In presenting to his young friends the sixth volume of the " Library for Young People , " the author can not be unconscious of what the readers of his former books require of him . They will turn the leaves of " Little by Little , " expecting to find an abundance of stirring incidents ; and he hopes they will not be disappointed . Some of the older readers and sterner critics will look for romantic and rather exaggerated events ; but he thinks they will look in vain , for as we grow older we become more reasonable , and do not expect showers of gold to fall upon every seedy hero , or to see nice young gentlemen leap over lofty precipices without sometimes being dashed to pieces . But the author hopes that something more than exciting incidents will be found upon his pages ; that , though he has seldom , if ever , gone out of his way to define the moral quality , or measure the moral quantity , of the words and deeds of his characters , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul Duncan , the hero of this volume , is a nautical young gentleman , and most of the events of the story occur upon the water ; but the author hopes his young lady friends will not make faces at him on this account . The boys insisted upon having a sea story , and being the " lords of creation , " of course they must be indulged ; but the writer most solemnly promises to remember the girls next time . Thanking my young friends again for the continued kindness manifested towards my pets , I give them " Little by Little , " hoping that the excellent spirit of Paul Duncan will pervade their minds and hearts , and lead them forward to the material and moral triumphs which crowned his useful life .

" I 'll give you a quarter , Paul , if you will take me down to the Point in your boat , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the boy addressed was baling out an old dingy-looking boat . " It blows too hard , " replied Paul Duncan . " The club went down in their boat . " " But it did n't blow so hard then as it does now . It 's a regular sou'easter . " " What are you afraid of , Paul ? " " I 'm not afraid ; but there 's no use of risking your life for a quarter . " " I 'll give you a half , then . " Paul Duncan hesitated . Half a dollar was a great deal of money to him , and more than often found its way into his exchequer . He glanced at the white-capped waves in the bay , and then at Thomas . " There 's no ballast in her , " said he . " Put some rocks in , then . " " I think it 's rather dangerous , and I do n't believe your mother would agree to have you go out in a boat in such a blow as this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not tied to my mother 's apron string . I think I 'm old enough to have a will of my own . Do n't talk to me about my mother , " replied Thomas contemptuously . " I 'm not a baby . " " Just as you please ; but I think it blows too hard to go out . " " Let me have your boat , and I 'll go alone then , if you are afraid to go . " " I 'm not afraid , " answered Paul , stung by these repeated implications upon his courage . " Jump in , and I 'll give you enough of it before you get half way to the Point . " Thomas got into the boat , which was anything but a beauty in her shape and appointments . Paul pushed her off the beach upon which she had grounded , and as she receded from the shore , leaped on board of her . Placing an oar at the stern , he sculled her out a short distance from the land , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind that struck it heeled the boat over so far that Thomas leaped with desperate haste up to the windward side . " Do n't be afraid , Tom , " said Paul , with a smile . " She has got the wind now . " " Who 's afraid ? " demanded Thomas . " I thought you were by the way you jumped . " " Well , the gunnel of your old craft went under . " " Not quite . " " I say it did ; and you do n't suppose I was going to sit there and be spilled into the drink -- do you ? " continued Thomas , sharply . " I wo n't dispute with you ; she heeled over , as a boat always will when she first gets the wind . " " You think you are an old salt , Paul , but you do n't know enough to navigate a herring pond . " " Just as you like , " replied Paul , whose good nature was proof against the assaults of his companion . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand this old boat pretty well . " " Paul ! Paul ! " cried a voice from the shore . " That 's my mother , " said the young boatman , as he discovered a woman on the beach . " What do you want , mother ? " " Come ashore , " replied Mrs. Duncan , whose voice was almost drowned by the noise of the waves as they beat against the boat . Paul 's mother seemed to think she had said enough , for her son was generally a very obedient boy , and she turned to walk up the bluff towards the house . But she knew enough about the management of a boat to perceive that , in this instance , her order was not obeyed . " Come ashore right off , Paul , " she repeated with an emphasis that was calculated to make an impression upon the rebellious party . " Do you want me , mother ? " asked Paul , as he put the boat about , and brought her upon the home tack . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for you to be out there . You 'll capsize , as true as you 're alive , " replied Mrs. Duncan ; and seeing the boat headed towards the shore , she hastened home . " Are you going to back out , Paul ? " demanded Thomas , as the boat came about . " My mother wo n't let me go , " replied Paul , rather sheepishly , for he was not proof against the derision of his companion . " Wo n't let you go ! " sneered Thomas . " You heard what she said . " " I did ; my mother would no more dare to say as much as that to me than she would dare to cut my head off . She knows her place better . " Paul was not a little shocked by this unfeeling speech , and could not help seeing that Thomas had not much regard for his mother . For his own part , he loved his mother very much , though he was not exactly willing to confess the fact to a boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been accustomed to obey his mother for the respect and love he bore her , and it had never before occurred to him that she overstepped the bounds of reason and propriety in presuming to command him . Paul had the reputation of being a good boy , both at home and among the neighbors ; but it must not be inferred that he was perfect , that he never disobeyed his father and mother ,  - -  though the instances were very rare , or that he never did what he knew to be wrong . He had his faults and his weaknesses ; but for the present I shall let my young reader discover them from what he says and what he does . He was disturbed by the derision of his friend , no less than by his impudent self-possession . He even asked himself why he should be tied to his mother 's apron string , as Thomas expressed the subjection of the child to the parent . He was only a year younger than his companion , and he began to question whether it was not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the apron string when it pulled too hard upon his inclination . Paul was the oldest of a family of six children , and was now in his fourteenth year . His father was a journeyman ship carpenter -- an honest , temperate , hard-working man , who was obliged to struggle with the realities of life in order to win a comfortable subsistence for his large family . In the inoffensive sense of the term , he was a poor man ; that is , he lived from hand to mouth , and had not saved a single dollar with which to meet the misfortunes of life . But he had brought up his family as well as he could , and given the oldest the best education his limited means would afford . Thomas Nettle 's father was a wealthy merchant , who had retired from active business , and lived upon his beautiful estate in Bayville , in which transpired the events of my story . Major Nettle , as his townsmen called him , for he had attained to the rank indicated by his military title in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had but a very low appreciation of the moral and religious duties and responsibilities of a parent . It was a favorite theory with him that a boy would do well enough if only let alone . It was of no use to cram his head or his heart with notions , as he called them , about morality and religion ; the boy would find them out himself when he wanted them . In support of his doctrine , he used to point to the minister 's son who was in the state prison , and the deacon 's son who had run away to sea to avoid the house of correction . Of course , then , Master Thomas Nettle 's parental training was never very severe , for he had no one to dispute his independence when he chose to assert it . Paul had seen enough of the world to find out that wealth commands a certain respect , and he could not always keep down a sense of deference with which his rich companions inspired him ; and when they admitted him to their friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their actions . Thomas was always dressed well , and always had money in his pocket ; and these things made Paul realize the difference in their social positions . It is true , he tried to make himself believe that he was as good as any one else , and would not bend his neck or his knee to the smartest boy in Bayville ; yet he could not but feel the disparity between himself and the sons of his rich neighbors . He would not go out of his way to court their favor , though it flattered his vanity to be their chosen companion . " Steady ! why do n't you luff her up , when the puffs come , " said Thomas , as a flaw of wind struck the sail , and careened her so far that she took in a little water over the side . " Oh , I do n't mind a little dash of water over the side , " replied Paul , with a smile ; for it must be owned that he was disposed to punish his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his courage . " Well , are you going ashore ? " continued Thomas . " Are you going to let your mother domineer over you ? If you do , I hope she will put you in the cradle and rock you to sleep when you get ashore . " " We must get some ballast , " answered Paul , who had not yet got far enough to declare his independence of maternal authority . " You are afraid to go ! " " I think I can stand it as long as you can . " " Then what are you going ashore for ? " " After more ballast , " replied Paul , who , though deeply stung by the sneers of Thomas , had not yet decided to disobey his mother . " Will you take me down to the Point when you get the ballast ? " " I do n't know ; I 'll see . " The old boat dashed on , and in a moment or two grounded upon the beach . There was a great struggle in the soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express command of his mother on the one hand , and he did not like to incur the derision of Thomas on the other , for he would tell it to all the boys who would call him " chickenish . " " There are two rocks that will just answer your purpose , " said Thomas , as they leaped out of the boat . " You take one and I will take the other . Come , bear a hand , or I shall not get to the picnic till the fun is all over . " The two large stones were placed in the boat , and still Paul was undecided . He had not the courage to face the ridicule of his independent friend , nor the heart to disobey the mother whom he loved and respected . " I guess I wo n't go , Tom , " said he , as a momentary resolution supported the better impulse of his nature . " Chicken-hearted ! Are you afraid of your mother or of the wind and waves ? " sneered Thomas , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hesitating boy quite as much as his words . " Of neither . If you think I 'm afraid to go any where that you dare go , you are very much mistaken . It 's a very easy thing for you to stand there and talk , but when the boat takes in a pint of water over the side , you jump as though an earthquake had taken you all aback , " said Paul , smartly . " Humph . Get into the boat , and we 'll soon see who 's afraid ; though perhaps you had better go and get your mother to go with you . " " I have proved you to be a coward , and I do n't think there is any use of going now . I do n't like to be in a boat with a fellow who is skittish when the wind blows , " continued Paul , who was determined to make the most of their previous experience . " It is n't safe to have a fellow jumping about in the boat when there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about over the thwarts like a frightened colt . " " You are smart , Paul ; but your big talk sounds silly while I stand here and stump you to carry me down to the Point . You are afraid of the sea , and afraid of your mother . You dare not go ! " " Jump in ! " cried Paul , desperately , as his failing resolution fled before these taunts . " Jump in , Tom . " " Now do n't back out if you happen to see one of your mother 's aprons on the clothes-line . " " Never fear me ; and if you do n't wish yourself ashore before you get half way to Tenean Point , I lose my guess ; that 's all , " answered Paul , as he pushed the boat off into deep water . " The wind is dead ahead , and we must beat all the way down . " " Put her through , Paul . " " Ay , ay , my hearty , I 'll put her through , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the sail , and hauled the sheet home . As she felt the strong blast , the old boat lay down before it , and a large wave broke over her gunnel ; but Paul luffed her up , so that she did not fill . Whatever Thomas thought of this stirring experience , he kept his seat upon the weather side , and appeared to be perfectly unconcerned . As they came out from under the bluff , where the windows of the house above commanded a view of their position , they were discovered by Mrs. Duncan , who again hastened to the beach to repeat her command more imperatively than before . Paul had steeled his heart to do wrong in this instance , and he pretended not to see or hear her ; and the boat dashed on her course . CHAPTER II . PAUL IS COOL AND SELF-POSSESSED . Bayville is situated about seven or eight miles from Boston , on the line of one of the principal railroads . A large portion of the inhabitants , even at the time of which I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place had a shipyard and several wharves from which the surrounding country was supplied with wood , coal , and lumber . The town is located on both sides of Tenean River , the estuary of which forms a very good harbor , though the place has not yet attained to any considerable commercial importance . The shipyard and the wharves were on the north side of the river , which was known as Mercantile Point . On the south side a peninsula extended about half a mile out into the sea , at the extremity of which was the little cottage of Mr. Duncan , the ship carpenter . It was built upon the high bluff , and below it was the beach , which had been formed by the continued caving of the earth from the high bank . The cottage was over a mile from the shipyard , by the road , and not more than half the distance in a straight line across the water . As an easy and pleasant way to get to his work , Mr. Duncan had purchased the old boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and in good weather generally went over to the shipyard by water . He was a skilful boatman , and under his tuition his son had learned all the mysteries of sailing a boat . Like most boys , he was disposed to be more daring than was necessary , and it was often that his father and mother found occasion to check him in the pursuit of bold enterprises . Paul was passionately fond of the water , and was proud of his nautical skill and knowledge . Aquatic sports were all the rage at Bayville , and there were very few gentlemen who had the means that did not own boats of some kind . In the summer season the harbor always presented a brilliant display of yachts , sail boats , and wherries . The largest of these was the Flyaway , a splendid yacht of fifty-two tons , which was jointly owned by Major Nettle and Captain Littleton . Even the boys of the High School had a club boat , which in the warm season , not only afforded them fine sport , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical organization . On the first day of May , when our story opens , the scholars of the High School had a picnic at Tenean Point , and the boat club had gone down to participate in the festivities of the occasion . Thomas Nettle had been to the city in the morning , and had not returned in season to go down with the club , of which he was a member . It was four miles to the Point by the road , and only half that distance by water , when the wind permitted the passage in a straight line . He did not like the idea of walking so far , choosing rather to incur the danger of being drowned by the upsetting of Paul 's old boat . In spite of the strong wind and the heavy sea , Paul kept the boat on her course , though , as the tide was against her , she did not make much headway . " Can you weather South Point , Paul ? " asked Thomas , who had been silent for some time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes about as much leeway as headway . " " It is pretty rough out here -- is n't it ? " " Rather , " replied Paul , indifferently . " She takes in a good deal of water . " " Mostly spray ; you can bale her out , if you have a mind to do so . " Thomas was glad to have something in the shape of occupation , for it required all his power to conceal a certain nervousness , which he would not have had Paul see for all the world . He took the tin kettle , and worked as though the safety of the craft depended entirely upon his efforts . The wind seemed to increase rather than diminish in force , and the sail was becoming more exciting every moment ; but Paul maintained his self-possession , and though he had some doubts about his ability to keep the old craft right side up , he did not permit his companion to know that he had a single misgiving . " We ca n't fetch by the Point , " said he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ; we may get ashore on the rocks . " " Good ! " exclaimed Paul , with a hearty laugh . " What is the matter now ? " demanded Thomas . " The idea of striking a rock on the weather side ! " laughed Paul . " You are right ; I did n't think . " The boat now came into comparatively still water , under the lee of Long Island , as the outermost of three small islets , extending out in a line from the mouth of the river , was called . The island was a mass of rocks , rising from ten to twenty feet above high water mark , and as they got behind it , they were sheltered from the force of the wind . In this situation , Paul attempted to tack ; but the old boat would not come round in stays , for she had partially lost her headway , and the tide was against her . " That 's bad , " said Thomas ; " we shall lose all we have gained by this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , " replied Paul . " Ay , ay ; " and Thomas took the oar , and brought her head up to the wind . There was a coolness and self-possession in the demeanor of Paul which filled his companion with confidence as well as admiration , though he was in no humor to acknowledge it . If Thomas was not actually terrified by the sweeping billows and the rude pitching of the boat , it was only because he felt that he was in the charge of a skilful boatman . The old craft soon caught the wind on the other tack , and drove out among the big waves again . Paul 's mother was still on the beach watching the uneasy movements of the boat , and in momentary expectation that she would be swamped . Her earnest gestures were disregarded by her son , and she was prepared for the worst fate that could befall him . Paul tried to keep his eyes away from her ; but he could not help stealing an occasional glance at her , though his conscience reproached him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he felt that his courage and his reputation as a boatman were at stake , and that , if he failed to achieve the purpose before him , he would be the derision of Thomas Nettle and all his companions . For two hours the boat labored heavily in the rough sea , and had accomplished about two thirds of the distance to Tenean Point . The young adventurers were now in the worst place in the bay , and the boat was exposed to the full force of the wind and the sea , from which they had before been partially protected by an island . " What do you think , Paul ? " said Thomas , suspending for a moment the work of baling , in which he had been engaged for the last hour . " What do I think ? " replied Paul , coolly , as he wiped the spray from his eyes ; " I think it blows tremendous hard . " " So do I. " " Then we sha n't quarrel about that , anyhow . " " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; I 'm in for it , at any rate . " " We do n't make much headway . " " That 's true . " " I sha n't get to the picnic in any kind of season , " continued Thomas , crouching down under the weather rail , as a huge wave gave the boat a slap that made her quiver like a leaf . " I ca n't help that , Tom ; I did n't want you to come this way . " " Do n't you think we had better run for the shore , and give it up ? " " I do n't think any such thing . If the old boat will only hold together long enough , I 'll put you ashore on Tenean Point . " " I 'm afraid she wo n't hold together much longer . " " No matter ; we will go it while she does hold together . Can you swim , Tom ? " " You know very well I can swim , Paul . " " Better get your boots off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim ashore in such a sea as this ? Besides , it is over a half a mile , and the surf on the beach would tear a fellow all to pieces . " " You ought to have thought of these things before you came out here . " " It is a great deal worse than I had any idea of , " answered Thomas , who had proceeded far enough to be willing to yield a point . " For my part , I am willing to be landed here ; " and he pointed to a little cove on the Tenean shore . " You do n't say you have got enough of it , Tom , " said Paul , with a smile . " Enough of it ! I want to get to the picnic some time to-day . I hope you do n't think I am frightened . " " Of course I do n't ; you dares n't be frightened after all your big talk before we came out . " " I 'll give up on that , Paul . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am willing to say that and stick to it . " " That 's saying a good deal . " " But you must n't suppose I am afraid . " " Of course not ; you 're only in a hurry to get to the picnic ; that 's the idea . " " That 's just it , and if you will put me ashore at the cove , I will be just as much obliged to you as though you carried me all the way to the Point . " " Let 's not back out , Tom . " " I do n't back out ; and I 'm sure you do n't . " " It looks a little like backing out to give up the chase . " " You ought to be satisfied , if I am . " " I sha n't be satisfied till I land you at the Point . " " Come , come , Paul , do n't carry the joke too far . The sea is getting heavier and heavier , and the wind blows a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to back out , I 'm willing . " " I do n't want to do anything of the sort . If you think I ca n't stand it as long as you can , you are mistaken , " replied Thomas , proudly ; and taking the dipper , he continued to bale out the water , whistling an air to indicate his indifference to the perils that surrounded them . " Put her through , then ; we sha n't be much longer if we do n't get swamped . " The boat was now standing out from the shore , and while Thomas was still busy , whistling off his fears , a violent gust of wind struck the sail , causing the boat to heel over so far that she drank up several buckets of water , and would have filled if the sprit had not broken , thus removing the pressure . " Come , Paul , I have got enough of this , " cried Thomas , uneasily . " I do n't think you will be able to get any more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't carry sail any longer , " replied Paul , apparently unmoved by the accident . " Bale her out as fast as you can , and I will take an oar , and keep her head up to the sea " . " What will you do now ? " asked Thomas , whose courage was sorely tried by the perilous situation of the boat . " Get the water out , and we will see what can be done , " answered Paul , who , though he had already decided this important question , would not permit his passenger to enter into his counsels , preferring to tantalize him by his mysterious manner . " Let us get ashore , Paul , as soon as possible . " " Going to back out ? " " No ; what 's the use of talking in that way , about backing out , when you ca n't carry sail ? " replied Thomas , whose pride was still unconquered , though his courage was rapidly failing him . " I shall rig a new sprit ; there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is just the right length . " " I 'll give up then , and back out , " said Thomas , despairing of any relief from the misfortunes that had befallen the boat . " Do n't back out on my account ; I will put you ashore at the Point , if you say the word , " replied Paul , satisfied now that he had kept his promise and given his friend enough of it . " Run for the shore , Paul . " " Just as you say ; " and the boatman , proud of the triumph he had won over his boastful companion , turned the boat 's head towards the shore . The corner of the sail hung down for the want of a sprit to support it , but as they had the wind free , there was canvas enough to drive her rapidly towards the shore . While they were still half a mile from the cove , Thomas called Paul 's attention to a horse and chaise on the beach , from which a man was making violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL HEARS BAD NEWS . " Who is it , Tom ? " asked Paul , very anxiously . " I do n't know ; ca n't make him out . " " What can he want with us ? " " Perhaps your mother has sent him after her runaway boy ; but whoever he is , I will tell him you are a fellow of the right spunk . " " Who can it be ? " " What matter who it is ? Your mother wo n't whip you -- will she ? " " No , of course not . My mother do n't whip me . " " I thought she did , you seem so much afraid of her . " " I am not afraid of her . " " If you are , there is nothing else that can frighten you . " " I mind my mother because she is my mother ; because I like to do so , and not because I am afraid of her . You had better not say much more about being afraid , Tom . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Thomas , smartly . " If you was n't afraid , you was confoundedly scared , " replied Paul , whose paradox was fully appreciated by his companion . " Look here , Paul ; are you going to tell the fellows that I was scared ? " demanded Thomas , rather in a beseeching than an intimidating tone . " That will depend on circumstances . " " What circumstances ? " " You may as well understand me first as last . You keep talking about my being afraid of my mother , and all that sort of stuff . I 'm not afraid of her , and I do n't like to be told that I am . " " I wo n't say it again , then . " " Fellows that live in glass houses must n't throw stones . " " Do you really think I was frightened , Paul ? " " I really think you was . Did n't you back out ? " " Not till the sail broke down . " " I offered to fix that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing . " " That 's the point exactly . Do n't you say a word about my mother , and you may talk as big as you please about this scrape . " " I 'm not going to talk big about it . I shall give you all the credit you deserve . " " Of course you will . The fellow that holds the bag can let the cat out when he chooses . I do n't like to have my mother spoken of as you speak of your mother . She 's my mother , and she has always been a good mother to me , and I would do anything in the world for her . There 's only one thing about this scrape that I 'm sorry for ; and that is , that I did n't mind her . It makes me feel bad . " " She wo n't say much to you ; she will be so glad to have you safely home , that she wo n't feel like jawing you , " answered Thomas , in what he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offensive to the penitent . " My mother do n't jaw ; it will make her feel bad that I did n't mind her ; and that is ten times worse than a scolding or a whipping.  - -  That man keeps shaking his hat to us . Who do you think it is ? " " It looks like Captain Littleton . " " What can he want of me ? " said Paul , anxiously . " If it is Captain Littleton , it is more like he wants me . " In a few moments more the boat darted into the cove , and the boys recognized Captain Littleton in the gentleman who had been beckoning to them . " Come ashore , Paul , as quick as you can ! " shouted he , as he jumped into his chaise , and drove nearer to the point where the boat was to land . " Do you want me , sir ? " asked Paul . " Yes ; you are wanted at home . " Our hero was filled with terror and anxiety by this reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman like Captain Littleton would not have taken the trouble to come after him . As the boat struck the bank , he brailed up the sail , and jumped ashore with the painter in his hand . " Come , Paul , never mind the boat ; Thomas will take care of her . Get into the chaise with me as quick as you can , " said Captain Littleton . " What is the matter , sir ? What has happened ? " demanded Paul , trembling with the most painful solicitude . " Get into the chaise first , and I will tell you as we return . " " Has anything happened to my mother , sir ? " cried Paul , the tears rushing to his eyes . " Nothing has happened to your mother , Paul . She is quite well , " answered Captain Littleton , as he urged the horse to his utmost speed . Paul was greatly relieved by this assurance , though it was still evident from the manner of the gentleman , and the speed at which he drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience smote him for his disobedience to his mother , and he was not in a fit moral condition to meet the shock of adversity with courage and fortitude . He would have given the world , in that anxious moment , to have undone the work of the last three hours , and effaced their record from his conscience . " Tell me what has happened , if you please , sir , " he continued . " Is any of the folks dead ? You say it is not my mother . " " Your mother is quite well , and none of your family are dead , though --  --  " Captain Littleton paused , and looked at the boy 's face , which was still bathed in tears . He saw the misery that he was enduring , and he hesitated to utter words which he knew must carry grief and woe to his heart . " You must be calm and firm , Paul , " continued the kind gentleman . " It is not so bad as you suppose , and we may hope for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is he dead , sir ? " gasped Paul . " You do n't tell me the whole story , sir . " " He is not dead , Paul ; but he is very badly hurt . " " He is alive , then ? " " He is . " Paul closely scrutinized the expression of Captain Littleton , fearful that he had not told him the whole truth . " Are you sure he was not killed ? " he asked , still unsatisfied . " He was alive when I left him , but that was nearly an hour ago . " " I am thankful if he is alive . How did it happen , sir ? " " He fell from the bow of the ship upon which he was at work , and struck a pile of timber . I am afraid he is very badly hurt . I happened to be near the shipyard at the time , and assisted in carrying him home . He is conscious , and asked for you . Your mother said you were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at these words , for he realized the nature and depth of his mother 's feelings when she had uttered them , and how bitterly did he regret his act of disobedience ! The dreadful event had come to intensify the anguish of his penitence , and he felt that , if he had not done wrong , he could have met the calamity with patience and resolution . When children do wrong , they know not what event may occur to increase a thousand fold the bitterness of their remorse . " Do you think my father is alive now ? " sobbed Paul . " I hope so ; but it is impossible to foretell the result . The doctors spoke very despondingly of his case ; but we must hope for the best . " " How does my mother bear it ? " " As well as could be expected , considering the suddenness of the calamity . " " O , it will kill her , " groaned Paul . " I hope not ; you must be calm , my boy . It is dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of the sufferer by useless lamentation . " " I will be as calm as I can , sir ; but it is awful to have such a thing happen just now . " " We know not what a day or an hour may bring forth , Paul . " " Yes , but to have it happen now . If it had been at any other time , I could have borne it better , " continued the penitent boy , wiping away the tears that blinded him . " We can not choose the time for such an event to happen . " " If it had only come before I left home ! O , dear . " " Be calm , Paul ; we could not select a time when we should be prepared for such a calamity . You must not suppose one time is better than another for trials and sorrows . " " You do not understand me , Captain Littleton , " replied Paul , earnestly . " I disobeyed my mother in going out in the boat . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach beckoning and calling to me not to go , but I did n't mind her . That 's what makes me feel so bad about it . " " I am sorry you disobeyed her , for you must suffer the more for your disobedience . " " I was sorry I did so before I came ashore , and now I would give all the world if I had minded mother , and let Tom Nettle laugh at me as much as he pleased . " " Tom is a wild boy , and you must not heed his jeers . " " I will not , another time . You think my father is not dead ? " " I think not , " replied Captain Littleton , as he increased the speed of the horse . Paul did not say much more , but wept in silence as the chaise dashed along the road . Every moment seemed like an hour , till he came in sight of the cottage of his father . There were the two sulkies of the doctors , and a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreadful calamity which had overtaken him . The panting horse stopped before the door , and Paul 's limbs almost failed him as he dragged himself into the house . " O Paul , " sobbed his mother , who met him at the door , " I thought you would never come . I 'm afraid you wo n't have a father a great while longer . " " Forgive me , mother , for what I did , " cried Paul . " I do forgive you , my son ; but come , your poor father wants to see you very much . " His mother took him by the hand , and led him into the chamber where his father lay . He was shocked by the change which a few short hours had produced , and he needed not the skill of the physicians to assure him that Mr. Duncan had but a short time to live . " Paul , " said his father , faintly , " I shall soon be no more , and I leave your mother and your brothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul , for they will soon have no one else to help them . Be a good boy , and be an honest man , and everything will go well with you . Be true to your God and true to yourself , and then all the world can not harm you . May God keep you in the path of duty as long as you live . " Mr. Duncan closed his eyes with an audible sigh , and Paul burst into tears , realizing that he was about to lose the kindest and best of fathers . " Do n't cry , my boy , " said the sufferer ; " be a man , and in a little while the struggle will be over with me . " The whole family were gathered round the bed , and Mr. Duncan gave them his blessing , for the doctors assured him his hour was at hand . We will not dwell upon the painful scene . In an hour all was still in that room save the sobs of the bereaved widow , who stood gazing in agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her that morning in the full vigor of health and strength . The angel of death was there , and had done his work . Paul was stupefied by the suddenness of the shock , and all the currents of his existence seemed to stop in their flow . He spent the afternoon in his chamber , trying to understand the nature of his situation . He had dried his tears , but the deeper grief had gone in upon his heart . He spent a wakeful night in thinking of the past , and in endeavoring to make himself believe that his father was dead . All that he had ever done for him , all that he had ever said to him , came up before him with a vividness that made them seem like realities . In this condition he moved about the house till after the funeral , mechanically executing such duties as he was required to perform ; but everything was so unnatural to him that he could hardly persuade himself of the reality of his being . The death of his father was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , and the wheels of time , the current of events , stopped , soon to resume their course in a different direction . When the last rites of love and respect had been paid to the remains of his father , Paul roused himself from his stupor , and began to examine the future . At the death bed of his parent he had received a solemn charge , and he carefully reviewed the words , and recalled the expression with which it had been committed to him . His mother and his brothers and sisters had been given into his care , and he felt the responsibility of the position he had accepted . He determined , to the best of his ability , to discharge his duty to them ; but he was sorely troubled to think of some way by which he could earn money enough to support them , for he had put a literal construction upon the dying words of his father . CHAPTER IV . PAUL BECOMES THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY . For a week after the funeral Paul racked his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pecuniary point of view , but without success . If he went into a store , or obtained such a place as a boy can fill , it would pay him only two or three dollars a week , and this would be scarcely anything towards the support of the family , for his father had generally earned twelve dollars a week during the greater portion of the year . He wanted to do something better . He did not expect to make so much as his father had made , but was determined , if possible , to earn at least half as much . Thus far his reflection had been to little purpose , for it was no small matter for a boy to charge himself with double the work of one of his age . He had not yet consulted his mother , nor obtained her views in regard to the support of the family . He did not know whether she expected him to do the whole of it , but it did not appear reasonable to him that she could do anything more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wished that he could go to her and relieve her of all responsibility in regard to the money affairs , and let her live just as she had been accustomed to live before the death of his father ; and he almost cried with vexation , after he had vainly ransacked his brains for the means , to think he could not do so . He could not hit upon any plan that would meet his expectations , and he decided to have a talk with her in relation to the future . " What are we going to do , mother ? " he asked , as he seated himself in the kitchen where Mrs. Duncan was getting supper . " That is what I have been thinking of myself , " she replied . " I have been talking with Captain Littleton to-day , and he gave me some good advice , and offered me any assistance I might require . " " You surely do n't mean to live on charity , mother , " added Paul , proudly . " Certainly not . Captain Littleton did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in getting work for myself and you . " " O , well , that 's all right . " " While we have our health and strength , we shall not have to ask other help of any one . " " Of course not . " " I hope I am above asking charity , or taking it either . " " I knew you were . What did Captain Littleton say ? " " Thanks to the goodness and forethought of your father , we are not left entirely destitute , " replied Mrs. Duncan , wiping a tear from her cheek . " I did n't know there was anything left . " " After paying all the funeral expenses and the doctor 's bills , I shall have fifty dollars in money . Your father had no debts . " " Fifty dollars is n't much , mother , towards supporting the family . It would n't last two months . " " That is very true ; we have more than that . Three years ago your father had his life insured for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in a few days . " " I did n't know that , " said Paul , greatly surprised to find they had what seemed to him so vast a sum . " We shall get along very well . " " Your father used to calculate that it cost him about eight dollars a week to live , or about four hundred dollars a year . If he had had work all the year round , he might have saved a very handsome sum , he used to tell me . " " It will not cost us eight dollars a week now . " " No ; we must live very prudently ; but if it cost us only five , a thousand dollars would last but a few years , and what should we do then ? " " We must not spend it then . " " Captain Littleton told me what he thought we had better do . This house in which we live can be bought for fifteen hundred dollars , though the owner has always asked eighteen hundred , and --  --  " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house ? " interrupted Paul , filled with amazement at the magnitude of the idea . " That is what Captain Littleton advises me to do . " " But you have n't money enough . " " I can give a mortgage for five hundred dollars . The rent of the house is one hundred and forty dollars , and Mr. Freeman says he can not afford to let it for any less . Now , if we buy it , we can pay a thousand dollars down , and we shall owe five hundred , on which we shall have to pay the interest , amounting to thirty dollars . By this plan , we should have to pay out only about fifty dollars a year for interest and taxes , or about a dollar a week . In this way we can get along on five dollars a week . " " Buy the house then , by all means , mother . Five dollars a week ! Well , I think I shall be able to support the family , after all . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " I am sure I can . " " What do you intend to do ? " " I do n't know yet . " " Your poor father intended that you should enter the High School this fall ; but I suppose that can not be . Captain Littleton said he would get you a place where you could have two or three dollars a week . " " I must make more than that , mother , " replied Paul , shaking his head . " You must not be too ambitious . If you get two or three dollars a week , you will do very well , and that sum will be a great help to me . " " You heard what father said to me in his last moments ? " said Paul , with solemn earnestness . " He told me to take care of my mother and of my brothers and sisters , and I mean to do so . " " But he never had a thought that you could earn money enough to support the whole of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not try to do too much . " " If we can live on five dollars a week , I am almost sure I can earn that . " " That is a good deal for a boy like you . " " I can do it , I know . " " Captain Littleton said he would find a place for you . " " I shall be very much obliged to him , and will take any place I can get ; but I am certain before long that I can make five dollars a week . " " Do n't think of such a thing . There are a great many men who get no more than that . You must work your way up , little by little , Paul , and one of these days you will obtain a good situation . " " That 's just what I mean to do . Little by little -- that 's my motto ; and if I can only get hold any where , you may leave the rest to me . " " You are a good boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mrs. Duncan , proudly . " I expect to get some work myself next week , and I have no doubt we shall do very well . " " What work , mother ? " asked Paul , a shadow of dissatisfaction passing over his face . " Captain Littleton thought he could get me a chance to make bags for the flour mills . " " I do n't mean to have you take in work , mother . You have enough to do to take care of the house and the children . " " I can do a good deal besides . Sarah can help a great deal about the house , and with what we can all do , we shall get along very well indeed . We ought to be very thankful for all the blessings that surround us . " " We are enough sight better off than I thought , " replied Paul ; " but I do n't want to have you make a slave of yourself . You used to work hard enough ; and now , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself out in a few years . " " I guess not , Paul . There is somebody knocking at the door ; go and see who it is . " Paul went to the door , and the visitor proved to be Captain Littleton . " I was looking for you , Paul , " said he . " I 'm going to give a dinner party to-morrow , and I want a mess of perch , fresh from the rocks , by twelve o'clock . I want you should go down and catch them for me . You always have good luck at fishing . Will you do this for me , Paul ? " " Yes , sir ; certainly I will . " " I will speak to your mother about it . " Paul conducted Captain Littleton into the little parlor , and called his mother . She was willing that he should go , and glad to have him do something in return for the gentleman 's repeated acts of kindness . " I will give you twenty cents a dozen for them , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued the captain . " He will not charge anything , sir , " added Mrs. Duncan . " Not a cent , sir , " repeated Paul . " It 's a fair trade , young man , and I wo n't take them unless I pay for them . " " I do n't want any pay from you , sir . " " But I choose to pay you , and you must take your orders from me in this instance . Have you any clams for bait ? " " No , sir . I will get some to-night . " " Very well ; you may go and get them now , and I will talk to your mother about business . " Paul took his hat and went down to the beach . Embarking in the old boat , he sailed over to Tenean , where plenty of clams were to be had , and a bucket full was soon procured . Like a prudent fisherman , he made all his arrangements for the next day . First he repaired the worn-out sail , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rudder head . When everything was in ship-shape order about the boat , he took out his perch lines , ganged on a new hook , and rigged an extra sinker for use in case of accident . " Going a fishing , Paul ? " said John Duncan , his brother , a lad of ten , who joined him when he had nearly completed his preparations . " I 'm going down in the morning to get a mess of perch for Captain Littleton . " " Let me go with you , Paul ? " " You must go to school . " " It do n't keep . " " Ask mother , then ; if she is willing , I am . " " Have you got a line for me ? " " Yes . " John Duncan , for his years , was almost as much of a sailor and fisherman as Paul . Both of them took to the water like ducks , and seemed to understand all about a boat as if by instinct . The prospect of a day down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he ran up the bluff with all his might to obtain the desired permission . " May I go a-fishing with Paul to-morrow , mother ? " shouted he , as he rushed into the parlor , without noticing the presence of Captain Littleton . " We will see about that by and by . Take off your cap . " " How do you do , John ? " said Captain Littleton . " Pretty well , " replied John , whose head keeled over on the port side , as he discovered the visitor , and three fingers found their way into his mouth . " You want to go a-fishing , do you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do you think it is safe to let him go ? " asked Mrs. Duncan . " I ai n't afraid , mother , " interrupted the young hopeful . " I know you are not , and that 's one reason why I do n't like to trust you in the boat . " " Your boys take to the water in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that kind , it is n't of much use to thwart them . " " I know it is n't ; but John has worried my life out since he was four years old , for he is always in the water . " " I should use proper precaution with him ; but Paul is so good a boatman that I should not be afraid to trust him in his care . " " You may go , John , " added Mrs. Duncan . " I have almost made up my mind to let him live in the water ; but I ca n't help going to the window when he is out on the beach , at least twenty times a day , to see if he is n't in trouble . " " To return to Paul , " said Captain Littleton , resuming the remarks which the entrance of John had interrupted . " I have the refusal of a place in a lawyer 's office , where the salary is two dollars and a half a week . It is small pay , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that . It would have astonished you to hear him talk a little while ago . He is going to assume the whole burden of supporting the family , and is not willing that I should do anything . " " He is a smart boy , and ought to have a good place . " " He says he means to make five dollars a week ; but that is mere boy-talk . " " I like his spirit , but he will hardly be expected to earn five dollars a week at present . I hope I shall be able to find him a better place than the one I spoke of . " " You are very good , sir ; I shall never be able to repay you for your kindness . " " Do n't mention it , ma'am . I am very glad to do anything I can for you . You have made up your mind then to purchase the house ? " " Yes , sir . " " I think that 's the best thing you can do under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few years , if you should want to sell , it would bring two thousand dollars . I will see Freeman as I return , and the papers shall be made out immediately . " " Thank you , sir . " Captain Littleton took his leave , and Mrs. Duncan was very grateful to him for the friendly interest he manifested in her affairs . When Paul returned to the house , his mother informed him that her friend had found a place for him ; but the young aspirant had got an idea , and made up his mind to decline the situation . CHAPTER V. PAUL COOKS HIS OWN BREAKFAST , AND GOES A-FISHING . About six miles east of Bayville was a rocky island , around which perch were abundant . Paul had often been there with his father , and was familiar with the locality . He knew just where to moor his boat to have good luck in fishing ; and was acquainted with all the channels , currents , and bars in the bay . He was not only a skilful seaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home on the bay as in the streets of Bayville . It would be low tide in the bay at seven o'clock , and Paul made his calculations accordingly . The best time to fish was on the " young flood , " or soon after the tide had turned to come in ; and , if the wind should happen to be light or contrary , it would take him a long time to run down to Rock Island , as the place was called ; therefore he must go down with the tide . To accomplish his purpose it was necessary that he should start by five o'clock in the morning , which was an hour before his usual breakfast time . He did not sleep very well that night , for the great idea to which we have alluded was creating an immense commotion in his mind . He had reasoned out the certainty of his being able to support the family , and he felt as proud of his great resolution as though he had achieved its full fruits . When , at last , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculations , and of the satisfaction he should have in giving his mother money enough on Saturday night to pay all the expenses of the family for a week . He woke very early in the morning , and as he jumped out of bed he heard the clock on the Town Hall strike four . He did not mean to disturb his mother , and therefore cautioned John not to make any noise . He was not like some boys , who growl and grumble at their mothers if their meals are not ready when they want them . Stealing softly down stairs , he went to the back kitchen , and made a fire in the stove . " Now , John , you go down to the boat , and bale her out , " said he to his brother , as the latter joined him . " Are you going without any breakfast ? " asked John . " No ; breakfast will be ready by the time you have baled out the boat . " " You have n't called mother yet ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you get your breakfast , then ? " " I will get it myself . " " You do n't know how to cook , " replied John , incredulously . " You see if I do n't ; now go ahead , and do n't make a noise , or you will wake mother . " Paul then went down cellar , and brought up a few potatoes , which he washed and put into the kettle . A piece of pork and a slice of veal were deposited in the frying pan , ready to be cooked at the proper time . The coffee , not omitting the important bit of fish skin , was put in the coffee-pot , and operations in that quarter were suspended till the water in the tea-kettle should boil . Though our hero had never actually performed these manoeuvres with his own hands , he had seen them executed so many times that he was perfectly familiar with the routine . Everything upon the stove was doing very well , and he pulled out the table , which he proceeded to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article was carefully disposed in its proper place , for Paul had already learned that food tastes better in the midst of order and neatness , than when taken in dirt and confusion . It is true , he made some mistakes for the want of experience , and was frequently obliged to stop and think what articles were required ; but when the table was set , he was satisfied with its cheerful and neat appearance . By this time the tea-kettle was spouting out long jets of steam , and the lid was rattling under the influence of the commotion beneath it . Paul poured a little of the boiling water into the coffee-pot , and then came an appalling difficulty -- he did not know how much to put in , and was not sure that he had taken the proper quantity of coffee . At a venture he filled the pot half full , and then proceeded to cook the meat . After the coffee had boiled ten or fifteen minutes , he tested its strength , and added more water . He was delighted with his success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the breakfast upon the table . " Breakfast is ready , " said Paul . " Did you cook it , though ? " " I did ; I told you I could . " " I 'll give up now . Why do n't you hire out for a cook ? " " Perhaps I shall , one of these days . " " Would n't mother 's eyes stick out if she should happen in about this time ! " " I guess not much . " But they did , for just as the boys were seating themselves at the table , Mrs. Duncan entered the room . " Why , boys ! what have you been doing ? " exclaimed she , astonished at the regularity with which everything seemed to be proceeding in her absence . " Only getting something to eat before we go , " replied Paul . " Why did n't you call me ? " " I thought I would n't get you up so early ; besides , I could get breakfast just as well myself . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes and meat look as nice as can be . How is your coffee ? Did you put a piece of fish-skin in the pot ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Did you put any salt on the meat ? " " I did ; come , mother , sit down and eat your breakfast . " Mrs. Duncan accepted this polite invitation , and seating herself in her accustomed place , began to pour out the coffee . It was clear , and of the right strength , and she liberally praised Paul for his culinary skill , and declared that her son was a jewel about the house . The breakfast seemed even better than usual that morning , and our hero was as proud as though he had built a meeting house . " Come , John , we must bear a hand ; there is n't a breath of wind , and it will take us some time to make Rock Island , " said Paul , as he rose from the table . " Have you filled the jug with water ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some gingerbread and cheese for luncheon , " added Mrs. Duncan , as she handed Paul a basket she had filled for their use . " Now , be very careful , and do n't run any risk . Look out for squalls , and do n't carry sail too long . " " I 'll be very careful , mother . You may trust me to go round the world , " replied Paul . " But I wish you had a better boat . " " She 'll do very well , mother , though I hope to have a better one some time or other . " The jug was filled at the pump , and with their provisions and water the boys set off with light hearts for the work of the day . Paul felt the responsibility of the trust which Captain Littleton had imposed upon him . He was going to make some money by the operation , and upon this day 's success depended the hopes which he had been cherishing in regard to his new scheme . There are always some drawbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bluff , he discovered the boat adrift at some distance from the shore . " You are a careless fellow , John , " he cried . " You did n't make fast the boat . " " That 's too bad , Paul ; I did n't mean to do that , " replied John , vexed at the accident . " I do n't suppose you did ; but you are careless . " " I thought I made her fast . What shall we do , Paul ? I would rather given anything than had this happen . " " So would I ; but there is no use of crying about it . There is n't a skiff within half a mile of here . " " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Paul , " said John , putting down the jug and throwing off his jacket . " I 'll swim out to her and scull her in . " Paul made no objection to this plan , and in half a minute more , John had stripped and was swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps fifty rods from the shore . He was a vigorous swimmer , as self-possessed in the water as on the land , and his brother had no fears in regard to his safety , or his ability to reach the boat . It did not take the little fellow long to catch the boat , and the accident did not make more than half an hour 's delay . The stores were taken on board , and before John had time to dress himself , the boat was under sail , and working slowly down the bay . A light breeze from the west had sprung up , and a gentle ripple at the bow assured the young fisherman that everything was progressing in a satisfactory manner . " I should like to be a fisherman , Paul , " said John , who sat on the bottom of the boat opening clams for bait . " Perhaps you may be one of these days , " replied Paul , moodily . " I think I shall do something in that line right off . " " You , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word about it to anybody , above all , not to mother . I have been thinking about it all night . " " What do you mean , Paul ? " The ambitious youth had a great idea in his mind , which was struggling to be actualized . More than twenty times since the preceding evening had the words of Captain Littleton crossed his imagination , and kindled up a great blaze of possibilities and probabilities . " I will give you twenty cents a dozen for them , " the captain had said . If he would buy perch others would buy them . He had a boat , and there would not be many days when he could not catch as many as five or six dozen . Even at a shilling a dozen he could make a dollar a day . This was his scheme -- to supply Bayville with fresh fish . He had as good a chance to sell them as the men who went through the place blowing their tin horns . He should have an advantage over them , for his fish were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would be willing to patronize him . The plan promised exceedingly well , and he wished to talk it over with some one , though he was not quite ready to have it made public . It was true , John was only ten years old , and did n't know much ; but he wanted to talk with somebody about it , and so he concluded to take his brother into his confidence . " What do I mean , John ? " said he . " Why ca n't I catch perch every day , and sell them in town ? " " Sure enough , why ca n't you ? " replied John , delighted with the idea , and perhaps bringing some selfish motives to bear upon it . " We can haul ' em in as fast as we can throw over the line off the rocks , and there are rich folks enough in Bayville to buy them . " " It 's a first-rate idea , " exclaimed John , with enthusiasm . " You might go down farther , and catch cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good boat . " " Father used to go out after cod and haddock in this boat . " " I know , but she is getting rather shaky . " The great idea was discussed in all its bearings till they reached Rock Island , when Paul carefully selected his position , and let go the anchor . The hooks were baited and the lines thrown over , and never before had Paul taken his fishing apparatus when so much seemed to depend upon the success of his efforts . His heart beat as the sinker touched the bottom , and he pulled it up the proper distance . All his fortunes for the future appeared to hang upon the result . " Hurrah ! I 've got one ! " shouted John , as with childish eagerness he pulled in his line . It was a sculpin ! Was this a type of his own success ? Was he to watch his chance on the great sea of life , and finally , after all his anxious watching and toil , was he to pull in only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart almost sunk within him , as he considered the possible failure of his favorite scheme . If he failed in this , he must accept the paltry two dollars and a half a week , and let his mother drudge like a slave . He could not tolerate the thought of failure , and --  --  A bite ! Paul did not whistle till he got out of the woods , and announced his success to John by slapping a monster perch upon the bottom of the boat . If that was a type of his success he was satisfied . Before he had time to follow out the reflections suggested by the event , John hauled in the mate to the big fish , and another had taken hold of his own hook . By ten o'clock there were six dozen perch in the basket , besides three handsome tautog and half a dozen sea flounders . The young fisherman was satisfied , hauled up killock , and made sail for home . His heart was as light as the upper air , and he was confident of the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A GOOD SPECULATION . " Now , John you must steer , while I skin the perch , " said Paul , as he resigned the helm to his brother . " That I will , " replied he , with alacrity , for he did not often get a chance to handle the boat , and was fond of the amusement . " But you must be careful , and keep your eyes open , for we have no time to spare , " added the youthful skipper . " Do you think I do n't know how to steer a boat ? " asked John , hurt by the insinuation . " You know how well enough , if you will pay attention to it , and not be fooling with her . " " I 'll keep her right . " Paul took from under the thwart an old shoe-knife which had been ground down to one third of its original width . It had been well sharpened for this important occasion , but he had provided an old whetstone as a further precaution against a dull blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice operation ; but Paul had had sufficient practice in the art to render him a skilful hand . Seating himself on the lee rail , he commenced work in earnest , occasionally glancing up to see that the boat was doing her best in the way of sailing . " How much will you make , Paul , if you sell all your fish ? " asked John . " The perch will bring a dollar and twenty cents , if I get twenty cents a dozen for them . " " The tautog are worth something . " " They are worth a quarter apiece . " " You have done a good day 's work then ? " " If I sell the fish , I shall , " answered Paul , with a smile of satisfaction . " Come , John , the sail is shaking , and you have lost the wind , " he added as his brother carelessly luffed her up . " I was adding up the perch and the tautog . " " You must mind the boat ; you must stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " John promised to be more careful , and Paul had no further occasion to complain of his inattention . The younger fisherman was a good boy , but he had not yet been trained to that steadiness of purpose which is necessary to success . He was only ten years old , and it was not to be expected that he should fully appreciate the earnestness of his brother 's purpose , though he was beginning to realize that close attention was necessary in order to accomplish great deeds . He was fond of trying experiments , just for the fun of the thing ; and when he had been permitted to take the helm on other occasions , he wanted to do something besides keep her in a direct course -- to see how close she would lie to the wind without letting the sail shake , to run down a floating mass of seaweed , or chase a stick of wood ; but on this trip , he was guilty of no greater indiscretion than carelessness . Long before the boat reached Bayville , Paul had skinned and strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditable to his skill . Leaving John to secure the boat , he took the fish and hastened up to the house of Captain Littleton . He found that gentleman in his garden with his guests . " Well , Paul , what luck ? " asked he , as the young fisherman came in sight . " First-rate , sir . " " How many have you got ? " " Six dozen . " " Just the number I want . Carry them into the kitchen , Paul . I declare , you have dressed them very nicely . " " I tried to have them right , sir , and I am glad they suit you , " replied Paul , modestly , as he walked towards the rear of the house . " Stop , Paul ; what have you got there ? " said Captain Littleton . " Tautog , sir ; and if you will permit me , I will leave them in the kitchen with the perch . " " You are a lucky fisherman Paul ; those are handsome fish , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right when you come out . That is a luxury I did not expect . " Paul was delighted by the commendation of his friend , and the splendid scheme of his future operations increased in importance with every word that was uttered . With a light heart he ran into the kitchen with his stock , and then returned to Captain Littleton . " Here is two dollars , Paul , " said he , handing him a bill . " That is too much , sir , " stammered Paul , overwhelmed at the idea of having made two dollars in one day . " It is right , my boy ; take it . You must n't be bashful if you are going to fight your way through the world . " " You are very kind , sir , but this is more than the fish come to , " answered Paul , taking the bill . " No , it is n't ; the perch come to a dollar and twenty cents , the tautog to seventy-five , which make a dollar and ninety-five cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much obliged to you besides . " " I did n't mean to charge you any thing for the tautog , sir . " " Look here , Paul ; when you get rich I will accept your gifts ; but now , my boy , I will take the will for the deed , and I feel just as grateful to you as though you had presented me a service of plate . You have done well , and I am glad of it . " " Thank you , sir ; I am very much obliged to you for this , and for all you have done for my mother , " replied Paul , as he put the bank bill in his pocket . " By the way , how about that place in the lawyer 's office , Paul ? " said Captain Littleton , as the young fisherman turned to go home . " If you please , sir , I had rather not take the place . " " You are going to do better , then ? " " Yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you for the trouble you have taken . " " Not at all , my boy ; I did n't think the situation would be large enough to suit your ambition . What are you going to do , Paul ? " " I am going to catch fish , and sell them in town , sir , " replied Paul , boldly , though he could hardly keep down the emotions that swelled in his bosom . " Good , my boy ! I like an enterprising spirit and I dare say you will do very well . You may put me down for two dozen perch every Saturday . " " Thank you , sir . " " I will speak to my neighbors , and I have no doubt you will find a market for all the fish you can catch . " " You are very kind . " " What does your mother say about the plan ? " " I have n't told her yet . It is a new idea . I am afraid she will not like it very well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you would speak to her about it , if you please , sir ; she will think everything of what you say . " " I will , Paul . When you catch any more tautog , be sure and bring them to me . " " I certainly will , Captain Littleton , " answered Paul , as he bounded towards home , his heart filled with gratitude to his friend , and with hope for the success of his darling scheme . Half a dozen times on the way , he put his hand into his pocket to feel of the old black wallet , that contained the proceeds of his first day 's work . He had never done a job before which produced more than half a dollar , and the immense sum in his pocket seemed enough to make or break an ordinary bank . Such a run of luck was almost incredible . Would n't his mother be astonished when he handed her that two dollar bill ! He had some misgivings in regard to his mother 's consent ; for like all good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to have him exposed to danger . But that two dollar bill , and the brilliant promise of success which the future held out to him , would be strong arguments in favor of the scheme , and he hoped to triumph over every objection she could present . Before he reached the cottage , Paul contrived to subdue some of his enthusiasm , and walked into the kitchen , where his mother was getting dinner , as coolly and indifferently as though nothing extraordinary had happened . It was hard work for him to keep down the excitement that was raging within , but he had determined not to made a fool of himself . " Well , Paul , have you had a good time , " said Mrs. Duncan , as he entered the room . " First-rate , mother , " he replied ; though he was not exactly pleased to find that she regarded the trip to Rock Island in the light of a pleasure excursion . " Did you get as many fish as Captain Littleton wanted ? " " Yes , more too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his kitchen just now . " " You were lucky . " " I am good for as many as that every day . Look here , mother ; " and he pulled out his wallet , and took therefrom the two dollar bill . " What do you think of that ? " " Did he give you all that ? " " He did . " " He is very liberal . " " That he is ; but the fish came to about that ; the tautog are worth a quarter apiece . " " You have done bravely , my boy . If you could make half as much money as that every day , we should have all we want , and more too . " " I can , mother ; and I mean to do so , " replied Paul , thinking this a good opportunity to announce his magnificent intentions . " You must n't be too confident , Paul . " " I know I can . " " And , pray , what do you mean to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going into the fishing business , mother . " " Into what ? " " Into the fishing business . " " What in the world do you mean by that ? " " I mean just what I say , mother ! " " Is the boy crazy ? " demanded Mrs. Duncan , suspending her culinary operations , and looking with interest into the animated face of her son . " I am as regular as I ever was in my life . I 've thought it all over , and spoken to Captain Littleton besides ; and he says go ahead , " replied Paul , making an early use of the captain 's encouraging words . " But I do n't understand what you mean ? Going into the fishing business ? " " Yes , ma'am ; we 've got a boat , and I mean to go down to Rock Island every day , Sundays excepted , and catch perch . I mean to sell them here in Bayville , and Captain Littleton told me to put him down for two dozen every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But , Paul --  --  " " If I can get a shilling a dozen for them , I can make a dollar a day as easy as you can turn your hand over , " added Paul , who was not disposed to let his mother speak upon impulse . " You would have to be on the water every day . " " What of that , mother ? The water is a good thing to be on , and just as safe as the land , if you are only a mind to think so . " " Rather dangerous , I 'm afraid . " " O , no , mother ; it 's only a notion some folks have , that the water is n't safe . " " Hundreds of people are drowned every year . " " And hundreds smashed up and killed on the railroads . Why , Captain Mitchell do n't think it is safe to go about much on the land . He only feels secure when he is in his old whale boat . He wo n't get into a chaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them ; but he knocks about the bay in all sorts of weather . Please do n't object to it , mother , for I 've set my heart upon the business , and I 'm satisfied I shall do well , " said Paul , with kindling enthusiasm . " Well , if you are set upon it , I do n't want to say too much against it , " replied Mrs. Duncan , doubtfully . " Captain Littleton will speak to you about it , and he understands these things . " " I know he does ; but after all , I would rather have you safe on land . " " I shall be safe enough , mother ; and I shall be able to take care of the family without your making bags . " " You are a good boy , Paul , " added his mother , turning from him to wipe away the tears that moistened her eyes , for in the loneliness of her widowhood she realized what it was to have such a noble and devoted son . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters with her . He had expected to have a hard beat to windward in reconciling her to his plan , but she had proved much more reasonable than he anticipated . He attributed his ready victory in a great measure to the influence of Captain Littleton 's name , and he was confident he would remove any remaining doubts she might harbor . After dinner Paul went up to his room , and taking from his drawer a little account book , which had long been waiting to be used , he entered the amount of the day 's sales upon the first page . " Little by little , " said he , as he returned the book to the drawer , " and one of these days I shall be rich . " This was a very comforting reflection , and notwithstanding the possible slip between the cup and the lip , he enjoyed the full benefit of it . CHAPTER VII . PAUL GOES INTO BUSINESS ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT . Before night , all the arrangements for the next day 's trip were completed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up in season in the morning . The excitement which his great project created in his mind , however , would not let him sleep till he was actually exhausted with thinking . He did not wake till five o'clock in the morning , which made him so ashamed of himself , that he could hardly conceal his vexation , especially as he found his mother was up , and his breakfast was nearly ready , when he went down-stairs . But on reflection he found he was early enough , for it would be low tide nearly an hour later than on the preceding day . While he was eating his breakfast , his brother John came down . It was an unusually early hour for him to rise , and it was evident from the haste with which he completed his toilet , after he found Paul had not gone , that he had an idea of his own , as well as his brother . " May n't I go with you , Paul ? " asked he . " You must go to school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ? " added he , turning quickly to Mrs. Duncan . " I 'd rather you would n't , John . " " Why not , mother ? " whined he . " I do n't want you to stay out of school a single day , when it can be prevented . " " I should think I might go with Paul . I can catch as many fish as he can . " " Paul is older than you are , and he always kept close to his school till he left . " " I want to do something towards supporting the family , as well as he . " Mrs. Duncan laughed , and so did Paul ; for however ambitious the young gentleman might have been to bear his full share of the burden of the family , it was too evident that his taste for boating and fishing was the dominant motive for absenting himself from school . " Let me go with you , Paul . " " Mother says you must go to school , and I think you had better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you skin the fish ? " demanded John , who had a proper idea of the value of his services , and was not at all pleased at the thought of having them undervalued . " I shall try to get along some way without you . I should like to have you go , first rate , John ; but I do n't think you ought to stay out of school . You will have a vacation next week , and you may go every day then , if you want to . " " You ought to take me with you , Paul , " continued John , resorting to the persuasive , now that the argumentative had failed . " I tell you I should like to have you go with me , if it were not for your school . " John exhausted his store of arguments and persuasions without effect , and then fled to his room to cry over his defeat . Paul sympathized with his brother in his disappointment , but as the head of the family , he could not , on principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lunch , he left the house and hastened to the beach . The wind was light , as on the preceding day , and it took him nearly two hours to run down to Rock Island , for the old boat was a very heavy sailer even under the most favorable circumstances . Paul did not feel quite so nervous as on the day before , for he was so confident of success that he did not feel uneasy even when he did not get a bite for quarter of an hour . The perch were accommodating in the main , and did not disappoint him , for at twelve o'clock -- as he judged it to be by the height of the tide -- he had seven dozen in the boat , and they were still biting as greedily as when he first commenced . He had two lines on board , and he tried the experiment of using them both at the same time , though without much success ; for perch are fastidious , and require a great deal of attention . While he was pulling in a fish upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bait from the other , and he came to the conclusion it was not best to have too many irons in the fire at once . Paul did not like to abandon the field while it was yielding such a rich harvest ; but he was a prudent fisherman , and not disposed to run any risks . The tide would turn in less than two hours , and he knew it would be impossible to run up to Bayville against both wind and tide . The old boat was not equal to any such emergency , and he reluctantly wound up his line and made sail for home . The seven dozen perch were to be cleaned , and when he got fairly under way he missed John , for it was difficult for him to skin fish and work the boat at the same time . Seating himself in the stern he passed his arm round the tiller , for there was no comb to keep it in place ,  - -  and commenced his labors . He soon found that he was working at a great disadvantage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty . Taking a small line , he made the middle of it fast to the end of the tiller ; then passing it round the cleets , he tied the ends together . This apparatus kept the tiller in its place , and he could change it to any required position by pulling the line . Resuming his labors upon the fish , he found his plan worked very well , and the perch were in readiness for market when he reached the shore . After securing the boat , he hastened with the fish to the cottage , where his dinner was waiting for him . His mother congratulated him upon his success , and told him that Captain Littleton had been to see her during his absence , and that she was entirely reconciled to his new occupation . The most difficult part of the business , in Paul 's estimation , was yet to come -- that of selling the fish . As he left the house with his precious load of merchandise , he could not help feeling that the grand scheme was still an experiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or eight dozen of perch every day . It was a large place , containing about six thousand inhabitants ; and as he walked along , he brought his mathematical knowledge into use in an attempt to convince himself that the market was large enough to keep him busy during the season . At the least calculation there were six hundred families in the town , and probably a thousand . If each family would buy a mess of perch once in ten days , it would make six hundred dozen in that time , or sixty dozen a day ; but , to make allowance for over-estimates , he was willing to reduce the total one half , and call it thirty dozen a day . The fisherman would supply a large portion of the demand , but he concluded that he should have no difficulty in selling all the perch he could catch . Passing the house of Captain Littleton , the next was that of Major Nettle , and he resolved to make his first attempt to sell . The gentleman , was not at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was just leaving when Thomas Nettle accosted him . " What have you got , Paul ? " " Perch ; do your folks want to buy any ? " " Yes , I guess they do . Where did you catch them ? " " Down at Rock Island ; I am going down every day . " " Are you , though ? I should like to go with you some time . " " I shall be glad to have you . I have gone into this business . " " What for ? " " Since my father died , I have to do something to help my mother , " replied Paul , not caring to announce to his friend the whole of his stupendous plan . " Do you expect to do anything at this business ? " " Certainly I do ; I made two dollars at it yesterday . " " Did you though ? " " Do your folks want any perch to-day ? " " I guess they do ; how much a dozen ? " " Seventeen cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate in his prices . " I will speak to my mother . " Thomas returned in a short time , and took two dozen of the fish , and paid the money for them . Overjoyed at this success , he proceeded to the next house ; but though he was eloquent in regard to the freshness and fineness of his wares , he could not make a trade . He met with no better success at the next three or four places at which he called , and he began to feel a little discouraged . But the next house in his way was a large , genteel boarding-house , and he had the satisfaction of selling four dozen at the price he had before fixed , though he had almost made up his mind to let them go at ninepence . The gentleman who kept the house was pleased to get the perch , and wanted the young fisherman to bring him some three times a week for the present , for his boarders were very fond of them . Paul could scarcely contain himself for the joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of his stock , and at the very next house he disposed of them . With a dollar and nineteen cents in his pocket , he walked towards home , proud as a lord of his success . The result of this day 's work afforded him far more satisfaction than that of the preceding day , though the proceeds were considerably less ; for he was conscious of the influence of Captain Littleton 's generosity in the transaction . But the second day 's triumph was achieved by his own unaided labor and skill . What he had done this day was a fair specimen of what he might hope to do in the future . " Sold out so soon , Paul ? " said his mother , as he entered the kitchen . " Yes ; I had good luck . They took four dozen at the boarding-house . I think if I had had twenty dozen I could have sold them all . There is a great deal of difference between perch just out of the water , fresh and good , and perch which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot sun , for two or three days . " Mrs. Duncan fully agreed with this sage remark , and did not think it improved any kind of fish to keep them a great while after they were caught . " One dollar and nineteen cents , mother ; here is the money , " continued Paul , emptying the contents of the wallet into her lap . " What do you think of the fishing business now , mother ? " " It has proved to be a very good business so far : but you must not expect people to eat perch all the year round , Paul . They will get sick of them after a while . " " Then I shall go farther off ; but there are other fish besides perch , and I do n't intend to confine my operations to one kind . There are eels , and smelts , and cod , and haddock ; and if worse comes to worse , I can go into the clam trade . " " What a boy ! " laughed Mrs. Duncan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will succeed . " " If I do n't , it shall not be my fault , " replied Paul , complacently . " But you do n't mean to follow this business all your life ? " " Why not ? " " The life of a fisherman is not the pleasantest in the world . " " That 's according to one 's taste . If I only had a good boat , I ca n't think of anything that would suit me better . " " It is hard work . " " So much the better . You said that five dollars a week would support the family . Now , if you have no objection , I will save up all I make over that sum , till I get enough to buy a boat . " " Certainly , Paul ; and if you give me three dollars a week , or even two , I can get along very well . " " I shall not do that , mother . I am going to support the family , anyhow ; and I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You must n't think of doing too much , Paul . " " Too much ! I shall be idle half the time , at this rate . Here I am , with my day 's work done at three o'clock in the afternoon . I do n't want you to do anything , mother , but take care of the house , as you always used to do . " " There will certainly be no need of it , if you get along as well as you expect . How much will such a boat as you want cost , Paul ? " " Well , I do n't know ; when I buy I want to get a first-rate one . " " How much do you think . " " Fifty to seventy-five dollars ; but I wo n't think of such a thing yet a while . The old one will do very well for the present . I can save up something every week , and little by little , I shall make up enough to get just such a boat as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life insurance ; for Mr. Freeman will perhaps sell us the house , if we pay nine hundred dollars down . " " I wo n't do that , mother . My boat shall be bought with my own earnings . " " I will lend you the money , then . " " No , I wo n't get in debt . " " But a new boat would be safer . " " The old one is safe enough ; all the fault I find with her is , that it takes her so long to get down to the fishing ground . " Paul resolutely refused to run in debt , or to touch the money which had been appropriated for the purchase of the house . He intended , when he had time , to fix up the old boat , and rig a jib on , which he thought would overcome his principal objection to her . When he went to bed that night , he entered the proceeds of this day 's work in his book , and then with pardonable pride , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two days . CHAPTER VIII . PAUL TAKES A COLD BATH . The limits of our little volume do not permit us to follow Paul Duncan into the minutiae of his prosperous business , and we are reminded that great events in his experience are yet to be introduced . He was successful in his undertaking , though , like all in this inconstant world , he was subjected to trials and disappointments . There were some days when it was so rough off the rocks that he could not fish ; and there were others when he had to travel many miles before he could sell his fish . During John 's vacation , his receipts amounted to about two dollars a day , which went a great way in counter-balancing the ill luck of the next week . On an average , he earned about a dollar a day . He had won a reputation in Bayville which helped him a great deal in disposing of his merchandise . People saw him working hard to supply the place of his father , and they were glad to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to help those that help themselves . The sympathy and kindness of his neighbors were a great assistance to him , and no doubt without them his fish would have oftener been a drug in the market . Paul inherited some portion of his father 's mechanical skill ; and on the first stormy day after he set up in business , he commenced his contemplated improvements upon the old boat . She was a very poor subject to work upon , but he got out the wood for building a half deck over her , which he fitted on as he had opportunity . A short bowsprit was added to her rig , and his mother made him a jib , which he cut out himself . Thus refitted , the old boat , though her main defects could not be remedied , was much improved , and worked better than before . She was far from coming up to the young fisherman 's ideal of a trim craft , and he cherished a strong hope that before many years had passed away , he should have the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly defined . The time was closer at hand than he suspected . One day , early in the month of July , Paul was making his way home from the rock in a smart blow . While he was fishing , the wind had hauled round to the northeast , and continued to freshen till it became a reefing breeze . He had got but a small fare of fish , for the heavy sea had interfered with his operations . He disliked to leave the fishing ground , but it was sufficiently evident to him that a storm was approaching . He had often promised his mother that he would be very careful , and the present seemed a proper time to exercise that caution . John was with him , and in spite of this bold youth 's most earnest protest , he got up the anchor and made sail for home . " What are you afraid of , Paul ? " demanded John , with evident disgust . " You are a pretty sailor ! Do n't you see it is going to blow a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to be out in a blow once . I want to know what it 's like , " replied the reckless boy . " You may know now , before you get home . Do n't you see the white caps on the waves off to windward ? " " I like the looks of them , and it 's fun to skip over them . " " I do n't want to worry mother . She 's at the window by this time , looking out for the boat . Do you think there is any fun in making her uneasy ? Besides , I do n't think it is safe to stay here any longer . There comes the Flyaway under jib and mainsail . " " What of it ? " " She went down to be gone all day . What do you suppose she 's coming back for at this early hour ? " " I suppose Captain Littleton did n't want to make the women seasick , " promptly replied John . " Would the foresail make them sick ? She has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when to expect a gale , and we shall have it soon . " So it seemed by the working of the little boat , for she tossed up and down on the waves like a feather , and thrust her bows under so far , that John had to waste some of his enthusiasm upon the baling kettle . Paul had not hoisted the jib , for the mainsail was all the old craft could stagger under , and her youthful skipper expected soon to be obliged to reef . The Flyaway was at the eastward of the island , driving over and through the waves like a phantom . The spray was dashing over her bows , and her jib was wet several feet above the boltrope . She was working to windward till she could clear the island , when she would have the wind free into Bayville Harbor . Perhaps some of my non-nautical young readers will need to be informed that working to windward means sailing in a zigzag line in the direction from which the wind blows . The Flyaway ran close in to Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just been lying at anchor , and his boat was not more than the eighth of a mile distant from her . The boys could distinctly see the ladies and gentlemen on board of her , and replied to signals of recognition that were made to them . There were several children on her deck , and Paul identified Carrie Littleton in a little girl of ten , who was waving her handkerchief to him . As the yacht came up into the wind , and before the boom swung over , the young lady jumped upon the taffrail to obtain a better view of them . To the horror of all who saw the accident , the heavy spar struck her on the shoulder , and she was knocked overboard . The Flyaway , catching the wind , flew from the spot , and when the little girl rose to the surface of the water , she was out of the reach of those on board of her . " Heavens and earth ! " shouted Paul , jumping up from his seat , as he beheld the catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom ! " " O , dear ! She will be drowned ! " gasped John . " Take the helm , John ! Do n't blubber ! Quick ! " cried Paul , as he leaped forward , and brailed up the sail . " Now , hard down ! Lively ! " The boat , which was making very good headway , came about , and was headed towards the island . Shaking out the sail again , she bore down towards the unfortunate girl . In the meantime , the Flyaway had luffed up ; though she was nearer to Carrie than Paul 's boat , she was rapidly drifting to leeward . Her tender , which was a light canoe , had been placed upon deck , and the crew were launching her ; but as they did so , by the clumsiness of some one engaged in the operation , she filled as she struck the water , and they were obliged to haul her up again with the halliards . Before they had made fast to the painter of the canoe , Paul had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk beneath the angry waves . She had evidently been injured by the blow of the boom , and was unable to make any exertion . " Now mind your eye , John ! " shouted Paul as he dashed off his coat and shoes . " When I dive , throw her up into the wind . " " Look out , Paul ; do n't do that , " remonstrated his brother . " You will be drowned yourself . Fish her up with the boathook . Mother will --  --  " The intrepid youth , disregarding the terror of his brother , dived over the bow of the boat the moment he saw the form of the poor girl , which was revealed to him by the white dress she wore . John obeyed the instructions he had received , but before Paul reappeared , with the drowning child in his arms , the boat had drifted some distance from the spot . " Haul aft your sheet ! " gasped Paul , when he had regained breath enough to speak . John obeyed , but his terror had almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt as it might have been ; but the boat slowly gathered headway , and moved towards the struggling youth . Paul battled manfully with the big waves , which repeatedly swept him under , and determined to die rather than drop his helpless burden . As the boat came down upon him , Paul supported Carrie with one arm , and grasped the gunwale with the other . " Luff up ! " said he . " Now , catch hold of her , and help haul her in , " he added , as the boat came up into the wind . John did his best , but he was not strong enough to draw the lifeless form into the boat . Bidding him hold on for his life , Paul leaped into the boat , and drew her in . " Keep her away for the yacht , " cried Paul , as he placed the form of the poor girl -- for he was not certain that it was still animated by the vital spark -- in the bottom of the boat . Turning her face down , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used all the efforts his knowledge and his means would permit to promote her restoration . In a few moments the boat came alongside the Flyaway , though John , in the excitement of the moment , stove her gunwale in , and had nearly added another calamity to the chapter of accidents . Captain Littleton jumped into the boat as she struck the side , and seizing the beloved child in his arms , leaped back upon deck , and then rushed into the cabin . " Hand up your painter , Paul , and come on board , both of you , " said Captain Gordon , the skipper of the Flyaway . " Ay , ay , sir , " replied Paul , too much interested in the fate of poor Carrie to think of parting company with the yacht . The fishing boat was made fast at the stern of the Flyaway , and she stood off again to clear the rocks around the island . All the party on board had followed Captain Littleton into the cabin , to learn the condition of his child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fortunate that Dr. Lawrence was one of the company , for he was a very skilful man , and under his direction the measures for the relief of Carrie were conducted . The Flyaway had reached her berth at the mouth of the river before the efforts for the child 's restoration promised to be effectual . It was found that the blow of the boom had not seriously injured her . In an hour after the yacht reached her moorings , she was able to speak , and the doctor ordered her to be taken home . Before the yacht reached her berth , a pair of anxious eyes , from the chamber window of the cottage , had discovered the dingy old boat towing at her stern . The mother 's heart almost failed her , as her imagination pictured some dreadful calamity that had happened to her boys . Filled with dreadful forebodings , she seized her shawl and bonnet , and hastened to the landing , in the rear of Captain Littleton 's house . They were bringing home the boat in which her boys had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had been lost . She tried to believe that the yacht had overtaken them , and that Captain Littleton had invited them on board ; but her fears were stronger than her hopes . When she reached the landing place , she saw that the gunwale of the old boat was stove , and her heart sank within her . There were several persons at the landing , and she told them what she feared . One of them took a skiff and rowed out to the yacht . Paul and John were both in the cabin , and when the messenger came alongside , the captain called them on deck . Seeing Mrs. Duncan on the shore , they got into their boat , and soon joined her . " I never was so glad to see you before in my life ! " exclaimed the delighted mother , clasping them both to her bosom . " Why , Paul , you are as wet as a drowned rat ! You have been overboard ; I know you have ! " " That 's so , mother ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over of my own free will . " " Yes , he did , mother , " interrupted John . " Carrie Littleton was knocked overboard by the boom , the Flyaway 's boat got swamped , and she drifted to leeward , and we came about , and bore down on her , and Paul dived after her , and I worked the boat , and we hauled her in , and took her on board the Flyaway -- did n't we , Paul ? " and John sputtered as though his own mouth had been full of salt water . " We did , " replied Paul . " You will catch your death a-cold , Paul . Do come home now . " " I must take the boat round . " One of the bystanders , all of whom had listened with eager interest to the particulars of the accident , volunteered to perform this service for him ; and Paul , shivering with cold , ran home , followed by his mother and John . " Where is Paul Duncan ? " demanded Captain Littleton , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gone , half an hour ago , sir , " replied Captain Gordon . " God bless him ! " fervently ejaculated the grateful father ; and he proceeded to give directions for the removal of Carrie . CHAPTER IX . PAUL BECOMES SKIPPER OF THE FAWN . The heroic act of Paul , in saving the life of Carrie Littleton , was the principal topic of conversation in Bayville for the next week . Of course it was the unanimous vote of the people that Paul was a hero , and there was some talk of giving him a complimentary dinner , and making speeches at him ; but the good sense of the strong-minded men and women of the place prevailed , and he was not treated with the honors that turn the head of a third-rate politician . But everybody thought something ought to be done , and after a full week had passed by , everybody wondered that Captain Littleton did not do something ; that he did not make Paul a present of a gold medal , or give him a check for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done anything more than thank Paul , with tears of gratitude in his eyes , for the noble service he had rendered him . The captain had the reputation of being a very liberal man , but the glory of his good name seemed to be rapidly passing away . Paul attended to his business as usual , and seemed to give but little heed to the compliments that were showered upon him . When any one spoke to him about his gallant deed , he tried to turn it off , declared he had only done his duty , as sentimental heroes generally do , and he did not think he had done any very great thing , after all . But notwithstanding all this seeming indifference , Paul was proud of the act that had made him famous . He was conscious that he had done a noble deed ; and his own heart assured him he deserved the praise which was so liberally bestowed upon him . Above all , he was grateful for the opportunity of serving Captain Littleton , who had been so kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thought of having saved that darling child from a watery grave , and he had given the fond father a good reason for being his friend as long as he lived . Paul never thought of any reward ; he hoped Captain Littleton would not give him anything , for that would deprive him of one half the satisfaction the act had afforded him . Another week passed by , and still , to the astonishment and disgust of the gossips of Bayville , Captain Littleton took no further notice of Paul 's heroic deed . Mrs. Green , who was Mrs. Duncan 's nearest neighbor , ventured to suggest that the captain was a mean man , and she would n't have thought it of him . " What would you have him do ? " asked Paul , to whom Captain Littleton 's reputation was as dear as that of his mother , or even of his dead father . " What would I have him do ? " repeated the old lady . " Why , he ought to give you a hundred dollar bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you fifty . " " I do n't want anything , Mrs. Green , " said Paul stoutly . " That 's nothing to do with it . He could just offer it -- could n't he ? He is a rich man , and a hundred dollars is no more to him than a hundred cents to me . It is downright mean , there . " " I do n't think so , marm . Captain Littleton has done everything he could for mother and for me , and I 'm sure I was glad to have a chance to do something for him . " " That may be ; but it do n't look well for a rich man like him to let you save his little daughter from drowning , and then only say thank'ee for it . " " I think it does , Mrs. Green , and I hope he will let the matter rest just where it is . " " There is no danger now but what he will . If he ever meant to do anything for you , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented , marm , and I only wish the neighbors were as easy about it as I am . " " It ai n't none of the neighbors ' business , I know , " added Mrs. Green , a little tartly ; " but I ca n't look on and see such meanness without speaking of it . It do n't make no difference who I say it to , neither ; I had just as lief say it to Captain Littleton , as say it to you and your mother . That is just what I think , and I may just as well speak it as think it . " It was a remarkable fact , under the circumstances , that Mrs. Green never did give Captain Littleton the benefit of her opinion on this subject . Perhaps she wronged him by her silence , thus denying him the practical advantage of her criticism for the direction of his future life . But Paul never liked Mrs. Green so well after this , for she had spoken ill of him whom he honored and esteemed . Our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name , pursued his humble avocation with pride and pleasure -- with pride , because he had been successful by his own unaided exertions ; with pleasure , because he was actually relieving his mother from the entire burden of supporting the family . Since the rescue of Carrie , perch , tom-cod , flounders , and tautog had been in greater demand than ever , for many of the rich people bought fish , even when they did not want them , just for the sake of patronizing the young hero ; and the poor people ate fish oftener than they would if their admiration for the little fish merchant had been less . The long summer vacation had commenced , and the boys were let loose from school for six weeks . John felt as though he had been emancipated from a dreadful drudgery . He could scarcely repress his exuberant joy , as he carried home his books on the last day of the term . Paul reproved him for his dislike of school , and told him he might see the day when he would appreciate the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , " growled John , though it was a good-natured growl . " Yes you do ; you hate school , " added Paul . " If you did not , you would not be so glad to get away from it . " " ' Not that I love Caesar less , but I love Rome more , ' " replied John , laughing . " What do you mean by that ? " demanded Paul , amused at the attitude into which his brother threw himself as he uttered the quotation . " Not that I love school less , but I love fishing more ; that 's the idea , " replied John . " I hope you will get enough of it in six weeks , then . " " I hope so , but I do n't believe I shall . At any rate , I 'm going every day , and I 'm going to be first mate of the Blowout . " " The what ? " " The Blowout ; that 's what I have christened the old boat . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's a very beautiful boat , " laughed John . " I wish you had a better one . " " So do I ; perhaps I may have , one of these days . " " Somebody 's got a new one , Paul , " added John . " There is one moored off Mercantile Point . Did you see her ? " " No ; whose is she ? " " I do n't know ; I saw her come up the bay as I came home from school . She 's a perfect beauty . " " We will go over and see her by and by , " said Paul , for a new boat was an object of interest to him , and he always improved the opportunity to inspect any strange craft that visited the bay . " But , John , we must be off early on Monday morning , and the jib of the Blowout , as you call her , wants mending . We will go down and sew it up . " The brothers repaired to the beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand and taking a little box containing the thread , needles , and wax for mending the sail , they commenced their labors . Their busy hands soon completed the task , and the Blowout was otherwise prepared for duty on Monday , for Paul never went near the boat on Sunday . They were now ready to visit the new craft ; but when they had pushed their boat down into the water , Paul saw a gentleman enter the cottage of his mother . It was Captain Littleton ; and Paul delayed their departure , thinking that he might want to see him . Presently his friend appeared on the bluff . " Are you busy , Paul ? " he shouted . " No , sir ; I will be with you in a moment . " " Stay where you are ; " and Captain Littleton descended the steep path which led to the beach . " You were going out -- were you ? " " We were , sir ; but it is of no consequence , " replied Paul . " John says there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about going to see her . " " Very well , I will go with you ; " and Captain Littleton stepped into the boat . " Our boat is not a very nice one for you to sail in , " apologized Paul . " I have been in worse ones than this , Paul ; and I have seen the time when I would have given all I had in the world for even so dingy a boat as this . " " When was that , sir ? " asked John , very promptly ; for he stood his ground , unawed by the dignity of the richest man in Bayville . " Get your boat under way , and I will tell you about it , " replied Captain Littleton . Paul shook out the mainsail , and then pushed off the boat , while John hoisted the jib . The former then took his place at the helm , and the latter seated himself amidships , both eager to hear the story of the captain . It was fortunate for them that the old Blowout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have obtained the whole of the story , which was long and very interesting and exciting . We have not space to repeat the story , but it was all about a shipwreck , and clinging to a broken spar for forty-eight hours , without food or water , and being rescued when life was nearly gone . " So you see , Paul , I should have been very comfortable even in a worse boat than yours , " added the story-teller , as he completed his narrative . " I should like to be shipwrecked once , " said John , musing . " Should you , my fine fellow ? " exclaimed the captain . " I should , sir , just to see how it would seem . " " It would seem very uncomfortable , my boy ; and I recommend you never to express such a wish again . Many shore people think there is something very fine and romantic about the sea , or even about a wreck ; but half a day 's experience would teach them better . For my part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sea , even as master of a vessel . " " There is the new boat , " interrupted Paul , as the Blowout rounded Dog Island , which had before concealed the new craft from their sight . " Is n't she a ripper ! " exclaimed John . " Do n't use such words , John , " added Paul , in a low tone . " She 's a very fine boat , " said John . " She has a broad beam , but she looks as though she would sail well ; " Paul continued . " Keep her away a little ; we will go on board of her if you like , " said Captain Littleton . Paul , though he would not have ventured on board of the new craft if he had been alone , ran the Blowout alongside of her , for he was satisfied that the presence of his friend would free him from the charge of trespass . John made fast the painter to the new boat , and the party leaped on board . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A perfect beauty , " added Paul , with enthusiasm . " She will sail like a bird . " " You see she has air chambers at the bow and stern , " said Captain Littleton . " You can not sink her . " The boys examined her from stem to stern , and their eyes sparkled with pleasure , as they rested upon her useful and elegant appurtenances . John looked over her gracefully rounded stern , and found there the words , FAWN -- BAYVILLE , in raised gilt letters ; and he immediately gave utterance to his opinion that the Fawn of Bayville could n't be beaten . " How do you like her , Paul ? " quietly asked Captain Littleton . " First rate , sir ; she is the finest boat I ever saw . " " Do you think she would sail well ? " " I know she would . " " Suppose we try her . You may hoist the fore and main sails . " " Does she belong to you , sir ? " " She belongs to a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul and John hoisted the sails , and got everything in readiness to slip the moorings , when the captain wished John to take the Blowout over to her berth , and they would take him on board again . He consented , and the two boats were soon headed towards the beach ; but the Fawn made three rods as often as the Blowout made one . At last John worked the clumsy old boat up to the beach , and jumped on board the Fawn . The language with which he expressed his satisfaction at her performance under sail was not very elegant or well chosen ; but it undoubtedly expressed his opinion , so that no mistakes in regard to his meaning could have been excused . " You like her , do you , Paul ? " asked Captain Littleton for the tenth time . " Very much indeed . She is a beauty ! Who owns her , sir ? " " She belongs to a young friend of mine -- one Paul Duncan . " " Sir ! What ! " " Exactly so , Paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the skipper of the Fawn . " CHAPTER X. PAUL AND JOHN ARE VERY MUCH EXCITED . Paul was overwhelmed with astonishment and delight at this unexpected declaration . His eyes filled with tears , and he could not utter a word to express the gratitude that filled his heart . " Yes , Paul , you shall hereafter be the skipper of the Fawn , " repeated Captain Littleton . " And I shall be first mate ! " exclaimed John , jumping up and clapping his hands with rapture . " Yes , and you shall be first mate , John ; for I have not forgotten that a part of my debt of gratitude for the rescue of my daughter is in your favor , my fine fellow . The Fawn shall be owned between you . " " Thank you , sir , " replied John ; " but it was Paul that saved Carrie . " " If you had not handled the old boat well , Paul could not have saved her . You are fairly entitled to a share of the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " interposed Paul , " I do not want to be paid for what I did . It was only my duty to save Carrie . " " Everybody does not do his duty in such a trying time as that was , Paul . But I have not said a word about paying you . " " I know you have not , sir ; but I suppose that is what you mean . " " I mean nothing of the kind , my boy . I could not pay you . There lies the Flyaway , " continued the Captain , pointing to his beautiful yacht ; " she cost me six thousand dollars . If I were called upon to decide which I would lose , Carrie or the Flyaway , which should I choose ? " " The Flyaway , of course . " " Then the Flyaway would have been but a small compensation for my child . Nay , if I were called upon to decide between my child and all I am worth in the world , I would sacrifice all my earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I could pay you , it would be all I have , Paul . You will not , therefore , consider this boat as a reward for saving Carrie 's life . " " I did n't mean that , sir , " stammered Paul , " but --  --  " " But you thought I meant it . I did not . I shall never be able to discharge the debt of gratitude I owe you . " " We will call it square , if you please , sir , " said John . " We will not , my fine fellow , " added the Captain , laughing at John 's matter-of-fact speech . " I had been thinking of making you a present of a boat before this event happened , Paul ; but I confess , the gift was hastened by your daring act . The long and the short of the whole matter is , that we will consider the Fawn a memorial of the rescue of Carrie , and not a reward . She is a strong , well-built , and safe boat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , how do you like her name ? " " First rate , sir . " " I think I heard you suggest that name for a boat once . " " It is just the name I should have given her , " replied Paul , so excited by the extraordinary event of the hour , that he could hardly keep his seat . " I am glad , then , that she suits you in every respect . Now , if you will put me ashore near my house , I will leave the Fawn and her owners to their future destiny . " Paul landed Captain Littleton on the pier behind his house , and after pouring out his thanks for the magnificent gift , they parted company . The Fawn was headed away from the rocks , and again stood out into the bay before the fresh breeze . " I say , Paul , is n't this a stunner ? " exclaimed John , suddenly jumping up from his seat , after he had remained silent and motionless for the full space of five minutes -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean by a ' stunner , ' John , " asked Paul , with dignity . " Well , what a -- what a -- what a thundering thing this is ! " sputtered John . " Only to think --  --  " " I wish you would n't use those slang phrases . You let them out before Captain Littleton , just as though he were one of the fellows . " " He 's one of ' em , anyhow . He 's a trump ! " " Will you quit using slang words ? " " I 'll try . " It must not be supposed that Paul was always so particular in regard to the choice of words ; but at the present time , the idea of being owner of such a craft as the Fawn , and being the friend of such a man as Captain Littleton , inspired him with a dignity he did not always possess . " Talk like a gentleman , if you can , now there is some prospect of your becoming one , " continued Paul . " I will try ; but I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a -- a beauty ! I should like to try her with the Snowbird . " " Very likely we may have a chance . She 's too good to go a fishing with , " said Paul , glancing around him at the cushioned seats in the standing room . " It wo n't hurt her any ; we can take the cushions out when we fish . " " We must use her for that , I suppose . But Jack Starr lets his boat , which is not half as good as this , for four dollars a day . Perhaps we can do a little business of this kind . " " Very likely we can ; folks always want to go down in the best boat . " " We can suit them , then . Where are you going now , Paul ? " " I am going to run in , and let mother see her . " " Good ! Wo n't her eyes stick out ? " " She will be surprised , " replied Paul , in tones of gentle rebuke . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was despatched for his mother . While he is absent , we will improve the opportunity to give our young readers a better idea of the new boat than they have yet obtained . She was about eighteen feet long , and very broad for her length . Her bow was very sharp , and her build combined the advantages of being a safe boat and a fast sailer . She was schooner-rigged , carrying a jib , foresail , and mainsail ; and there was a staysail in the cuddy for use when the wind was light . The deck of the Fawn extended over about half her length , and under it was a cuddy , or small cabin , containing two berths , both of which were furnished with proper bedding . There were four lockers , or closets , accessible from the standing room , where the boys could keep their fish lines , knives , spare ropes , and other articles required on board . The Fawn was rather large for a boy of Paul 's age to handle , but as this fault would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be well to prepare for the future as well as the present . But the rigging was so arranged that the new boat was hardly more difficult to manage than the old one , and she was capable of saving at least one half the time which the Blowout occupied in going to and returning from the fishing ground . While John was absent , Paul again examined every part of the Fawn . He looked into all the lockers , sounded the copper air-chambers , lay down upon each of the berths , and hoisted the mainsail , just to see how easily it could be done . The examination was satisfactory in every respect . " Mother , mother ! " shouted John , as he rushed breathless into the house , where Mrs. Duncan was getting tea ; " come down to the beach just as quick as ever you can . " " What is the matter , John ? What has happened ? " asked Mrs. Duncan , alarmed by his earnest manner . " Come down quick , mother ; do n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing , mother ; only come . " " Is anything the matter with Paul ? " she inquired , as she hastily grasped her sun-bonnet , and followed John out of the house . The enthusiastic youth did not wait for the more tardy steps of age , but tumbled recklessly down the steep path , and leaped into the boat . " Where is mother ? " demanded Paul . " She is coming . I wish we had a cannon ; we would fire a salute . " " No use of burning powder for nothing . There she comes . " But it was some time before Mrs. Duncan could reach the beach , and John occupied the interim in various antics , such as running up the shrouds of the Fawn , hoisting and lowering the jib , lying down on the bobstay , and finally in tumbling overboard while attempting to perch himself on the end of the bowsprit . This accident did not in the least disturb his equanimity , and he had just shaken himself , like a Newfoundland dog , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Paul ? " asked Mrs. Duncan , who , during the last moments of her walk , had been gazing with admiration upon the trim craft . " Mine , mother , " replied Paul , with assumed indifference . " Mine , too , " added John . " We own her together , " said Paul . " Own her together ? What do you mean by that ? Have n't you learned better than to make sport of your mother , boys ? " " It is ours , certain true , mother ! " cried John . " You do n't mean so ? " " It is a fact , mother , " replied Paul . " Why , where , what in the world --  --  " " That 's it , mother ; I knew you 'd come to it , " interposed John . " To make a long story short , Captain Littleton made us a present of her . " " Dear me ! " " Is n't she a beauty ? " " I should think she was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out to sail in her . You shall try her right off , " said John . " Jump aboard . " " But I ca n't jump aboard . The water is knee-deep around her . Besides , supper is almost ready . " " Never mind the supper . Jump in . " " I ca n't jump in . Where have you been , John ? You are as wet as a drowned rat ! " " I fell into the tub just now ; but never mind that . " " But I do mind it ; and you must go up and have on dry clothes before you go anywhere . " " We will go up and have supper , and after that we will take you out , " said Paul . John was disposed to rebel at this step ; but Paul was firm and decided , and made fast the Fawn to the stake in the beach . When they reached the house , the young rogue , sorely against his will , was compelled to retire to his chamber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from the effects of his cold bath , when Paul went up to call him to supper , he found him standing at the window , in his wet garments , gazing with intense interest upon the Fawn , as she lay moored at the beach . Paul , notwithstanding the flutter of emotions in his bosom , ate his supper with dignity and propriety , and several times admonished his brother that he behaved more like a young monkey than a reasonable human being . Yet Paul was excited , and so was his mother . The former talked of the good times he should have down the bay , and the latter speaking of the forethought of Captain Littleton in having the copper air chambers placed in the boat . She was glad the Fawn was a lifeboat , and she could feel a great deal easier , now , when her boys were away on the water . Supper was finished , and John , in his impatience to get on board the boat again , condescended to wipe the dishes , while Paul cleared off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embark , and repaired to the beach for that purpose . John was absolutely frantic in his efforts to perform his duty as the first officer of the Fawn , and in his eagerness had nearly drowned his mother , and swamped the boat . If the halliards of the new craft had not been new and strong , he would certainly have broken them in hoisting the sails . Paul was disgusted at his conduct , and it was only when he threatened to put him on shore that the mate subsided into the appearance of a tolerable calm . The party had a very pleasant sail ; but John almost cried with vexation , after the boat was properly secured at her moorings , to think he could not go on board of her again till Monday morning . Paul was scarcely less excited than his brother ; but the consciousness of being the head of the family restrained any outbreak of enthusiasm on his part . His thoughts ran deeper and extended farther into the future . As he retired that night , he examined the columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be satisfied with his success . His excitement had moderated , and he looked upon the Fawn as a new blessing , and in his heart thanked God , from whom all his blessings came . He regarded his fortune as already made , for little by little , he felt sure of achieving it . CHAPTER XI . PAUL 'S FIRST CRUISE IN THE FAWN . At breakfast time the next morning , John Duncan was among the missing . His mother had charged him , when he first got up , to study his Sunday school lesson , which , in the extraordinary excitement of the preceding evening , had been neglected . Paul searched for him in their chamber , and in all the other apartments of the house ; but he was not to be found . Neither Paul nor his mother had any fears that he had run away or committed suicide ; so that his absence produced more of indignation than alarm . " He must have gone down to the boat , " suggested Mrs. Duncan . " If he has , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son ! you would not do that . " " He has no business on board the boat on Sunday . " " That is very true , Paul ; but I suppose he can not keep his thoughts away from her . I do n't much wonder , either . " " I do n't know as I am very much surprised myself , " added Paul , whose second thought was more reasonable than the first . When he considered how many times his thoughts had wandered to the beautiful Fawn , and how many times he had permitted himself to anticipate the pleasure of the first cruise in her , during the morning , he was more charitable towards his younger brother , who had only done what he had thought . " I will find him , " said Paul , taking his cap . " Do n't be harsh with him , Paul , for he means right , only he has not so much strength of mind as you have . " " I wo n't be hard upon him . " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be a hypocrite , mother , and I may as well own that , while getting my lesson , I could not help thinking of the new boat . I do n't want you to believe I am better than I am . " " It is very natural that you should think of her ; but you must try not to do so . It is almost a pity the boat had not come on Monday , so that you could have had a whole week to think about her before Sunday . " Paul ran down to the beach , and discovered that the door of the cuddy of the Fawn was open . Jumping on board , he found John stretched out upon one of the beds , apparently very busily engaged in studying his Sunday school lesson . " What are you doing here , John ? " demanded Paul , though his tones were very gentle . " I am getting my lesson , " replied John , as demurely as though he had not chosen an unusual place for the exercise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . " " What made you come here ? " " I could n't help thinking of the boat , and I made up my mind that I could get my lesson here better than anywhere else . " " I 'm afraid you have n't studied it much . " " Hear me say it , then , " said John , jumping up , and handing Paul the book . " Not now ; breakfast is ready . But I want to have an understanding with you , as you are part owner of the Fawn , that neither of us go on board of her on Sunday , unless there is some strong reason for it . Will you agree to it ? " " I sha n't want to after to-day . " " No matter ; will you agree to it ? " " Yes ; but there was a strong reason this morning . " " What was it ? " " Why , I wanted to see her . " " That 's no reason at all . I have just as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we must n't do everything we want to do . Come , lock the cuddy , and let us go up to the house . " " That 's honest , and not a bit like preaching , " said John to himself , as he locked the cuddy , and followed his brother up the hill . " I am trying to make money , John , but I do n't believe money is all we have to live for . " " Of course not ; there is a good deal of fun to be had in this world , that costs money instead of bringing it in , " answered John , very soberly ; and it was evident that his thoughts were not upon his Sunday school lesson . " I was n't speaking of fun . Up to the time I went to sleep last night I was thinking how I should make money ; this morning , the first words I saw when I opened the Testament to get my Sunday school lesson , were , ' For what is a man profited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own soul ? ' " " I guess you had the nightmare last night , and have got the blues this morning , " said John , trying to get up a laugh , in which , however , he did not succeed very well , for it is hard , even for a tolerably well-disposed boy , to make fun of serious things . " I mean just what I say , John ; you need n't laugh . I feel that we have something else to live for besides money . It is a very pleasant thing to make money --  --  " " Little by little , " added John , adopting his brother 's favorite motto . " But I would n't be a rich man , if I had to be as mean and selfish as old -- no matter who . He is poorer than I am now , with his hundreds of thousands . I mean to lay up good principles --  --  " " Little by little , " interpolated John . " Little by little , if you please ; but even a little every day will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thought every day will make a man rich in good principles ; at any rate , my book says so . " " How can a fellow help thinking of the boat , if it is Sunday ? " " We must try to think of our lesson , and when we go to church , of what the minister says . I am going to try and not think of the Fawn again till I wake up to-morrow morning . " " I am willing to try , but it 's no use . I wish Sunday was over , and Monday had come . " How many boys and girls have thought the same thing ! That Sunday , whose moments seemed so heavy , was a golden opportunity which may have passed never to be recalled . We are indebted to the still hours of the quiet Sabbath , to the leisure moments of our daily life , nay , to the sleepless couch of pain and suffering , and to the bitter time of woe and bereavement , for some of the best and truest thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our good resolutions . A single instant may produce an impression upon the heart which shall last to the end of life . The words of the Scripture which Paul had read and heard read a hundred times , without feeling the tremendous truth they contain , were now full of meaning . They seemed to connect themselves with his individual future , and to have produced an impression which the excitement of possessing the new boat could not overcome . He was in the right frame of mind to receive such an impression , and it had an important influence on all his subsequent career . As the family seated themselves at the breakfast table , Mrs. Duncan improved the opportunity to enlarge upon the duties we owe to ourselves and to others , in connection with the Sabbath day . It is true that John 's levity occasionally detracted from the effect of the lessons ; but it was not wholly lost , even upon that wayward youth . Paul struggled hard with his thoughts during the day , and he was surprised , when night came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a good day to him , and he had profited by the instruction it afforded him ; for the first step towards moral or spiritual improvement is to fasten the mind earnestly upon some moral or religious topic . Long before the sun rose the next morning , Paul and John were on the beach . And when Mrs. Duncan rang the bell out of the window for them to come to breakfast , they had dug a bucket of clams , and had prepared the Fawn for her first trip down the bay . " You wo n't be anxious about us now , mother , for we have a boat that ca n't sink , " said Paul , as he took the luncheon prepared for them . " I shall feel easier now . " " Besides , you know we have two good berths on board the boat , and we should be just as comfortable , if out all night , as though we were in our own beds up-stairs . " " That may be , but I hope you will never stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We shall not , mother ; you may depend upon it ; but we might get aground ; or the wind might die out , and the Fawn is too large to be rowed up . " " I sha n't worry about you , if I can help it , for I know you are very careful , Paul . " The boys hastened down to the boat , and Mrs. Duncan went out upon the bluff to see them off . The wind blew fresh from the southwest when they started , and the Fawn went out under jib and mainsail only ; but even with this sail , she flew like a racehorse over the waters . " Shall I hoist the foresail , Paul ? " asked John . " I think not ; she is doing very well . " " But she will do better with the foresail . " " Let well enough alone . " " I want to see her do her best . " " I have promised mother a hundred times that I would be careful ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , though there might not be any danger , she would think we were going straight to the bottom . We will not hoist the foresail . " This answer satisfied the impatient boy , and in a short time they reached the perch ground ; but either there were no fish there , or they had not got the hang of the new boat ; for the fishermen could hardly get a bite . After trying for an hour , and catching only half a dozen small perch , the boys became disgusted with their ill luck , and it required but little persuasion on the part of John to induce Paul to get up the anchor , and go farther down the bay . An hour 's sail brought them to a reef of rocks , which was quite a noted locality with the fishermen . The Fawn was anchored in a safe place , and the young fishermen threw over their lines . Better success attended their efforts here , and in three hours they had caught eight dozen fine perch , besides ten handsome rock-cod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had scarcely noticed that the wind had been steadily increasing , and that it was producing a heavy sea in the bay . " We shall have a chance to find out what kind of a sea boat the Fawn is , " said Paul , as he weighed the anchor . " I am glad of it , " replied John . " The wind is freshening every moment , " said Paul , casting an anxious glance to windward . " Hope it will blow a gale . " " I think we shall get more than we want . " " Not more than I want , at any rate . " Paul hoisted the jib , and the Fawn rushed out among the white-capped waves ; but she walked over them so majestically , that John declared she could weather any gale that ever blew . For a time she breasted the foam of the head sea in a most gallant manner ; but the wind came in fearful gusts , increasing in violence every moment till Paul came to the conclusion that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proposed to set a reefed foresail . John scouted the idea , but he did not want the mainmast blown out of her , and consented to the change . John took the helm , and Paul , after lowering the jib and mainsail , hoisted the reefed foresail . The boat rode easier then ; but as the wind and tide were both against them , it was soon discovered that she made no headway . As the gale steadily increased in fury , Paul would not attempt to carry any more sail , though John insisted that she could bear the jib and a close-reefed mainsail . It was evident to Paul that , unless he put on more sail , he could not beat up to Bayville against the tide ; but it was clearly imprudent to carry any more sail , and for two hours more the Fawn struggled with her hopeless task without making a single mile . " What are you going to do , Paul ? " asked John , impatient , but not terrified by their situation . " We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " We will run over to Farm Island , and anchor under the lee of the high bluff ; " and he headed the Fawn in the direction indicated . CHAPTER XII . PAUL SLEEPS ON HIS WATCH . Farm Island was about two miles distant , and as the Fawn had the wind on the quarter , it required but a short time for her to reach her haven of safety . Under the high bluff on the seaward side of the island , the water was comparatively tranquil ; and here Paul anchored . " We are all right now , " said he , with a feeling of relief , as he took in the foresail . " When do you suppose we shall get home ? " asked John . " I do n't know ; we will not borrow any trouble , so long as we are in a place of safety . " " Mother wo n't think we are in a place of safety , " added John . " Yes , she will : I have often told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a safe place , and keep quiet till it was prudent to run home . " " It is lucky we are in the Fawn instead of the Blowout . " " We should not have gone down so far in the old boat . I felt so safe in this craft that I did not mind much about the weather . " " We have been safe enough all the time ; and if you would only have put on the jib and reefed mainsail , we should have been at home by this time . " " I did not think it was prudent to do so . I may have been mistaken ; if I was , I have erred on the safe side . " " I suppose we must sleep on board , " said John . " If you do n't like the idea , you can go on shore , and sleep at the farm house . " " But I do like the idea ; we have good beds , and I had just as lief sleep here as in my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad we are caught . " " I thought so , " said Paul , laughing ; " but there it one thing we are not prepared for . " " What is that ? " " Supper . " " I wish we had a frying pan and a furnace ; we could have some fried perch for supper . " " As we have not those things , we must make the best of what we have . Our luncheon is all gone ; but there are two or three crackers in the locker , which I threw in from the old boat . " " We sha n't starve before morning , " replied John , whose philosophy was proof against an empty stomach . " I know that ; but it would be a good deal better to have some supper , if we could get it . " " Ca n't we go on shore ? " " No , we ca n't land on this shallow beach . It would n't be safe to get aground here . " Both boys were very hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lunch in the middle of the day . The crackers were eaten , and washed down with a drink of cold water from the jug ; but it was a dry and unsatisfactory supper and Paul resolved in future to keep the Fawn provisioned for such an emergency as the present . The wind still blew with undiminished violence , and the black clouds indicated rain . By and by the darkness came on , and there was no longer any prospect of getting home before the next day . Just before dark , a man hailed them from the shore , and offered them a bed at the farm house ; but Paul thanked him and declined the offer , at the same time hinting that they had nothing on board to eat . " Come ashore , then , and get some supper , " replied the man . " We ca n't get ashore ; we draw too much water , " answered Paul . " I will bring you off then . " The man pushed a skiff into the water , and soon came alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " said he . " Yes , sir ; she is a very nice boat . " " But this is pretty heavy weather for boys to be out . Whose boat is she ? " " She belongs to us . " " To you ? " replied the man , apparently much astonished . " Yes , sir ; she was given to us by Captain Littleton . " " O , ho ! so you are Paul Duncan . " " Yes , sir . " " And I understand why he gave it to you . Come , boys , you must go up to my house and stay with me to-night . I should rather have Paul Duncan under my roof than the governor of the state . " " We must stay on board , sir , to look out for the boat . If anything should happen to her in the night , I should never forgive myself for deserting her . We have a nice place to sleep , " continued Paul , opening the doors of the cuddy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , but there is not much fun in sleeping on board a small boat such a night as this will be . But come up to the house , and have some supper . " " Thank you , sir ; we will do that , for we are both very hungry . Stop a moment . John , hand out two or three of those rock-cod . Wo n't you take these , sir ? " " I am much obliged to you for them . Though we live so near the fish we do n't have much time to catch them , " replied Mr. Drake , for that was the name of the farmer , as he threw the fish into his skiff . The two boys got into the boat with him , and he rowed them on shore . They were warmly welcomed by Mrs. Drake and the children , and a nice supper was soon placed before them ; but all the arguments and expostulations of the farmer and his wife could not induce them to spend the night at the house . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fawn to leave her , and John was too deeply smitten with the romantic idea of sleeping on board , to think of spending the night in any other manner . Mr. Drake , therefore , reluctantly put them on board their boat again . " Now , Paul , we are in for it , " said John , as he saw the farmer land , and draw up his skiff upon the beach . " Yes , and it is going to be a very dirty night . I think the wind has shifted since we went ashore , " replied Paul . " So do I ; we feel it as much again as we did . " " It blows full as hard as it has any time to-day . " The boys sat down in the standing room , and had a long talk about home and mother , and wondered what she would think because they did n't come home . It was now quite dark , and there was not a single star to relieve the gloom of the scene . John even went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pokerish , " and he was glad they were in so comfortable a place . " Come , Paul , is n't it time to turn in ? " asked John , after they had come to the unanimous conclusion that it was a decidedly stormy night . " You can turn in , John , if you want to , " replied Paul . " Ai n't you going to sleep any to-night ? " " I have no idea of leaving the Fawn to take care of herself in such weather as this . " " Are you going to sit up all night ? " asked John . " It is n't customary , I believe , on board ship , for all hands to turn in , and let the vessel take her chance . " " There is no danger here . " " If we both go to sleep , we may wake up and find ourselves nowhere . Suppose the wind should change to the eastward ; we should be fully exposed to all the fury of the storm . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns , then . " " Very well ; I will keep the first watch , and you may turn in as soon as you please . " " What is that ? " asked John as he heard three strokes of a bell . " There is a large ship at anchor off there . " " But it is n't three o'clock yet . Her clocks must be out of order . " " Three bells ; that is half-past nine o'clock . " " I do n't understand it ; how should three bells mean half-past nine ? " inquired John , who did not like to leave any nautical subject till it had been fully investigated . " It begins to rain , and we may as well sit in the cuddy ; " and they both retreated to the little cabin , and seated themselves on their berths . " If we only had a lantern to hang up in here , we should be perfectly at home . " " We will bring one next time ; but about the bells , Paul ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are called the larbord and the starbord watches . In large vessels , they are under the care of the first and second mates . The twenty-four hours , on board ship , are divided into five watches of four hours each , and two dog-watches of two hours each . During these watches , the bell is struck every half hour ; that is , one bell at half past eight ; two bells at nine , three bells at half-past nine ; and so on , till twelve , when it is eight bells , at which time one watch goes below , and the other comes on deck . At half past twelve the bell strikes one again ; at one it strikes twice , and so on . Do you understand me ? " " I think I do ; but when are the dog-watches ? ' " From four to six , and from six to eight in the evening . They always strike the bells by twos , as you heard just now . But , John , it rains like fury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry place in this cabin . " " I wish we had a lantern , for it is as dark as a pocket in here . It would make it so much pleasanter . But you must turn in now , or you will not be able to stand your watch . " " I think I will . " John took off his boots , and placed himself under the blanket and comforter of his berth , for there were no sheets . He gaped several times , and tried to continue the conversation with Paul ; but the poor fellow , worn out with the fatigue and excitement of the day , was soon fast asleep . Paul listened to the sound of his heavy breathing , between the splashes of the waves as they broke upon the bow of the boat , till he began to feel sleepy himself , and then , wrapping the greatcoat , which he always carried with him , closely around his body , he went upon deck to see if there was any change in the weather or the position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hauling round to the eastward , for the Fawn tumbled about as she had done out upon the open waters of the bay As he lay down upon the deck to examine the cable , so as to assure himself that it was not chafing the boat , a huge wave broke over the bowsprit , and he would have been drenched to the skin , if his coat had not been water-proof . The rain continued to pour down , and Paul retired to the cuddy again . It was a weary , lonely watch , and he was so tired he could hardly keep his eyes open . But it seemed to him that the violence of the gale was subsiding , and he again went upon deck to satisfy himself on this point . There was still a heavy sea , but he was satisfied that the wind had very sensibly abated . Six bells sounded from the ship as he returned to the cuddy . Throwing himself on his berth , he listened for a while to John 's sonorous snores , and before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sound asleep himself . Worn out by the labors of the day , he could no longer keep his eyes open . He woke with a start , for he was conscious that he had forsaken the post of duty ,  - -  and hastened upon deck . Eight bells from the ship told him it was midnight . The wind had nearly subsided , but it rained very hard , and the heavy sea continued to break over the bow of the Fawn . John was still sleeping like a log , and Paul , though it was time for the larboard watch to be called , had not the heart to wake up his brother . As the gale had subsided , the boat seemed to be no longer in danger , and he decided to turn in and finish his nap . But while he slept , the wind , which had abated only to come with still greater violence from another quarter , steadily increased in fury , till it blew a gale from the northeast . The pitching of the boat soon startled Paul from his slumbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the Fawn was rapidly dragging her anchor , and was in imminent peril of being dashed to pieces on the rocky shore . CHAPTER XIII . PAUL MAKES A NIGHT RUN IN THE STORM . " John , John ! " shouted Paul , when he realized the dangerous situation of the Fawn . But the first mate of the craft slept too soundly to be disturbed by mere words , and the skipper had to shake him before he came to his senses . " What is the matter , Paul ? " asked he , as soon as he could get his eyes open and realize where he was . " Put on your greatcoat and shoes , and come out here and be lively about it , " cried Paul . John obeyed , and before he was ready to join Paul in the standing room , he began to apprehend the state of affairs on board , for the furious wind and the angry waves that stormed against the hull and rigging of the Fawn told their own story . " What 's the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't you see there is a gale of wind down upon us ? " replied Paul , sharply . " Well , what of it ? " demanded the young salt , with provoking indifference . " A good deal of it ; the boat has dragged her anchor , and at this rate will be upon the rocks in fifteen minutes ! Come , be alive , and do n't stand there like a log . " " What shall I do ? You are the skipper , and I am ready to do anything you say , " replied John , who was by this time fully awake . " Can we pay out any more cable ? " But this was a useless question , for Paul knew very well that the cable was all out . Our young readers may not all understand the meaning of Paul 's question . If the vessel rides at anchor with a short cable , her motion , as she rises and falls with the sea , raises up the shaft of the anchor , which has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom . But Paul had been careful the night before to give the Fawn all the cable he could spare ; and it was evident , therefore , that the anchor was not heavy enough , or that there was no holding-ground at the bottom . " There is only one thing we can do , John , " said Paul , desperately , after he had fully examined the situation of the boat . " Say on , then , " replied John ; " I am ready for anything that you say . " " We must get up the anchor , and leave this place . " " Up it is , then . " " But this is an awful bad time , and an awful bad place to hoist a sail . " " Let her drive ; we shall go it well enough . It blows like all-possessed : but what 's the use of having a life boat , if you ca n't go out in her when it blows ? " " Stand by the fore halliards , then , " cried Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it yesterday . " The foresail was hoisted , and slammed with tremendous fury in the fresh gale . The boys then grasped the cable , and it required the full effort of their united strength to weigh the anchor ; but the task was accomplished at last , and Paul leaped to his place at the helm . Laying her course parallel with the shore of the island , the Fawn dashed over the furious waves , within ten rods ' distance from the breakers on the beach . In a few moments she passed beyond the reach of this peril , and rushed out among the billows of the open bay . It was a fearful night even for strong men to venture upon the stormy sea ; it was doubly perilous for these two boys ; yet they had no choice , for to avoid a greater danger they had chosen the less . But the Fawn behaved in a very gallant manner , and her noble bearing promised to achieve all that could be done for the safety of the young fishermen . Notwithstanding the violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the waves , and did not seem to labor in her course . " Do you know where you are , Paul ? " asked his brother , after they had sat in silence for half an hour . " Certainly I do ; there is South Point light dead ahead . " " Yes ; but there is any quantity of rocks between us and the light . " " I know that ; but I know where they are just as well as I know where the kitchen is , when I get into the house . Do n't talk to me now , John ; go below and turn in , if you like . " " Do n't you want me ? " " No . " Paul did not think that John could act upon this suggestion , in such a storm and in the midst of so many perils ; but he did , and as the young skipper heard no more from him , he concluded he was asleep . " What a fellow ! " thought Paul . " He could sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , let him sleep ; he is tired enough . " The Fawn dashed madly on , yet under perfect control , and the gallant skipper , when he saw through the deep darkness , the white breakers on Rock Island , felt entirely relieved from the responsibility which had before almost crushed his spirits , for it was plain sailing after he had passed that point and the dangerous reefs which environed it . If the Fawn could stand such a sea as that , she could stand anything , and her character was fully established for the future . His spirits rose as he neared South Point light , which was not more than a mile and a half from his mother 's house . He whistled merrily , to give expression to his satisfaction , as he passed the light , for he and the boat were now safe beyond a peradventure . Taking an extra turn in the foresheet , he laid the course of the boat a little closer to the wind , which soon brought her into the comparatively still water behind Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a light was burning in her chamber . He was grieved to see this , for he feared she might be sick , or that in her anxiety for the safety of her boys , she had sat up all night thinking of them . But in a few moments , he let go the anchor off the beach , and lowered the foresail . After making everything secure on board , he hauled the old boat , which he had moored there in the morning , alongside . John was still asleep ; neither the paying out of the cable , nor the noise of Paul 's feet , as he furled the foresail , had roused him from his deep slumbers , and the skipper decided to let him finish his night 's rest on board . Sculling the old boat ashore , he ran up the hill , and knocked at the side door of the cottage . " Who 's there ? " asked his mother . " Paul . " The door was opened , and the fond mother clasped her son to her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am so glad you have got back ! " exclaimed she ; " I was sure you were drowned . Where is John ? He is n't with you , Paul ! O , he is --  --  " " Fast asleep on board the Fawn , mother . " " Then he is safe . " " Yes ; safe -- yes . " " You have had a terrible time of it -- have n't you ? " " Not very bad , mother ; the wind and tide were against us , and we could n't get up without carrying more sail than I thought it was safe to carry ; so I ran under the lee of an island , and anchored . " " But what did you start back in the night for ? " " The wind hauled round to the northeast , and blew so that we dragged our anchor , and had to make sail to keep off the rocks . " " And John is safe , you say ? " " Perfectly safe . But why are you not in bed , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempest as this , when I knew my boys were on the water . " " Well , go to bed now , then , for I must go on board again and clean my fish . " " You shall do nothing of the kind ! I will warrant you have n't had a wink of sleep all night long . " " Yes ; I slept two or three hours . " " Go right up-stairs , and go to bed , then . You will kill yourself , working all night , and losing your sleep . " " But John is asleep in the cabin of the Fawn . Shall I leave him there ? Suppose the boat should go adrift ? " " Well , then , go down to the boat , and go to bed there . You need n't clean your fish yet . " Paul decided to adopt this suggestion , and in a few moments he was snoring with his brother in the little cabin of the boat . It was six o'clock when the first officer of the Fawn began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter past six before he realized , in the fullest sense , that he was still in the land of the living . An unpleasant dream that the gallant craft had been dashed in pieces on Rock Island reef , and that he , the before mentioned first officer of the schooner Fawn , had been thrown upon the rocks , where an enormous green lobster , about the size of a full-grown elephant , had seized him in one of his huge claws , and borne him down among the rock weed and devil 's aprons for his breakfast , happily proved to be a mere fantasy of his slumbering faculties . John sat upon his berth and congratulated himself upon his escape from the claw of the lobster . Then the occurrences of the night , the run off the lee shore , and the white-capped billows that had growled so in the gloom , began to come to his recollection , and he realized that they had had a tough time of it . But it was all right now , for though the rain pattered upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there was Paul fast asleep in the other berth ; of course it was all right , or he would not be there . " But where are we ? " thought John . " That 's the next question . The last thing I remember was , that we were driving like mad over the rough sea . Then Paul told me to turn in ; and I did , but I could hardly keep in my berth , the boat rolled and pitched so . Of course Paul could n't get up while the wind blew so , and he must have anchored under some island . I wonder where we are . " At last John came to the conclusion that he could find out by simply walking out of the cuddy into the standing room . Acting upon this brilliant idea , he soon ascertained that the Fawn was at anchor near the beach of Bayville . He was somewhat astonished at the fact , and then paid a very high , though inaudible , compliment to the sleeping accommodations of the Fawn , whereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuddy ,  - -  he and Paul invariably dignified the little place as the cabin ,  - -  and found that Paul still slumbered . He was considerate enough not to wake him , for he knew that he had had a hard time of it ; but it occurred to him that their mother might be desirous of knowing whether they were still in the land of the living or not , and he decided to go up to the house and reveal that important fact . It was very affectionate of him to think of his mother , after he had been snoring like a trooper all night ; but John , in spite of his waywardness , was a kindhearted boy , and he came to the unanimous conclusion -- he and John -- that it was not right to let his mother worry any longer about them . She would be astonished to see him alone , and would immediately make up her mind that Paul was drowned ; and he should have the pleasure of informing her that his brother still lived , and was fast asleep in the cabin of the Fawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was first mate . John , on his arrival at the house , walked into the kitchen where Mrs. Duncan was getting breakfast ; walked in as he who does the ghost in Hamlet walks in -- with the confident assurance that he is about to create a sensation . " Well , John , you have got back . Did you sleep well , my son ? " " First rate , " growled John . " Why the deuce is n't she astonished ? " thought he . " She ought to be astonished to see me come home after being on the briny deep all night . " " You had a hard time of it -- did n't you , John ? " " Well , rather hard ; I slept like a log all night -- except about half an hour . You did n't expect to see us back -- did you ? " " I was a good deal worried till Paul came up and told me you were safe , and that you were asleep in the cabin . " " O , ho ! so Paul has been home -- has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cabin now . " " Let him sleep -- he needs rest , " replied Mrs. Duncan ; and it was after nine o'clock when the family breakfasted that morning . CHAPTER XIV . PAUL SCOLDS THE FIRST OFFICER OF THE FAWN . After breakfast the young fishermen cleaned their perch and cod , and before dinner had disposed of the lot . From the proceeds of the sale , Paul purchased a small lantern , which was suspended in the cabin of the Fawn , for the darkness of that gloomy night was not soon to be forgotten . The next day was clear and pleasant , and the boat went down as usual , and for more than a fortnight , no event worthy of a place in the history of Paul 's fortunes occurred . The new boat worked admirably in every respect , and the boys were as proud of her as England has ever been of the Great Eastern . During these two weeks Paul had taken down three fishing parties , and had given them so good satisfaction , that his services in this line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a day for her , including the wages of himself and the first officer , he always welcomed such jobs , and John liked the fun of it even better than fishing , especially when there were any ladies in the party , for it was very amusing to him to see them in the agonies of sea sickness . He took a malicious delight in stowing them away in the berths in the cabin ; yet in spite of the fun he made of them John would do all he could to assist them . Just before the arrival of the Fawn in the waters of Bayville harbor , Paul had been unanimously elected a member of the Tenean Boat Club . He was very grateful for the honor conferred upon him , but his business was such that he could not often pull an oar in the boat . The members of the club all treated him with a great deal of consideration , though they were all the sons of rich men ; and Paul felt that , if he was not their equal in worldly possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in the management of a boat . One day , when the young fisherman called at the house of Major Kettle to sell fish , he met Thomas in the garden , who unfolded to him a magnificent project in which the Teneans -- as the members of the Boat Club were generally called -- were about to engage . " We think of going on a cruise in the Flyaway , " said Thomas . " Where ? " " I do n't know where yet ; but we mean to be gone a week or ten days . " " Who is going with you ? " " Captain Littleton , I suppose , though I had just as lief he would stay at home . " " Of course he would n't let a lot of boys go off for a week in the yacht , without some one to take care of them , " said Paul , with a smile . " We can take care of ourselves ; we do n't want any one to take care of us . " " How many of you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with us . " " But I ca n't go . " " Yes you can ; why not ? " " I have to attend to my business . " " You can afford to take a vacation of a week or two , I should think . " Paul shook his head . He was delighted with the idea , and would have been very glad to go , but he could not think of neglecting his business to go away upon a pleasure excursion . " You must go , Paul ; the fellows all want you to go , and we shall have a first-rate time . " " I have no doubt you will ; and I should be very glad to go with you if I could ; but it is of no use for me to think of such a thing . " " It is not fully decided that we are to go yet ; but Captain Littleton and my father have consented to let us have the Flyaway . We shall know all about it next week . " Paul continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flyaway haunted his imagination , and it required a great deal of self-denial for him to forego the anticipated pleasure . He felt that the summer season was the harvest time of his business , and he could not afford to waste a week or two in idle play . " Little by Little , " was his motto , and he was not willing that any of those " littles " should slip through his fingers . When they went down in the Fawn the next day , he told John about the excursion , and that he had been invited to form one of the party . " But I ca n't afford to go , " he added . " Why not ? It wo n't cost you anything . " " I shall lose my time , for the Fawn will lie idle at her moorings while I am gone . " " No , she wo n't . I will go a fishing in her every day . " " I think not , John . " " Do you think I ca n't manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an aspersion should be cast upon his nautical skill . " She 's too heavy a boat for you to manage alone . " " I will get a couple of fellows to help me ; they will be glad enough of the chance . " " I dare say they will ; but you are not quite old enough yet to run the boat yourself . " " What odds does it make how old I am , if I only know how to handle her ? Could you work her any better if you were a hundred years old ? " " But you are reckless , careless , John ; you know you are . " " I do n't think I am ; but I will promise to be very careful . You may take the foresail off , if you please , before you go ; then you will be sure I shall not carry too much sail . " " I do n't intend to go ; so it is of no use to talk about it . " " You are a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . " " You have a right to your own opinion , John . " " I wish I had a chance to go . I would give all my old shoes , if I could only be one of the party . What a glorious time they will have ! " Paul was of precisely the same opinion , but the idea of letting John run the Fawn during his absence was not for a moment to be tolerated . He would certainly run her on the rocks , or carry sail till the wind took the masts out of her . As it was a very pleasant day , Paul decided to run down below , and try his luck among the cod and haddock ; and they went farther out than they had ever been before . A fine lot of fish , including a mammoth cod , that had required the strength of both of them to pull out of the water , rewarded their enterprise . The wind was very light , and instead of getting home before the tide turned , as Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the ebb tide set in against them . To add to this misfortune , the wind entirely died out , and they were forced to come to anchor , to prevent drifting down with the tide . With a good wind they were only two hours ' sail from home ; but , as it was , there was a prospect of spending another night in the cabin of the Fawn -- not a very unpleasant alternative , John thought , especially as they had a lantern , and plenty of provisions on board . The cod and haddock had all been dressed , and there was nothing for the boys to do ; so Paul went into the cabin and stretched himself on his berth . He had placed two or three books on board for such an emergency as the present , and he was soon absorbed in the contents of one of them . He did not read long , for a hard day 's work is not a good preparation for literary labors . The book fell from his hand , and to the music of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that fishermen can sleep twenty-four hours on a stretch . Many years ago , we went down a-fishing in one of the pinky-stern schooners , which were much more common then in the waters of Massachusetts Bay than at the present time . The crew consisted of the skipper and three men , the former of whom was an old , weather-beaten fisherman , who had roughed it on the coast from his boyhood . We went down one night intending to fish the next day , and return by sunset ; but unfortunately a heavy rain kept us at our anchorage off Spectacle Island for twenty-four hours . The old skipper got out of his berth and ate his breakfast about ten , and after going half way up the companion ladder , to smell the weather , turned in again , and slept till four , when he was called to partake of a greasy chowder . As soon as he had disposed of a reasonable allowance for four hearty men , he tumbled into his berth once more , and was not visible again till the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirds of the time . They were the sleepiest men we ever encountered during their leisure ; but even the old skipper suddenly joined the " wide-awakes " when we reached the fishing grounds . Paul had already contracted this fisherman 's habit , and while the Fawn lay at anchor , he slept like a rock . After amusing himself for an hour on deck , John went below to take an observation , and to announce the prospect of " a breeze from the south-ward , " for he had discovered a gentle ripple on the water at a distance . But when he saw that Paul was " having his watch below , " he quickly returned to the standing room , closing the cabin doors behind him . " There is a capful of wind , " said he to himself , " and I will just show the skipper of the Fawn that I can handle her as well as he can . " He waited till the breeze reached her , and then , with as little noise as possible , he weighed the anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , Captain Duncan ; you can finish your snooze at your leisure , " muttered he , congratulating himself upon the fact that he had got off without waking Paul . The wind freshened into a nice little breeze , and the Fawn , close-hauled rippled merrily through the water . Still Paul slept on , unconscious of the progress she was making , while John was jubilant over the success of his trick . He was obliged to tack so as to go to the windward of Rock Island , but he twice accomplished this manoeuvre without disturbing the sleeper . The boat was now up with Rock Island , and John , who could never see why Paul always wanted to keep half a mile away from this dangerous reef , laid her course very near the rocks . " All right , my boy , " said John , who had a bad habit of talking to himself when there was no one present to whom he could address his remarks ; " wo n't Captain Duncan be astonished when he comes out of the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , for just as the rash first officer arrived to the conclusion that the boat had run clear of all the dangers of the navigation in that quarter ,  --  Bump ! went the Fawn on a hidden ledge . " What are you about ? " cried Paul , angrily , as he rushed out of the cabin . " About got aground , I should say , " replied John , a good deal more astonished than he had calculated Paul would be . " Let go your sheets ! Take the boat hook , and let us push her off , if we can , " cried Paul . Both the boys went to work , and after a few moments of hard labor , succeeded in pushing the Fawn off the ledge upon which she had struck . " I suppose this is a specimen of your management , " said Paul , as he hauled the sheets home , and seated himself at the helm . " Rather bad management , I am willing to own , " replied John , who felt that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eye . " Next time , when you undertake to sail the Fawn without me , do n't you do it . You would be a pretty fellow to run the boat if I were away a week ; there would n't be a board left on her ribs in three days . " " It has n't hurt her any , Paul . " " I suppose it has n't ; but it would have been just the same if it had been blowing a ten-knot breeze . " But John felt that , if it had n't hurt the Fawn any , it had hurt himself a great deal ; and he made a tremendous great resolution to be more careful in the future . The boat reached her mooring in good season , notwithstanding the detention . CHAPTER XV . PAUL GOES ON A CRUISE IN THE FLYAWAY . " There has been a gentleman here to see you , " said Mrs. Duncan , when Paul went to the house . " Who was he ? " " He left his name and residence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see him this evening , " replied Mrs. Duncan , handing him the address of the gentleman . " Charles Morrison , Chestnut Street , third house from the depot , " said Paul , reading the paper . " What does he want ? " " He said something about hiring your boat next week . " " What , the Fawn ? " " I suppose so ; but he wants to see you , at any rate . " " Does he want me to go with her ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know . " After supper Paul went to see Mr. Morrison , and found that he wanted the Fawn for the whole of the following week , and that he did not want a skipper . He was going down to Bleakport to spend a week , and he wanted a good boat , which he could not procure at the place . He offered to pay fifteen dollars for the use of her , and to restore her in as good condition as when he took her . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not do better ; but he was not prepared to give a decided answer , and promised to see the gentleman again the next evening . On his return home he found Henry Littleton and Thomas Nettle waiting for him . The arrangements in regard to the excursion in the Flyaway had been completed , and the two boys had come to urge Paul to join them . " When do you sail ? " asked Paul . " Next Friday . " " And how long shall you be gone ? " " About eight or ten days , " replied Henry Littleton . " My father is going with us . " " I have got a good offer for the use of my boat next week , " answered Paul , musing , " and I do n't know but I will go . " " That 's right , Paul ; we must have you with us , at all events . " " Father says we ought to have you with us , " said Henry . " I will talk with my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I will go . " " We have talked with your mother already , and she is perfectly willing you should go . " " I will let you know to-morrow . " The boys left him , saying he must certainly go with them , and Paul went into the house to talk over the matter with his mother . " Do you think I can go , mother ? " " To be sure you can go , " interposed John . " What is the use of talking about it ? " " I did n't ask you John , " said Paul , with a smile . " I do n't see why you ca n't go , " replied Mrs. Duncan . " I suppose there is no more danger of your getting drowned than there would be if you stayed at home . " " He will certainly be drowned , mother , " added John . " We shall be safe enough . " " Then you had better go . " " I have got a chance to let the Fawn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I should make if I stayed . " " And if you let her , I shall go skipper . Sha n't I ? " demanded John . " I think not ; Mr. Morrison will be his own skipper . " " Then I wo n't agree to it . I am part owner of the Fawn , " said the first mate , pouting like a school-girl . " You agreed to let me manage the Fawn at the beginning , " added Paul . " You ca n't do anything with her alone , except run her on the rocks . " " I do n't want you to manage me out of her in that manner , " growled John . " I have as good a right in her as you have , and I do n't mean to stay on shore here a whole week , sucking my fingers , when there is fun to be had . " While they were discussing this important question , which even threatened a rupture in the partnership between the young fishermen , Captain Littleton was admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ? You are not quarrelling , I hope , " said Captain Littleton , as he entered the room , for he had heard a portion of one of John 's excited speeches while at the door . " O , no , sir , " replied Paul . " I have got a chance to let the Fawn for a week , and John is opposed to my doing so . " " Is he ? I am sorry for that . Mr. Morrison spoke to me about a boat for the week , and I recommended him to you . I had a motive for doing so , for I want you to join the excursion in the Flyaway . I thought you would like to go , if you could do so without any loss . " " Thank you , sir . I should like to go very much ; and when I got this chance to let the Fawn , I about made up my mind to go . " " Then it is all right ; but I am sorry John will not consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay on shore a whole week , " pouted the first mate of the Fawn . " If they would only take me as skipper , I should like it first rate . What shall I do with myself for a whole week on shore ? " " I do n't see as I can go , then , " added Paul . " Well , I do n't want to keep you from going , Paul ; " and a better feeling seemed to be roused in John 's bosom . " I ca n't afford to let the Fawn lie idle for a week , in the busy season , " continued Paul . " Ca n't I go a-fishing in her while you are gone ? " " Certainly not ; you ca n't have my share to smash up on the rocks , " said Paul , a little tartly . " You know you ran the boat on the rocks this very afternoon . " John felt a little lame here , and he did not venture a reply . He had sacrificed his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reef , and he felt that his brother 's conclusions were correct . " Well , at any rate , I wo n't keep you from going in the Flyaway , whatever I do . I will agree to let her to Mr. Morrison . " " That 's generous , John . You have got the right kind of a heart beneath your jacket , though you have an odd way of showing it sometimes , " said Captain Littleton . " John means right , sir , " added Paul . " I like to have a little fun myself , as well as the rest of the fellows , " continued John , " but I am willing to stay at home for Paul 's sake . " " That 's the right feeling , my boy , " replied Captain Littleton ; " and if your mother is willing , you may go in the Flyaway . " " Hoo-ray ! " shouted John , jumping out of his chair , and performing some gymnastic feats that astonished the visitor and the family . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no objection , if Captain Littleton thinks it is safe . " " He will be as safe as my own son , Mrs. Duncan , " added the captain . " Hoo-ray ! " shouted John again . " Come , my son , behave yourself , or they wo n't want such an unmannerly fellow in the company . " " I will be as polite as a French dancing-master . " John was in luck again , and for the following three days he talked of nothing but the cruise of the Flyaway . Even sailing in the Fawn seemed tame to the idea of going off one or two hundred miles , and visiting towns and cities he had never seen , and had never before expected to see . He could hardly sleep nights , and when he did sleep , it was only to dream of being out of sight of land , or of occupying a berth in the cabin of the yacht . Paul concluded his bargain with Mr. Morrison , and made all his preparations for an absence of a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from home before . He cleaned up the Fawn for Mr. Morrison , and split wood enough to last his mother a fortnight . It had already been decided that the yacht should go to the eastward , and visit Gloucester , the Isles of Shoals , Portsmouth , and Portland ; and to be prepared for the excursion , he carefully studied all the maps and books he could procure , which gave any information in regard to these places . The Flyaway was to sail on Friday at high water . For more than a fortnight , Captain Gordon had been training the boys of the Tenean Club to serve as " able seamen " on board the yacht . There were twelve of them , including Paul , who were to join the party . More than half of them were sixteen or seventeen years old ; so that they were strong enough to do all the work required in the management of the vessel . They were all well trained , and every one of them knew his duty on board . Besides Captain Gordon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briskett , who had for many years been the master of a coasting vessel , and knew every rock and shoal between Boston and Eastport . Dick , the colored steward , was to retain his place during the cruise . Captain Littleton was to go as a passenger . John Duncan was nominally appointed cabin boy . Friday came , and the officers and crew of the Flyaway were all on board . The anchor had been hove short , and the mainsail hoisted ; the hour for sailing had arrived , and she only waited the coming of Captain Littleton . He had gone to Boston that morning , and his return was momentarily expected . When the amateur crew had grown very impatient at his non-arrival , he appeared ; but only to inform them that he had just received a telegraphic despatch from New York , which would compel him to start for that city in the afternoon . " Now , boys , what is to be done ? " asked he . " Will you postpone the trip for a week ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the whole crew were wofully elongated . " I must give it up altogether , then , " added Paul , bitterly disappointed ; and John was ready to howl at the idea of not going . " I will see what can be done , " continued Captain Littleton , as he called Captain Gordon . For a few moments they were engaged in earnest conversation together , and the boys waited with anxious interest for the result of the conference . " Captain Gordon thinks he can take care of you , and I have concluded to let you go without me . " " Hurrah ! " shouted several of the boys . " But , boys , I must put you on honor to behave well during the cruise . Will you do it ? " " We will . " " And obey the orders of Captain Gordon in all things , whether you are on board or on shore ? " " We will , " replied all the boys at once . " Very well ; I shall trust you . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall do so . Good-by , now , and a pleasant cruise to you ; " and Captain Littleton went over the side . " Good-by , sir , " replied the crew . " That 's first rate -- is n't it ? " whispered Tom Nettle , as the captain departed . " I am glad he is n't going . " " So am I , " replied Frank Thompson . " We shall not have him watching us all the time . Let me tell you , there is fun ahead now , " added Thomas . Captain Briskett , who was to be first officer of the Flyaway , as well as pilot , summoned them to the windlass to heave up the anchor ; and in a few minutes the yacht was standing down the harbor under all sail . The Teneans gave three rousing cheers , and then distributed themselves in various parts of the deck to enjoy the exciting scene . " All hands aft , " said Captain Gordon , when the yacht had reached the open bay . " Ay , ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their places in the standing room . " Now , boys , we must make our arrangements . When a ship goes to sea , it is customary to divide the crew into two watches . I shall take the starboard watch , and Captain Briskett the larboard . Each of us will choose a man in his turn till all are taken . " " Go on , " said Captain Briskett . " Henry Littleton , " replied the skipper . " Paul Duncan , " added the pilot . And so they proceeded till all the boys were chosen , except John , who resented the slight thus put upon him . To satisfy him , therefore , he was taken into the captain 's watch . " There are only eight berths in the cabin , boys , and you must draw lots for them , " continued the master ; " but they are all wide enough to hold two each . Now , if you want to pair off , you can do so . " Lots were drawn , and Paul and Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself thrown out of the calculation ; but the captain said he would make a bed for him on a locker , and he was satisfied . The boys then went below to see their berths , which had all been numbered for the occasion . CHAPTER XVI . PAUL WITNESSES A MUTINY . When the Flyaway had passed Farm Island , and reached the fishing ground , she lay to , for the purpose of enabling the crew to catch a few cod and haddock , for the chowder and fry . But cod and haddock are singularly obstinate at times , and persistently refuse to appreciate the angler 's endeavors in their behalf . They were so on the present occasion , and it was two hours before the chief of the culinary department could say there were enough to satisfy the ravenous appetites of the sixteen persons on board . Some of the boys had actually decided that fishing was a nuisance , but they were just as fond of chowder as those who enjoyed the fun even of catching only one fish per hour . As fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the chowder pot or the frying pan . There were some queer fish caught , including quite a number of sculpins , " a wolfer eel , "  - -  so Captain Briskett called him ,  - -  and a large catfish . The latter was an ugly monster , having dangerous-looking teeth , with which he laid hold of everything that came in his way . There was also in the collection a large skate , or ray , which called forth some rather large fish stories from the two experienced skippers on board . As the culinary department was now supplied , the yacht stood away for Gloucester , which was to be her first port . They had a fine wind , and before the chowder was ready , the Flyaway was in sight of the Reef of Norman 's Woe . " Dinner is ready , " said Dick , at last , for the stomachs of the boys had been in a state of rebellion for two hours . There was a grand rush for the cabin ; but , to the astonishment of the hungry crew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not permit a single one of them to go below . " That 's not the way to do on board ship , " said he . " Are you all going below at once ? " " Why not ? " asked Tom Nettle . " Suppose we should have occasion to tack , or to take in sail in a hurry ? Have we got to wait for you to finish your plate of chowder ? " " We are all as hungry as bears , Captain Gordon , " added Frank Thompson . " We ca n't stand it any longer . " " Part of you must stand it half an hour longer . Captain Briskett has the helm , and the larboard watch will remain on deck , the starboard watch go below . " The captain 's watch tumbled down the companion way , ranged themselves round the table , and went to work as though they had not eaten anything for a month . As they are doing very well , we will return to the deck , and listen a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seated himself by the side of the helmsman , and was asking questions in regard to the reef , the depth of water in the harbor , and other questions of interest only to nautical persons . The rest of the watch had gathered in a group on the forecastle . It was unfortunate that so many of the refractory spirits had been chosen into the same watch ; but there were Tom Kettle , Frank Thompson , and Samuel Nason , all three of whom had once been expelled from the club for misconduct , and only been readmitted on their solemn promise to mend their manners , and behave like gentlemen in future . " I do n't like it , " said Tom ; " and if the rest of the fellows will back me up , I will go below and have dinner with the crowd . " " I will back you up , for one , " said Frank . " And I , for another , " added Samuel . " But Captain Gordon gave a good reason why some of us should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , he did n't . What is there to do ? We sha n't have to touch a sail this hour -- see if we do , " retorted Tom . " But we might have occasion to do so , and for one , I am willing to observe the discipline of the vessel , " said Charles Lawrence . " I do n't like the idea of having old Gordon domineering over us for a week , " added Frank . " I do n't care so much about the dinner as I do the spirit the old fellow exhibited . He placed himself before the companion way , just as though he had been the captain of a ship , and we were all common sailors . " " We will cure him of that before we have been with him many days , " added Tom . " I 'll bet we will , " answered Frank ; " and I think the present is the best time to begin . How many of you will make a grand rush into the cabin ? " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rash step . " Come on , then , " said Tom , " I will go if there is only one fellow to back me up . " " We will follow you , " added Frank . " Go ahead , Tom ! " " You had better count the cost before you go any farther , " interposed Charles Lawrence . " You know we all promised to obey Captain Gordon in everything he directed , whether on shore or on board . " " We did n't expect he was going to treat us like servants -- like dogs . " " Captain Littleton would n't let him domineer over us in that style if he were here . Come on , boys , " said Tom , as he led the way aft . " Where are you going , boys ? " demanded Captain Briskett , as the rebellious watch appeared in the standing room . " Going below to get our dinner . " " Not yet ; you must wait till the watch is relieved . You heard the captain 's orders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are not going to be treated like dogs . " " But it is necessary that one watch should be on deck all the time . " " Can you tell me why it was necessary to have the starboard watch go to dinner first ? " " I can not ; it is the captain 's business to order , and mine to obey , " replied the mate . " It is n't our business to obey any such orders as that , " said Tom . " Come , Paul , let us all go below , and have our dinner . " " I shall obey orders , " replied Paul , decidedly . " On deck , there ! What 's the matter ? " called Captain Gordon , from the cabin . " There is a mutiny in the larboard watch , " replied the mate , with a smile . Tom and Frank did not wait for any more explanations , and began to descend the ladder into the cabin . " Stop , boys ! what does this mean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means that we are going to have our dinners ; that is all , " replied Tom , who had by this time reached the cabin floor . " But my orders were , that the larboard watch should remain on deck . " " We do n't care for that . " " You do n't , eh ? " And Captain Gordon was evidently very much surprised , for whatever he had expected , he certainly had not anticipated a mutiny the first day out . " Was n't my order a reasonable one ? " he continued . " No , sir ! It was not . " " It is necessary that one watch should be on deck while the vessel is under sail . " " That may be ; but it was n't necessary that your watch should go to dinner first , " replied Tom . " Will you return to your duty , or not ? " " No , sir ! " " You had better consider well what you are doing , Tom , before you go any farther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressly directed me to do everything I have done , so far ; and especially to keep one watch on deck all the time , while we are under sail . Now , those of you who are willing to return to your duty and obey orders , as you promised Captain Littleton , go on deck again . " Not one of the four boys accepted this polite invitation . " Then I am to settle this question with these four , " added the captain . " There 's no settling about it ; we are going to have our dinner ; that 's all , " said Tom , pushing forward towards the table ; but Captain Gordon placed himself before him , and prevented his farther progress . " I have asked you to return to your duty ; now I order you to do so ; and I am going to be obeyed , even if there are some broken heads to bind up afterwards , " replied the captain . " Briskett , let Paul take the helm and come below . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face flushed with anger . But instead of standing back , Captain Gordon seized him by the collar and threw him down . This was the signal for Frank to step in , and do battle for his friend . He was a stout fellow , and there was , for a moment , a prospect of a smart little battle but the brawny pilot suddenly destroyed this prospect by laying both hands on the second mutineer , and dragging him on deck . Captain Gordon followed him with Tom , the two other refractory spirits not deeming it prudent to keep the promises they had made on deck only a few moments before . Captain Gordon tied Tom 's hands behind him , and Frank was presently reduced to the same ignominious condition . The other two were ordered to take their places by the side of the prisoners , and they deemed it prudent to obey . " All hands on deck ! " shouted the captain , as he took the helm from Paul . " Ready to go about ! " All the boys wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were promptly obeyed , and they took their stations as they had been instructed to do when the yacht was to go about . In a few moments the Flyaway , which had by this time passed the reef , and was standing up the harbor , was put about , and headed towards the open sea . No one ventured to ask any questions ; but as soon as the mate had been restored to the helm , he fastened the prisoners to the rail , and gave the starboard watch orders to finish their dinners , and led the way to the cabin . " He will have to pay dearly for this , " growled Tom , when the captain had gone below . " My father is half owner of the Flyaway , and if he does n't get turned off , it wo n't be his fault . " But Frank did not make any reply . His father did not own half the yacht , and he began to think he had " barked up the wrong tree , " as he afterwards expressed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and could n't understand why the yacht had been put about , and headed towards home . It was rather ominous , and he wished himself out of the scrape , or rather that he had not embarked in such a stupid enterprise . Captain Gordon finished his dinner in silence , and as his brow looked as stormy as a thundercloud , not one of the boys in his watch cared to question him in regard to his future course . When the starboard watch had finished their dinner , they went on deck ; and the captain ordered Dick to carry some of the chowder up for the rebellious portion of the other watch , while the mate , and those of his party who " stuck by the ship , " went below . When dinner was over , and all hands had returned to the deck , Captain Gordon announced his intention to return to Bayville at once . " We have n't been gone a week yet , " said Henry Littleton . " Your father told me , if any serious difficulty occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows have chosen to disobey orders the first day out ; and I think that is a serious matter . " " Do you hear that , Tom ? " said Frank , in a whisper , to his fellow-prisoner . " I do n't care ; the sooner he goes home the sooner will he be discharged . " " But we shall lose all our fun , any way . " " Ca n't help it ; I wo n't be treated like a servant by my father 's servant , " replied Tom , loud enough to be heard by the captain . " Your father can do what he thinks best when I get home , but while I command a vessel all hands obey orders . " " Come , Tom , do n't let us spoil all the fun . We will pay him off at another time . Do n't let us break up the cruise , " whispered Frank . " He 's got us where the hair is short , and we ca n't help ourselves . " Tom at first refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party elegantly expressed it ; but Frank 's suggestion to pay him off at another time at last prevailed with him , and he consented to join with his companions in trouble in an apology to Captain Gordon , and a promise to obey orders without grumbling in future . Frank therefore made overtures for a capitulation ; but the captain at first declined to listen to them , and it was only upon the urgent request of the rest of the party that he finally consented to pardon the offenders and continue the cruise . It was only because he did not like to punish the innocent with the guilty , he declared , that he reversed his former decision ; but if any further difficulty occurred , they would know what to expect . CHAPTER XVII . PAUL DISCOVERS THAT MISCHIEF IS BREWING . It was with more than the usual alacrity that the crew flew to their stations when the order was given to come about , and the Flyaway was soon retracing her course towards Gloucester . It was about sunset when this step was taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman 's Reef . She would have made a quick run of this distance , but the wind had all died out , and there was a perfect calm upon the sea . There was but little prospect of their getting to Gloucester that night , and they were too far out to anchor . Before dark the captain had some misgivings as to the propriety of his course in continuing the cruise , for Tom and his companions seemed to be sulky , and he had several times observed them in close communication on the forecastle . But he felt perfectly competent to manage them , however refractory they might prove to be ; yet he feared their misconduct would destroy all the pleasure of the trip . He resolved to treat them as well as though nothing had happened , but at the same time to keep a sharp lookout upon them . " All hands aft , " called Captain Gordon ; and the crew , including the mutineers , promptly obeyed the summons . " Boys , " he continued , when they had all assembled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip , at the suggestion of Captain Littleton , who would have carried out the plan if he had come with us ,  - -  I propose to instruct you a little in the practical duties of seamanship to give you something to think about , while we are idling around the decks . You see that bell , over the windlass ? " " Ay , ay , sir . " " That 's a very important thing on board a ship , for by it is regulated everything that takes place , especially the watches . As we are likely to be out to-night , or at least a part of the night , I intend to keep a regular watch on board , just as they do in any well-regulated vessel . Indeed , it is absolutely necessary to do so . We ca n't all turn in and sleep while the vessel is on her course ; some of us must be on deck all the time . Therefore we had better have things done up in shipshape order . " " That is just what we want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the crew . " Very well , " continued the captain , consulting his watch ; " it wants a few minutes of eight o'clock , at which time we will strike eight bells , and set the watch . " " Which watch , captain ? " asked Tom Nettle , in rather surly tones . " There is a rule about this matter , my lad , as there is about everything aboard ship . I shall follow this rule , " replied Captain Gordon , without even looking at the speaker . " What is the rule ? " asked Henry , rather because he wished to turn the captain 's attention away from Tom , than because he was impatient to know the rule . " The captain 's watch , which is the second mate 's in ships , takes the first , and the first officer 's the second , on the outward voyage ; on the homeward voyage the order is reversed . The starboard watch is the captain 's ; therefore it is my first watch to-night . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on deck , and remain till four ; then the starboard again till eight . " " That is n't fair , " said Edward Freeman . " Why not , my boy ? " asked the captain , with a smile ; for he readily perceived the objection the speaker was about to urge . " The starboard watch will be on deck eight hours of the night , while the other watch will be up only four hours . " " Just so , my lad ; but to-morrow night the order of the watches will be reversed . Give me your attention for a moment , and I will explain the matter . Continuing from the point where I left off , the starboard watch will be on duty from eight to twelve ; the larboard from twelve to four ; when the starboard will come on deck ; but --  --  " " That will bring things just as they were the preceding night , and the starboard watch will be on duty eight hours , as before , " interrupted Edward , thinking he had caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watch from four to eight in the afternoon is divided into two , called the dog-watches . " " That makes it all right . " At this moment , Captain Briskett , who had gone forward for the purpose , struck the bell eight times . " Eight bells ! All the starboard watch , ahoy ! " shouted Captain Gordon . " All the rest of you had better go below and turn in ; while you sleep , pay attention to it , for when we call you , we shall want you . " The mate and his watch all went below ; but , though they took to their berths , the excitement of the occasion was too great to permit them to sleep . There was a great deal of " skylarking " done in the cabin , as well as on deck , during the next hour , but one by one the boys below dropped asleep , and those on deck were soon tired of play , and called upon Captain Gordon to " spin a yarn . " He was good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck soon came to the conclusion that " sailoring " was not particularly funny at night , for there was a good deal of gaping , and not a little impatience for the eight bells that would relieve them for a while . At six bells there was a prospect of a little wind , and the yacht began to ripple through the water . The wind increased steadily till they had quite a lively breeze . " All the larboard watch , ahoy ! " shouted the captain down the companionway , at eight bells . " Ay , ay , " replied Briskett . But it was no easy task to rouse the sleepers , and even when they were awoke , some of them declared they were not going on deck again that night . They concluded , however , after the experience of the first day , that it would be better to fall in with the discipline of the vessel . They found the Flyaway making good progress through the water , which in some measure waked them up , and reconciled them to their situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gloucester harbor , and the watch were permitted to go below . A lantern was hoisted on the forestay , and all hands were soon asleep . Our limited space does not permit us to transfer the log of the Flyaway to our pages , and we must hasten on to more exciting events than the ordinary working of the vessel . The party spent the forenoon at Gloucester , and after dinner made sail for Portsmouth , arriving there at about nine o'clock in the evening ; or rather at the mouth of the river , for they anchored off Kittery Point . On Monday morning , the Tenean , which lay upon deck , was put into the water , and the club pulled up to the city . While they were absent , the wind veered round to the northeast , and there were some signs of a storm . It had been the intention of Captain Gordon to run over to the Isles of Shoals in the afternoon , but the weather was so inauspicious that he declined to carry out his purpose . The club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fishing , and in visiting the objects of interest on shore , including , of course , the Pepperell monument . Unfortunately , Tuesday proved to be no better day than Monday ; and in addition to the prospect of a storm , there was a dense fog outside the harbor . As Captain Gordon had been particularly cautioned to incur no needless risks , he positively refused to leave the harbor , though the boys had teased him from sunrise to do so . Even Henry and Paul were vexed at the delay . They had thoroughly exhausted Portsmouth , Kittery Point , and the Navy Yard ; had visited Fort Constitution , Fort McClary , and the Lighthouse ; in fact , there was not a single point of interest left to be visited . All the forenoon the boys did not intermit their persuasions to induce the captain to proceed on the cruise ; but he was as firm as a rock , and declared that , if they all went down on their knees before him , he would not " budge an inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importunities of his crew , announced his intention to walk up to Portsmouth , and called for volunteers to accompany him . Captain Briskett , Henry , and Edward were all that were disposed to go with him , and he departed , leaving the rest of the crew to amuse themselves in the best way they could . Hardly had they disappeared behind the hill on shore , before Paul noticed that Tom Nettle and the other mutineers on the first day out were gathered in a group around the heel of the bowsprit . They were engaged in earnest conversation , but in tones so low that he could not understand them . Presently Tom called one of the boys who were fishing over the port rail , and then another , and another , till all on board but himself had been admitted to the conference . Even John Duncan was permitted to share the confidence of the party . Paul at once came to the conclusion that they were plotting mischief ; but he could form no idea of the nature of the plot -- whether it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden fort that frowned upon them from the heights above . He was sorry to see John permitted to enter this conclave of mischief ; but because his brother apparently acquiesced in the plan , he hoped that no serious roguery was intended . The details of the mysterious scheme seemed to have been all arranged , for presently the boys separated into groups ; but Paul heard Tom say the tide would begin to run out in half an hour . What this meant he could not possibly imagine , unless the boys intended to run away in the Tenean , and wanted the ebb tide to help them out of the river . " John , " said Paul , when the conspirators separated . " Well , what do you want , Paul ? " demanded John , in rather surly tones , as he joined his brother . " There is mischief brewing there , and I warn you not to engage in it . " " Mischief ? " queried John . " What do you mean by mischief ? " " Do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " These boys are getting up some trick ; do n't you have anything to do with it . " John made no reply . " What is the game ? " asked Paul . " Ca n't tell . " " Ca n't you indeed ? " " No , I ca n't . " " You know we all promised to obey Captain Gordon . " " I am not going to disobey him . " " If there is anything wrong going on , it is your duty to tell of it . " " O , you ca n't pump me ; so it 's no use to try , " replied John , walking away , and joining the principal conspirators in the forecastle . " But what are you going to do with Paul ? " were the first words that saluted his ears , as John joined them . " I do n't know . What can we do with him ? " said Tom , to whom the question of the previous speaker had been addressed . " Of course Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; you might as well attempt to capture Fort Constitution as to make him join us . " " Are you sure we ca n't bring him over ? " " Do n't say a word to him about it , or he will prevent us from going . " " He ca n't do that . " " He would find a way ; he might jump overboard , and swim to one of these vessels and get assistance . " " But we want Paul ; and if we keep him on board , he will join us after a few hours . " " You must n't hurt him any way , " interposed John ; " if you are going to do anything of that sort , I shall let the cat out of the bag . " " We wo n't hurt him , " replied Tom . " I 'll tell you what we will do . We will get him to go down into the cabin under some pretence , and then fasten him down , " said Frank . " That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board too ; what shall we do with him ? " " Fasten them both down below . " Paul , from the frequent glances bestowed upon him by the plotters , was satisfied that he was the subject of their remarks ; but this did not disturb him , for , firm in his purpose to do right , whatever might happen to him in consequence , he was prepared for any event which the conspirators might bring to pass . He was sorry to find that mischief was brewing at all , and pained to see his brother a consenting party to it . CHAPTER XVIII . PAUL IS MADE A PRISONER . Before the half hour which the conspirators had indicated as the favorable time for carrying out their mysterious project had elapsed , Tom Nettle and Frank Thompson went below to prepare the way for the execution of their scheme . In the cook room , which occupied the fore part of the hold of the yacht , Dick was busily engaged in scraping potatoes . This seemed to be the favorite occupation of the steward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals in this employment ; and fried potatoes was the standard dish for breakfast , dinner , and supper . " I 'm glad you come down , Tom ; I want to use you a few moments , " said Dick , as the two boys entered the cook room . " Well , what do you want , Dick ? " " I want you to help me move the stove ; the pipe is loose ; and if you will just hold it while I slide the stove back two or three inches , it will make it all right . Just hold the pipe up while I push the stove back . " " I have just cleaned up , Dick , " replied Tom , who never hesitated at a white lie , and not often at a black one . " Paul is on deck , and in just the trim to do a job of that kind . " " No matter , then ; I will call him , " replied Dick ; and the two boys presently returned to the deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't say a word , and Dick will call him down in a minute . " But the steward seemed to forget that he intended to make a change in the position of the stove , for he did not call Paul , as the conspirators were anxiously waiting for him to do . The tide had turned , and there was no obstacle in their way except the presence on deck of him to whom they had not dared to breathe a word of moral treason . " Paul , " said Tom , at last , when his patience was completely exhausted , " Dick wants to see you down below . " In order to make the request seem like one just made , he had lain down upon the fore hatch , which opened into the apartment where the steward was at work , thus seeming to be in communication with him . " What does he want ? " asked Paul , unconscious of the trick which was about to be played off upon him , and rather pleased than otherwise at the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He wants you to help him move the stove . " " Never mind it now , Paul , " interposed the steward from below ; " any time before I make the fire to get supper will do . " " I will go now ; I have nothing else to do , " replied Paul , as he descended the companion ladder . " Now is our time ! " exclaimed Tom . " You look out for the fore hatch , and I will take care of the companion way . " " Ay , ay , Tom , and be quick about it . " At a signal from the chief conspirator , the slide was drawn and the fore hatchway covered up , thus making Paul and the steward prisoners below . " What does that mean ? " said Paul . " I do n't know ; some mischief , I suppose , " replied Dick . " They are playing off a trick upon us . " " We are prisoners , anyhow , " continued Paul , glancing at the closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind them at all , and they will soon get sick of the fun . " " But what are they about ? " added Paul , as he heard the creak of the windlass on deck . " I 'm afraid they are up to some serious mischief . " " Ca n't help it ; ' tai n't my fault , and I never meddle with what do n't concern me . All I got to do is to cook the victuals , and take care of the cabin . " Dick was utterly indifferent in regard to the conspirators , and went on scraping his potatoes , as though nothing unusual was in progress . As long as they had not carried off his cooking stove , or separated him from the ice chest , he was perfectly contented , and undoubtedly would call all hands to supper at the proper time , precisely as though everything was proceeding in a proper and regular manner on board the Flyaway . Dick prided himself upon minding his own business ; and if the yacht had been seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have proceeded with their accustomed order and promptness . It was not so with Paul ; for the creaking of the windlass , and the activity that seemed to be manifested on deck , had already suggested to him a suspicion in regard to the purpose of the crew . He was not long left in doubt , for the sounds from above soon indicated that a portion of the conspirators were hoisting the mainsail . But he found it very difficult to accept the conclusion that these indications forced upon him . The boys on deck were certainly getting the yacht in readiness to sail ; yet it seemed scarcely credible to him that they intended to run away with her . A scheme so bold and wicked passed his comprehension , and he was not prepared to believe that even Tom and Frank had the hardihood to carry it out . But the evidences were fast increasing ; he heard the voice of Tom Nettle , as he stood at the helm , issuing his orders with as much assurance as though he had been regularly placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawse-hole , and the jib rattling up the stay . He could no longer cherish a hope that their purpose was less criminal than he had feared . He almost cried with sorrow and vexation when he considered that his brother John was one of the mutineers . " They are running away with the yacht , " said he to his fellow-prisoner . " That 's none of my business , " replied Dick , with his accustomed stoicism . " All I got to say is , that supper will be ready at six o'clock ; because why -- that 's the time Captain Gordon told me to have supper . " " But do you mean to let them run away with the yacht ? " " Do n't see that I can help myself ; " and the steward suspended his labors for a moment , glancing at Paul as though he had a vague suspicion that he might be in some degree responsible for his inactivity . " I think we have a duty to perform , " continued Paul . " What can we do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her back to her anchorage . " " But we ca n't do that . We are prisoners here ; can you break through that hatchway ? " " Then you are willing to do something ? " " Certainly I am , " replied Dick . " If you can tell me what to do , I will do it . " Paul seated himself by the side of the steward , and proposed to him that , at a suitable time , they should make an effort to recover the yacht , and return her to her lawful commander . Dick consented , but he was afraid they would have no opportunity to put the plan in execution , for they could hardly overcome the eleven mutineers . Yet each pledged himself to the other to do whatever could be done ; but it was agreed that they should not attempt anything without a reasonable prospect of success . There was a stiff breeze from the northeast , and the prisoners saw the yacht lying over upon her side , which gave some indication of the rate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how dense was the fog outside , and they had some fears that her reckless managers would run her upon the rocks , which was not a pleasant prospect to them , confined as they were in the cabin . An hour by the clock had elapsed since the yacht got under way , and it was evident from her motion that she was laboring through a heavy sea . Paul had begun to be uneasy , for he had very little confidence in the seamanship of Tom Nettle , who , he judged , was the new master of the Flyaway , and he was in momentary expectation that she would strike upon a rock , and the cabin be filled with water . When the yacht first got under way there had been a great deal of confusion on deck . Frank had rebelled at the authority of Tom , and claimed the right to command ; but this dispute had been settled , and new causes of difficulty had appeared every moment . But now the conspirators were very quiet , and Paul perceived that they had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear their low and earnest tones , as they consulted together in the standing room . More than once he had heard his own name mentioned , but he could not hear enough of the conversation to determine what they intended to do with him . We will leave Paul and his fellow-prisoner below for a time , and notice the condition of things on deck . The weather was decidedly threatening . The wind was increasing in violence , and there was a heavy sea . In short there was every indication of a regular northeaster . Tom Nettle had the helm , but his face no longer wore the confident assurance which had given him the victory over his rival in the contest for the command , and which had strengthened the doubting hearts of his more timid followers . His eye was restless , and his movements uneasy . He was not a stupid boy -- only a reckless one ; and he could not help seeing that he was leading those who had trusted in him into hardship and perils which neither party had foreseen . The Flyaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainsail , and was completely enveloped in the dense fog that covered the ocean . Her bowsprit was slapping the waves , and the spray sweeping the entire length of the deck . Frank Thompson was lying out upon the bowsprit , wet to the skin , peering through the fog to give timely notice of breakers , or of any vessel which might lie in the path of the yacht . The rest of the crew were seated in the standing room , most of them engaged in watching the anxious face of Tom Nettle , whose boasted seamanship was now put to the severest test . The Flyaway dashed on , and the faces of the rebel crew became more and more anxious every moment . Another hour elapsed , and the wind continued to freshen , and the sea to rise . Dense volumes of fog rolled by the vessel , and the mutineers were all wet to the skin . John Duncan was the only one who seemed to enjoy the scene , and it was evident at times that even he had some painful misgivings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-lee ! " shouted Frank , suddenly jumping down from the bowsprit , and making the most violent gestures . Tom , startled and confused by the frantic movements of Frank , unfortunately put the helm the wrong way ; and the yacht , getting the wind more a-beam , plunged deeper than ever into the huge waves . " The other way , you confounded fool ! " roared Frank , as he let go of the jib sheet . The bewildered helmsman obeyed this order ; but the movement had been so long delayed that the whole crew could hear the roar of the breakers ahead of the yacht . With the assistance of his companions Tom put the helm hard-a-lee , and the Flyaway came up into the wind . But Frank had made a greater blunder , if possible , than the confused skipper ; for when he had cast off the jib sheet , long before he should have done so , the sail had blown out as far as it could , carrying the end of the sheet with it . My young and non-nautical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a rope . The jib-sheet is the rope attached to the lower part of the sail , by which it is hauled in or let out , as occasion may require . On the Flyaway this rope ran through a double block , or tackle . The sail was now slapping and banging in the fresh wind , so that Frank could not get hold of it ; for the heavy block threatened to knock his brains out , as it thrashed in every direction . In consequence of this blunder , when the yacht came up into the wind , and there was no jib to help her round , she fell off , lost her headway , and drifted helplessly towards the rocks . Tom was appalled at the danger that menaced them , and gave all sorts of orders ; but none of them were heeded by the panic-stricken crew . " Draw the slide , and call up Paul , " gasped the disheartened skipper ; and his order was understood and instantly obeyed . CHAPTER XIX . PAUL TAKES COMMAND OF THE FLYAWAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried Tom , as the prisoners rushed up the ladder . " You take the helm , Dick . " " Me ! " exclaimed the steward . " I do n't know no more about handling a vessel than I do about making a watch . Paul must help you . " " Forgive me , Paul , for shutting you up down there , and get us out of this scrape if you can . " At this moment the keel of the Flyaway grazed upon a rock , and then bumped heavily as she sank down with the sea . " We are lost ! We shall all be drowned ! " exclaimed Frank Thompson . Paul 's quick eye instantly measured the peril that menaced the Flyaway , and though she continued to thump and grind on the rocks at the bottom , he did not lose all hope of saving her . The first thing was to secure the jib sheet . Seizing the guy rope which was used to haul out the main boom , he ordered all hands forward . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , with a dexterous throw , he succeeded in fastening to the block . The sail was then hauled down , and the truant sheet effectually secured . The coast line , upon which they were in danger of being dashed to pieces , extended northeast and southwest , and the yacht was still some twenty rods distant from the breakers . Paul ordered the jib to be hauled hard up on the weather side , which caused the vessel 's head to swing round with the wind ; then , as the sheet was eased off , she slid over the rock , and for a moment ran down parallel with the coast , and before the wind . When this manoeuvre had been successfully accomplished , Paul ran to the helm , and giving the necessary orders , the Flyaway was soon braced sharp up , and standing away from the breakers . " Three cheers for Paul Duncan ! " shouted Tom Nettle , when he realized that they had escaped the terrible fate which a moment before had hung over them . " One ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , sharply . " Try the pump , and see whether she leaks any . " The cheers were not given in the face of this sharp rebuke , and Tom hastened to obey the order which Paul had just issued . The examination revealed the gratifying fact that the Flyaway was still sound , and made no water . She had only bumped a few times in deep water with the action of the waves . " You can take the helm again , Tom , " said Paul , when the survey was completed . " If you wish to make me a prisoner again , I will go below . " " I do not , " replied Tom . " I am not one of your number , but I should like to ask what you intend to do ? " " We calculated to go to Portland , " replied the chief of the conspiracy . " To Portland ? " " That is what we intended . " " That is not what you told us , " said one of the boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and return before Captain Gordon got back . " " That was only to get your consent to the plan , you spoonies , " said Frank . " You are smart sailors , I must confess , " replied Paul , with a sneer . " It was easy enough to get out of the harbor , but not so easy to get back again . " " We depended upon you , " said Tom . " Did you , indeed ? Do you expect me to join in such a miserable scrape as this ? " " We will do just what you say now . " " Will you ? You are very kind . After you have got into a difficulty you ca n't get out of you want me to join the company . You expect me to pilot you down to Portland -- do n't you ? " " We will obey your orders , Paul ; go anywhere you please , " said Frank . " That is a great deal easier said than done . What can I do , what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew everything , Tom , better than Captain Gordon . I hope you have got enough of it . " " Captain Gordon was right , " replied Tom ; and this sentiment was responded to by all the mutineers . " I 'm glad you have come to your senses , even at the eleventh hour , " continued Paul ; who , finding the conspirators were all upon the stool of repentance , was disposed to treat them a great deal better than they deserved . " I shall not go to Portland , or attempt to go there , for I do not consider myself competent to pilot a vessel in these waters , " said he . " I shall take the Flyaway back to Portsmouth harbor as soon as I can get there . " " Wherever you say , Paul , we will go , " answered Tom . It was no easy matter to run back to the harbor they had left in the dense fog that then prevailed , and Paul was sorely tried to determine what course he should take . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Briskett , he had obtained a tolerable idea of the coast and of the dangerous ledges and islands in the vicinity . This knowledge , however , was of little use to him while the fog lasted . He had no doubt that the island upon which the mutineers had so nearly wrecked the Flyaway was Boon Island , or one of the Isles of Shoals . The yacht was now headed east by north by the compass , and a few hours upon this course would bring them to the coast of Maine . " Two of you go forward , and keep a sharp lookout ahead , " said Paul . " Tom , you will take the helm , while I go below and look on the chart . " " Ay , ay , " replied Tom , reassured by the coolness and self-possession of the newly-appointed skipper . " I would give a good deal to be out of this scrape , " continued Paul . " So would I , " frankly added Tom . " I was a fool to think I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose will become of us ? " " I ca n't form any idea , " answered Paul , as he descended the ladder . He found that the closet which contained the chart was locked ; but he felt that the circumstances in which he was placed fully justified him in forcing open the door , and he lost no time in doing so . With the chart in his hand he returned to the deck . After questioning Tom in regard to the course he had sailed since leaving Kittery Point , he came to the conclusion that the land astern of them was one of the Isles of Shoals , for they never could have made Boon Island without tacking . But he could not see how , with the wind northeast , and the yacht close-hauled , she had brought up on the Isles of Shoals . Tom helped him solve this difficulty by declaring that he had not been very particular in keeping her close up to the wind . Having satisfied himself on this point , the youthful skipper proceeded to decide upon his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was in danger of running upon Boon Island . The night was coming on and it promised to be a night of peril . There were only two methods open to the young navigator . He must either attempt to make Portsmouth harbor again , or stand out to sea . In the dense fog , it would be extremely perilous for him to try to find the port from which they had sailed ; and on the other hand , it seemed scarcely less perilous to go to sea with the prospect of a gale before him . It was an anxious moment for poor Paul , for he felt that the safety of the yacht and of his misguided companions were in his keeping , and before God he felt responsible for them . He tried to hold a consultation with Tom and some of the larger boys , but they were utterly incapable of giving him any advice . They were completely bewildered , and looked up to Paul as children to a father , in the midst of the dangers into which they had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain was full , as he thought of his mother and his friends at home . He felt his own weakness , his own ignorance , and , stealing away from his companions he went below , and , on his bended knee , looked to Heaven for that strength and that knowledge which Heaven alone can give in the hour of peril . He prayed for himself , for his brother , and for all his companions ; but especially did he ask God to give him wisdom to guide the frail bark through the perils that environed her . The prayer gave him resolution , and , as though his earnest supplication had been heard , he felt competent to decide between the two courses which alone were left open to him . The shore was studded with dangers ; and the broad ocean , though lashed into fury by the increasing tempest , was preferable to a lee shore . The Flyaway was a stiff sea-boat , and if well-managed , would ride out any gale that would be likely to come upon them at this season of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , he ordered all hands to stand by the jib sheet while he took the helm himself . His directions were so skilfully given , and so well obeyed , that the Flyaway came about as handsomely as though Captain Gordon himself had controlled the manoeuvre . Her course was laid exactly east , and the compass was placed in a convenient position for use . Dick now summoned the crew to supper . Several of them looked at Paul , but no one ventured to leave the post of duty till explicit orders had been given to that effect . Half the boys were permitted to " pipe to supper , " while the other half were to remain on duty . After the meal was disposed of , Paul gave the helm to Tom , and went forward to make his arrangement for the night . The foresail was reefed in readiness for use in case it should blow too hard for the vessel to carry the jib and mainsail ; the fore hatch was carefully secured to guard against the peril of " shipping a sea ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . On his return to the standing room , Paul found that Tom could not steer by compass , and he was obliged to take the helm himself . Among the appointments of the Fawn , there was a compass ; and Paul , more for the purpose of familiarizing himself with its use than from any necessity had often steered by it . The knowledge which the youthful mariner had thus gained was now invaluable to him , and he was thankful that he had obtained it . A long and tedious night was before him , even though the perils of a gale should not be added to his present trials . The steward , at his request , brought him up an oil-cloth coat belonging to Captain Gordon , and thus protected from the penetrating mist , he gave himself up to the long and anxious watch before him . Darkness came down upon them , and the Flyaway still rolled and pitched in the heavy head-sea . The wind did not sensibly increase , and Paul dared to hope that the gale would not break upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go below and turn in , assuring them they would be called at one o'clock . The order was obeyed , but not one of the boys could sleep until nearly half of their watch below had expired . Hour after hour Paul kept his position at the helm , till the clock in the cabin indicated midnight . The watch on deck had taken turns at the lookout on the bowsprit . No event had occurred to disturb the monotony of the scene , except that they narrowly escaped being run down by a large schooner . The fog had begun to dissipate , and by one o'clock they had passed entirely out of it ; but the wind had increased in violence , and at this time it blew a fresh gale . All hands were called up , and after an hour of hard labor , the jib and mainsail were taken in , and the reefed foresail set . Now , though the wind blew a gale , the Flyaway behaved so well that Paul ventured to send the watch which had served from nine o'clock below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to the eastward , the clouds began to disperse , the wind suddenly abated , till it became almost a calm , and there was every appearance of fair weather . At this time Paul put the Flyaway about , and laid her course due west . CHAPTER XX . PAUL EXERCISES A STRONG MORAL INFLUENCE . At sunrise the sky was clear , and there was not a particle of fog to be seen in any direction ; but the wind had all died out , and there was a perfect calm upon the ocean . The yacht was out of sight of land , and Paul judged that she was from eighty to a hundred miles to the eastward of the Isles of Shoals . There was not a sail to be seen , and the crew were awed by the feeling that they were alone upon the ocean . Perhaps not one of them had ever been out of sight of land before , and many of them had serious doubts whether they should ever see the shore again . After the Flyaway had rolled and pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a breeze sprang up from the southwest . The bonnet was rove on the jib , and the yacht began to dash merrily over the waves . Paul ate his breakfast , and remained on deck till nine o'clock , though he was almost exhausted by the fatigue and incessant watching of the previous night ; but he had trained Tom and Frank so that they could steer by compass , and at the suggestion of the former , he went below to obtain the sleep he so much needed . As the wind continued to blow steadily from the southwest , the yacht held her course , and the young commander was permitted to sleep till two o'clock in the afternoon , when , much refreshed , he again appeared on deck . Land was in sight over the weather bow , and the boys were in excellent spirits -- or rather would have been , if the record of their misconduct could have been obliterated . Frank and Tom had recovered their wonted cheerfulness , and when they sighted the land , had begun to think of the probable consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was clear enough that Captain Gordon would immediately return home , when he recovered possession of the yacht . The cruise was , therefore , about up , if they returned to the port from which they had sailed ; and strange as it may seem , Frank was actually trying to persuade his companions to run for Portland . They had all enjoyed their sail during the day , and been pleased with the novelty of their situation . It was not pleasant for them to think of the frowns of Captain Gordon , and of being compelled to sail at once for home . A majority of them would have been in favor of continuing the cruise , if that oppressive sense of having done wrong had not operated against the scheme . But the most the adventurous leader -- brave and skilful now that it was fine weather and plain sailing -- could accomplish , was to induce the others to consent if Paul would agree to the plan . " Of course he wo n't agree , " replied Frank , pettishly . " There are enough of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had your own way yesterday , and we came within one of being wrecked , " said one of them . " That was n't my fault , " growled Frank . " Whose fault was it , then ? " demanded Tom . " Yours , of course ; did n't you put the helm the wrong way when I told you to put it hard-a-lee ? " " And you let go the jib sheet long before you ought to have done so . That 's what made all the trouble . If it had n't been for Paul , some of us would not have been here to talk about it now . " " You are a spunky fellow , Tom , " sneered Frank . " So are you , when there is no danger near . " " How many fellows will go to Portland ? " asked Frank , desperately . There was no response , and the conversation was here interrupted by the appearance of Paul . There were enough of them who would gladly have seen the bow of the Flyaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the influence of Paul was so powerful that no one but Frank would consent to take the command from him . " What land is that ? " asked Tom , as the skipper joined the group in the standing room . " The Isles of Shoals . Keep her away a couple of points , Frank , " replied Paul . " I shall keep her as I think best , " answered Frank , gruffly ; for he was smarting under the disappointment he had just experienced . " Are you going to run her on the island ? " said Paul , astonished at the rude answer he had received . " I do n't know as it is any more your business than mine where I run her . " " What is the matter , Frank ? What ails you ? What makes you so ill-natured ? I hope I have n't done anything to give you reason for any ill feeling . " " He wants us to go to Portland , " said one of the crew . " I thought you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added Paul , with a smile . " I 'm not going back to be snubbed by old Gordon ; and the rest of the fellows would n't , if they had any spunk at all . Come , Tom , let 's keep her away for Portland . " " I will not , " replied Tom , decidedly ; " at least , I will not unless Paul thinks we had better go there . " " I do not think so , " interposed Paul . " You have done wrong , and all of you had better get in the right path as soon as possible . " " I am willing , " said Tom . " So am I , " replied half a dozen others . " The fact is , fellows , " continued Tom , very earnestly , " I have had a lesson which will last me as long as I live . This is the meanest scrape I was ever concerned in , and when I get out of it I will try to do better . You need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done , and I confess that I am heartily sorry for it . I did more thinking last night than I ever did in seven years before . " " Humph ! " sneered Frank . " I do n't care what you say , Frank ; if it is in my power to reform my life , I mean to do it . " Tom continued his remarks in quite an eloquent strain , declaring that , in the perils of the stormy night through which they had passed , he had thought of all the wrong he had ever done , and resolved to be a better boy . Above all things , he said , he had learned the necessity of obedience ; and that because he had refused to obey Captain Gordon , he had been glad to obey the orders of Paul Duncan , a boy like himself . " That schooner is bearing down upon us , " said Samuel Nason , pointing to a vessel over the weather quarter . The stranger was evidently a fisherman , and had now approached within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had come near enough to enable the boys to distinguish the persons of those on board of her . " Captain Littleton ! " exclaimed Tom , who was the first to recognize him . " Ease off the jib sheet ! " shouted Frank , as he cast off the main sheet himself , and put the helm up , so as to carry the yacht away from the schooner . " What are you doing ? " demanded Paul . " Do you think I am going to throw myself into the hands of Captain Littleton and old Gordon ? I 'll bet I ai n't , " replied Frank . " What are you going to do ? " asked Tom . " Get out of his way , of course ; the Flyaway can outsail that craft , and we may as well have our cruise out as be snubbed by any of ' em . Ease off that jib sheet , I say . Come , Tom , show your spunk . " " I will , but in a little different way from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and attempting to restore the yacht to her former course . " No , you do n't , " growled Frank , dealing him a heavy blow , which Tom promptly returned ; and then commenced a struggle between them for the possession of the tiller . Frank was the largest and strongest boy on board , and for a moment the victory leaned to his side . Paul , who had seconded Tom 's movement by hauling in the main sheet , now rushed to the conflict , assisted by several of the larger boys . After a severe engagement , Frank was knocked down , and held till his hands and feet were tied . This turbulent spirit thus secured , Paul took the helm , and the yacht was brought to her course again . By this time the schooner had lowered her boat from the stern davits , and Captain Littleton and his companions were pulling towards the Flyaway . " What does this mean ? " demanded the captain , sternly , as he leaped over the rail . " Paul , " he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am astonished to see you here . " The boys hung their heads with shame , and Paul preferred to let some other person vindicate him from the implied charge . " Will you explain this , Paul ? " said Captain Littleton . " If it had been my own son , I could not have been more surprised . " " Paul is innocent , sir , " interposed Tom , stepping forward . " Frank Thompson and myself are the guilty ones . He and I got up the scrape ; we fastened Paul and Dick in the cabin , and deceived the rest of the fellows . We kept Paul a prisoner till we had nearly wrecked the Flyaway , and then we called him up , and he saved the yacht and all our lives . " " That sounds like a true story , Tom , and I am glad to find you have the manliness to acknowledge your guilt . Paul , your hand ; I have been grieving over you all day , and now I am rejoiced to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have hitherto borne . " Paul gave the captain his hand , and thanked him for the kind words he had spoken . " What was the quarrel I witnessed just before I came on board ? " asked Captain Littleton . " Frank Thompson wanted to run away from you , and have the cruise out , " replied Paul . " Tom and all the rest of the party opposed him , and finally took the helm away from him by force . " Paul proceeded to give a more detailed account of the events which had transpired on board of the Flyaway since her departure from Portsmouth harbor . Tom and the other mutineers expressed their sorrow for what they had done , and were ready to submit to such punishment as the captain thought it necessary to inflict upon them . But Paul told him how penitent they had been , that Tom had promised to reform his life , and he thought they had already been severely punished for their misconduct by the terrors of the long and anxious night they had passed through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to follow Frank 's plan of continuing the cruise . " But they punished you more than they punished themselves , by keeping you on deck all night , " said Captain Littleton . " It was not punishment to me , for I was innocent , and they were guilty , " replied Paul . " You are right , my boy ; it is guilt that makes us cowards in the midst of peril . You plead so strongly for them , Paul , that I shall forgive all except Frank . He must be a passenger in that fishing schooner , which is bound for Boston . When I arrived at Portsmouth this morning , I learned from Captain Gordon that the boys had run away with the yacht . I supposed , of course , you had wrecked her in the gale and the fog , and I chartered that vessel , which was on the point of sailing for Boston , to go in search of you . I thank God you are all safe . " Frank Thompson , in spite of his earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flyaway 's head was turned to the north . Captains Gordon and Briskett resumed their places , and Henry Littleton spent the whole afternoon in listening to Paul 's animated narrative of the cruise of the yacht to seaward . In the course of the night the Flyaway reached Portland . But we have not space to detail the adventures of the Teneans in the harbor , or to give the particulars of the race between them and the North Star Boat Club . On the following Saturday night the Flyaway arrived at Bayville , and Mrs. Duncan once more pressed to her heart her darling boys . CHAPTER XXI . PAUL ADVANCES LITTLE BY LITTLE , AND THE STORY ENDS . For several years Paul pursued his calling as a fisherman ; and as he grew older the business became more profitable . Before he was twenty-one , the mortgage on the house was paid off ; and when he was free he had saved up quite a handsome sum of money , with which he purposed to extend his operations . But when he was on the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as second mate of an ocean steamer was offered to him , with the promise of certain advancement as he became qualified to fill more important positions . He concluded , after mature deliberation , to accept the offer , and the fishing business was entirely given up to John , who continued it for several years , with good success . If my young reader 's imagination is vivid enough to accomplish the feat , let us step forward nine years which will very nearly bring our story up to the present time . It is easy to jump over a long period of years in this manner on paper , but not so easy for the mind to realize the number and the importance of the events which may transpire in this time . Though we step forward over long years of toil and care , of joy and sorrow , of severe trial and patient waiting , and behold the Paul Duncan of to-day , it will be hard to believe he is not still a boy , and the skipper of the Fawn , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer a boy , and we can scarcely believe that he with the bushy whiskers , and the strong , well-knit frame , is the young navigator of our tale . Yet it is he ; and in order that our young friends may be properly introduced to him , we will step back a day . Ah , you do n't recognize Bayville ; you do n't feel at home there ; for everything is changed since the young fisherman sold his wares in its streets . Where is the cottage of Mrs. Duncan , do you ask ? Well , about two years ago , it was pulled down to give place to the more elegant structure that occupies its site . It is a very beautiful residence ; not very elaborate or very costly , it is true , but a beautiful residence for all that . Who lives there now ? Mrs. Duncan , of course ; and she is still an active woman , and as affectionate a mother as can be found in the whole country . You recognize in the elderly gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Captain Littleton . He is still hale and hearty , and makes a regular call every day at the home of Mrs. Duncan . He is in a hurry to-day , and has a newspaper in his hand . " The Marmora has arrived , " he exclaims , as he enters the room where the old lady is seated . " You do n't say so ! " " Arrived this morning , and is at the wharf in New York by this time . " " I 'm so glad ! " replied Mrs. Duncan , pulling off her spectacles , and wiping away the moisture in her eyes . " When will they be home ? " To-morrow morning . " And on the following morning , Captain Littleton and Mrs. Duncan were at the railroad station , waiting the arrival of the train which was to bring the absent ones . They were not very patient , but at last the cars appeared , and stopped at the station . " There they are ! " cried Mrs. Duncan , as she stepped forward and grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame and bushy whiskers . A beautiful lady is leaning upon his arm , and when she sees Captain Littleton , she throws herself into his arms , just as the young ladies in the romances do . But you wish to know about this lady , and we hasten to inform you that it is Mrs. Paul Duncan , late Miss Carrie Littleton . No doubt you expected all this when the young fisherman jumped overboard and rescued her from a watery grave ; and it would be a great pity to disappoint you , especially when a few dashes of the pen will make all right with them and with the sympathizing reader . Captain Duncan and lady were escorted to the residence of Mrs. Duncan by their happy parents , and attended by sundry brothers and sisters , all intensely delighted with this pleasant reunion . I will not tell you how happy everybody is at the house on the point ; but if the reader wishes to hear about the last trip of the Marmora , he must " call at the captain 's office , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickest passage which had yet been made , and Captain Duncan was almost as proud of his ship as he was of his wife . Little by little , Paul Duncan had worked his way up from the position in which we left him ten years before , to the command of one of the finest ocean steamers that sailed out of New York . He was exceedingly popular with the public , and was often quoted as the noblest specimen of a gallant captain , and , at the same time , a true Christian gentleman . He is not rich , as wealth is measured in our day , though he has some property , and receives a liberal salary from the Steamship Company ; but in the higher and truer sense , he is rich -- rich in the possession of a noble and lofty character , and a faith which reaches beyond the treasures of this world . John Duncan still continues to follow the fishing business , and owns a fine schooner , which is engaged in mackerel catching most of the time . He is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fawn ,  - -  which , by the way , is the name of his schooner ,  - -  and is noted for carrying sail longer than any other skipper in the fleet , thus putting the nerves of his crew to the severest trials . Now , reader , if you like the character of Paul Duncan , build up one like it . Be true to yourself , to your parents , and to your God ; be patient and persevering , and you will obtain your full measure of success , though like him you are obliged to win it LITTLE BY LITTLE .
