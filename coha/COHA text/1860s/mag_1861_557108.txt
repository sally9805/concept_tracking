CHARLES W. SHIELDS . HENRY C. POTTER . ThEODORE T. MUNGER . SAMUEL W. DIKE . WILLIAM CHAUNCY LANGDON . SETH Low . RICHARD T. ELY . PROBLEMS OF THE FAMILY . THEIR MAGNITUDE . FEW years before his death the late Dr. Mulford , whose great book " The Nation " has been the instructor of many statesmen in the higher conceptions of our political institutions , wrote in apriYate letter that he thought the sixteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States ought to be on the family . His meaning was made clear in some later conversations upon the subject . He saw that marriage , divorce , and polygamy , with perhaps other connected subjects , are so interrelated that nothing short of one inclusive constitutional provision on the family will meet the case when it shall finally be made up for this highest form of political action upon it . Other subjects seemed to him so much beneath this in real dignity , or to be so much more within the scope of the States themselves , that he thought this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature and place of the family in the social order , so many and grave evils arise from its present legal and social conditions , and these matters are of such a fundamental , universal , and urgent character , that he thought , as he again wrote and repeatedly said , that " the family is the most important question that has come before the American people since the war . ' And as the war had brought into the Constitution certain amendments relating to the individual , so he thought the time would come when the results of study and peaceful discussion on the family might find their way into the organic law of the nation . But no one saw more clearly than Dr. Mulford the long and thorough work that needs to be done in preparation for this great end ; and for some time before his death he had seriously thought of undertaking a book on the family . No one , certainly no one in this department of pro- 1 The first Present-day Paper , " The Problems of Modern Society , " appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought upon political and social problems , could have taken up the task with larger promise of usefulness . I have found substantial agreement in this opinion of Dr. Mulford , as to the supreme importance of the family in our social problems , among many persons whose opinions are entitled to the greatest respect . Mr. Gladstone also has lately given the weight of his name to a still more emphatic statement . For he says , " The greatest and deepest of all human controversies is the marriage controversy . It appears to be surging up upon all sides around us . . . . It is in America that , from whatever cause , this controversy has reached a stage of development more advanced than elsewhere . " THE SCOPE OF THIS DISCUSSION . THIS paper will not attempt to go into those deeper relations of the subject which lead to the proper apprehension of the grounds on which such opinions rest . For an explanation of them must come from a scientific knowledge of the nature and movement of nearly all the great social institutions and forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is enough to remark one or two things in passing . The year i86i , the opening of our civil war , was the year in which Sir Henry Sumner Maine , by the publication of his " Ancient Law , " introduced to English readers a system of study that , by its use of the historical method upon the material afforded by law , has given us new and larger views of the social life which lies back of and interprets our own . Within nearly the same period a very different school of students of social problems has sprung up - that of those who would account for the present order of society upon the theory of evolution . Whatever may be said of some of the conclusions of this latter school , its facts and theories demand consideration by every one who would understand modern social problems . It is not too much to say that under the combined influence of these two very unlike classes of writers , and from the mighty forces of the VOL . XXXIX. - 54. 385 // present , the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms ; and it is only as we study them in their historical relations as well as in the more common ways that we can hope to solve them or even understand them . With these remarks , it is purposed to confine this presentation of the subject to the more practical problems before us and sketch some of the work that immediately needs attention . SOME LINES OF INvESTIGAvIoN . TilE true way to begin is undoubtedly with the use of investigation . For the time has come when social studies demand that we start with indisputable facts , so far as they can be discovered . Dogmatism and sentiment are more and more coming under ban as guides in the work of social reform . We shall gain much if we can enter upon the hard work that is to be done for the family from the solid basis of fact . The statistical report of the Department of Labor at Washington on marriage and divorce was originated for this purpose . It begins at the beginning . It gives , for the United States , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations as they bear upon two points : first , the existence of the family as this is affected in its entrance into being through marriage , and secondly , by its unnatural and premature dissolution by divorce . In effect , it is an official report of facts on the vitality of the most fundamental and universal institution of society *n the greater part of Christendom . It demonstrates a suspected , but hitherto not clearly proven , fact that the official disruptions of the marriage bond have more than doubled within twenty years on both sides the Atlantic ; that the exceptions to the general rule are few ; that the movement still goes on and has reached huge proportions in the United States , where the laws regulating the formation and dissolution of the family are extremely lax , indefinite , and conflicting . The discovery of this uniform tendency of the social tissue to break up into its individual units points to the need of further investigation . For this fundamental fact in social statistics demands more study both by itself and in its relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning marriage and divorce to be investigated , and beyond this those matters which are closely related to these subjects should become the object of special inquiry . Licentiousness , that most difficult of all social evils for the student and reformer , needs attention , however reluctant we may be to give it . For licentiousness corrupts the physical basis of the family , whose maintenance in the vigor of absolute purity is of more concern to society than anything else in the physical conditions of human welfare . Its extent , forms , the classes affected by it , its influence upon pauperism , crime , insanity , intemperance , and its hereditary results are subjects that call for investigation . The study of the productiveness of American families in children , by careful examination both of birth-rates and of deathrates , is another . A knowledge of this subject by classes , whether of so-called native stock or of foreign birth , whether Irish , German , French , Canadian , Protestant or Catholic , white or black , rich or poor , if carried on , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census of Massachusetts , will be of great value . It has been found in that State that the birth-rate among foreign mothers is much larger than among others ; that the death-rate among their children is also greater , but not enough so to offset the greater birth-rate ; and that in the last ten years there has been a decided gain in the number of children in families of native stock , and a loss in those of foreign origin . Any one can see the great value of such inquiries . It is not hard to understand that the future of this country is dependent in part upon the relative operation of these powers of reproduction . The common method of improving society by individual conversions to better ways may need to be supplemented by some control upon the organism of the family , instead of being content in the degree we have been to pick out individuals one by one . In this way we may perhaps turn to our advantage the greater reproductive powers of certain classes against which we now contend with doubtful success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , will be needed to fix attention and direct action . And to these several inquiries one more especially needs to be added - the investigation of the home as itself a unit of the various social forces . For it is not enough that we study the effects of its virtues or its vices , one by one , separately . Such is its vitality , and its interrelations are so important , that we miss much if we dissect it and test it by parts only . I believe that the relation of the home , as a social unity , to poverty , crime , intemperance , and other vice , is worthy of the search of the statistician under the direction of social science . The composition of the family , its housing , its relation to the industries of its members and society , its influence in supplying the saloon , the brothel , the almshouse , and the prison with victims , or in resisting the allurements of these places of vice , as well as its own sufferings from them , are subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely by the statistical method , is to be sought that exact information which is almost indispensable to the greatest success in social reform . // CONFIDENCE IN SCIENTIFIC STATIST1CS . NOR is there any need of serious hesitation about using statistical methods here because of the obstacles to mathematical estimates of social forces . That there are difficulties no thoughtful statistician will deny . But the principle on which the statistical measurement of social elelnents and their movements rests is as sound as that which justifies the man of business in his use of bookkeeping . Indeed , social statistics are only the application of the well-established methods of business and science to social affairs . The units of measurement are less easily managed than in material things , but they are by no means beyond control . And besides , we are continually depending in our practical action upon what is called common observation . Thatis to say , the judgments and actions of mankind upon social matters are continually made up upon the very material which the statistician uses . But he simply gathers the exact matter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets out of it the real truth it holds so far as his methods can accomplish the task . In other words , he systematically extracts the reducible truth and puts the rest where its real value can be better understood , even though it is seen to be incapable of measurement by his instruments . He does not put in order the mere observation of one man nor that of all men concerning a class of facts , but goes to the facts themselves and coml ) els the observer to see them all in their proportions and relations . I speak of this matter at some length because the time is evidently near when the call for this kind of work will be more general than it has been , and to direct attention to its essential trustworthiness . There 1 A striking illustration of the value of such statistical work as has been urged in this paragraph , and of the use of it in correcting the opinions of the people , is afforded hy some figures that have come to hand since it was written . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and throw light upon the probable effect of that uniform legislation which is widely advocated . Uniformity is often sought because it is expected to prevent a great part , if not the greater part by far , of our divorces , since these are supposed hy many to he granted largely , if not chiefly , to those who have left their own State in order to obtain them more easily or secretly . But the facts are as follows Out of the total of 328,716 divorces granted in the United States in the twenty years from 1867 to i886 , inclusive , 289,546 were granted to couples who had been married in this country , and only 7739 were from marriages celebrated in foreign countries . The place of the marriage of 31,389 is unknown . One-fourth of these latter are reported from Connecticut , as that State does not require a disclosure of the place of marriage in its lihels for divorce . Now the report shows that out of the 289,546 divorces whose place of marriage was in this country and was ascertained , 231,867 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State where the persons divorced had been married , and 57,679 couples , or 19.9 is , as already intimated , a growing distrust of sentiment as a safe guide , and a readiness to accept the methods of scientific investigation as the basis of social reform , and it is well to know the really high degree of confidence which we can put in these methods . The economist , as I shall try to point out later , the advocates of temperance , sexual purity , prison reform , and the prevention of poverty and of all kinds of vice , have a deep interest in the results of statistical and other investigations touching the home and its social influences . We are now working blindly and wastefully in many of these directions for lack of more exact information about our subjects . And more than this , the popular mind , and even its leaders , need to see the number and tremendous force of the influences that emanate from the family or center in it.1 With this plea for preliminary and general investigation , let us look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done for the family and about it , as , for convenience , we follow along the line of the cardinal classes of American social institutions . We naturally begin with religious institutions- the most fundamental and important of all . Let us take these on their practical side . We shall soon see that the Church has quite overlooked or negligently used one of its most important forces . TREND OF ECCLESIASTICAL DEVELOPMENT . THE American religious life of this century has had two chief centers of development . One of these is the local church . This has been made the subject of a series of inventions that have produced most remarkable results in the Christian organization and life of the more progressive of our communities . The Sundayper cent. , obtained divorce in some other State . The migration from State to State to obtain divorce must therefore be included within this 19.9 per cent . But it can not he even anything like the whole of it . For in 1870 there were 23.2 per cent. , and in i88o 22.1 per cent. , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not born . Of course this last class comprises persons of all ages , while that under special consideration is made up of those who migrated between the date of marriage and that of divorce . The length of married life before divorce in the United States averages 9.17 years , which , I think , is from one-third to one-half the average continuation of a marriage in those instances where divorce does not occur . Careful study may lead to a reasonably correct approximation to the proper reduction from the 19.9 per cent. , and thus give the probable percentage of cases of migration to obtain divorce , but at present I would not venture an opinion on the point . It certainly is a very small part of all the divorces of the country , though varying in different States . But the necessity of such investigation is the point it illustrates . The discovery of these facts alone justifies the cost of the invaluable report of the Department of Lahor . It can hardly fail to compel the study of the problem of uniformity from almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the general question . // school , the prayer-meeting , the Young Men 's Christian Association , the Society of Christian Endeavor , children 's societies , and religious guilds of various kinds are examples of a large number of devices that have been made for the use of the churches . But they are all only varying forms of a single sociological type . One underlying principle has been the controlling idea in their construction . Their chief purl ) O5* has been to make most effective the method of religious influence through the use of an assembly of the people of a given vicinage . The primary social form for religious work is taken to be the congregation , and seemingly every possible way of turning it to account has been sought out and made the subject of inventive skill . The Sunday-school is the most notable of these recent developments . Not only has it a literature devoted to its work of instruction which perhaps is now larger in amount and the subject of more thought than that of any other single department of religious work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organization and work peculiar to itself . We have made a great science of the organization , the housing , and the successful operation of the Sunday-school system . This is more or less true of the other later forms of doing religious work in collections of the people of a locality . They are fast becoming elaborate . And the same tendency is seen in those churches which formerly stood aloof from this complete surrender to the idea of dependence upon congregations or local assemblies . Even the Methodist Episcopal Church in New England , if not elsewhere , seems to have lost something of its former reliance upon the class and its meeting and upon the house-to-house work which that institution and the circuit-riding system accomplished in their best days . I am not pointing to this tendency either to approve or to condemn it , but to call attention to the fact . It has undoubtedly greatly increased the efficiency of Christian work . But we do well to reflect upon the nature of this remarkable process by which most local churches of nearly all Protestant faiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory is unlike its predecessor of two generations ago . Another development has gone on in connection with this of the congregation . I refer to those larger forms of religious action that in some degree are regarded as representative of the life or organization of the local churches . Some of these are truly representative of the lower congregations , both in form and reality . Others are so in name , but in fact only partially , having a dominance of either clerical or other ecclesiastical influence that is neither democratic in origin nor truly representative . Some of these have sprung up in due constitutional form out of their polities . Others are anomalies as judged by their relation to their polities , but have had a more or less natural development . As society has become more complex , nearly all the Christian denominations have multiplied these larger forms of work to meet the necessities of their times . This is especially true of those polities founded on the theory of the essential independence of the local church . In this respect the simpler forms of ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has given us the modern state with its interacting parts of national , State , and local institutions . And just as the development has been truly representative of the constituent congregations , or been dominated by the paternal idea with power emanating from a superior order , the religious development has reproduced one or the other of the two great systems of political life . In some directions the representative form of development has done much to improve the former , that is , the congregational . It has often greatly helped the latter to better methods and a larger life . It has quietly brought to the community those broader conceptions and rules of action that have made public opinion a power for good . By use of the two the individual , who is the common object of their solicitude and beneficent care , has been touched and made to feel his relationship to his fellows and his responsibility for the discharge of the duties that grow out of it as apparently could be done in no other possible way . CONSEQUENT SUPPRESSION OF THE FAMILY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these two directions , or , perhaps , some would say in this one direction , from the inevitable tendency of communal life to expand into the association of communities , there is one of the three great types of social order which has r*ceived nothing like the care and skill that have been bestowed upon the others . I refer to the family . While it has not been forgotten , the family has been comparatively neglected . As soon as one attempts to institute a comparison between the labor spent in bringing out and developing the resources of the congregation in the various forms of it , to which allusion has been made , he can scarcely fail to feel the force of my contention . The Sunday-school , the Sunday-school teacher , Sunday-school relations and duties , and Sunday-school rooms and literature have been abundantly , though still probably far from exhaustively , studied and planned for . This and those institutions of the Church which are constructed on the similar principle of work through use of popular // assemblies may be said to have come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like this has been done for the family as a distinct religious institution demanding a correspondingly distinct treatment . Considerable advance in the welfare of the home may be freely conceded without abating the force of the charge that it has been relatively neglected . There has been of late years considerable talk in the newspapers and elsewhere about doing things for the home , and this is a token of good . But the form it assumes is rather disheartening . It reveals a lack of faith in the home itself . For the plea for the home almost always ends in an exhortation to some other institution to attempt some work for this precious charge of society whose constitution and training are assumed to be too delicate for any effort towards its own support . The irreligion of the home is usually met only by some redoubled effort to bring its inmates into the various congregations of the Church . ITS PERIL TO THE CHURCH . THE consequences of this method are very serious . For one thing , we are limiting our religious work to the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed upon it . Having committed our task to the congregation , we have put ourselves under its limitations to the extent of our dependence upon that ecclesiastical form and the higher one that works upon and through it . We can go where our congregation can be gathered , but we must stop with the length of its rope , or cut loose from it and make our way beyond as best we can , deprived of most of the aids that have been provided for it . Accordingly our hold upon the people fails as we get away from the conditions under which congregations are gathered and do their work . I ) istance alone cuts us off from some millions of people in the United States . Let no one start at this word millions , for it is true to the facts . The experience of the AmericanTract Society in the work of its colporteurs and a statistical examination of a large section of rural Vermont go to show that one-third of our people outside the cities  --  and this means about one-fourth the entire population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-six per cent . live more than two miles from the nearest church of any kind , and the proportion of nonattendants upon public worship was found to be fifty per cent . greater as we passed this limit of two miles . The reader will understand how very large this part of the population is when I say that a careful study of the census of i88o shows that in the fourteen Northern States east of the Mississippi River , where a little over one-half of the entire population of the United States was found in that year , there were more people by about a million in the country townships of less than 2000 inhabitants than there were in all the large cities and towns having 4000 or upwards . Any one must see , what the facts prove conclusively , that the attempt to evangelize these great numbers by main reliance on the various forms of congregational effort must largely fail of its object . Statistics for Vermont , where this kind of information has been better gathered than elsewhere , show this . That State has about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her third of a million of people , and yet nearly one-half of the population do not go to church at all . This probably pretty fairly represents the condition of things in a large part of the country . The occupation by two or more churches of the same field has much to do with this state of things . But the limits of Christian action fixed by the conditions of work through public assemblies has a large part of the responsibility for it . XVe distribute our work far too much with reference to its relation to some church edifice ; and where we can not hope to secure church organization or church attendance we too often let things go , or work our defective method as we can . But other things operate against the congregational method of doing our work . The social barriers of dress , manners , sympathies , the conditions of health , household cares , and other like influences , often have all the effect of distance . And here the problem is very much the same in country and in city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accomplished by the great working churches , as they are called , through the variety of ways already noted . But the thoughtful student of these methods must see that their simple extension or the intensive development of their work will not fully meet the case even in denser populations . W*le we may not neglect this , we must soon add something else to it . And I suggest that there is more hope from the recognition and better use of the family than in any other one social instrument within our reach . The latent religious powers of the average American home , of which I am more especially writing in this paper , almost need discovery THE HOME . NOTHING else can be used with so great effect to meet the obstacles presented by distance and the other hinderances to public worship as the home . The home is alway*s in contact with // the vast numbers of the unchurched both in city and country . It is , so to speak , always on the ground . Distance , weather , dress , and the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Natural affection , parental duty , and domestic interest are pleading for its offices . It brings to its task something of more worth than mere intellectual qualification or professional enthusiasm . And these forces wait the development and direction which the Church can give if it will apply its energies and resources to the work with anything like the way in which it has spent itself over the Sunday-school and similar institutions . In the judgment of the sociologist that can not be a healthful or permanent adjustment of the forces of the Church which does not distribute them proportionately among the three great forms of social institutions represented by the family , the congregation , and the larger bodies formed out of the latter . The family is the primary social institution . It is the most universal in its inclusion of members and in its presence . It is the most constant in its influence . It comes into the closest contact with persons of all ages and sex , though it touches especially the young , and it is the great channel of woman 's influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social institutions and yet keep the life of the family sound and duly vigorous is the great task of modern society . As our modem civilization pushes out its wonderful growth on this side and on that , it continually finds itself compelled to look to its primary constituents and see that they are kept at their very best . It does this on peril of dissolution . The clearest lessons from the history of Aryan civilization , enforced too by the stress laid by early Christianity upon piety in the household , point in this same direction . Here , then , is a place for some practical work in the development of the latent religious uses of the family . While we may not cease our talk with men about public worship and the duties they owe it , we may well learn to go to them in behalf of the family . But this must not be done as if the family were a beggar , with selfrespect lost , waiting for the dole others may condescend to give it . We have had too much of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it helpless by the methods of our charity long enough . It is time to help the home to self-respect by our own respect for it . There is in it a slumbering consciousness of itself which needs to be called into activity . It is time we ceased to make people feel that there is no salvation except by way of the churchdoor , in simplejustice at least to Him who said , " I am the door . " Where He is there is the church , is at least Protestant dodrine , and no form of ecclesiasticism , not even that of the most orthodox Protestantism any more than that of Rome , can shut Him within church walls or look to the congregation as the place for the greater part of His work . Work in this direction will be slow at first . Long disuse of the powers of the family , or perhaps I should say the great neglect to train and use them fully , has had the effect of partial paralysis or of infantile weakness . It is easier to work upon larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as we can make shoes cheaper in a factory than in the old-fashioned way . AN EXAMPLE . BUT the work can be done . I give an example , which is only one , and in the single direction of religious instruction . I refer to the home department of the Sunday-school . This is the name given to an extension of the Sunday-school beyond the limits of the collection of its members in congregations . It secures the enrollment of all it can of those persons who can not attend with much frequency the central Sunday-school , as its members in the home department of the school . These are supplied with the necessary material and helps , and are pledged to give at least a halfhour every Sunday to the study of the international lesson or some other Scripture at home , either alone or with other members of the family . A record of attendance upon this duty and of other matters is made and sent regularly to the school , which in its turn gives similar information . This is the leading feature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This device has been very successful , almost always adding at least one-fifth to the membership of the school , and sometimes doubling its numbers . Several hundred schools probably have adopted it in country towns , where it is working remarkably well , and of late it has been most successfully tried in some cities . The principle of this is evident , and it is capable of enlargement and application in several directions . It reaches more people than the congregational method of work can do by itself . What is more , it has planted anew in the popular mind the idea of the responsibility of the home to itself and the possibility of doing its own work in some measure . Now we may go on to other arrangements of this general sort . Household worship and perhaps liturgical aids to it , studies in the ethics and esthetics of home life , the assignment of definite parts of religious instruction to the home along with those pursued in the church school , may be named as within the range of the American family of ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munger lately // outlined in THE CENTURY , 1 and also the salient points of Church history , the confessions , collects , hymns , music , and missionary work of the Church might become parts of systematic study at home in the more intelligent families , if not in most . THE FAMILY IN THE EDUCATION OF THE PUBLIC ScHOOLS . I NEED touch but briefly the application of this principle in the field of so-called secular education . The same vicious tendency prevails here as in our use of religious institutions . The public school , which is based on the collective principle , and the periodical press are now compelled to do their own work and much of that which belongs to the home . If there is popular ignorance of morals or even religion , we seek a place for instruction and call for text-books on these subjects in the public school . Our cherished school system is in some danger of breaking down under burdens that do not naturally belong to it , by a thoughtless attempt to put upon it the whole task of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a careful survey of the entire range of educational forces - the home , the school , the church , the great university of literature , and the vocation , with a view to determine the province of each and the contributions these various parts should each make to the whole and to one another . Among these the family demands particular attention . For a hundred things in thought , feeling , speech , manner , and morals are determined quite as much by the home as by the school . The home and the school can not afford to work inharmoniously or at cross purposes . PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS . THE state among us generally confines itself to the regulation of the education of the schools . But it may point out to the people what must be expected of those educational institutions which it does not attempt to control . It may open the way for a closer interrelation of home and school , and so break up the tendency to concentrate educational thought upon the teacher and pupil to the comparative neglect of the parent and child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , and the parent is sometimes shut out of a participation in what should be common work . Besides this , we are now trying to secure the education of the entire people by concentration of effort upon the younger half . There is a consequent loss in two directions . We work against the unedu1 September , m888. cated part of the population that is outside the school-room , and we do nothing for the adults . But if we should bring about some cooperation of the parent with the school we should reinforce the work of the teacher with that of the parent and in some degree educate both together . A certain kind of social vitality would be given to what otherwise is too mechanical . Instead of combating nature we should secure her aid . By educational tracts and by other means , like a series of cards reporting weekly or monthly the subjects of study , their methods of pursuit , and such general matters as the proper pronunciation and use of certain words , the points made in manners , morals , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished for the children and much indirectly for the parents . The general life of the home and the instruction of the school-room would then more happily blend with each other . It would seem to be a proper thing for both state and churchperhaps after a common agreement  --  to take up the work of outlining their respective provinces in education with the purpose of clearly defining each and the duties growing out of their relationship . At present one part of the church seems to be engaged in a determined effort to secure to itself the entire educational functions of society because the state does not do full religious work , while another part is as zealous in its effort to force religious work to a certain degree upon the state . The last is often done on the weak plea that since the church and family do not reach certain classes with instruction in religion and morals , the school must be made to do their work for them . The idea of recalling the two former institutions to their own share in the work is hardly entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American political system , and the way that will strengthen all educational interests , would seem to be in the direction here indicated . But it can not be taken without turning attention to the family as a factor of unmeasured value in our educational problems . THE FAMILY IN ECONOMICS . ECONOMIC institutions are the third class where there is new work for the family . It is significant of the need of this that the original meaning of the term " economic " has been lost , and it no longer refers to the law of the house , as the word strictly means , but we use it almost wholly in the larger sense . For our science of wealth is now poll/lad economy , or the science of wealth in city and State , or rather the nation and the world . In this we have moved so far away from the primary institution-the // family- that the primary sense of the term has dropped well-nigh out of sight . It clings to the word economic merely in etymology . But any one who has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and property must have been impressed with their close interrelations and mutual dependencies . Few things in the history of the civilization of Western Europe are more suggestive than the great changes in property from the time when it was largely the corporate possession of a household or village community down to its present form of individual ownership . This history of the growth of individual out of corporate property , of modern capital and the new organization of labor , of the will as a means of transmitting property , of the emancipation of capital and labor from the bonds of status to the liberty of contract , and of the industrial activities of women and children , is closely interwoven with that of the family . In some way or other the family has been deeply affected by all these social changes . And in this movement , as in religion and education , the family has made surrender of one after another of its functions to the institutions above it and to the individual members of itself . The family is still continually yielding something to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that multitudinous combination we call society . This is by no means wholly wrong . For it is the very process of life in highly organized society , and the family receives much for what it gives . But it is my present contention that we should know just what has been going on , so that xve may act intelligently , and not needlessly run into danger . There may be need of arresting the process of differentiation in some directions , and of turning our thought to re-integration in more constructive lines of work . The friction of our present social life finds a part , at least , of its explanation in this suggestion . The corporate forms of capital and of the industrial organization of the times belong to this class . The irritation over the working of the modern will , by which the individual fixes his property for all time to uses defined by the conceptions of his own short life , is another . So completely has the modern commercial theory of endowments and trusts as affairs of pure contract taken possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most people , who do not know the history of law on this subject , either absurd or dishonest . THE MOVEMENT IN BEHALF OF WOMAN . THE bearing of modern industrial methods on the family and on the future of woman deserves more study than has yet been given to it , in order that we may detect the real causes that lie underneath . What some call a woman s movement for industrial liberty is not quite what it is claimed to be . It is largely an incident in the movement of property , which is seeking its own ends , caring very little for either sex or age . In order to find an easier place under the common industrial yoke that rests upon the neck of every individual , women seek more and more employments . But it is not so . much womanhood as it is property that is the real impelling force . Let me state the principle concretely . It is the desire of capital , or property in accumulation , to get things done at the smallest cost to itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end it seeks , the less there is in labor beyond the ability to accomplish the end the less costly the labor . Put the few indispensable qualities of successful labor into a machine , or supply them in a human being , and mere capital cares little for anything besides . It is under this law that women are continually taking the place of men in our industries , and children that of both . Under it the Irish , the French-Canadians , the Italians , Hungarians , and Chinese successively supplant each other in the lower forms of labor . I do not , of course , forget the powerful and beneficent upward movement that comes to all classes from this . But we must not shut our eyes to the difficulties that the operation of this principle puts in the way of those near the foot of the social ladder , nor the bondage it imposes on all who feel the pressure of it . Its effect upon the family is one of the most serious things in the whole modern industrial problem . THE DISINTEGRATING WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , been like that of a huge glacier , breaking and wearing away into their elementary atoms all forms of corporation , whether political or economical . Its ultimate atom is the individual ; its favorite corporation is the largest possible combination . The family has in it the greatest cohesive strength , and consequently has most successfully withstood the grinding power that has tended to crush everything subjected to it . This operation of the modern industrial system , and the commercial outgrowth of it , combine with other social causes to help postpone marriage and reduce the size of families in those sections of society where these tendencies are the least needed . It brings the family into the labor market as a mere collection of individuals on the same economic footing as the unmarried . For small provision , at the best , will be made in fixing wages , for the rearing of children , the care of // other dependents , and all those little things that make the home . In the market of wages the family is the accident of the laborer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these differentials between the economic value of society as a mere mass of individuals and what it is as actually composed of men , women , and children , living in families and having domestic and social wants above those bare material necessities to which capital is inclined to confine its thought , be carefully sought out and estimated . Political economy may well think of calling statistics into its service for their aid in the solution of this problem , which is clearly a difficult one . But it may not be impossible , for example , to get the approximate economic value of ten thousand persons of the usual proportions as to age and sex and compare it with the pecuniary returns of the labor of the same number of like proportions in respect of age and sex who are outside real family life . And something like this is the important statistical problem of measuring the share of the home in the general accumulation of wealth . If some work like this could be done even fairly well , it is probable that we should recognize as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realm of study where it has been greatly ignored . e THE FAMILY AS THE SUBJECT OF LAW . THE last field of work for the family is in the region of law and politics . The official report on marriage and divorce shows the need of legal reform . There is dangerous looseness both in the statutes and in their administration . There is nothing like a scientific and harmonious system of law upon these subjects for the whole country . Great confusion prevails . In too many States andTerritories the family can be formed in marriage and dissolved by divorce in the most careless and irresponsible manner . In most there are no provisions for official information on these most important matters . On the other hand , Europe has recovered largely from her early looseness , particularly in respect of the law of marriage , and has pretty generally secured scientific and conservative systems for the civil recognition of marriage and the dissolution of its bond . It hasinsome countriesrealized the idea of family law as an organic whole , and as the point from which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done very little to reduce to order the colonial confusion and the unrelated growths of the new States . It is not easy to find the term family in. national or State constitutions . It is by no means frequent in our statute-books . VOL . XXXIX. - 55 . Indeed the title has found its way into the encyclopedias only in recent years . We have come at the family in fragments and legislated accordingly . Our ideas of it are extremely individualistic , and so we are dominated by the conception of marriage as a mere contract , with little thought of the family and its relations of status . In this respect law only reflects the common sentiment . There is a vast deal of work to be done here - a work that is scarcely begun . THE FAMILY IN POLITICAL SCIENCE . THE more strictly political problem of the family is , if anything , still farther from our present views of public questions . Democracies necessarily part with the political significance of families as Europe understands the idea . Among us has culminated that prolonged social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions to build the city , the State , and the nation . And we are now confronting the question whether the last point shall not be yielded , and by the enfranchisement of women secure the completed substitution of the individual for the family as the ultimate and only true depositary of the prerogatives of political power . Those who advocate this final step triumphantly quote one of the great generalizations of Sir Henry S. Maine - that the movement of society has been from the family to the individual , assuming that social movements go straight on in the direction they have hitherto been taking . But some of us may well recall another of the remarks of that great scholar . For he has said that " Civilization is nothing more than a name for the old order of the Aryan world , dissolved but perpetually reconstructing itself under a vast variety of solvent forces . " An American student of social institutions also reminds us that " The family perpetually reproduces the ethical history of man and continually reconstructs the constitution of society . " If these statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as will be readily granted , it certainly is high time that we considered more thoroughly than has yet been done the part which this primary and universal social institution is likely to have in the politics of the future . The recovery of an institution like the family to its true place in the ultimate social order , carrying along with it the subordinate problem of the ( letermiflation of the political functions of woman , may be an early necessity of our political stability and vigor . The wiser political thought may refuse to speak positively on the enfranchisement of woman until it has studied more carefully the political relations of the family . // Whether it be for weal or for woe , the proposed perfection of the economic , political , and legal individualization of modern life is the most momentous of social propositions , and the gravity of the problem is not diminished when we remember that the world has yet to witness the first successful attempt of a civilization at the reconstruction of its own social order after it has reached high achievement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shunned , let us not forget that it is also unscientific , at least , to proclaim with unhesitating confidence the ultimate triumph of our present social order . RETURN TO THE FAMILY OF THE PAST IMPROBABLE . BUT we may not by any means return to the exact type of even the better family of the past . For social movements , as already implied , do not vibrate like a pendulum between two extremes , rising to a fixed point only to return to the exact place whence it started . The cry heard in some quarters , which calls simply for " the good old family of former times , " may not be a wise one . For it is a recovery to yet unexperienced possibilities rather than to a narrower domestic life that seems most likely . We have been tending politically towards nationalization ; that is , to the concentration of more and larger functions in the highest political forms of government . This almost necessarily goes on at the expense of the state , the municipality , and the family . The whole modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give way . The Trust , as we now feel it , is the latest evidence of this tendency in the field of economics . Economic forces have of late years had an immense influence in shaping public and private law . As has been already intimated , the family is the strongest natural barrier to that great disintegrating process which constantly tends to reduce to their lowest terms all intermediate combinations or institutional forms between the individual and the largest conceivable organization ; in short , between the individual and the largest massing of social force . Social readjustment along truly natural and therefore proportional lines , in which each social combination shall have its true place and share of work , is the great task before us . No one can think long upon the point without seeing that in this great work the family , from its nature as the original germ and permanent tissue of society , will become a leading object in the study of the problem . Its profound study is indispensable to the solution of the problems which underlie socialism . EDUCATIONAL WORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the problems of the scholar and the statesman among us are preeminently those of the people , there is need of fundamental educational work in which both classes can share . Chairs of sociology are needed which shall begin work by such analysis and historical study of social institutions that the framework of society may be understood both as it now exists and from the comparative point of view , and our concrete social problems be made to appear in the light of their relation to the great social institutions whose working has given rise to them . The trouble with much of our social therapeutics is that our practice is not based on sufficient anatomical knowledge . Comparative social anatomy and physiology are strangely neglected . There is need of some provision by which young men who are to be legislators , clergymen , missionaries , and writers for the periodical press , and young women , too ,  - -  for whom there is plenty of work based on this very kind of knowledge , both in city and country , in touching the home-life of our people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief features of the social order about them . I mean that such shall have the advantage of knowing the social life around them in the way they know things in the inferior departments of biology . Have we not come to the time when the biology of society demands some place in the majority of our higher institutions , such as it is just beginning to have in one or two of them ? Such study will bring out the place of the family in the development and present constitution of society . It will help us to forecast in some degree our future work . It will equip for their work - at least partlythe educated young men and women whose opportunities for usefulness in the solution of social problems increase with the years . Some of these subjects open fresh fields for monographs . We need , for example , a good manual on social structure and functions . Then another needs to be written , making , as I suggested some years ago , 1 a critical historical study of the development of the family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I there tried to show , that the family has not come out into its proper perspective , even in the thought of the Church at the end of all these centuries , as a distinct wellproportioned whole . Its practical and theoretical aspects in their several and separate parts have usually been the subject of study and precept . But now a singularly fortunate convergence of several of its fragmentary prob1 Tn an article entitled " The Family in the History of Christianity , " " Christian Thooght , " Dec. , 1885. // lems make it a fit time to bring forward the inquiry whether the family is not soon to receive something of that special and larger thought which has been occupied during the last hundred years with the individual . The great treatise upon the family , and indeed anything worthy the subject , is yet to be written . And before that is done , we need to measure accurately what has and what has not been already achieved . We might well go much farther and examine anew the ground of antiquity , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some valuable books , and study the place of the family in all the great religions . A special treatise on its relation to property or to education is equally needed . And it might be well to consider the usefulness of distributing this great work among those who should take up its various parts with the cooperation and under the direction of that increasing number of scholars who are becoming competent for tasks of this kind . POPULAR sTUDy OF TUE FAMILy . MORE popular agencies for study should be set in motion . The great Chautauqua idea of home study deserves its vigorous prosecution . But we need to go beyond this . There is work enough for the energies of a great publication society . The great publication societies seem slow to perceive that the times have outgrown the piously written but often weak tract of former days and demand almost a new order of literature . The Christian spirit , the scientific accuracy and method , the literary form , and the practical touch upon such subjects as are treated in this paper might be combined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some of the old publication societies which have lost their hold upon large portions of our people . These tracts should be written by or under the supervision of the best teachers of their subjects whom we have , and by well-educated young men and young women mostly , who have taken in the fresh thought and methods of recent years at every step in their education . For it is useless to disguise the fact that recent advances in scientific methods have made rubbish of a great deal that was well enough a generation ago . It is , then , my conclusion that much original and other special work , both in study and in the practical application of its results , needs to be done for the family ; that this should be applied to the family considered by itself and to it in its relation to religious , educational , economic , and political institutions , with the multiform practical problems to which their working gives rise ; that the collection of facts by the aid of statistical science be continued and extended in various directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and finally , in order that we may accomplish all these ends in the best way , that we ought as speedily as possible to lay broad and deep the foundations of a thoroughly scientific training in that department of sociological study which is connected with the family ; and to do all we can meanwhile to bring the best results of such knowledge as we have into the service of those who have practical uses for it .

( ITALIAN OLD MASTERS . ) NTEGNA must be ranked among the very few artists of the highest order to whom fortune was always kind and whom every material circumstance in his life led in the direction of his highest abilities .
