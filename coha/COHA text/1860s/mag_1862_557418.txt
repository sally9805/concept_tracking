" EDWARD IRVING 's warfare has closed , if not in victory , yet in invincibility and faithful endurance to the end His was the freest , brotherliest , bravest human soul mine ever came in contact with . I call him , on the whole , the best man I have ever ( after hard trial enough ) found in this world , or now hope to find . " Thus wrote Thomas Carlyle nearly thirty years ago . The history of a man who while living filled so large a place in men 's minds , and who when dead could call forth such a eulogy , deserves to be written ; all the more that in outward results his life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record . We have only commendation to give to the manner in which Mrs. Oliphant has performed her task . The theological warfare in which Irving 's later years were passed has now grown of little consequence ; but the character of the man himself , which she so lovingly portrays , can never lose its interest . Edward Irving was born in August , 1792 , at the quiet little Scotch seaport of Annan . His father was Gavin Irving , a tanner of good repute and condition . His mother , Mary // Lowther , was the tall , handsome , high-spirited daughter of a neighboring farmer . From her the children of Gavin Irving inherited the stately presence and dark , solemn beauty for which they all were noted . This in Edward was rendered peculiar , though hardly marred , by a marked obliquity of vision . The young Irvings grew up tall and stout , Edward being famous for his feats of running and leaping , and of swimming and rowing in the swift-flowing Solway . Edward was destined for th2 ministry . The Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the flumaiiities , and as many more in Theology , before ordination . The candidates for the ministry , therefore , must enter college at an early age . At thirteen Edward was sent to the University of Edinburgh , in company with his brother , two years older . The Scottish Alma Jlliater provides only classrooms and instruction , and takes no personal charge of even her youngest children . A room far up in one of the lofty Edinburgh houses was procured for the two lads . Here , to use our American college phrase , they " boarded themselves , " at small cost in money , receiving their supplies of oatmeal , cheese , and other necessaries , from home . They pursued their studies as best they might , going to the class-rooms at the hours for recitation , in their country caps and jackets ; for a distinct academical costume is unknown in Edinburgh . The session lasts only from May to November , leaving the whole summer free . At . its close the lads sent their boxes home by the carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight as the crow flies , " Edward making it a point to leap every fence in the way . The four years passed . Irving returned to his native Annan " with college prizes , high character , and promise . Nothing but joy , health , hopefulness , looked out from the blooming young man . " Soon afterward he was appointed teacher of a school just established in the little village of lladdington , where he remained two years , pursuing his theological studies by himself , only resorting to the Divinity School at Edinburgh to undergo the necessary examinations . Here we get our first purely personal glimpse of the man . He was employed as private tutor to a little girl of five or six years . // The lessons were to be given from six to eight in the morning , and in the evening . When he came in in the dark winter mornings , and found her peeping , hardly half-dressed , from her room , he would take her up in his strong arms , and , carrying her to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , setting her on the table , would teach her the mysteries of scholastic logic , with which the little philosopher puzzled the astonished household . The tutor was required to leave a written report of his pupil 's conduct ; and when this report was pessima ,  --  " Very bad indeed , " - she was to be punished . One day this was the only true report that could be rendered . Irving paused long , pen in hand , before writing the word . " Jane , " he said at length , pitifully , " my heart is broken , but I must tell the truth . " Half a century has passed ; but that pupil still remembers the sad face of her tutor as he wrote the word which doomed her to chastisement . Love for children and the consequent faculty of winning their love were characteristics of Irving 's great nature . In after years , he could hardly pass a child without laying his hand in benediction upon its head . In the height of his London renown he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms , while the nurse followed behind ; or stretched at full length upon the grass in the public square , with a bevy of the neighboring children tumbling over him . Toward the close of his troubled career he was once preaching in the street , when a cry went up that a child had been separated from its parents in the crowd . He had it brought to him ; taking it in his arms , he hushed its cries , and held it lovingly nestling against his broad shoulder during the whole of his long discourse , then gave it back to its parents , who had been waiting for it in the throng . After two years at Haddington , Irving was appointed to the mastership of the academy in the " lang toun of Kirkaldy . " He was now past twenty , and had attained his full height of six feet and some two , three , or four inches , with a corresponding development of breadth . Like all strong , healthy men , he gloried in his physical might and activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In school he was an absolute ruler , being nowise sparing of the rod . Out of // school he was the companion and playmate of his pupils , with whom he was always a favorite . Looking back upon his career , we can not help thinking that his proper vocation was that of a teacher , and that , if Scotland had offered any fitting sphere for him , like that of the great English schools , Irving might have anticipated the noble career of Arnold of Rugby . Three years after coming to Kirkaldy he completed his divinity course , and after going through the " trials " before the Presbytery he was duly licensed to preach the Gospel among the churches ; for the Scottish Church " ordains no pastor until he has been provided with a flock . " He met with little acceptance anywhere . Good Dr. Martin , of Kirkaldy , whose daughter he was to marry , sometimes suffered Irving to occupy his pulpit , to the manifest disfavor of the people . Beveridge the baker would irreverently kick open his pew door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was seen in the pulpit ; and it was notable that the congregation was visibly diminished whenever it was known that the " schoolmaster " was to preach . He had " ower muckle gran'ner , " was the criticism of the good folks of Kirkaldy ; very likely not altogether an unjust one , for Irving 's style , always ornate and sounding , was doubtless at first overstrained and bombastic . At all events , he found no honor at home . So for three years more he taught his school , and sat on Sundays silent in church , listening to sermons which fell coldly upon his ear , or framing imaginary discourses which should move men 's hearts . He was now twenty-seven years old ; and if , as he believed , his work in life was to be that of a preacher , he must not delay entering upon it . So he gave up his school , and , with the small savings of seven years , betook himself again to Edinburgh , hoping that some opening would present itself . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then his thoughts turned toward the East . If Scotland rejected him , he might carry Christianity under strange skies . In that year , 1819 , there was another young student , who also had been teaching at Kirkaldy , had now come up to Edinburgh , and was wearily waiting for employment . None offering , he was about to return to the country . " I have , " // he said , " the ends of my thoughts to bring together , which no one can do in this thoughtless scene . I have my views of life to reform , and the whole plan of my conduct to newmodel ; and with all , I have my health to recover . And then once more I shall venture my bark upon the waters of this wide realm , and if she can not weather it , I shall steer west , and try the waters of another world . " This young student did not try the waters of a new world ; but has lived to write " Sartor Resartus , " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life of Frederick the Great . " While busy with his Oriental grammars , and looking for a speedy departure to the East , Irving received an invitation from Dr. Chalmers to become his assistant in Glasgow . That great manufacturing city was in a troubled state . Want of work , and consequent starvation , produced the deepest discontent . There was talk of plots and risings . Chalmers had undertaken the supervision , economical and spiritual , of the very poorest quarter of the city , and Irving 's main work was to visit the hungry weavers and spinners in their gloomy homes , to minister to their spiritual wants , and likewise to aid in dispensing the alms of the church . He entered these poor dwellings always with the apostolical benediction , " Peace be to this house . " As a visitor he was eminently successful , but as a preacher he still found little favor . The discourses which were destined to awaken the great heart of London fell coldly on the ears of Glasgow . There was but one Chalmers , and the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It s no himself ' the day , " was whispered disparagingly when Irving entered the pulpit . Irving felt that this was not his place . There was , indeed , but one Chalmers ; but there was also only one Irving , for whom , he was assured , there was a fitting work , - if not in Scotland , then elsewhere . His old missionary schemes recurred to his thoughts . Might it not be his appointed task to go forth , apostle-like , and proclaim the Gospel in the East ? Or should he accept an invitation to become a preacher in Jamaica ? White men , or brown men , or black men , what mattered it , so long as he found his own work and performed it ? Sitting one morning in my lonely apartment , " he writes , 26* // " and meditating the uncertainties of a preacher 's life , and revolving in my mind purposes of missionary work , a stranger stepped in upon my musings , and opened to me the commission with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . In an obscure street in the smoky , dusty heart of London was the little " Caledonian Chapel , " capable of seating about six hundred people . Small as it was , it was too large for its scanty congregation , which had dwindled down to fifty , and was in almost hopeless straits . It was , however , connected with the " Caledonian Asylum , " a government institution for the benefit of the orphans of Scotch soldiers and sailors , and received a small grant from Parliament , upon condition that its minister should be able to preach in Gaelic . This little church had heard of Chalmers 's assistant , and now sent asking him to become their minister . Irving 's heart leaped to the summons . He replied that he would go on any call , and almost on any conditions . If need were , he would support himself by the labor of his own hands . He knew not a word of Gaelic , but would pledge himself to be able to write and speak it in six months ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . " He set out forthwith , bearing a letter of introduction from good Doctor Fleming of Edinburgh to worthy Doctor Waugh of London . The bearer was a large , rawboned , uncouth Scotchman , but a man of great learning and profound attainments in science . His moral character was excellent , and his doctrinal views Doctor Fleming judged to be sound . He had been assistant to Chalmers of Glasgow , who thought very well of him . As a preacher he had formerly been rather fanciful , but he had now come down to the level of plain commonsense . Moreover , he had a special faculty for visiting among the people , and would doubtless make a very useful minister in London ; and so , if Doctor Waugh could aid him in any way , he would greatly oblige Doctor Fleming . This was the somewhat hesitating commendation accorded to the man whose splendid eloquence was so soon to thrill all London . The " trial of his gifts " having been found satisfactory , the stipulation as to preaching in Gaelic waived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London in // July , 1822 . He attracted attention from the first . The little chapel began to fill . Hearers of higher station and of wider culture appeared among the audience . One day Sir James Mackintosh was present . Irving , in his prayer , spoke of a family of poor orphans , who were now " thrown upon the fatherhood of God . " Mackintosh repeated this phrase to Canning , who " started , " and at once made an appointment to hear the Scotch preacher the next Sunday . Soon after , a debate on church endowments sprung up in the House of Commons . It was urged that good pay was necessary to secure good preaching . Canning denied this ; and by way of proof , said that he had just heard the minister of one of the poorest congregations of the poorest of all churches , with no endowments at all , who had nevertheless preached the most eloquent sermon to which he had ever listened . This public praise from the so-called " British Cicero " sent London hurrying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throng increased , until the congregation found themselves like the garrison of a besieged fortress . It became a matter of difficulty to reach the door of the chapel , and then admittance could be had only by the bearer of a ticket . If this was numbered , the possessor entered the designated pew ; if not , he must probably stand through the whole long service and longer sermon , for Jrving would not be limited in time , and his discourses were quite likely to exceed two hours in length . " I am resolved , " he said , to some who remonstrated , " that two hours and a half I will have the privilege of . " The awkward Scotchman , whom Kirkaldy bakers had flouted , Glasgow traders endured , and good Doctor Fleming doubtingly patronized , stepped at once , as though by conscious right , into his new sphere as instructor of " imaginative men , and political men , and legal men , and scientific men , who bear the world in hand . " The secret of his sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tall stature , majestic presence , long black hair , voice of wonderful melody and power ; and even in the strange , discordant glance of his eyes , which gave the impression of something supernatural , - the one seeming to belong to a " bandit of Salvator // Rosa , the other to the Saviour of the world . " These might have attracted the attention of fashion , eager for some new excitement , but not of the intelligent and gifted , who crowded , month after month , to the little chapel . At a time when preaching was dull and formal , here was a man who discoursed of righteousness , a judgment to come , of the Living God , Ruler of earth and Arbiter of men 's destinies , as though he really believed , not only in the truth , but in the paramount importance of his message . Kean on the stage was not more thoroughly in earnest than Irving in the pulpit . The vices of the rich , the well-born , the cultivated , of the intellectual and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were passed in stern review . No wonder London was roused from its apathy , and the newspapers of the day noticed Irving 's sermons as regularly as they did the performances of the theatre and the opera . This heyday of popularity lasted in a measure for quite five years ; but when , in 1827 , the new " National Church , " which had been built for Irving , was opened , fashion had gone on its idle way , and he found himself at the head of a large congregation of permanent hearers , who filled , but did not overflow , the limits of the church . It is customary to say that Irving 's head was turned by the sudden influx of popularity , and that when this passed away , - as from its nature it must , - he tried to bring it back by resorting to wild extravagance . Carlyle , in his magnificent elegy , written just after the death of Irving , seems to sanction this theory . Nothing to warrant it appears in his true biography , as narrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gone to Kirkaldy , from whose manse he brought back Isabella Martin , his longaffianced bride . After two years , she returned for a while to Scotland , bearing their first-born son , who died almost at the moment when the mother gave birth to another child . She was obliged to remain behind , while Irving returned to his work in London . The letters which he wrote to her , and the long journal which he kept for her , - now for the first time made public , - give a more perfect revelation of his life and heart than we know where to find elsewhere . They would form of themselves a considerable volume of the most tender // letters ever written . They give a daily picture of his life at the very time when he is supposed to have been intoxicated by the poisonous breath of fashionable applause . Yet no hint here appears of such malign influence . We see him in his modest home exercising all the humane courtesies of a Christian priest , consoling the afflicted , confirming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no trace of even casual intimacy with the world of fashion . Besides the regular duties of his ministerial office , his other occupations during these bright , busy years were enormous . The books which he wrote were alone enough to make up the tale of one man 's daily work . One of his discourses deserves special note , since it marks the first point of the divergence , which was to grow so wide , between Irving and the great body of the religious world . Two years after his arrival at the metropolis , the London Missionary Society , wishing to avail itself of his popularity , invited him to preach its anniversary sermon . He accepted the invitation , and , having retired to the country , prepared the discourse . The appointed day came , and was duly announced . The great chapel in Tottenham Court Road , once known as that built for Whitefield , was crowded , long before the hour , by an eager audience . The preliminary services were commenced a full hour before the appointed time . Irving 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the sounding periods the officials of the Society looked around in blank astonishment . Instead of a discourse upon the benefits accomplished by the missionary work as carried on by the Society , with " prudence " as its first , second , and third requisite , and a due regard to the subsequent contributions to be made , he had drawn a portrait of the ideal missionary of the apostolic ages , going forth without staff or scrip , with no society to back him , intent only upon proclaiming his heavenly message . If the preacher was right , they were all wrong . A wild hubbub arose ; the Society disowned the sermon , and angry recrimination followed . It was clear then , and grew daily more apparent , that the whole scheme of Irving and that of the religious world was at variance . The divergence grew wider , and occasion only was needed to put them in actual opposition . // Irving , meanwhile , had entered upon that train of study and thought which was to color all his subsequent life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of interpretation of the Prophecies , which betokened the near end of " the world " and the ushering in of a new dispensation . Men paid no heed to his interpretation , and would not even give him time to sum up his columns of prophetical figures . Like Moses , he was slow of speech ; he wanted an Aaron to stand between him and the people . He encountered Irving , who listened to his expositions , and was convinced of their soundness . In due time a band of men devoted to the study of prophecy were grouped together , whose annual meetings were known as the " Albury Conference . " Three members of this body have a decided individuality . These were Irving , Joseph Wolff , the eccentric Christianized Hebrew , the oracle to whom all points of textual criticism were submitted , and Henry Drummond , at whose princely mansion of Albury the meetings of the students of prophecy were held . Henry Drummond was in many ways a man of note . High-born , wealthy , a keen politician , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pietist , he seemed to touch life at every point . In the British Parliament there was no more caustic critic of public measures ; in social life , no man more brilliant ; in philanthropic effort , none more zealous ; in mystic theology , no one more devoted . He combined in himself all that was necessary to make up a Wilberforce and a Loyola , a Knox and a Joe Smith . Irving has given the only intelligible report of the meetings of these Albury prophets , of which we need only mention that the grand conclusion was that the " fulness of the times " was at hand , and that the great gathering of the saints , and the visible reign of Christ on earth , was about to commence . To the enforcement of this doctrine Irving soon began to devote his mighty powers . Full of the impression that the time was short , he went , in 1828 , to Scotland , to warn first his own father 's house and kindred , and then all Scotland , through her capital . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his message . The whole country-side was moved . The neighboring // clergy closed their churches , and went with their people the long Sabbath-day 's journey over the moors to hear him . Thence he went to Edinburgh . It was May , when all the clergy of Scotland were gathered in the city ; so that in preaching to them he was in effect preaching to the nation . He began a course of Lectures on the Apocalypse , at six o'clock in the morning . The church was thronged at an hour when half of his audience would usually have been in their beds . Chalmers tried to force his way into the building , but without success . He had to change the place to the largest church in the metropolis . Here Chalmers heard him . " I have no hesitation , " he writes in his journal , " in saying it is quite woful . There is power and richness , and gleams of exquisite beauty , but withal a mysterious and extreme allegorization which I am sure must be pernicious to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became involved in that weary struggle in which the short remainder of his life was to be spent . He could not fail to come , sooner or later , into direct collision with his own national Church . His scheme of the Christian faith differed widely in many respects from theirs . To say nothing of the idea that grew out of his views of prophecy , that the existing churches were soon to be done away with , - cast aside as a worn-out garment , - his views on baptismal regeneration differed in no appreciable points from those since put forth by the " High Church " section of the Episcopacy ; his theory of the authority of the priestly office was as lofty as that of the most strenuous IRomanist ; while his doctrine of the Atonement , if carried dut to its logical sequence , would throw doubt upon the eternity of future punishment . But the actual breach between him and the Church by which he had been ordained took place on a point where he never dreamed that he was at variance with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he became involved in his prophetical studies , had been the doctrine of the Trinity , and its relations to the redemption of fallen human nature . Freed , in his new chapel , from the presence of the throng of strange new faces to which he had addressed the bursts of brilliant oratory that marked his early preaching , he had , Sabbath // after Sabbath , borne his regular audience for hours together through lofty arguments leading into the very secret courts of heaven , and tracing out the eternal covenants between the ineffable Triune Godhead , in virtue of which " the Word became flesh , " not merely for the salvation of individual man , but for the final overthrow of evil in a nature which had become corrupt and sinful . As human nature had fallen through the sin of the one man who was its first head and representative , so it was to be redeemed by the perfect obedience of the one Mau who was appointed its second head and representative . This Head must be of the same nature with the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted in all points as we are , yet without sin . " In other words , as Irving phrased it , he took upon himself our " corrupt human nature , " " that sinful substance . " Charges of heresy as to this doctrine were brought , at first vaguely , and then , as the breach between Irving and the religious world grew wider , in a definite shape . Irving himself states his belief in explicit terms . In the Preface to his volume , " Christ 's Holiness in the Flesh , " he says - " The doctrine which , with all orthodox churches , I hold and maintain concerning the person of Christ , - the doctrine , I mean , of his human nature , - is that it was manhood fallen which he took up into his divine person , in order to prove the grace and the might of Godhead in redeeming it ; or , to use the words of our Scottish Confession , that his flesh was , in its proper nature , mortal and corruptible , but received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tract , " The Orthodox and Catholic Doctrine of our Lord 's llun*an Nature , " he writes at greater length - " I believe that my Lord did come down and toil and sweat and travail , in exceeding great sorrow , in this mass of temptation , with which I and every sinful man am oppressed ; did bring his Divine presence into death-possessed humanity , into the one substance of manhood created in Adam , and by the Fall brought into a state of resistance and alienation from God , of condemnation and proclivity to evil , of subjection to the Devil ; and bearing it all upon his shoulders in that very state into which God put it after Adam had sinned , did suffer its sorrows and pains , and swimming anguish , its darkness , wasteness , disconsolateness , and hiddenness from the countenance of God ; // and by his faith and patience did win for himself the name of the Man of Sorrows and the Author and Finisher of our faith . " This was what Irving taught and believed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilful perversion - charged with teaching , was the " sinfulness and corruption of our Lord 's human nature . " The Presbytery of London took the matter up , and formally condemned the doctrine , excommunicated him from their body , and recommended that the sentence should be read from their pulpits . Irving then denied the jurisdiction of this Presbytery over him , since he was ordained , not by this body , but by a Presbytery in Scotland , to which alone he declared himself amenable . A formal manifesto was put forth by him and the members of his Church Session , who still clung to him , in which they explicitly declare - " That we utterly detest and abhor any doctrine that would charge with sin , original or actual , our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , whom we worship and adore as the very and eternal God , of one substance , and equal with the Father ; who , when the fulness of the time was come , did take upon him man 's nature , with all the essential properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very God and very man , yet one Christ , the only Mediator hetween God and man ' ; who in the days of his flesh was holy , harmless , ondefiled , and full of grace and truth ' ; who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God ' ; the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world , ' a Lamb without blemish and without spot ' ; in which offering of himself he made a proper , real , and full . satisfaction to his Father 's justice in our behalf . ' And we further declare , that all our peace of conscience , progress in sanctification , and . hope of eternal blessedness resteth upon the sinlessness of that sacrifice , and the completeness of that atonement , which he hath made for us as our substitute . " And , finally , we do solemnly declare that these are the doctrines which are constantly taught in this church , agreeably to the standards of the Church of Scotland , and the Word of God . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the General Assembly of the Scottish Church formally condemned his treatises on the subject of Christ 's human nature . He now openly stood aloof from his brethren of the Church , and was to go on his weary way alone . His opinions on prophecy // had become fully developed . They all pointed to the immediate closing of the present , and the ushering in of a new dispensation ; the gathering in of the saints , and the personal reign of Christ upon earth . That this new dispensation was to be inaugurated by miraculous gifts , like those which marked the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost , - gifts of speaking in unknown tongues , of direct inspiration , and wonder-working , - gifts which had long been in abeyance , - was a foregone conclusion . Just then came from Scotland reports that this miraculous outpouring had begun . At Fernicarry , on the Clyde , lived a young woman , Mary Campbell , noted for a kind of ecstatic piety , for which there is little room in our Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Catholic Church . She believed that the Lord had set her apart for missionary labors among the heathen . This faith was in no wise weakened when she had long lain in a deep decline , which , to all human appearance , was at the point of bringing her to her grave . Some friends of like faith were kneeling at her bedside , imploring a restitution of the spiritual gifts . All at once the sick woman burst out into loud and long speech in a language unknown to her or her friends . This was at once accepted as the " preparation of the Spirit , " and the " preparation of the body " was confidently anticipated . It was delayed but a few days . At Port Glasgow , across the Clyde , was a family named Macdonald , noted for their profound and saintly piety . There were two brothers , who pursued their daily labor as builders , and a sister , a bed-ridden invalid . Coming home to dinner , the brothers found their sister in the very ecstasy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke forth into a long and fervent address , closing with a solemn prayer that her , brother James might then be endowed with the power of the Holy Ghost . He walked to the window , stood silent for a moment , and exclaimed , " I have got it ! " Then , stepping to his bed-ridden sister Margaret , he took her by the hand , with the words , " Arise and walk . " She arose at once , and from that moment was perfectly cured . He then sent to Mary Campbell , across the Clyde , a letter containing the same words , " Arise and walk . " The sick girl , whose // death seemed at hand , arose at once on the summons , and , without any interval of convalescence , returned to active life . Nor was this all . In London , some months later , Elizabeth Fancourt , who had been for eight years confined to her bed by a hip-disease , was healed upon the prayer of faith being offered up by a pious friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flabby flesh became firm and sound , the crooked spine was straightened , and even an enlarged collarbone resumed its natural shape . Such , at least , were the accounts given of these wonderful transactions . Reports of them were spread far and wide ; the cases were investigated by men who were not , like Irving , predisposed to believe them . No one dared to pronounce them impostures . Even Chalmers , one of the shrewdest and most cautious of men , would not condemn them . We do not pretend to explain these phenomena . All the prominent persons , both before and after , bore characters that seemed to set aside any suspicion of wilful imposture . Mary Campbell , indeed , afterward figured among Irving 's flock in London , but always to her credit ; while the Macdonalds kept on in their quiet life at Port Glasgow . We do not learn that they ever claimed any subsequent influx of miraculous power . The alleged facts of the long illnesses and sudden restorations were capable of easy disproof , if not true ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we can now see , we can refuse credence to the alleged facts , only on the ground that they are so inherently incredible that no amount of direct evidence can substantiate them . It is foreign from our purpose to enter upon this question , our only object being to show their influence upon Irving 's life . To his mind there was no such inherent improbability in these events . Nay , they were in the highest degree probable . Such manifestations were the very things which he believed were to appear in the latter days . For this he and his disciples had prayed ; and would God , when they asked bread , give them a stone ? When , therefore , not long afterward , the manifestation of unknown tongues appeared in his own church , he entered upon the investigation of their genuineness with a mind predisposed in their favor . // In the summer of 1831 the first mention occurs of the speaking in tongues " in Irving 's church . " Two of my flock , " he writes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By " prophecy " he here and elsewhere means , not the foretelling of future events , but the gift of exhortation , in intelligible language , under the direct influence of the Holy Spirit . The first manifestations were private ; and it was four months before they were made in public . At first the " sealed " ones broke out in their private devotions into ejaculations in a language which they themselves , we infer , did not profess to understand ; then , in time , they were moved to speak in public , and , still later , to add exhortations in intelligible language . For some weeks Irving tried to restrain these public manifestations ; but at last , convinced that they were the direct utterances of the Spirit , he dared no longer to oppose them ; and , against the wishes of the officials of the congregation , they became a part of the regular service of the church . Strange and wild scenes were enacted ; crowds were again drawn to the services ; and the whole matter was spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really were , it is now difficult to say . Or rather they were to each hearer just what his own feelings and imagination made them . Mary Campbell thought that the tongue given to her was that of the Pelew Islands ; others imagined that they were speaking Turkish or Chinese ; at length the hypothesis that these were any languages spoken on earth was abandoned , and they were thought to be a supernatural sign given in attestation of the authority of the intelligible " prophecy " which followed . Irving describes them with unwonted splendor of diction . We quote a few sentences from him . " The whole utterance , " he says , " from the beginning to the end of it , is with a power and strength and fulness , and sometimes rapidity of voice , altogether different from the person 's ordinary utterance in any mood . There is a march and a majesty , and a sustained grandeur in the voice , especially of those who prophesy , which I have never heard even a resemblance to , except now and thea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss O'Neil . And when the speech utters itself in the way of a psalm or a spiritual song , it is the // likest to some of the most simple and ancient chants in the cathedral service . Most frequently the silence is broken by utterance in a tongue , and this continues for a longer or a shorter period , sometimes occupying only a few words , as it were filling the first gust of sound ; sometimes extending to five minutes , or even more , of earnest and deeply-felt discourse , with which the heart and soul of the speaker is manifestly much moved to tears , and sighs , and unutterable groanings , to joy , and mirth and exultation , and even laughter of the heart . So far from being unmeaning gibberish , as the thoughtless and heedless sons of Belial have said , it is regularly-formed , well-proportioned , deeply-felt discourse , which evidently wanteth only the ear of him whose native tongue it is to make it a very masterpiece of powerful speech . " To others the " tongues " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to frenzy by strong nervous excitement . If they were less intelligible than some of the " prophesyings " of which they were the sign and authentic seal , it must have been unedifying in the extreme . But the torrent , once broken forth , could no longer be restrained , and devout , sober men , who came to be edified , were shocked by the constant interruptions of these prophets , male and female , - mainly the latter , as was to be expected . Among these gifted persons , one Robert Baxter deserves special mention . He was evidently a weak , excitable , enthusiastic man . Visions of a higher order of inspiration than even the prophetic , to be bestowed upon him , haunted his imagination . He was to be the " apostle " of the new dispensation . The " ministry of the Spirit , " not merely " the ministry of the word , " was to be laid upon him . He gave himself up to fasting and prayer ; tried to exorcise evil spirits ; rebuked Irving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he must go to the Lord Chancellor 's court , where a message would be put into his mouth that would make the nation tremble ; that he would be cast into prison ; that then the abomination of desolation would be set up in the land , and Satan would sit in the high places of the land . He proceeded to the court , but no message came to him , though he stood there for three hours waiting for it . He thought he had been deceived . Then he was told , " in the power , " that he had misconceived the message ; that the imprisonment which 27* // he was to suffer was that bondage of the spirit which had prevented him from saying a word . Again a message came to him that he must leave wife and children , and wander over the earth without home or habitation . Then the Scripture , " If any man provide not for his own , he hath denied the faith , " was brought to his mind , and he thought the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the power " told to declare that the 1,260 years of witnessing had begun ; that in three and a half years the saints would be taken up ; that ordination by the Church was cut short in judgment , and a new spiritual ministry was to be established ; that church and state were accursed ; that many of the people , some of the nobles , and the king would be given to the prayers of the people ; that the nation and the Church would be destroyed ; that pestilence and the sword would overflow the land ; but that the people of the Lord would be preserved . The full narrative of these wild procedures in the Caledonian Chapel makes a strange chapter in the history of human error . This state of things could not last . Irving , never doubting that these prophetic utterances were from the Divine Spirit , could not check them . The staid members of his flock remonstrated in vain . They had followed him so far with loving zeal . Here they must part . The legal document by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of trustees provided that the worship should be in accordance with that of the Church of Scotland , and that the London Presbytery should be arbiters of this question . The trustees laid their charge before this body , whose spiritual jurisdiction they had solemnly repudiated only a few months before . But this was purely a legal question as to the ordering of worship . There could be but one decision . The worship of the Caledonian Chapel was not in accordance with the standards of the Church , as was most clearly to be seen . On the very day when the trial was to come on , Robert Baxter came to London , and told Irving that he had become convinced that his own claims to Divine inspiration were groundless ; that he had been deceived , and was now sure that he and all the other prophets had been speaking by a lying spirit , and not by the Spirit of God . // Irving defended himself with wonderful skill . He tried to show that there was nothing against Scripture in the proceedings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question was , Had the rules of the Scottish Church been violated ? and the Presbytery refused to be diverted from it . Their decision was given that the charges were fully proven , and that " the Rev. Edward Irving has rendered himself unfit to remain the minister of the National Scotch Church , and ought to be removed therefrom , in pursuance of the trustdeed of the said church . " Mrs. Oliphant , with a woman 's feeling , censures the action of the Presbytery ; but we think , that , even upon her own showing and that of Irving himself , they could not have done otherwise . The church which had been built for , and virtually by Irving , was at once closed against him , and the large part of his flock which adhered to him were forced to seek some other place of assemblage . For a while they met in a hall which on other days was occupied by Robert Owen and his sceptical associates . Afterward they secured the large gallery in Newman Street , built by West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they began the organization of the " Catholic Apostolic Church . " The room was fitted up in a peculiar manner . There were the usual pews and galleries , as in other churches ; but in lieu of a pulpit was a platform capable of containing fifty persons . On the front of this were seven seats , - the middle one for the " angel , " or minister , the three on each side for the " elders . " Below , on the steps , were seven seats for the " prophets , " and still lower another seven for the deacons . The " angel " ordered the service ; the preaching was by the elders in turn , the prophets speaking " as utterance was given to them . " A full report of the opening services has been preserved . The sermon was by Irving , interrupted now and then by the utterances of the prophets and others of the gifted of both sexes . These interjected interruptions are also given . Nothing less worthy of direct inspiration can be conceived . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Drummond - " Ab , be ye warned ! be ye warned ! Ye have been warned . The Lord hath prepared for you a table , but it is a table in the presence of // your enemies . Ah , look you well to it ! The city shall be builded , - ah ! every jot , every piece of the edifice . Be faithful each under his load , - each under his load ; but see that ye build with one hand , and with a weapon in the other . Look to it , - look to it . Ye have been warned . Ah ! Sanballat , Sanballat , Sanballat ; the Horonite , the Moabite , the Ammonite ! AhI confederate , confederate , confederate with the Horonite ! Ah , look ye to it , look ye to it ! " Irving Was now wholly loose from all his old ecclesiastical relations . But he was to make one more formal appearance before a Scottish Presbytery . The General Assembly had , as we have mentioned , condemned his doctrines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the Presbytery which had ordained him to proceed to his trial . He was cited to appear before this body in his native Annan . The trial was to take place on the 12th of March , 1833 . He went down , accompanied by some friends , - among them David Dow , once a minister in Scotland , now one of the " prophets " of the " Apostolic Church . " The church of Annan was crowded to witness the trial of the great man by his ecclesiastical peers . It was computed that two thousand persons were present . The trial began at noon . Irving was charged with " printing , publishing , and disseminating heresies and heretical doctrines , particularly the doctrine of the fallen state and sinfulness of our Lord 's human nature . " He admitted the authorship of the works in question . The obscure country parsons who composed the Presbytery had made up their minds as to the heterodoxy of Irving 's views ; and , though he vehemently protested that he had never taught or held the doctrine laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that they had to do was to give their sentence , one by one , - " Guilty as libelled , " - with such remarks as they were able to make . These proceedings occupied the whole afternoon . Darkness set in ; a single candle was placed upon the moderator 's table as he asked the oldest member to lead in prayer before he proceeded to pronounce the solemn sentence of condemnation . In the thick gloom , a voice was heard from the pew in which Irving and his friends were seated : " Arise , depart . Ye can not pray . Depart , flee ! " The voice was that of the prophet Dow ; to Irving it was the voice of God ; and so he and his // friends went out into the cold March night , without waiting to hear the solemn sentence of deposition by which the Presbytery took away from him the office which eleven years before they had conferred , pronouncing him no longer a minister or member of the Church of Scotland . He remained a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited listeners , and then , taking a solemn farewell of his friends and kinsfolk , he returned to London . He was received , not as a martyr who had borne a good testimony , but by an interdict of the prophets " in the power , " forbidding him to exercise his function as " angel " of the church , and degrading him to the post of " deacon , " the lowest in their ministry . It would be curious to know who were the men that passed this sentence . But Irving bowed his lofty head , and for weeks sat silent . Then came a new utterance , " by the concurrent action in manifested supernatural power both of prophet and apostle , " reappointing him as " angel " of the flock , and Mr. Cardale , the " apostle , " laid his hands upon the head of Edward Irving in new ordination . But his great public work was done . His functions were circumscribed by the obscure " prophets " and " apostles , " who took it upon themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hither and thither , upon this mission and that , for months ; and at length , in September of 1832 , - the last autumn which he was to see , - they ordered him to go to Scotland , " in the power , " to do some great prophetic work . The strong man who twelve years before had come up to London was now but a shadow of his former self . Hardly forty-two , he was an old man . The giant form was bent ; the once raven hair was as white as snow ; the mighty voice was weak and faltering . Perhaps the prophets sent him away , hoping that a visit to his native land would restore his wasted powers . He set off by devious ways , sending back almost day by day tender notes to his wife and children , - hopeful at first . The rides - for he went on horseback - seemed to recruit his wasted strength ; his pulse , fevered by excitement , had fajlen to a hundred . Soon , however , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord made vain the remedies // of man . " By the middle of October he had reached Liverpool , worn out and exhausted , and wrote to his wife to come to him . She obeyed the call , and hastened to join him . Together they proceeded to Glasgow in the stormy October , in obedience to the mission laid upon him , though physicians assured him that his only chance of life was to spend the winter in a southern climate . But the mission was , he believed , appointed of God , and He would give him strength to accomplish it . It was to establish an " Apostolic Church " in Glasgow , where his small band of disciples had found a little place for worship . For a few weeks his gaunt form is visible in the streets , or in the little assembly of his disciples . Then strength fails , and he takes to his bed , stricken with death , as all believe but himself and his faithful wife , who still trust that the miraculous power which raised Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf . But the supreme hour approached , and even his wife abandoned hope . Irving grew delirious . Now lie thought himself in his London congregation ; now , counselling the members of his flock . Once he was heard murmuring to himself sonorous syllables in a tongue unknown to those who watched beside him . Could it be that now the gift in which he so faithfully believed , though it had never been vouchsafed to him , was to be bestowed ? Were the words of that unknown tongue the precursor of the miraculous healing that was to restore him to health and vigor ? Doctor Martin , the father of his wife , bent down his head to catch those mysterious sounds . But it was no unknown language that came from those pale lips . It was the Hebrew measures of the twenty-third Psalm : " The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . " Feebler and feebler waned the tide of life . Then a last debate seemed to spring up in that soul which was so soon to be with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer , " murmuring to himself in inarticulate argument , confusedly struggling in his weakness to account for this visible death which at last his human faculties could no longer refuse to believe in , - perhaps touched with ineffable trouble that his Master had seemed to fail of his word and promise . At last that self-argument came to a sublime conclusion in a trust more strong // than life or death . As the gloomy December Sunday sank into the night shadows , his last audible words on earth fell from his pale lips . The last thing like a sentence we could make out was , " If I die , I die unto the Lord . Amen . " ' And so , at the wintry midnight hour which ended that last Sabbath on earth , the last bonds of mortal trouble dropped asunder , and the saint and martyr entered into the rest of his Lord . " They buried Irving with solemn pomp in the crypt of the magnificent Cathedral of Glasgow . Most of the clergy of the city followed him to the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been excommunicated from their body , remembering only the worth and piety of the man . It seemed that his work had perished before him . The great and noble , " the men who hold the world in their hands , " to whom he had preached righteousness and the judgment to come , had gone on in their old way . He had unrolled the solemn scroll of prophecy , but the consummation which he had educed had not come to pass . The doctrine of the oneness of his Lord and Master with the humanity which he had come to redeem , the doctrine which was to him the centre and life of the Christian faith , had been solemnly condemned by the Church of his love , and for maintaining it he had been excommunicated and deposed on the very spot where lie had been baptized and ordained . The new " Apostolic Church " which had gathered around him had been given up to babbling " prophets " and feeble " apostles . " To him had been vouchsafed none of those miraculous gifts which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in abeyance only on account of its want of faith ; and some of those in whose claims to the possession of these gifts he had most implicitly trusted , had publicly acknowledged that they had been the dupes of evil spirits or of their own eager imaginations . To himself , as he lay dying on that winter Sabbath evening , his life must have seemed a failure , saving only for the sublime conclusion that he had been honestand faithful to the light given him , so that , " living or dying , he was the Lord 's . " No wonder that the world tried , in its foolish way , to explain the mystery of his life . The easiest solution was to pronounce him crazed , first by popular applause , then by its withdrawal . We can hardly wonder that Carlyle , writing just // after Irving 's death , should have given faith to this idea . He has since grown wiser . Not many months ago , Milburn , the American " Blind Preacher , " visited Carlyle . Something brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My poor friend Irving , " he exclaimed , bursting out into sublime monologue , " men thought him daft ; but he was dazed . I have heard that the eagle becomes blind in gazing with unveiled eye upon the sun . Thus Irving tried to do what no man may do and live , to gaze full in the face of the brightness of the Deity , and so blindness fell upon him . " It was fit that the life of Edward Irving should be written by one so tender and reverent as his present biographer . " So far , " she says in conclusion , " as these volumes present the man himself , with his imperfections breaking tenderly into his natural grandeur , always indivisible , and moving in a profound unity of nature through such proof of all sorrows as falls to the lot of few , I do not fear that his own words and ways are not enough to clear the holy and religious memory of Edward Irving of many a cloud of misapprehension and censure of levity ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my task . He died in the prime and bloom of his days , without , so far as his last writings leave any trace , either decadence of intellect or lowering of thought ; and left , so far as by much inquiry I have been able to find out , neither an enemy nor a wrong behind him . No shadow of unkindness obscures the sunshine on that grave which in old days would have been a shrine of pilgrims . The pious care of his nephew has emblazoned the narrow Norman lancet over him with a John Baptist , austere herald of the cross and advent ; but a tenderer radiance of human light than that which encircled the solitary out of his desert lingers about that resting-place . There lies a man who trusted God to extremity , and believed in all Divine communications with truth as absolute as any patriarch or prophet ; to whom mean thoughts and unbelieving hearts were the only things miraculous and out of nature ; who desired to know nothing in heaven or earth , neither comfort , nor peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the work of his Master , whom he loved , - yet to whose arms children clung with instinctive trust , and to whose heart no soul in trouble ever appealed in vain . He was laid in his grave in the December of 1834 , - a lifetime since ; but scarce any man who knew him can yet name , without a softened voice and a dimmed eye , the name of Edward Irving , - true friend and tender heart , - martyr and saint .
