ON THE RELATION OF ART TO NATURE . IN TWO PARTS . PAET IL THE repulsive ugliness of the early Christian paintings was not the conse-. quence of any break in the tradition . There was no reason why the graceful drawing of the human figure should not have been transmitted , as well as the technical procedures and the pigments . Nor was effort wanting : these pictures were often very elaborate and splendid in execution . But it is clear that grace and resemblance to anything existing , so far from being aimed at , were intentionally avoided . Even as late as the thirteenth century we find figures with blue legs and red bodies , - the horses in a procession blue , red , and yellow . Any whim of association , or fanciful color - pattern , was preferred to beauty or correctness . Likeness to actw 1 things seemed to be regarded , indeed , as an unavoidable evil , to be restricted as far as possible . The problem was , to show God 's omnipresence in the world , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abidin* , presence in holy men and women as an inspiration obliterating their humanity . But so long as the divine and the human are looked upon as essentially opposed , their union can he by miracle only , and the first thought must be to keep prominent this miraculousness , and guard against confusion of this angelic existence with every-day reality . The result is this realm of ghosts , at home neither in heaven nor on earth , neither presuming to be spirit nor condescending to be body , but hovering intermediate . But the more strongly the antithesis is felt , the nearer the thought to end this remaining ten ( lerness for the gross and unspiritual , - to drop this ballast of earth , and rise into the region of heavenly realities . Upon a window of Canterbury Cathedral beneath a representation of the miracle of Cana , is the legend , - " Lymplsa dat historiorn , ririum notat allegoriam . " But if t1z* earthly is there only for the sake of this heavenly transmutation , - if the miracle , and the miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things must be miraculous , for all else may be safely ignored . Henceforth , nothing is of itself profane , for the profane is only that wherein the higher and truer sense has riot yet been recognized . What is demanded is not an exceptional transmutation , but a translation , - that all Nature should be interpreted of the spirit . The result is , on the one hand , a greater license in dealing with actual forms , since Art sees all things on one level of dignity , - respects one no more than another , but only its own purpose , - is careless of material qualities , and of moral qualities , too , as far as they are hound to particular shapes . Why dwell tediously upon one particle , when the value of it consists not in its particularity , but in its harmony with the rest of the universe ? Giotto seems to make short work with the human form divine by wrapping all his figures from head to foot in flowing draperies . But these figures have more humanity in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer petrified in the shape , hut speaks to us freely and directly , in a look , a gesture , a sweep of the garment . The Greek said , - " With these superhuman lineaments you are to conceive the presence of Jove ; these are the appropriate forms of the immortals . " Giotto said , - " See what divine meanings in every-day faces and actions ; with these eyes you are to look upon the people in the street . " The one is a remote and incredible perfection ,  --  the other , the // intimate reality of the actual and present . It is , in truth , therefore , a closer approach to Nature than was before possible . The artist no long , er shuns full actuality for his conception , for he fears no confusion with the actual . For instance , from the earliest times the celestial nature of aneels had been naively intimated by appending wings to them . There was no attempt to carry out the suggestion , or to show the mechanical 1 ) ossibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The painters of the sixteenth century , on the other hand , from a nervous dread lest wings should prove insufficient , establish a sure basis of clouds for their angels , with more and more emphasis of buoyancy and extent , until at last , no longer trusting their own statement , they settle the question by showing them from below , already risen , and so choke off the doubt whether they can rise . But Orcagna 's angels float without assistance or effort , by their own inherent lightness , as naturally as we walk . They are not out of their element , but bring their element with them . These are not men caught up into the skies , and do not need to be sustained there . The world they inhabit is not earth in heaven , but heaven on earth , - the earth seen in accordance with the purpose of its existence . Giotto 's fellow - citizens were struck with the new interest which the language of attitude and gesture and all the familiar details of life acquired in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they had been taught to see , and concluded it was only an unexampled closeness of copying . No doubt Giotto thought so , too , - but had that been all , we should not have heard of it . It is this new interest that has to be accounted for . The charm did not lie in the fact , nor in the reproduction of it in the picture , but in a sudden sense of its value as expression , resting on a still obscurer feeling that herein lay its whole value , - that the actual is not what it seems , still less a pure delusion , but that it is pure seeming , so that its phenomenal character is no reproach , but the bond that connects it with reality . Just because it is only " the outward show , " and does not pretend to be anything more , what it shows is not " the things that only seem , " but the things that are . The attractiveness of beauty is due to the sense of higher affinities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the form shines with the splendor of a purpose that belongs not to it , but to the whole whereof it is a part . Aristotle makes wonder the forerunner of science . So our admiration of beauty is a tribute paid in advance to the fresh insight it promises . Whether it be called miracle or inspiration , the artist must see his theme as something excellent and singular . This is perhaps that " strangeness " which Lord Bacon requires in all " excellent heanty , " the new significance coming direct , and not through reflection , and therefore ineffable and incomparable . That Giotto and his successors went on for two hundred years painting saints and miracles was not because the Church so ordained , nor from any extraordinary devoutness of the artists , but because they still needed an outward assurance that what they did was not the petty triviality it seemed . There must always remain the sense of an ulterior , undeveloped meaning when that is laid bare , Art has become superfluous , and makes haste to withdraw into obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture or the statue avails anything , and this circumstantiality of expression is tolerable only so long as it is the only expression . Beauty is an honor to matter ; but spirit , the source of beauty , is impatient of such measure of it as Art can give . As , in the legend , Eurydice , the dawn , sinks back into night at the look of the arisen sun , so this lovely flush of the dawning intelligence wanes before the eye of the intellect . The picture iS a help so long as it transcends previous conception ; but when the mind comes up with these sallies , and the picture is compared with the idea , it sinks back into a thing . Thenceforth it // takes rank with Nature , and falls victim to the natural laws . It is only an aspect and an instant , - not eternal , but a petty persistence , - not God , but an idol , - not the saint , but his flesh and integuments . Shall we say , then , that beauty is an illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it provisional truth , - truth at a certain stage , as appearance , not yet as idea . It is appearance seen as final , as the highest the mind has reached . Hence i miraculousness . It is in advance of consciousness ; we can not account for it any . more than the savage could account for his fetich , - why this bunch of rags and feathers should be more venerable to him than other rags and feathers . But to deny that the impressiveness it adds to matter comes from a deeper sense of the truth would be as unwise as for him to deny his fetich . The fetich is false , not as compared with other rags and feathers , but as compared with a higher conception of God . The falsity is not that he sees God in this rubbish , but that he does not see Him elsewhere . Coleridge said that a picture is something between a thought and a thing . It must keep the mean ; either extreme is fatal . Plato makes Eros intermediate between wisdom and ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forever needy , forever seeking the Psyche whom he can never meet face to face . The history of Art has a certain analogy to the growth of the corals . Like them , it seeks the light which it can not endure . A certain depth beneath the surface is most favorable to it , - a dim , midway renion of twilight and calm , remote alike from the stagnant obscurity of mere sensation and from the agitated surface of day , the dry light of the intellect . When it is laid bare , it dies , - its substance , indeed , enduring as the basis of new continents , but the life gone , and only the traces of its action left in the stony relics of the past . Greek Art perished when its secret was translated into clearer language by Plato and Aristotle ; and Duccio and Cimabue and Giotto must go the same way as soon as St. Francis of Assisi or Luther or Calvin puts into words what they meant . It is its own success that is fatal to Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon is shown to be pervading , uniVersal , and not the property of this or that shape , the particular manifestation is degraded . Color and form are due to partial opacity ; the light must penetrate to a certain depth , but net throughout . The name of Giotto has come to stand for Devotional Art , for an earnestness that subordinates all display to the sacredness of the theme . But his fellow-citizens knew him for a man of quick worldly wit , who despised asceticism , and was ready with the most audacious jokes , even at sacred things . Ghiberti and Cennini do not praise him for piety , but for having " brought Art back to Nature " and " translated it from Greek into Latin , " - that is , from the language of clerks into the vernacular . It is not anything special in the intention that gives Giotto his fame , but the freedom , directness , and variety of the language with which it is expressed . The effort to escape from traditional fbrmulas and conventional shapes often makes jtself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statuesque forms of the earlier time , it is the dramatic interest that is now prominent , - the composition , the convergent action of numerous fi , ures , separately , perhaps , insignificant , but pervaded by a common emotion that subordinates all distinctions and leaves itself alone visible . Even in the traditional groups , as , for instance , the Holy Families , etc. , the aim is more complete realization , in draperies , gestures , postures , rather than beauty of form . We miss in Giotto much that had been attained before him . What Madonna of his can rank with Giovanni Pisano 's ? The * Northern cathedral-sculptures , even some of the Byzantine carvings , have a dignity that is at least uncommon in his pictures . Especially the faces are generally wooden , - destitute alike of individuality and // of the loveliness of IDuccio 's and even of some of Cimabtie 's . On the other hand , in the picture wherein the school attained , perhaps , its highest success as to beauty of the faces , Orcagna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed are ranged in row above row , with mostly no relation to each other but juxtaposition . We see here two directions , - one in continuation of the antique , seeking beauty as the property of certain privileged forms , the other as the hidden possibility that pervades all things . One or the other must abate something : either the image must become less sacred , or the meaning narrower ; for the language of painting is not figurative , like the language of poetry , but figure , and unless the form bear on its face that it is not all that is meant , its inherent limitations are transferred to the thought itself . When Dante tells us that Brunetto Latini and his companions looked at him , - " Come vecchio sartor fa nella cruna , " it is the intensity of the gaze that is present with us , not the old tailor and his needle . But in Painting the image is usurping and exclusive . Of these divergent tendencies it is easy to see which must conquer . The gifts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as the property of this or that saint . The worship of the Madonna is better than the worship of Athene just so far as the homage is paid to a sentiment and not to a person . iNow the Madonna , too , must come down from her throne . The painters grew tired of painting saints and angels . Giotto already had diverged from the traditional heads and draperies , and begun to put his figures into the Florentine dress . Masaccio and Filippino Lippi brought their fellow-citizens into their pictures . Soon the Holy Family is only a Florentine matron with her baby . The sacred histories are no longer the end , but only the excuse ; everything else is insisted on rather than the pretended theme . The second INicene Council had declared that " the designing of the holy images was not to be left to the invention of artists , but to the approved legislation and tradition of the Catholic Church . " But now the Church had to take a great deal that it had not bargained for . Perspective , chiaroscuro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the show of things , without regard to what they are ,  --  this is now the religion of Art . These things may seem to us rather superficial , and Art to have declined from its ancient dignity . But see how they took . hold of men , and what men they took hold of . In the midst of that bloody and shameless fifteenth century , when only force seems sacred , men hunted these shadows as if they were wealth and power . Paolo Uccello could not be got away from his drawing to his meals or his rest , and only replied to his wife 's remonstrances , " Ah , this perspective is so delightful ! " With what ardor Mantegna and Luca Signorelli seized upon a new trait or action ! Leonardo da Vinci , " the first name of the fifte*nth century , " a man to whom any career was open , and who seemed almost equally fit for any , never walked the streets without a sketchbook in his hand , and was all his life long immersed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed by his endless caricatures and studies , but perhaps by nothing more clearly than by his incidental discovery of the pnnclpIe of the stereoscope , which he describes in his treatise on Painting . This was no learned curiosity , nor the whim of seeing the universe under drill , but only a clearer instinct of what the purpose of Art is , namely , to see the reality of the actual world in and as the appearance , instead of groping for some ulterior reality hidden behind it . Leonardo has been called the precursor of Bacon . Certainly the conviction that underlies this passion for the outside of things is the same in both , - the firm belief that the truth is not to be sought in some remote seventh heaven , but in a truer view of the universe about us . Donatello told Paolo Uccello that he // was leaving the substance for the show . But the painter doubtless felt that the show was more real than any such " substance . " For it is the finite taken as what it truly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infinite . If it seem shadowy and abstract , it is to be considered with what it is compared . What an abstraction is depends on what is taken away and what left behind . For instance , the Slavery question in our politics is sometimes termed an abstraction . Yes , surely , if the dollar is almighty , is the final reality , - if peace and comfort are alone worth living for ,  --  then the Slavery question and several other things are abstractions . So in the world of matter , if the chemical results are the reality of it , the appearance may well be considered as an abstraction . But this is not the view of Art ; Art has never magnified the materiality of the finite ; on the contrary , its history is only the record of successive attempts to dispose of matter , the failure always lying in the hasty effort to abolish it altogether in favor of an immaterial principle outside of it , something behind the phenomena , like Kant 's noumenon ,  --   - -  - too fine to exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , not spirit , but only a superfine kind of matter ; or as in a picture in the Cam*0 Saiito at Pisa , where the world is figured as a series of concentric circles , held up like a shield by God standing behind it . It may be asked , Was not the appearance , and this alone , from nil time , the object of Art ? But so long as the figment of a separate reality of the finite is kept up , an antagonism subsists between this and truth , and the appearance can not be frankly made the end , but has only an indirect , derivative value . In the classic it was the human form in superhuman perfection ; in the early Christian Art , God condescending to inhabit human shape ; in each cuse , what is given is felt to be negative to the reality , - a fiction , not the truth . But now the antagonism falls away , and the truth of Art is felt to be a higher power of the truth of Nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre , thus naively declaring mind and not matter to be the substance of the universe . It will see only this , feeling well that there is no other reality . It maybe said that Perspective is as much an outward mat*rial fact as any other . So it is , as soon as the point of sight is fixed . The mind alters nothing , but gives to the objects that coherency that makes them into a world . The universe has no existence for the idiot , not because it is not Ihere , but because he makes no image of it , or , as we say , does not mind it . The point of sight is the mark of a foregone action of the mind ; what is embraced in it is seen together , because it belongs to one conception . The effect can be simulated to a certain extent by mechanical contrivance ; but before the rules of perspective were systematized , the perspective of a picture betrays its history , tells how much of it was seen together , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still more or less mosaics , - their piecemeal origin confessed by slight indications in the midst even of very advanced technical skill . Thus , in Antonio Pollaiuolo 's " Three Archangels , " in the Florence Academy , - three admirably drawn figures , abreast , and about equally distant from the frame , the line of the right wing touches the head at the same point in each , with no allowance for their different relations to the centre of the picture . But there is a deeper kind of perspective , not so easily manufactured , though the manufacture of this , too , is often attempted , namely , Composition . The true ground of perspective in a picture is not a mechanical arrangement of lines , but a definite vision , - an affection of the painter by the subject , the net result of it in his mind , instantaneous and complete . It is a mistake to suppose that Composition is anything arbitrary , - that in the landscape out-of-doors we see the world as God made it , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the logic of vision ; an Uncomposed view is no more possible than an unlogical sentence . The eyes convey in each case what the mind is able to grasp ,  --  no less , no more . As to any particular work , it is always a question of fact what it amounts to ; the composition may be shallow , it may be bad , - the work of the understanding , not of the imagination , - put *together , instead of seen together . But a picture without composition would be the mathematical point . Mr. Ruskin thinks any sensible person would exchange his pictures , however good , for windows through which lie could see the scenes themselves . This does not quite meet the point , for it may be only a preference of quantity to quality . The window gives an infinitude of pictures ; the painter , whatever his merit , but one . A fair comparison would be to place by the side of the Turner drawing a photograph of the scene , which we will suppose taken at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as light and shade . Whoever should then prefer the photograph must be either more of a naturalist than an artist , or else a better artist than Turner . The photograph , supposing it to be perfect in it way , gives what is seen at a first glance , only with the optical part of the process expanded over the whole field , instead of being confined to one point , as the eye is . The picture in it is the first glance of the operator , as he selected it ; whatever delicacy of detail told in the impression on his mind tells in the impression on the plate ; whatever is more than that does not go to increase the richness of the result , as picture , but belongs to another sphere . The landscape - photographs that we have lately had in such admirable perfection , however they may overpower our judgment at first sight , will , I believe , be found not to wear well ; they have really less in them than even second - rate drawings , and therefore are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are where the subject is professedly a fragment , as in near foliage , tree-trunks , stone-texture ; or where the mind 's work is already dofie , and needs only to be reflected , as in buildings , sculpture , and , to a certain extent , portrait , - as far as the character has wrought itself into the clothes , habitual attitude , etc . Is not the popularity of the small full - length portrait-photographs owing to the predominance they give to this passive imprint of the mind 's past action upon externals over its momentary and elusive presence ? It is to the fillip received from the startling likeness of trivial details , exciting us to supply what is deficient in more important points , that is to be ascribed the leniency to the photograph on the part of near relatives and friends , who are usually hard to please with a painted likeness . But all comparisons between the photograph and the hand-drawn picture are apt to be vitiated by the confusion of various extraneous interests with a purely artistic satisfaction resting in the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the comparisons of Art with Nature . Of course , at bottom the interest is always that of the indwelling idea . But the question is , whether we stop at the outside , the material texture , or pass at once to the other extreme , the thought conveyed , or whether the two sides remain undistinguished . In the latter case only is our enjoyment strictly aesthetic , that is , attached to the hare perception of this particular thing ; in the others , it is not this thing that prevails , but the physical or moral qualities , the class to which it belongs . It is true all these qualities play in and influence or even constitute the impression that particular works of Art make upon us . One man admires a picture for its handling , its surface , the way in which the paint is laid on ; another , for its illustration of the laws of physiognomy ; another , because it reminds him of the spring he spent in Rome , the pleasant people he met there , etc . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure we feel ; but for any criticism we must quit these accidents and personalities , // and attend solely to that in the work which is unique , peculiar to it , that in which it suggests nothing , and associates itself with nothing , but refuses to ho classed or distributed . This may not be the most important aspect of the thing represented , nor the deepest interest that a picture can have ; but here , strictly speaking , lies all the beauty of it . The photojaph has or may have a certain value of this kind , but a little time is needful before we discriminate what is general and what is special . Its extraneous interest , as specimen , as instance only , tends at once to abate from the first view , as the mind classifies and disposes of it . What remains , not thus to be disposed of ; is its value as picture . Under this test , the photograph , compared with works of Art of a high order , will prove wanting in substance , thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too empty . For the result in each case must be proportionate to the impression that it echoes ; but this , in the work of the artist , is reinforced by all his previous study and experience , as well as by the force and delicacy which his perception has over that of other men . It is thus really more concrete , has more in it , than the actual scene . But when Composition is decried as artificial , what is meant is that it is artilice . It must be artificial , in the sense that all is there for the sake of the picture . But it is not to be the contrivance of the painter ; the purpose must be in the work , not in his head . Diotima , in Plato 's " Banquet , " tells Socrates that Eros desires not the beautiful , but to bring forth in the beautiful ; the creative impulse itself must be the motive , not anything ulterior . We require of the artist that he shall build better than he knows , - that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however correct or respectable , but an infinity , inexhaustible like Nature . He is to paint , as Turner said , only his impressions , and this precisely because they are not his , but stand outside of his will . To further this , to get the direct action of the artist 's instinct , clear of the meddling and patching of forethought and afterthought , is no doubt the aim of the seemingly careless , formless handling now in vogue , - the dash which Harding says makes all the difference between what is good and what is intolerable in water-colors ,  --  and the paletteknife-and-finger procedure of the French painters . The sin of premeditated ccimposition is that it is premeditated ; the why and wherefore is of less consequence . If the motive be extraneous to the work , a theory , not an instinct , it does not matter much how high it is . It is fatal to beauty to see in the thing only its uses , - in the tree only the planks , in Niagara only the water - power ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moral meaning of them , so far as it is consciously present in the artist 's mind , is just so far from the true intent of Art . This is the bane of the modern German school , both in landscape and history . They are laborious , learned , accurate , elevated in sentiment ; Kaulbach 's pictures , for instance , are complete treatises upon the theme , both as to the conception and the drawing , grouping , etc. ; but it is mostly as treatises that they have interest . So the allegories in Albert Diirer 's " Melancholia " are obstructive to it as a work of Art , and just in proportion to their value as thoughts . The moral meaning in a picture , and its fidelity to fact , may each serve as measure of its merit after it is done . They must each be there , for its aim is to express after its own fashion the reality that lurks in every particle of matter . But it is for the spectator to see them , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the motive , - to preach morality to Art , or to require from the artist an inventory of the landscape . That five or ten million pines grow in a Swiss valley is no reason why every one of them should be drawn . No doubt every one of them has its reason for being there , and it is conceivable that an exhaustive final statement might require 1864.1 319 // them all to be shown . But there are no final statements in this world , least of all in Art . There are many things besides pines in the valley , and more important , and they can he drawn meanwhile . Besides , if all the pines , why not every pebble and blade of grass ? The earnestness that attracts us in mediieval Art , the devout fervor of the earlier time and the veracity of the later , the deference of the painter to his theme , is profoundly interesting as history , but it was conditioned also by the limitations of that age . The mediieval mind was oppressed by a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's work , and ruled by him ; but it is not His dwelling-place , but only his footstool . The Divine spirit penetrates into the world of matter at certain points and to a certain depth , does not possess and inhabit it now and here , but only elsewhere and at a future time , in heaven , and at the final Judgment ; and meantime the Church and the State are to maintain His jurisdiction over this outlying province as well as they can . The actual presence of God in the world would seem to drag Him down into questionable limitations , not to be assumed without express warrant , as exception , miracle , and in things consecrated and set apart . Hence the patchwork composition of the early painters ; we see in it an extreme diversity of value ascribed to the things about them . It is a world partly divine and partly rubbish ; not a universe , but a collection of fragments from various worlds . The figures in their landscapes do not tread the earth as if they belonged there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the occasion . The earth is a desert upon which stones have been laid and herbs stuck into the crevices . The trees are put together out of separate leaves and twigs , and the rocks and mountains inserted like posts . In the earliest specimens the figures themselves have the same piecemeal look : their members are not born together , but put together . We see just how far the soul extends into them , - sometimes only to the eyes , then to the rest of the features , afterwards to the limbs and extremities . Evidently the artist 's conception left much outside of it , to be added by way of label or explanation . In the trees , the care is to give the well-known fruit , the acorn or the apple , not the character of the tree ; for what is wanted is only an indication what tree is meant : The only tie between man and the material world is the use he makes of it , elaborating and turning it into something it was not . Hence the trim orderliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods or the mountains , but only dread and dislike , and draws his tropes from engineering , from shipyards , moats , embankments . The mediieval conception is higher than the antique ; it recognizes a reality beyond the immediate , but not yet that it is the reality of the immediate and present also . But Art must dislodge this phantom of a lower , profane reality , and accept its own visions as authentic and sufficient . The modern mind is in this sense less religious than the medieval , that the antithesis of phenomenal and real is less present to it . But the pungency of this antithesis comes from an imperfect realization of its meaning . Just so far as the subjection of the finite remains no longer a postulate or an aspiration , but is carried into effect ,  --  its finiteness no longer resisted or deplored , but accepted ,  --  just so far it ceases tobe opaque and inert . The present seems trivial and squalid , because it is clutched and held fast ,  --  the fugitive image petrified into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it becomes transparent , and reveals the fair lines of the ideal . The complaints of want of earnestness , devoutness , in modern Art , are as shortsighted as Schiller 's lament over the prosaic present , as a world bereft of the gods . It is a loss to which we can well resign ourselves , that we no longer see God throned on Olympus , or anywhere else outside of the world . It is no misfortune that the mind has recognized under these alien forms a spirit akin to itself , and // therefore no longer gives bribes to Fate by setting up images to it . The deity it worships is thenceforth no longer powerless to exist , nor is there any existence out of him ; it needs not , then , to provide a limbo for him in some sphere of abstraction . What has fled is not the divinity , but its false isolation , its delegation to a corner of the universe . Instead of the god with his whims , we have law universal , the rule of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmative . That the sun is no longer the chariot of Helios , but a gravitating fireball , is only the other side of the perception that it is mind embodied , not some unrelated entity for which a charioteer must be deputed . We no longer worship groves and fountains , nor Madonnas and saints , and our Art accordingly can no longer have the fervency , since its objects have not the concreteness , that belonged to former times . But it is to be noticed that Art can be devout only in proportion as Religion is artistic , - that is , as matter , and not spirit , is the immediate object of worship . Art and Religion spring from the same root , but coincide only at the outset , as in fetichism , the worship of the Black Stone of the Caaba , or the wonderworking Madonnas of Italy . The fetich is at once image and god ; the interest in the appearance is not distinct from the interest in the meaning . It needs neither to be beautiful nor to be understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the idol , the two sides are separated . It is no longer this thing merely , but , on the one hand , spirit , above and beyond matter , and , on the other , the appearance , equally self- sufficing and supreme among earthly things , just because its reality is not here , but elsewhere , - appearance , therefore , as transcendent , or Beauty . To every age the religion of the foregoing seems artificial , incumbered with forms , and its Art superstitious , overscrupulous , biased by considerations that have nothing to do with Art . Hence religious reformers are mystics , enthusi asts : this is the look of Luther , even of the hard-headed Calvin , as seen from the Roman - Catholic side . Hence , also , every epoch of revolution in Art seems to the preceding like an irruption of frivolity and profanity . Christian Art would have seemed so to the ancients ; the Realism of the fourteenth century must have seemed so to the Giottesehi and the Renaissance , to both . The term Pre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring together such men as FrIL Angelico , Filippo Lippi , and Luca Signorelli , has so far an intelligible basis , that all this period , from Giotto to Raphael , amidst all diversities , is characterized throughout by a deference of Art to something extraneous . It is not beauty that Frh An*elico looks for , but holiness , or beauty as expressin , * this ; it is not beauty that draws Filippo Lippi , but homely actuality . It is from this point of view that the Renaissance has been attacked as wanting in faith , earnestness , humility . The Renaissance had swallowed all formulas . Nothing was in itself sacred , but all other considerations were sacrificed to the appeal to the eye . But this , so far from proving any " faithlessness , " shows , on the contrary , an entire faith in their Art , that it was able to accomplish what was required of it , and needed not to be bolstered up by anything external . Mr. Ruskin wants language to express his contempt for Claude , because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he paints only a graceful landscape , in which the Bush is rather inconspicuous . But Claude might well reply , that what he intended was not a history , nor a homily , but a picture ; that the name was added for convenience ' sake , as he might name his son , John , without meaning any comparisons with the Evangelist . It is no defect , but a merit , that it requires nothing else than itself to explain it . Claude depicts " an unutilized earth , " whence all traces of care , labor , sorrow , rapine , and want , - all that can suggest the perils and trials of life ,  --  is removed . The buildings are palaces or picturesque // March , ruins ; the personages promenade at leisure , or only pretend to be doing something . All action and story , all individuality of persons , objects , and events , is merged in a pervading atmosphere of tranquil , sunny repose ,  --  as of a holiday-afternoon . It may seem to us an idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - Mr. Ruskin sees in it only a " dim , stupid , serene , leguminous enjoyment . " But whoever knows Rome will at least recognize in Claude 's pictures some reflex of that enchantment that still hangs over the wondrous city , and draws to it generation after generation of pilgrims . In what does the mysterious charm consist ? Is it not that the place seems set apart from the working-day world of selfish and warring interests ? that here all manner of men , for once , lay aside their sordid occupations and their vulgar standards , to come together on the ground of a common humanity ? It is easy to sneer at the Renaissance , but to understand it we must take it in its connection . The matters that interested that age seem now superfluous , the recreations of a holiday rather than the business of life . But coming from the dust and din of the fifteenth century , it looks differently . It was , in whatever dim or fantastic shape , a recognition of universal brotherhood , - of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sympathy , were it only for a picnic . In this villeygiatura of the human race the immediate aim is no very lofty one , - not truth , not duty , but to please or be pleased . But who is it that is to be pleased ? INot the great of the earth , not the consecrated of the Church , not the men merely of this guild or this nation , but Man . It is the festival of the new saint , Humanus , - a joyful announcement that the ancient antagonism is not fundamental , but destined to be overcome . This dreamy , half- sad , but friendly and soothing influence , that breathes from Claude 's landscapes , is not the highest*that Nature can inspire , but it is far better than to see in the earth only food , lodging , and a place to fight in , or even mere background and fillmo ' - in . The builders of the Rhine-castles looked down the reaches of the river only to spy out their prey or their enemy ; the monks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - garden , but any interest beyond that would have been heathenish and dangerous . Whilst to the ancients the earth had value only as enjoyable , inhabitable , the earlier Christian ages valued it only as uninhabitable , as a wilderness repelling society . lathe earliest medkeval landscapes , the effort to represent a wilderness that is there only for the sake of the hermits leads to the curious contradiction of a populous hermitage , every part of it occupied by figures resolutely bent on being alone , and sedulously ignoring the others . Humboldt quotes from the early Fathers some glowing descriptions of natural scenery , but they turn always upon the seclusion from mankind , and upon the contrast between the grandeur of God 's works and the littleness of ours . But in Claude we have the hint , however crude , of a relation as unsordid as this , but positive and direct , - the soul of the landscape speaking at once to the soul of man , - showing itself cognate , already friendly , and needing only to throw off the husk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the purely pictorial , that he postpones the facts or the story to beauty , but that he does not defer enough , that he does not sufficiently trust his own eyes , but by way of further assurance drags in architecture , ships , mythological or Scripture stories , not caring for them himself , but supposing the spectator cares , so that they remain unassimilated , a scum floating on the surface and obscurin* the work . Here is the " want of faith " with which , if any , he is justly chargeable , - that beauty is not enough for him , but he must make it pleasing . Pleasingness implies a languid acceptance , in which the mind is spared the shock of fresh suggestion or incitement . We call the Venus de ' Medici , for instance , a pleasing statue , but the // Venus of Milo beautiful ; because in the we find in fuller measure only what as already accepted and agreeable ; whilst in the other we feel the presence of an unexplored and formidable personality , provoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range and extent . This deference to the spectator marks the decline of Art from the supremacy of its position as the interpreter of religion to mankind . The work is no longer a revelation devoutly received by the artist and piously transmitted to a believing world ; but he is a cultivated man , who gives what is agreeable to a cultivated society , where the Bible is treated with de But the Renaissance had its religion , too , - namely , Culture . The one " virtue , " acknowledged on all hands , alike by busy merchants , soldiers , despots , women , the acquaintance with Greek and Roman literature and art , was not quite the idle dilettanteism it seems . Lorenzo de ' Medici said , that , without the knowl edge of the t*latonic philosophy , it was hard to be a good citizen and Christian . Leo X. thought , " Nothing more excellent or more useful has been given by the Cre ator to mankind , if we except only the knowledge and true worship of Himself , than these studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life , but are applicable and useful to every qwq show and outside , is no reproach , but means only that it was not a mere gal vanizing of dead bones , that a new spir it was masqueradin* in these garments . Had it been in earnest in its revival of the past , it would have been insignifi cant ; its disregard of the substance , and care for the form alone , showed that the form was used only as a protest against the old forms . A provincial nar rowness , even a slight air of vulgarity , was felt to attach to the teachings of the Church . Gentility had come to im ply not only heathendom , ( " gentilis est qui in Christum non credit , " ) but liberal breeding . The attraction of the classic culture , " the humanities , " as it was well called , was just this cosmopolitan large ness , that it had no prejudices and pre scribed no test , but was open to all kinds of merit and every manner of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance , frequently excmplifles this feeling , perhaps nowhere more strik ingly than in the account of his pilgrimage to the temple of Minerva at Assisi , which he lovingly describes , remarking , at the same time , that he passed with only aver sion the Church of St. Francis , with its frescos by Cimabue , Giotto , and their followers , which no traveller of our day willin , , ly misses or soon forgets , though the temple may probably occupy but a er men brought much of what they were from the fifteenth century , but even Raphael is too academic . It is not a Chinese deference to tradition , nor conformity to a fixed national taste , such as ruled Greek Art as by an organic necessity . One knows not whether to wonder most at the fancied need to attach to the work the stamp of classic authority , or at the levity with which the venerable forms of antiquity are treated . Nothing can be more superficial than this varnish of classicality . The names of Cicero , Brutus , Augustus were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , or of any others , or of the times they lived in , was very slightly realized . The classic architecture , with its cogent adaptatipn and sequence of parts , is cut up into theatrescenery : its " members " are members no longer , but scraps to be stuck about at will . The gods and heroes of the ancient world have become the pageant of a holiday even the sacred legends of the Church receive only an outward respect , and at last not even that . Claude wants a foreground-figure and puts in *neas , Diana , or Moses , he cares little which , and he would hear , unmoved , Mr. Ruskin 's eloquent denunciation of their utter unfitness for the assumed character , and the absurdity of the whole action of the piece . // small space in his memory . " I made no doubt , " says Goethe , " that all the heads there bore the same stamp as my Captain 's , " - *n Italian officer , more orthodox than enlightened , with whom he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , the Italian Renaissance was the counterpart of the German Reformation , and , like that , a declaration that God is not shut up in a corner of the universe , nor His revelation restricted in regard of time , place , or persons . The day was long p*ast when the Church was synonymous with civilization . The Church-ideal of holiness had long since been laid aside ; a new world had grown up , in which other aims and another spirit prevailed . Macchiavelli thought the Church had nothing to do with worldly affairs , could do nothing for the State or for freedom . And the Church thought so , too . If it was left out of the new order of things , it was because it had left itself out . " The world " was godless , pompa Diaboli ; devotion to God implied devotion ( of the world ) to the Devil . But the world , thus cut adrift , found itself yet alive and vigorous , and began thenceforth to live its own life , leaving the " other world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the State or the individual , it was felt must come from individual effort , and not be conferred as a stamp or visa from the Pope and the College of Cardinals . It was not Religion that was dead , but only the Church . The Church being petrified into a negation , Culture , the religion of the world , was necessarily ne*ative to that , and for a time absorbed in the mere getting rid , of obstructions . Sainthood had never been proposed even as an ideal for all mankind , but only as fuga sceculi , the avoidance of all connection with human affairs . Logically , it must lead to the completest isolation , and find its best exponent in Simeon Stylites . The new ideal of Culture must involve firstof all the getting rid of isolation , natural and artificial . Its representatives are such men as Leonardo da Vinci and LeonBattista Alberti , masters of all arts and sciences , travelled , well-bred , at home in the universe , - thoroughly accom**r ed men of the world , with senses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of splendid figures ; whatever growth there was in any country came now to its floweringtime . The drawback is want of purpose . This splendor looks only to show ; there is no universal aim , no motive except whim , - the whims of men of talent , or the whim of the crowd . For the approbation of the Church is substituted the applause of cultivated society , a wider convention , but conventional still . This is the frivolous side of the Renaissance , not its holding light the old traditions , but that for the traditions it rejected it had nothing but tradition to substitute . But if this declaration of independence was at first only a claim for license , not for liberty , this is only what was natural , and may be said of Protestantism as well . Protestantism , too , had its orthodoxy , and has not even yet quite realized that the private judgment whose rights it vindicated does not mean personal whim , and therefore is not fortified by the assent of any man or body of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thought , which is necessarily individual , and at the same time of universal validity ; whereas , personality is partial , belongs to the crowd , and to that part of the man which confounds him with the crowd . Were the private judgment indeed private , it would have no rights . Off what consequence the private judgments of a tribe of apes , or of Bushmen ? This reference to the bystanders means only an appeal from the Church ; it is at bottom a declaration that the truth is not a miraculous exception , a falsehood which for this particular occasion is called truth , but the substance of the universe , apparent everywhere , and to all that seek it . The perception must be its own evidence , it must be true for us , now and here . We have no ri , ght to blame the Renaissance painters for their love of show , for Art exists for show , and the due fulfilment of its // purpose , bringing to the surface what was dimly indicated , must engage it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to a hidden ulterior meaning more and more a mere pretence . What was once Thought has now become form , color , surface ; to make a mystery of it would be thoughtlessness or hypocrisy . The shortcoming is not in the artists , but in Art . Painting shares the same fate as Sculpture : not only is the soul not a thing , it is not wholly an appearance , but combines with its appearing a constant protest against the finality of it . Not only is the body an inadequate manifestation , but what it manifests is itself progressive , and any conception of it restrictive and partial . Henceforth any representation of the human form must either pretend a mystery that is not felt , or , if inspired by a nenuine interest , it must be of a lower kind , and must avoid of set purpose any undue exaltation of one part over another , as of the face over the limbs , and dwell rather upon harmony of lines and colors , wherein nothing shall be prominent at the expense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iiitensity , in inward meaning , by allusion , by an interest reflected from without , instead of the immediate and intuitive . We often feel , even in Raphael 's pictures , that the aim is lower than , for instance , Fr*i Angelico 's . But it is at least genuine , and what that saves us from we may see in some of Perugino 's and Pinturicchio 's altar-pieces , where spirituality means kicking heels , hollow cheeks , and a deadly-sweet smile . That Raphael , among all his Holy Families , painted only one Madonna di San Sisto , and that hastily , on trifling occasion , shows that it was a chance - hit rather than the normal fruit of his genius . The beauty that shines like celestial flame from the face of th' divine child , and the transfigured humanity of the mother , are no denizens of earth , but fugitive radiances that tinge it for a moment and are gone . For once , the impossible is achieved ; the figures hover , dreamlike , disconnected from all around , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , but beyond it . But it is a casual success , not to be sought or expected . A wise instinct made the painter in general shun such direct , explicit statement , and rather treat the subject somewhat cavalierly than allow it to confront and confound him . The greater he is , and the more complete his development , the more he must dread whatever makes his Art secondary or superfluous . Whatever force we give to the reproach of want of elevation , etc. , the only impossible theme is the unartistic . But before we give heed to any such reproach we must beware of confounding the personality of the artist or the fashion of the time with the movin* spirit in both . He works always - as Michel Angelo complained that he was painting the ceiling of the Sistine-over his own head , and blinded by his own paint . The perpose that we speak of is not his petty domn*s and intentions , but what he unintentionally accomplishes . It is the spiritual alone that interests ; and if later Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly the effect of its juster appreciation , that rendered direct expression hopeless , but at the same time superfluous , by discovering the same import more accessible elsewhere , as the higher indirect meaning of all material things . Critics tell us that the charm of landscape is incomplete without the presence of man , - that there must always be some hint , at least , of human habitation or influence . Certainly it is always a human interest , it is not the timber an ( l the water , that moves us , but the echo of a kindred mind . But in the " landscape and figures " it is hardly a human interest that we take in the figures . The . " dull victims of pipe and mug " serve our turn perhaps better than the noblest mountaineers . It is not to them that we look for the spirit of the landscape , - rather anywhere else . It is the security of ' the perception that allows it to dispense with pointed demonstration , and to delight rather in obscurer intimations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - a beauty not detachable , belonging to the picture , to the composition , not to the component parts . It has no favorites ; it is violated alike by the systematic glorification and the systematic depreciation of particular forms . The Apollo Belvedere would make as poor a figure in the foreground of a modern landscape as a fisherman in jack-boots and red nightcap on a pedestal in the Vatican . Claude 's or Turner 's figures may be absurd , when taken by themselves ; but the absurdity consists in taking them by themselves . Turner , it is said , could draw figures well ; Claude probably could not ; ( he is more likely to have tried ; ) but each must have felt that anything that should call attention to the figures would be worse than any had drawing . Nicolas Poussin was well called " the learned " ; for it is his learning , his study of the antique , of Raphael , of drapery and anatomy , that most appears in his landscapes and gives his figures their plastic emphasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the boundary-lines can not , be very exactly drawn ; the genius of a Delaroche or a Millais will give interest to a figure-piece at whatever epoch . But such pictures as Etty 's , or Page 's Venus , where the beauty of the human body is the point of attraction , are fiat anachronisms , and for this reason , not from any prudishness of the public , can never excite a hearty enthusiasm . From the sixteenth century downwards all pictures becime more and more tableaux de genre , - the piece is not described by the nominal subject , but only the class to which it belongs , leaving its special character wholly undetermined . And in proportion as the action and the detail are dwelt upon , the more evident.is it that the theme is only a pretence . Martyrdoms , when there was any fervency of faith in the martyrs , were very abstract . A hint of sword or wheel sufficed . The saints and the angels , as long as men believed in them , carried their witness in their faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as direct rep-March , resentation is aimed at and the event portrayed as an historical fact , it is proof enough that all direct interest is gone and nothing left but the technical problem . The martyrdoms are vulgar cxecution-scenes ,  --  the angels , men sprawling upon clouds . Michel Angelo was a noble , devout man , but it is clear that the God he prayed to was not the God he painted . This essential disparity between idea and representation is the weak side of Art , plastic and pictorial ; but because it is essential it is not felt by the artist as defect . His genius urges him to all advance that is possible within the limits of his Art , but not to transcend it . It will he in vain to exhort him to unite the ancient piety to the modern knowledge . If he listen to the exhortation , he may be a good critic , hut he is no painter . He must be absorbed in what he sees to the exclusion of everything else ; impartiality is a virtue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a onesidedness ; either the conception or the embodying of it halts , is only partially realized ; some incompleteness , some mystery , some apparent want of coincidence between form and meaning is a necessity to the artist , and if he does not find it , he will invent it . Hence the embarrassment of some of the English Pre - Raphaclitists , particularly in dealing with the human form . They have no hesitation in pursuing into still further minuteness the literal delineation of inanimate objects , draperies , etc. ; but they shrink from giving full life to their figures , not from a slavish adherence to their exemplars , but from a dread lest it should seem that what is shown is all that is meant . The early painters were thus nc*'ce and distinct because of their limitations ; they knew very well what they meant ,  --  as , that the event took place outof*doors , with the sun shining , the grass under-foot , an oak-tree here , a strawberry-vine there , - mere adjunct and byplay , not to be questioned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took care of . But who can say what a modern landscape means ? The si*nificance // On the Relation of Art to Nature . that in the older picture was as it ' were outside of it , presupposed , assured elsewhere , has now to be incorporated , verily present in every atom of soil and film of vapor . The realism of the modern picture must be infinitely more extended , for the meaning of it is that nothing is superfluous or insignificant . But with the reality that it lends to every particle of matter , it must introduce , at the same time , the protest that spirit makes against matter , - most distinct , indeed , in the human form and countenance , but nowhere absent . In its utmost explication there must be felt that there is yet more behind ; its utmost distinctness must be everywhere indefinable , evanescent , - must proclaim that this parade of surfaceappearance is not there for its own sake . This is what Mr. Ruskin calls " the pathetic fallacy " : but there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the guise of mystery . Turner said that Mr. iRuskin bad put all sorts of meanings into his pictures that he knew nothing about . Of course , else they would never have got into the pictures . But this does not affect their validity , but means only that it is the imagination , not the intellect , that must apprehend them . It is not an outward , arbitrary incompleteness that is demanded , but a visible ( lependence of each part , by its partiality declaring the completeness of the whole . It is often said that the picture must " leave room for the imagination . " Yes , and for nothinig else ; but this does not imply that it should be unfinished , but that , wben the painter has set down what the imagination grasped in one view , he shall stop , no matter wbere , and not attempt to eke out the deficiency by formula or by knack of fingers . Wherever the inspiration leaves him , there is an end of the picture . Beyond that we get only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can avail him ; he is only mystifying himself or us . At these points we sooner or later come up with him , are as good as he , and the work forthwith begins to tire . What is tiresome is to have thrust upon us the dead surface of matter : this is the prose of the world , which we come to Art to escape . It is prosaic , because it is seen as the understanding sees it , as an aggregate only , apart from its vital connection ; it matters little whose the understanding The artist must be alive only to the is. totality of the impression , blind and deaf to all outside of that . He must believe that the idyl he sees in the landscape is there because he sees it , and will appear in the picture without the help of demonstration . The danger is , that from weakness of faith he will fancy or pretend that he sees something else , which may be there , but formed no part of the impression . It is simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take up and carry ; all beyond that is hindrance , and any conscious endeavor of his can not help , but can only thwart . The picturesque has its root in the mind 's craving for totality . It is Nature seen as a whole ; all the characteristics and prerequisites of it come back to this , - such as roughness , wildness , ruin , ob-* scurity , the gloom of night or of storm ; whatever the outward discrepancy , wherever the effect is produced , it is because in some way there is a gain in completeness . On this condition everything is welcome ,  --  without it , nothing . Thus , a broken , weedy bank is more picturesque than the velvet slope , - the decayed oak than the symmetry of the sapling ,  - -  the squalid shanty by the railroad , with its base of dirt , its windows stuffed with old hats , and the red shirts dependent from its eaves , than the neatest brick cottage . They strike a richer accord , while the others drone on a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass and breadth for the oh-. trusiveness of petty particulars . It is not the pettiness , but the particularity , that makes them unpicturesque . No impressiveness in the object can atone for exclusiveness . Niagara can not be painted , not because it is too difficult , but hecause it is no landscape , but like a v*mst 1864.1 // March , illuminated capital letter filling the whole page , or the sublime monotony of the mosque - inscriptions , declaring in thousandfold repetition that God is great . The soaring sublimity of the Moslem monotheism comes partly from its narrowness and abstractness . Is it because w* are a little hard of bearing that it takes such reiteration to move us ? The wholeness which the imagination demands is not quantitative , but qualitative ; it has nothing to do with size or with number , except so far as , by confusing the sense , they obscurely intimate infinity , with which all quantities are incommensurable . Mr. Ruskin 's encyclopedic anatomizing of the landscape , to the end of showing the closeness of Turner 's perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a longer list , for it is to be remembered that the longest list would be no nearer to an exhaustive analysis than the shortest . It is not a specious completeness , but a sense of infinity that can never he completed , - greater intensity , not greater extension , - that distinguishes modern landscapeart . Hence there is no incongruity in the seeming license that it takes with the firm order of Nature . It is in no spirit of levity or profanity that the substantial distinctions of things are thus disregarded , - that all absolute rank is denied , and the value of each made contingent and floating . It is only that the mind is somewhat nearer apprehending the sense , and dwefls less on the characters . If Art suffers in its relative rank among human interests by this democratic levelling , it is to the gain of what Art intends . It is true , no picture can henceforth move us as men were once moved by pictures . iNo Borgo Allegro will ever turn out again in triumph for a Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner or another may excite comes far short of that . But the splendor that clothed the poor , pale , formal image belonged very little to it , but expressed rather the previous need of utterance , and could reach that pitch only when the age had not yet learned to think and to write , but must put up with these hieroglyphics . Art has no more grown unreligious than Religion has , but only less idolatrous . Asfast as religion passes into life , - as the spiritual nature of man begins to be recognized as the ground of legislation and society , and not merely in the miracle of sainthood , - the apparatus and imagery of the Church , its dogmas and ceremonies , grow superfluous , as what they stand for is itself present . It is the dawn that makes these stars grow pale . So in Art , as fast as the dream of the imagination becomes the common sense of m*ankind , and only so fast , the awe that surrounded the earlier glimpses is lost . Its influence is not lessened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truly popular philosophy . Our picture-gazing and view-hunting only express the feeling that our science is too abstract , that it does not attach us , but isolates us in the universe . What we are thus inwardly drawn to explore is not the chaff and exuvice of things , not their differences only , but their central connection , in spite of apparent diversity . This , stated , is the Ideal , the abrupt contradiction of the actual , and the creation of a world extraordinary , in which all defect is removed . But the defect can not be cured by correction , for that admits its right to exist ; it is not by exclusion that limitation is overcome , - this is only to establish a new limitation , - but by inclusion , by reaching the point where the superficial antagonism vanishes . Then the ideal is seen no longer in opposition , but everywhere and alone existent . As this point is approached , the impulse to reconstruct the actual - as if the triumph of truth were staked on that venture - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is most elaborate and circumstantial , and latest where the image has least materiality and fixity , where it is only a reminder of what the actual is securely felt to be , in spite of . its stubborn exterior . // The modern mind is therefore less demonstrative ; our civilization seeks less to declare and typify itself outwardly in works of Art , manners , dress , etc . Hence it is , perhaps , that the beauty of the race has not kept pace with its culture . It is less beautiful , because it cares less for beauty , since this is no longer the only reconcilement of the actual with the inward demands . The vice of* the imagination is its inevitable exaggeration . It is our own weakness and dulness that we try to hide from ourselves by this partiality . Therefore it was said that the ima* , es were the Bible of the laity . Bishop Durandus already in the thirteenth century declared that it is only where the truth is not yet revealed that this " Judaizing " is permissible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . In this the superficial antagonisms of use and beauty , of fact and reality , disappear . A little gain here , or the hint of it , richly repays all the lost magnificence . We need not concern ourselves lest these latter ages should be left bankrupt of the sense of beauty , for that is but a phase of a force that is never absent ; nothing can supersede it but itself in a higher power . What we lament as decay only shows its demands fulfilled , and the arts it has left behind are but the landmarks of its accomplished purpose .
