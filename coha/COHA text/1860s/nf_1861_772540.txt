txt The Spirit Proper to the Times . A SERMON PREACHED IN KING 'S CHAPEL , BOSTON , SUNDAY , MAY 12 , 1861 . BY JAMES WALKER , D.D . PRINTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE WARDENS OF THE SOCIETY . BOSTON : PRESS OF GEO . C. RAND &; AVERY , NO. 3 CORNHILL . 1861 . SERMON . " With such sacrifices God is well pleased . "  --  Hebrews xiii . 16 . I am to speak of public spirit , as manifested in a willingness to make sacrifices for the public good . The necessity for making sacrifices would seem to be founded in this : as we can not have every thing , we must be willing to sacrifice some things in order to obtain or secure others . Wicked men recognize and act upon this principle . Can you not recall more than one person in your own circle of acquaintances who is sacrificing his health , his good name , his domestic comfort , to vicious indulgences ? Worldly people recognize and act upon this principle . Look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands , but in order to do so , is he not sacrificing every thing which makes life worth having ? It is a mistake to suppose that religion , or morality , or the public necessities , ever call upon us to make greater sacrifices than those which men are continually making to sin and the world , to fashion and fame , to " the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life . " In times of ease , and abundance , and tranquillity , the public takes care of itself . There are few sacrifices on the part of individuals for the public good , because there are few occasions for such sacrifices . They are not made because not called for , because not needed . Moreover , private benevolence is apt at such times to become less active , and , for the same reason , that is to say , because less of it is required . This state of things is seized upon by those who are eager to put the worst possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extreme degeneracy . How often are we to be told that our present troubles are sent upon us in order to lift the whole community out of the mire of money-getting propensities , where every thing like public spirit was in danger of being swallowed up and lost ? I protest against this wholesale abuse of what has been ,  --  at best , a gross exaggeration . The whole truth in this matter is told in a few words . By constitution , by habit , by circumstances , our people are intensely active ; and this activity , for want of other objects , has been turned into the channels of material prosperity . If , therefore , you merely affirm their excessive eagerness in acquisition , I grant it ; but if , not content with this , you go on to charge them with being niggards in expending what they have acquired , I deny it , emphatically , utterly . Read the history of what has been done in this commonwealth , in this city , during the last twenty-five years for humanity , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of public use or human need , and then say , if you can , that public spirit has been dying out . Our people have never been otherwise than public spirited , and hence the promptness and unanimity of their response to this new call to public duty . Hence also our confidence in it ,  --  not as an excitement merely , which a day has made , and a day may unmake , but as an expression of character . Let us , however , be just to the excitement itself , considered as the sudden and spontaneous uprising of a whole community to sustain the government . We need demonstrations of this kind , from time to time , to reassure us that all men have souls . It is worth a great deal merely as an experiment , on a large scale , to prove that the moral and social instincts are as much a part of human nature as the selfish instincts . But he must be a superficial observer who can see nothing in this vast movement but the play of instincts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what passes for loyalty or patriotism in other countries is blind impulse , growing out of mere attachment to the soil , or the power of custom , or a helpless feeling of dependence on things as they are . " If my father in his grave could hear of this war , " said a Spanish peasant , " his bones would not rest . " Yet what earthly interest , what intelligible concern had Spanish peasants in the rivalships and struggles of princes who thought of nothing but their own or their family aggrandizement . Of such loyalty , of such patriotism , there never has been much in this country , and there never will be . The loyal and patriotic States have risen up as one man to maintain the government , because the government represents the great ideas of order and liberty . It is not an excitement of irritation merely , or of wounded vanity , or of a selfish and discomfited ambition . It is , as I have said , a great moral force , a reverence for order and liberty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an excitement resting on solid and intelligible principle , and one , therefore , which trial and sacrifice will be likely to convert into earnest and solemn purpose . I suppose some are full of concern as to the effect which trial and sacrifice will really have on this new outbreak of public spirit . They fear that suffering for our principles will abate our confidence in them , or at least our interest in them , and so the ardor will die away . So doubtless , it will in some cases , for every community has its representatives of " the seed that was sown on stony ground " ; but it will be the exception and not the rule . Human nature , if it has fair play , will never lead a single individual to think less of a privilege or blessing , merely because it has cost more . When has religion interested men the most , and the most generally ? Precisely at those times when men were religious at the greatest sacrifices . Indeed , it is on this principle that we explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last twenty or thirty years ; it is because we have had so little to do for our country . A foreign war , even a famine or a pestilence , if it had been sufficiently severe , would have saved us from our present trouble and humiliation . So long as the people think and feel together , they hold each other up , and the sacrifices in which they express their public spirit , instead of wearing it out , will purify it and keep it alive . And this is not all . From the language sometimes used in speaking of sacrifices for the public good , it might almost be supposed that the making of them is simply painful , simply distressing . But is it so ? Of course both instinct and duty impel us to look out for ourselves ; but is it not equally true that both instinct and duty impel us to help one another , and provide for the common weal ? A generous and noble deed ,  --  simply painful , simply distressing ! I will not deny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may bring here and there one to look on things in this light , but not until he is , in the language of Scripture , " without natural affection . " " Public spirit , " so an eminent jurist has defined it , " is the whole body of those affections which unite men 's hearts to the commonwealth . " What I insist upon is , that these are real and natural affections , and that , in acting them out , we find a real and natural satisfaction . Who will say that the happiest moments of his existence have not been those in which he was conscious of living for others , and not for himself ? There are many things in the present aspect of our public affairs to fill us with regret and anxiety , but a gleam of light shines through the cloud . Every man and woman and child will be moved to act more unselfishly , more nobly ; life will cost more , but it will also be worth more . It is extremely difficult to do justice to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such mean and little things , of such noble and great things . There is , however , one distinction which all , I suppose , will accord to it : I mean its tendency to rise up and meet great emergencies . In every soul that lives there is an untold amount of latent energy and public spirit which only waits for the occasion to call it forth . Read the history of the Netherlands ,  --  a people made up , for the most part , of merchants and manufacturers , of traders and artisans , growing rich and apparently thinking of little else . A blow is struck at the free institutions which they had inherited from their ancestors ; immediately a new spirit reveals itself , and all Europe rings with the story of their heroic daring and suffering . The sacrifices which the country asks for in time of war are those of property , labor , and life ; and she does not ask in vain . We are continually reminded that this rebellion has taken place at a moment of great national prosperity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thousand ways , must be immense ; every man , however , from his diminished fortune , is " ready to distribute , " and " not grudgingly or of necessity . " His public spirit makes him love to give . I doubt whether it is common for rich men to think any better of themselves merely because they are rich ; but if they can make their riches , and their financial skill , available to save the State , they will think better of themselves , and they will have a right to do so . There is a natural jealousy of wealth , especially when it takes the form of a passion for accumulation , which demagogues and fanatics know how to use for bad ends . One of the incidental benefits resulting from a great national struggle is , that all these social misunderstandings and heart-burnings are suspended , are healed . The people see and feel and acknowledge that a real title to nobility is found , not in wealth itself , but in wealth generously and nobly bestowed . Others are manifesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here I wish I could find fit terms in which to acknowledge the services and sufferings of women . You have heard of the Spartan mother equipping her son for battle , and giving him , last of all , the shield , with the brief and stern farewell , " With it or on it . " We expect no such stoicism now , but we expect what is better . We expect that Christian mothers , with hearts bleeding for their country , and bleeding for their children , will say , " It is the will of God that they should go , " and , furthermore , that they will go , having always been taught at home that there are many things worse than death . And then how many fingers are busily at work in all classes , rich and poor alike , to provide for the comfort of those who go ? They even ask for the privilege of tending the sick and wounded . How many , brought up in ease and affluence , would follow in the steps of her whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedside of the dying soldier was as a glimpse of heaven . I have heard men call this " romance . " But is it well , or right , or tolerable , in times like these , to look round for side motives , when the motive avowed is reasonable and probable ? I believe , as I believe I live , that many who never knew what it is to work before , are ready to thank God for the chance they now have to live to some purpose . But will our men fight ? There is no denying that this word sounds disagreeably in a Christian discourse ; still , I have no misgivings in respect to it ,  --  no extravagances to take back ; not the beginning of a doubt but that there are wars which , on one side at least , are necessary , and just , and holy . The Bible contains no express and unqualified prohibition of war ; neither can such prohibition be said to be intimated or implied in any text or in the general tenor of Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of civil government . Besides , I remember that the first person not a Jew , in whose favor our Lord wrought a miracle , was a Roman centurion ; and that the first person not a Jew admitted into the Christian church , was also a Roman centurion ; and not a syllable is said against their calling , neither is there a shadow of evidence that they ever changed it . Undoubtedly it is the legitimate and certain tendency of the spirit of the gospel , as it is more and more diffused in the world , to introduce universal peace ; but the spirit of the gospel acts from within outwardly , and not from without inwardly . Thus the stop to be put to war is to be expected , not so much by chaining down those irrepressible instincts which lead men to resist wrong , as by eradicating the disposition to do wrong . Wars will cease when all men are Christians , and perfect Christians ; but this will not be to-day nor to-morrow . Accordingly , I am not surprised that the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or that it is sustained by the whole moral and religious sentiment of the community . Men are ready to offer up not only their money and their labor , but also their lives . Are you afraid that your sons and brothers will be cowards merely because they are not duelists ? because they have never been engaged in a street-fight ? because prayers were made at their departure ? or because they have carried their bibles with them ? Did Cromwell 's soldiers flee before the cavaliers because they were sober and God-fearing men ? Our people have no love for fighting , as a pastime ; let it , however , become a serious business , and they will show that their veins are full of the blood that flowed so freely in other days . These are some of the ways in which a people may manifest their public spirit , and in which our people are manifesting it now . " With such sacrifices God is well pleased . " I have given a definition of public spirit from the jurists , but I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophet , " They helped every one his neighbor , and every one said to his brother , Be of good courage . " In looking back on what has been said , I find I have not spoken against anybody , not even against our enemies . Perhaps we have had enough of invective ; at any rate the pulpit may spare it . God is my witness , I feel no vindictive resentment , no bitter hostility against those who have been swept away by this terrible delusion . Moreover , I confess to being greatly moved by the circumstance that in some respects what is true of us is true also of them . They seem to be of one mind ; their religious men appeal with confidence to the righteous Judge ; their women are working day and night to help forward the cause . If it were a mere question of interest , or passion , or prejudice between us and them , it might be said that one side is as likely to be self-deceived as the other . But it is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and this too avowedly for the purpose of founding society on the servitude of an inferior race , on whose toil the more favored races are to live , they have put themselves in opposition to the settled convictions and the moral sense of good men all over the world . To the student of history it is no new thing that a whole community should be given over " to believe a lie , "  --  not the less mad , because all mad together . The process by which this state of things is brought about is always substantially the same . Egotism , vanity , disappointed ambition , sectional jealousies , a real or supposed interest or expediency induce them to wish that a wrong course were the right one . They try to convince themselves that it is so , and all such efforts to sophisticate the conscience , if persisted in , are punished by entire success . The spectacle does not inspire me with hate ; it fills me with wonder and profound melancholy . Do these men think that by altering their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or make wrong come out right in the great and solemn issues which are before us ? We stand where their own great men stood in the best days of the republic . As regards the leading rights and interests at stake , our consciences are but the echo of the conscience of the Christian world . The fathers of the Revolution , one and all , are looking down with sorrow and indignation on this attempt to break up and destroy their work . Nevertheless , it can do no good to begin by overvaluing ourselves , or undervaluing our enemies . We know that the behests of a righteous Providence will be accomplished , but we do not know in what way . It is more than probable that in the troubles and distractions which have come upon the country we ourselves have something to answer for . For this reason reverses and humiliations may be in store for us , before we are accounted worthy to carry out the Divine judgments . But there can be no doubt as to the end . A struggle has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of nature do not fail , if there is any meaning in the moral sentiments of mankind , or any justice in heaven . * * * * *
