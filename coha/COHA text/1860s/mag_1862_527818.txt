txt PRESENCE . IT was a long and terrible conflict ,  --  I will not say where , because that fact has nothing to do with my story . The Revolutionists were no match in numbers for the mercenaries of the Dictator , but they fought with the stormy desperation of the ancient Scythians , and they won , as they deserved to win : for this was another revolt of freedom against oppression , of conscience against tyranny , of an exasperated people against a foreign despot . Every eye shone with the sublimity of a great principle , and every arm was nerved with a strength grander and more enduring than that imparted by the fierceness of passion or the sternness of pride . As I flew from one part of the field to another , in execution of the orders of my superior officer , I wondered whether blood as brave and good dyed the heather at Bannockburn , or streamed down the mountain-gorge where Tell met the Austrians at Morgarten , or stained with crimson glare the narrow pass held by the Spartan three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , plunged forward in the deathstruggle , and fell with me , leaving me stunned for a little time , though not seriously hurt . With returning consciousness came the quickened perception which sometimes follows a slight concussion of the brain , daguerreotyping upon my mind each individual of these fiery ranks , in vivid , even painful clearness . As I watched with intensified interest the hurrying panorama , the fine figure and face of my friend Vilalba flashed before me . I noted at once the long wavy masses of brown hair falling beneath the martial cap ; the mouth , a feature seldom beautiful in men , blending sweetness and firmness in rare degree , now compressed and almost colorless ; but the eyes ! the " empty , melancholy eyes " ! what strange , glassy , introspective fixedness ! what inexplicable fascination , as if they were riveted on some object unseen by other mortals ! A glance sufficed to show to myself , at least , that he was in a state of tense nervous excitation , similar to that of a subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie moved and spoke like a somnambulist , with the same insulation from surrounding minds and superiority to material obstacles . I had long known him as a brave officer ; but here was something more than bravery , more than the fierce energy of the hour . His mien , always corn-82 July , // manding , was now imperial . In utter fearlessness of peril , he assumed the most exposed positions , dashed through the strongest defences , accomplished with marvellous dexterity a wellnigh impossible coup-dc-main , and all with the unrecognizing , changeless countenance of one who has no choice , no volition , hut is the passive slave of some resistless inspiration . After the conflict was over , I sought Vilalba , and congratulated him on his brilliant achievement , jestingly adding that I knew he was leagued with sorcery and helped on hy diabolical arts . The cold evasiveness of his reply confirmed my belief that the condition I have descrihed was abnormal , and that he was himself conscious of the fact . Many years passed away , during which I met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I often heard of him as actively , even arduously employed in public affairs , and rewarded by fortune and position . The prestige of fame , unusual personal graces , and high mental endowments gave him favor in social life ; and women avowed that the mingled truth and tenderness of his genial and generous nature were all hut irresistible . Nevertheless they were chagrined by his singular indifference to their allurements ; and many a fair one , even more interested than inquisitive , vainly sought to break the unconquerable reticence which , under apparent frankness , he relentlessly maintained . He had , indeed , once been married , for a few years only ; but his wife was not of those who can concentrate and absorb the fulness of another soul , wedding memory with immortal longing . Thus the problem of my friend 's life-lon* reserve continued to provoke curiosity until its solution was granted to me alone , and , with it , the explanation of his mesmeric entrancement on the occasion to which I have alluded . I repeat the story because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be classed among those psychological phenomena which form the most occult , the most interesting , and the least understood of all departments of human knowledge . Durino ' a period of summer recreation I induced Vilalba to renew our interrupted acquaintance by passing a month with me in my country home . The moonlight of many years had blended its silver with his still abundant locks , and the lines of thought were deepened in his face , but I found him in other respects unchanged . He had the same deep , metallic voice , so musical that to hear him say the slightest things was a pleasure , the same graceful courtesy and happy elasticity of temperament ; and was full as ever of noble purposes , and the Roman self-conviction of power to live them out . One of those nights that " are not made for slumber " found us lingering beneath the odorous vines which interlocked their gay blossoms around the slight columns of the veranda , until even the gray surprise of dawn , - the " soft , guileless consolations " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cool , fragraut breezes , gentle as remembered kisses upon the brow , the tremulous tenderness of the star-beams , the listening hush of midnight , having swayed us to a mood of pensiveness which found a reflex in our conversation . From the warning glare of sunlight the heart shuts close its secrets ; but hours like these beguile from its inmost depths those subtile emotions , and vague , dreamy , delicious thoughts , which , like plants , waken to life only beneath the protecting shadows of darkness . " Why is it , " says Richter , " that the night puts warmer love in our hearts ? Is it the nightly pressure of helplessness , or is it the exalting separation from the turmoils of life , - that veiling of the world in which for the soul nothing then remains but souls , - that causes the letters in which loved names are written to appear like phosphorus-writing by night , onfire , while by day , in their cloudy traces , they but smoke ? " Insensibly we wandered into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where // reason and illusion hold contested sway , - where the relations between spirit and matter seem so incomprehensibly involved and complicated that we can only feel , without being able to analyze them , and even the old words created for our coarse material needs seem no more suitable than would a sparrow 's wings for the flight of an eagle . " It is eml ) hatically true of these themes , " I remarked , after a long rambling talk , half reverie , half reason , " that language conceals the ideas , or , rather , the imaginations they evolve for the word idea implies something more tangible than vagaries which the Greek poet would have called the dream of the shadow of smoke . ' But yet more unsatisfactory than the impotence of the type is the obscurity of the thing typified . We can lay down no premises , because no basis can be found for them ,  --  and establish no axioms , because we have no mathematical certainties . Objects which present the assurance of palpable facts to-day may vanish as meteors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's articles of faith in these mental phantasmagoria is like carving a cathedral from sunset clouds , or creating salient and retreating lines of armed hosts in the northern lights . Though willing dupes to the pretty fancy , we know that before the light of science the architecture is resolved into mist , and the battalions into a stream of electricity . " " Not so , " replied Vilalba . " Your skyvisions are a deceit , and you know it while you enjoy them . But the torch of science is by no means incendiary to the system of psychology . Arago himself admits that it may one day obtain a place among the exact sciences , and speaks of the actual power which one human being may exert over another without the intervention of any known physical agent while Cuvier and other noted scientists concede even more than this . " " Do you , then , believe , " I asked , " that there is between the silent grave and the silent stars an answer to this problem we have discussed to-night , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ? To me it seems hopelessly inscrutable , and all effort to elucidate it , like the language of the Son of Maia , by night bringeth darkness before the eyes , and in the daytime nought clearer . ' I shall as soon expect to wrest her buried secrets from the Sphinx , or to revive the lost mysteries of the Egyptian priesthood . " " And yet , most of those marvels , " answered my friend , " as well as the later oracles of Greece , and the clairvoyance , mesmerism , etc. , of modern times , were probably the result of a certain power of the mind to shake off for a time its fetters in defiance of physical impediments , and even to exert its control over the senses and will and perception of another . I do not doubt that in certain conditions of the mind there arise potentialities wonderful as any ever conceived by fiction , and that these are guided by laws unannounced as yet , but which will be found in some future archives , induct. - ed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and generalized statement . My own experience suffices to myself for both assurance and prophecy . Although the loftiest , sweetest music of the soul is yet unwritten , its faint articulations interblend with the jangling discords of life , as the chimes of distant bells float through the roar of winds and waves , and chant to imperilled hearts the songs of hope and gladness . " His voice fell to the low , earnest tone of one who has found in life a pearl of truth unseen by others and as his eye gleamed in the starlight , I saw that it wore the same speculative expression as on the battle-field twenty years before . A slight tremor fled through his frame , as though he had been touched by an invisible hand , and a faint smile of recognition brightened his features . " How can we explain , " continued he , after a brief pause , " this mystery of PREsENcE ? Are you not often conscious of being actually nearer to a mind a thousand miles distant than to one // whose outer vestments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of a person repulsive , not necessarily to our senses , but to our instincts ,  --  which in this case are notes of warning from the remote depths of the soul , - as if our entire being intrenched itself behind a vitally repellent barrier , in absolute security that no power in the universe can break through it , in opposition to our will . For the will does not seem to create the barrier , but to guard it ; and , thus defended , material contact with the individual affects us no more than the touch of a plaster statue . We are each , and must remain , mutually unknowing and unknown . On the other hand , does not fixed and earnest thought upon one we love seem to brine , the companion-spirit within the sacred temple of our own being , infolded as a welcome guest in our warm charities and gentle joys , and imparting in return the lustre of a serene and living beauty ? ig then , those whom we do not recognize as kindred are repelled , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses , why may not the loved be brought near without that aid , through the more subtile and more potent attraction of sympathy ? I do not mean nearness in the sense of memory or imagination , but that actual propinquity of spirit which I suppose implied in the recognition of Presence . Nor do I refer to any volition which is dependent on the known action of the brain , but to a hidden faculty , the germ perhaps of some higher faculty , now folded within the present life like the wings of a chrysalis , which looks through or beyond the material existence , and obtains a truer and finer perception of the spiritual than can be filtered through the coarser organs of sight and hearing . " " Vilalba , you are evidently a disciple of Des Cartes . Your theory is based on the idealistic principle , I think , therefore I am . ' I confess that I could never he satisfied with mere subjective consciousness on a point which involves the cooperation of another mind . Nothing less than the most positive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that two minds could meet and commune , apart from material intervention . " " I know , " answered Vilalba , " that it is easier to feel than to reason about things which lie without the pale of mathematical demonstration . But some day , my friend , you will learn that beyond the arid abstractions of the schoolmen , beyond the golden dreams of the poets , there is a truth in this matter , faintly discerned now as the most dim of yonder stars , hut as surely a link in the chain which suspends the Universe to the throne of God . However , your incredulity is commendable , for doubt is the avenue to knowledge . I admit that no testimony is conclusive save that of the senses , and such witness I have received . " " You speak perpetual enigmas , and I suspect you - for the second time - of tampering with the black arts . Do you mean to say that you are a believer in the doctrine of palpable spiritual manifestation ? " " I might say in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pretences and the plausibilities of to-day , many of which result from the independent action of the mind through clairvoyance , and others from mere excitation of the nervous sensibilities , the truth of that theory is possibly implied in the wants of the soul ; for a want proves the existence of an antidote as effectually as a positive and negative interchangeably bear witness to each other 's existence . But if you will have patience to listen to a story of my own life , I can better explain how my convictions have been beguiled into the credence which appears to you unphilosophical , if not absurd . " " I will listen with pleasure , - first lighting another cigar to dispel the weird shapes which will probably respond to your incantation . " Vilalba smiled slightly . " Do not be disturbed . The phantoms will not visit you , nor , I fear , myself either . But you must promise faith in my veracity ; for I am about to tell you a tale of fact , and not of fancy . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how flatteringly that little phrase seems to extend the scale of one 's being ! - when I had just entered on the active duties of manhood , that some affairs called me to New Orleans , and detained me there several months . Letters of friendship gave me admission into some of the most agreeable French families of that quasi Parisian city , and in the reception of their hospitality I soon lost the feeling of isolation which attends a stranger in a crowded mart . My life at that time was without shadows . I had health , friends , education , position ,  --  youth , as well , which then seemed a blessing , though I would not now exchange for it my crown of years and experience . Fortune only I then had not ; and because I had it not , I am telling you , to-night , this story . " It chanced , one day , that I was invited to dine at the house of an aristocratic subject of the old French re'g*me . I did not know the family , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those mysterious impulses which are in fact the messengers of Destiny compelled me to go , and I went . Thus slight may be the thread which chant es the entire web of the future ! After greeting my host , and the party assembled in the drawing-room , my attention was arrested by a portrait suspended in a recess , and partly veiled by purple curtains , like Isis within her shrine . The lovely , living eyes beamed upon me out of the shrine , radiant with an internal light I had never before seen on canvas . The features were harmonious , the complexion pure and clear , and the whole picture wore an air of graceful , gentle girlhood , glowing , like Undine , with the flush of the coining soul . ' I hardly knew whether the face was strictly beautiful according to the canons of Art ; for only a Shakspeare can be at the same time critical and sympathetic , and my criticism was baffled and blinded by the fascination of those wondrous eyes . They reminded me of what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were enough to make one believe in the immortality of the soul . Life multiplied by feeling into a limitless dream of past and future was mirrored in their clear depths ; the questful gaze seemed reading the significance of the one through the symbols of the other , and pondering the lesson with sweetness of assent and ever-earnest longing for fuller revelation . " As I lingered before this fair shadow , I heard my name pronounced , and , turning , beheld the not less fair original , the daughter of my host . Now do not fear a catalogue of feminine graces , or a lengthened romance of the heart , tedious with such platitudes as have been Elysium to the actors , and weariness to the audience , ever since the world began . The Enchanted Isles wear no enchantment to unanointed vision ; their skies of Paradise are fog , their angels Ilarpies , perchance , or harsh-throated Sirens . Besides , we can never describe correctly those whom we love , because we see them through the heart ; and time heart 's optics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , from almost the first time I looked upon Blanche , I fidt that I had at last found the gift rarely accorded to us here , - the fulfilment of a promise hidden in every heart , but often waited for in vain . Hitherto my all-sufficing self-hood had never been stirred by the mighty touch of Love . I had been amused hy trivial and superficial affections , like the gay triflers of whom ilasselas says , They fancied they were in love , when in truth they were only idle . ' But that sentiment which is never twice inspired , that new birth of A soul within the soul , evolving it sublime-ly , ' had never until now wakened my pulses and opened my eyes to he higher and holier heritage . Perhaps von doubt that Psychal fetters may he tbrged in a moment 's heat ; but I believe that the love which is deepest and most sacred , and which Plato calls the memory of divine beings whom we knew in some anterior life , that recognition of kindred natures which precedes reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a gradual and cautious attraction , like the growth of a coral reef , but sudden and magnetic as the coalescence of two drops of mercury . " Durinrr several following weeks we met many times , and yet , in looking back to that dream of heaven , I can not tell how often , nor for 110w long . Time is merely the measure given to past emotions , and those emotions flowed over me in a tidal sweep which merged all details in one continuous memory . The lone hemisphere of my life was rounded into completeness , and its feverish unrest changed to deep tranquillity , as if a faint , tremulous star were transmuted into a calm , full-orbed planet . Do you remember that story of Plato 's - I recall the air-woven subtilties of the delightful idealist , to illustrate , not to prove - that story of the banquet where the ripe wines of the ZE4ean Isles unchained the tongues of such talkers as Pausanias and Socrates and others as witty and wise , until they fell into a discourse on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling eddies of fancy , were borne to that pre*xistent sphere which , in Plato 's opinion , furnished the key to all the enigmas of this ? There they beheld the complete and original souls , tile compound of male and female , dual and yet one , so happy and so haughty in their perfection of beauty and of power that Jupiter could not tolerate his godlike rivals , and therefore cut them asunder , sending the dissevered halves tumbling down to earth , bewildered and melancholy enough , until some good fortune might restore to each the alter ego which constituted the divine unity . And thus ' says Plato , whenever it happens that a man meets with his other half , the very counterpart of himself , they are both smitten with strong love they recognize their ancient union they are powerfully attracted by the consciousness that they belong to each other and they are unwilling to be again parted , even for a short time . And if Vulcan were to stand over them with his fire and forge , and offer to melt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them one again , they would both say that this was just what they desired ! ' " I dare say you have read - unless your partiality for the soft Southern tongues has chased away your Teutonic taste - that exquisite poem of Schiller 's , iDas Geheimnitz der Reminiscenz , ' the happiest possible crystallization of the same theory . I recall a few lines from Bulwer 's fine translation : - " Why from its lord doth thus my soul de-part ? Is it because its native home thou art ? Or were they brothers in the days of yore , Twin-bound both souls , and in the links they bore Sigh to he bound once more ? " Were once our beings blent and intertwin-ing , And therefore still my heart for thine is pin-ing ? Knew we the light of some extinguished sun , - The joys remote of some bright realm un-done , Where once our souls were ONE ? " Yes , it is so ! And thou wert bound to me In the long-vanished eld eternally ! In the dark troubled tablets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - " One with thy love , my soul " ! ' " Now the Athenian dreamer builded better than lie knew . That phantom which perpetually attends and perpetually evades us , - the inevitable guest whose silence maddens and whose sweetness consoles , - whose filmy radiance eclipses all beauty , - whose voiceless eloquence subdues all sound ,  --  ever beckoning , ever inspiring , patient , pleading , and unchanging , - this is the Ideal which Plato called the dearer self , because , when its craving sympathies find reflex and response in a livin , , form , its rapturous welcome ignores the 01 ( 1 imperfeet being , and the union only is recognized as Self indeed , complete and undivided . And that fulness of human love becomes a faint type and interpreter of the Infinite , as through it we glide into // grander harmonies and enlarged relations with the Universe , urged on forever by insatiable desires and far-reaching aspirations which testify our celestial origin and intimate our immortal destiny . " Lo ! arm in arm , through every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek , everywhere we seek Union and bond , till in one sea sublime Of love be merged all measure and all time ! " I never disclosed in words my love to Blanche . Through the lucid transparency of Presence , I believed that she knew all and comprehended all , without the aid of those blundering symbols . We never even spoke of the future for all time , past and to come , seemed to converge and centre and repose in that radiant present . In the enchantment of my new life , I feared lest a breath should disturb the spell , and send me back to darkness and solitude . " Of course , this could not last forever . There came a time when I found that my affa s would compel me to leave New Orleans for a year , or perhaps a little longer . With the discovery my dream was broken . The golden web which had been woven around me shrank beneath the iron hand of necessity , and fell in fragments at my feet . I knew that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , a stern and exacting man in his domestic relations , had often declared that he would never give his daughter to a husband who had no fortune . If I sought his permission to address her now , my fate was fixed . There was no alternative , therefore , but to wait until my return , when I hoped to have secured , in sufficient measure , the material passport to his favor . Our parting was necessarily sudden , and , strange as it may seem , some fatal repression sealed my lips , and withheld me from uttering the few words which would have made the future wholly ours , and sculptured my dream of love in monumental permanence . Ah ! with what narrow and trembling planks do we bridge the abyss of misery and despair ! But he patient while I linger for a moment here . The evening before my departure , I went to take leave of her . There were other guests in the drawing-room , the atmosphere was heated and oppressive , and after a little time I proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the fragrant coolness of the garden . We walked slowly along through clustering flowers and under arching orange-trees , which infolded us tenderly within their shining arms , as in tremulous silence we waited for words that should say enough and yet not too much . The glories of all summer evenings seemed concentred in this one . The moon now silvered leaf and blossom , and then suddenly fled behind a shadowing cloud , while the stars shone out with gladness brief and bright as the promises of my heart . Skilful artists in the music-room thrilled the air with some of those exquisite compositions of Mendelssohn which dissolve the soul in sweetness or ravish it with delight , until it seems as if all past emotions of joy were melted in one rapid and comprehensive rebxperience , and all future inheritance gleamed in promise before our enraptured vision , and we are hurried on with electric speed to hitherto unscaled heights of feeling , whence we catch faint glimpses of the unutterable mysteries of our being , and foreshadowings of a faroff , glorified existence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language could have uttered , and , as my eyes met the eyes of Blanche , the question of my heart was asked and answered , once for all . I recognized the treasured ideal of my restless , vagrant heart , and I seemed to hear it murmuring gently , as if to a long-lost mato , Where host thou stayed so long ? ' I felt that henceforth there was for us no real parting . Our material forms might be severed , but our spirits were one and inseparate . " On the fountains of our life e seal was set To keep their waters clear and bright Forever . ' And thus , with scarce a word beside , I // said the God be with you ! ' and went out into the world alone , yet henceforth not alone . " Two years passed away . They had heen years of success in my worldly affairs , and were blessed by memories and hopes which grew hrighter with each day . I had not heard of Blanche , save indirect . ly through a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was as sacred , the future as secure , in her eyes as in my own . I was now ready to return , and to repeat in words the vows which my heart had sworn long before . I fixed the time , and wrote to my friend to herald my coming . Before that letter reached him , there came tidings which , like a storm of desolation , swept me to the dust . Blanche was in France , and married , - how or when or to whom , I knew not , cared not . The relentless fact was sufficient . The very foundations of the earth seemed to tremble and slide from beneath me . The sounds of day tortured , the silence of night maddened me . I sought forgetfulness in travel , in wild adventure , in reckless dissipation . With that strange fatality which often leads us to seek happiness or repose where we have least chance of finding it , I , too , married . But I committed no perjury . I offered friendship , and it sufficed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I merely esteemed had not the mental or the magnetic ascendancy which might have triumphed for a time over the image shrined in my inmost heart . I sought every avenue through which I might fly from that and from myself . I tried mental occupation , and explored literature and science , with feverish ardor and some reward . I think it is Coleridge who recommends to those who are suffering from extreme sorrow the study of a new language . But to a mind of deep feeling diversion is not relief . If we fly from memory , we are pursued and overtaken like fugitive slaves , and punished with redoubled tortures . The only sure remedy for grief is self-evolved . We must accept sorrow as a guest , not shun it as a foe , and , receiving it into close compan ionship , let the mournful face haunt our daily paths , even though it shut out all friends and dim the light of earth and heaven . And when we have learned the lesson which it came to teach , the fearful phantom brightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gently leads us to heights of purer atmosphere and more extended vision , and strengthens us for the battle which demands unfaltering heart and hope . " Do you remember the remark of the child Goethe , when his young reason was perplexed by attempting to reconcile the terrible earthciuake at Lisbon with the idea of infinite goodness ? God knows very well that an immortal soul can not suffer from mortal accident . ' With sunilar faith there came to me tran ( luil restoration . The deluge of passion rolled back , and from the wreck of my Eden arose a new and more spiritual creation . But forgetfulness was never possible . In the maddening turbulence of my grief an ( l the ghastly stillness of its reaction , the lovely spirit which had become a part of my life seemed to have fled to the inner temple of my soul , breaking the solitude with glimmering ray and faint melodious murmur . And when I could bear to look and listen , it grew brighter and more palpable , until at last it attended me omnipresently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action . " Nor was it a ghost summoned by memory , or the airy creation of fancy . One evening an incident occurred which will test your credulity , or make you doubt my sanity . I sat alone , and reading-nothing more exciting , however , than a daily newspaper . My health was perfect , my mind unperturbed . Suddenly my eye was arrested by a cloud passing slowly back and forth several times before me , not projected upon the wall , but floating in the atmosphere . 1 looked around for the cause , but the doors and windows were closed , and nothiug stirred in the apartment . Then I saw a point of light , small as a star at first , but gra ( lually enlarging into a luminous cloud which filled the centre of the room . I shivered with // strange coldness , and every nerve tingled as if touched by a galvanic battery . From the tremulous waves of the cloud arose , like figures in a dissolving view , the form and features of my lost love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but pale and anguish-stricken , with clasped hands and tearful eyes ; arid upon my ears fell , like arrows of fire , the words , You hare been the cause of all this ; oh , why did you not ' The question was unfinished , and from my riveted gaze , half terror , half delight , the vision faded , and I was alone . " Of course you will pronounce this mere nervous excitement , but , I pray you , await the sequel . Those burning words told the story of that mistake which bad draped in despair our earthly lives . They were no reflection from my own mind . In the self-concentration of my disappointment , I had never dreamed that I alone was in fault , - that I should have anchored my - hope on somewhat more defined than the voiceless intelligence of sympathy . But the very reproach of the mysterious visitor brought with it a conviction , positive and indubitable , that the spiritual portion of our being possesses the power to act upon the material perception of another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have known , beyond the possibility of deception , that the kindred spirit was still my companion , my own inalienable possession , in spite of all factitious ties , of all physical intervention . " Have you heard that among certain tribes of the North-American Indians are men who possess an art which enables them to endure torture and actual death without apparent suffering or even consciousness ? I once chanced to fall in with one of these tribes , then living in Louisiana , now removed to the far West , and was permitted to witness some fantastic rites , half warlike , half religious , in which , however , there was nothing noticeable except this trance-like condition , which some of the warriors seemed to command at pleasure , manifested by a tense rigidity of the features and muscles , and a mental exaltation which proved to be both clairvoyant and clairoyant : a state analogous to that of hypnotism , or the artificial sleep produced by gazing fixedly on a near , bright object , and differing only in degree from the nervous or imaginative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which chained St. Simeon Stylites to his pillar , and sustains the Hindoo fakirs in their apparently superhuman vigils . These children of Nature had probed with direct simplicity some of the deep secrets which men of science often fail to discern through tortuous devices . I was assured that this trance was merely the result of a concentrative energy of the will , which riveted the faculties upon a single purpose or idea , and held every nerve and sense in absolute abeyance . We are so little accustomed to test the potency of the will out of the ordinary plane of its operation , that we have little conception how mighty a lever it may be made , or to what new exercise it may be directed and yet we are all conscious of periods in our lives when , like a vast rock in ocean , it has suddenly loomed up firm and defiant amid our petty purposes and fretful indecisions , waxing grander an ( l stronger under opposition , a something apart from , yet a conscious portion of ourselves , - a master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . " I will confess that curiosity led me long ago to slight experiments in the direction in which you say the diabolic lies , but my mind was never concentrated on any one idea of sufficient interest to command success , until , in some periods of min*led peril and excitement , the memory of Blanche , and the conscious , even startling nearness of that sweet presence , have lent to my will unwonted energy and inspiration . " Twenty years passed slowly away . It is common to speak of the flight of time . For me , time has no wings . The days and years are faltering and tardyfooted , laden with the experiences of the outer and the problems of the inner // world , which seem perpetually multiplied by reflection , like figures in a room mirrorred on all sides . Meanwhile , my wife had died . I have never since sought women beyond the formal pale of the drawing-room : not from insensibility to loveliness , but because the memory , dearer far than bliss , ' of one irretrievable affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet , admitting no dance of satellites within its orbit . " At last the long silence was broken . I heard that Blanche was free , and , with mingled haste and hesitation , I prepared to seek her . The ideal should he tested , I said to myself by the actual , and if proved a deceit , then was all faith a mockery , all promise and premonition a glittering lie . As soon as winds and waves could carry me , I was in Louisiana , and in the very dwelling and at the same hour which had witnessed our parting . Again was it a soft summer evening . The same faint golden rays painted the sun 's farewell , and the same silver moon looked eloquent response , as on the evening breeze floated sweet remembered odors of jessamine and orange . A*ain the ideal beauty of the lovely portrait met my gaze and seemed to melt into my heart ; and once more , softly , lightly , fell a footstep , and the Presence by which I had never been forsaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable array of sense . ' It was indeed the living Blanche , calm and stately as of old , - no longer radiant with the flush of youth , but serene in tenderest grace and sweet reserve , and beautiful through the lustre of the inner light of soul . She uttered a faint cry of joy , and placing her trembling hand in mine , we stood transfixed and silent , with riveted gaze , reading in each other 's eyes feelings too sacred for speech , too deep for smiles or tears . In that long , burning look , it seemed as if the emotions of each were imparted to the other , not in slow succession as through words and sentences , but daguerreotyped or electrotyped in perfected form upon the conscious understanding . No language could have made so clear and comprehensible the revelation of that all-centring , unconquerable love which thrilled our inmost being , and pervaded the atmosphere around us with subtile and tremulous vibrations . In that moment all time was fused and forgotten . There was for us no Past , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could willingly have died then and there , for I knew that all life could bring but one such moment . My heart spoke truly . A change passed over the countenance of Blanche , - an expression of unutterable grief , like Eve 's retrospective look at Eden . Quivering with strange tremor , again she stood before me , with clasped hands and tearful eves , in the very attitude of that memorable apparition , and again fell upon my ears the mysterious plaint and the uncompleted question , - You have been the cause of oil this ; oh , why did you not ' " Now , my friend , can your philosophy explain this startling verification , this reflex action of the vision , or the fantasy , or whatever else you may please to term it , whose prophetic shadow fell upon my astonished senses long years before ? In all the intervening time , we were separated by great distance , no word or sign passed between us , nor did we even hear of each other except indefinitely and through chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision more rational than that the spirit thus closely affined with my own was enabled , through its innate potencies , or through some agency of which we are ignorant , to impress upon my bodily perceptions its uncontrollable emotions ? That this manifestation was made through what physiologists call the unconscious or involuntary action of the mind was proved by the incredulity and surprise of Blanche when I told her of the wonderful coincidence . " I need not relate , even if I could do so , the outpouring of long-pent emotions which relieved the yearning love and haunting memories of sad , silent , lingering years . It is enough to tell you briefly of the story which was repeated in // fragments through many hours of unfamiliar bliss . Soon after my departure from New Orleans , the father of Blanche , with the stern authority which many parents exercise over the matrimonial affairs of their daug1*ters , insisted upon her forming an alliance to which the opposition of her own heart was the only objection . So trifling an impediment was decisively put aside by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , until the time fixed for my return was past , and unable to plead any open acknowledgment on my part which could justify her refusal , had no alternative hut to obey . I confess , ' said she , in faltering tones , that , after my fate was fixed , and I was parted from you , as I believed for life , I tried to believe that the love which had given so slight witness in words to its truth and fervor must have faded entirely away , and that I was forgotten , and perhaps supplanted . And therefore , in the varied pursuits and pleasures of my new sphere , and in the indulgence and kindness which ministered to the outer , hut , alas ! never to the inner life , I sought happiness , and I , too , like yourself strove to forget . Ah ! that art of forgetting , which the Athenian coveted as the best of boons , - when was it ever found through effort or desire ? In all scenes of beauty or of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sorrow , my heart still turned to you with ceaseless longing , as if you alone could touch its master-chord , and waken the harmonies which were struggling for expression . By slow degrees , as I learned to dissever you from the material world , there came a conviction of the nearness of your spirit , sometimes so positive that I would waken from a reverie , in which I was lost to sights and sounds around me , with a sense of having been in your actual presence . I was aware of an effect rather than of an immediate consciousness , - as if the magnetism of your touch had swept over me , cooling the fever of my brain , and charming to deep tranquillity my troubled heart . And thus I learned , through sim ilar experience , the same belief as yours . I have felt the continuous nearness , the inseparable union of our spirits , as plainly as I feel it now , with my hand clasped in yours , and reading in your eyes the unutterable things which we can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . " What I possess I see afar off lying , And what I lost is real and undyingY The material presence is indeed very dear , hut I believe that it is not essential to the perpetuity of that love which is nurtured through mutual and perfect un-derstandino ' " It is not essential , ' I replied , hut it is , as you say , very , very dear , because it is an exponent and participant of the hidden life which it was designed to aid and to enframe . Blanche , it was you who first wakened my soul to the glorious revelation , the heavenly heritage of love . It was you who opened to me the world which lies heyond the mere external , who gently allured me from the coarse and clouding elements of sense , and infolded me in the holy purity of that marriage of kindred natures which alone is hallowed by the laws of God , and which no accidents of time or place can rend asunder . Apart from the bitterness of this long separation , the lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffaceably engraven on both our hearts , and confirmed in the assurance of this blessed reunion , may I not hope that for the remainder of our earthly lives we may study together in visible companionship such further lessons as may be held in reserve for us ? ' " Her face glowed with a soft crimson flush , and again her eyes were suffused with tears , through which beamed a look of sweet , heavenly sorro*v ,  --  such as might have shone in the orbs of the angel who enforced upon Adam the sentence of expulsion from Paradise , and who , while sharing the exile 's grief beheld in the remote horizon , far beyond the tangled wilderness of Earth , another gate , wide opening to welcome him to the Immortal // Land . She was silent for a little time , and then she murmured , lingering gently on the words , iNo , it must not he . We are , indeed , inalienably one , in a nearer and dearer sense than can he expressed by any transient symbol . Let us not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dwelt and communed together , for one liable to discord and misinterpretation . I have an irresistible impression that my life here will be very brief . While I remain , come to me when you will , let me be the Egeria of your hours of leisure , and a consoler in your cares ,  --  hut let us await , for another and a higher life , the more perfect consummation of our love . For , oh , believe , as I believe , faith is no mockery , nor is the heart 's prophecy a lie . We were not born to he the dupes of dreams or the sport of chance . The voice which whispered to me long ago the promise fulfilled in this hour tells me that in a bright Hereafter we shall find compensation for every sorrow , reality for every ideal , and that there at last shall he resolved in luminous perception the veiled and troubled mystery of PRES-ENCE !
