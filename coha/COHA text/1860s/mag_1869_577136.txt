THE BATTLE OF PLATTSBURGH BAY . AN UNPUBLISHED MANUSCIIIPT OF J. FENIMORE C0Oi*ETh* EvERY portion of this globe has districts that may be termed its battlegrounds . In Europe , it will be found , if the inquiry be limited to modern times , that more blood has been spilt on the fertile fields of Flanders and on the broad plains of Saxony , than in all the rest of that quarter of the globe ; while , in this country , we must turn to the shores of Champlain and the Niagara , in quest of the scenes of the principal conflicts with the stranger . The battles of the Revolution are exceptions to this rule , having been fought in a domestic quarrel ; but , whenever this people , whether as colonists or as an independent nation , have been called on to take up arms , their battalions have repaired to these two points , near , or on our own immediate territory , as regularly as the gladiator was once seen to enter the arena . Natural causes have aided those that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the map will explain the reasons why the two points mentioned should have become the battle-fields of America , since they have , hitherto , been the only two great avenues by which hostile armies could approach each other , in the wars that have arrayed the Canadas against the Colonies , or the States , and necessity has conspired with convenience to give them the painful notoriety of having been the scenes of human slaughter . We , of New York , have more than a national interest in tracing events so intimately connected with a part of our own territory ; and I now ask your pa- * Mr. cooper prepared his account of the Battle of Lake champlain for a lecture , to be delivered before the " New York Historical Society . " It was also read in the court-House , at coopersto* , before the " Young Men 's Association " of the village . It has never yet been printed -- Editor . VOL. iir. -4 tience , gentlemen , while we examine a little , in detail , one of the brightest incidents , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated one of these sections of the State . It was a matter of course , that the original colonists should establish themselves on the borders of navigable streams communicating with the ocean . These were the paths that were still open towards the lands of their birth , and were necessary alike to their safety and their happiness . Thus , while the French spread themselves along the banks of the St. Lawrence , the Dutch , and , subsequently , their successors , the English , did the same on the shore of the Hudson , until time extended the cultivated possessions of the one to the shores of the great lakes , and of the other over the whole surface of the goodly region that has been transmitted to us from our fathers . A broad belt of forest separated these contiguous communities , until a period subsequent to the Revolution , nor was the country fairly opened between them at the close of the last struggle between England and America . But , for all the purposes of war , Nature had constructed a highway that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champlain and the Lac du Saint Sacrement stretched athwart the belt of intermediate forest , openingits mysteries to the knowledge of the adventurous , and causing its echoes to repeat the soldier 's shout and the din of arms . Our annals tell us of formidable armies meeting in the shades of these woods , and along the shores of their lakes and water-courses . Montcalm is said to have led 9,000 men to the siege of Fort William Henry , in 1757 ; the garriscal of which fortress amounted to more than 2,000 , while a reserve of between 4,000 // *ud 5,000 lay at Fort Edward , to support the latter . Abercrombie is said to have advanced against Ticonderoga , in 1758 , at the head of 16,000 combatants , of whom near 2,000 were slain or wounded in his abortive attempt on the place . At a later day , Burgoyne passed along these wilds with an army of 10,000 men , better appointed , it was thought at the time , than any similar force that had then left the island of Great Britain . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exploits of Sir William Johnson , Dieskau , his captive Rogers , Putnam , Allen , Arnold , and others , all of whom distinguished themselves , by deeds of war , enacted in this portion of our territory . Singular delusions have long existed in England on the subject of the character , policy , and feelings of the people of this country . These have arisen from mistaken reasoning , ignorance of our history , and the application of principles that belong to the state of society which exists in Europe , but which , when brought to bear on that of America , find little in their support , with much that is antagonistic . To one of these singular delusions has been owing two of the greatest military enterprises that Great Britain ever entered into on this continent . That both should fail , was a natural consequence of the error in which they originated . In Europe , with few and trifling exceptions , men are mere agents of the state , whereas the state is the agent of the people among ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accessories ; here , the population is the principal , and the Government the accessory . Let us not be deceived by high-sounding antitheses . Each of these conditions of society has advantages peculiar to itseig and each its own marked disadvantages . Among the latter , it entails weakness in the attack on the popular form of government , while it renders it nearly invincible when thrown on the defensive . As a consequence of this relation of the people to the state , history has shown us how often the destinies of nations have been decided , in the other hemisphere , with little or no reference to the feelings , or interest , of the bulk of their population . The conqueror of the capital was , half the time , the conqueror of the nation , and the power that could seize upon the machinery of the state , has generally been able to wield the authority of the state itself . In the very last battle that was fought on British ground , a handful of German mercenaries contended with a half-disciplined band of Highlanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Scotland may be said to have been merely lookers-on ; and , even in our own day , a Duke of Orleans has been placed on the throne of the head of his own family , by a small body of deputies , who had the fortitude to remain at their posts in the hour of revolution . In neither of these great events was the nation more in the game than the stake played for , though dictated rejoicings and congratulations followed , as if the achievement were its own . In the wars of Europe , it has been the aim of the commander to intercept communications , to seize on military positions , to invest capitals , and to conquer the country by conquering its political sources of power . To cut off the military communications between two provinces has had the effect of severing the wings of an army , their people usually remaining passive and submissive to events . It has been owing to the success of this system , this facility of the governed in following the fortunes of the governors , that England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own territory , by forcing armies through , along that bloody highway , that connects the Canadas with the mouth of the Hudson . Most of those who are old enough to remember the theories of the War of 1776 , as they were discussed in the quarter of a century that succeeded the peace , must remember that one of the favorite projects of the British arms was to sever New England from'the Middle and Southern States , by a line of posts that should ex // tend along the Hudson to Albany , thence across the country to the two northern lakes , and then to the Isle aux Noix . It was owing to this policy that Burgoyne attempted his unfortunate expedition in 1777 . Its failure was the consequence of the institutions of this country and of the character of the people , as it had been fashioned by those institutions . Instead of quietly waiting for a result that should follow the efforts of the two states , the population flew to arms , and , while its efforts were attended by many of the defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its invaders as captives , giving a practical exemplification of that theory which tells us that , to conquer the state among ourselves , it is necessary to conquer the people . Had a different fate awaited this well-appointed force , and the line of posts been established , the last would probably have been carried in detail , by that same population , taking the mockery of a military array under the name of militia , as was done by Greene , and Lee , and Sumter , and Marion , at a later day , in Carolina . The project itself argued an ignorance of the people it was intended to subdue . In a nation like this , the invader 's authority is necessarily limited to the portion of country actually covered by his armies , freemen arising in the rear of his marches , like healthful plants rearing their heads after the passage of the tempest. - These brief reflections on the unconquerable moral force of a community , knit together by equal rights , and accustomed to depend on their own exertions , suggest the propriety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had the armies of England that were scattered along our coast , or were employed in a renewed attempt , in 1814 , to sever at least a portion of New England from the Middle States , been collected at the mouth of the Hudson , then , indeed , might we have been made to feel how unpreparedly we plunged into the conflict , and how formidable a great maritime state can ever render itself to American interests and American trade , though virtually impotent in its assaults on American liberty . New York might have been carried by a well-directed coup-de-main , at any period of the war , - its last six months , perhaps , excepted ; and a disciplined force of fifteen or twenty thousand English troops , once in possession of the island , and supported by a powerful fleet , would have proved difficult , indeed , to dislodge . That some such calamity did not befall us , was owing to ignorance on the part of the enemy of our real condition , and to the fact that no soldier of a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late period of the war , one of these great enterprises was attempted at New Orleans ; and it failed , under the providence of God , solely through the rare promptitude and decision of the man who directed the motley bands of citizens that had been hurriedly assembled for the defence of the place . At no moment , in the War of 1812-its last six months possibly excepted-was New York in as complete a state of defence as it was when Washington was obliged to abandon it to the enemy in 1776 . We all know how much the possession of this town , by the English , embarrassed the country during the struggle of the Revolution , and it ought ever to be borne in mind , that without a complete system of harbol ? and land defence , no port of its magnitude is so easily invaded from the side of the ocean , while few are more easily defended , when once possessed and garrisoned by those who can command the water , against attempts at recapture on the side of the land . Before quitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a singular historical fact , that has often excited smiles among the observant and wellinformed . It would seem to be a truth beyond dispute , that the English nation , or that portion of them that professed to have any knowledge of this country , in 1812 , imagined that their own friends were to be found in the new States of the West , while the hostility of the Seaboard was ascribed to commercial rivalry . These facts ' are betrayed in a variety of ways . They are seen in the // proclamations of the period , in the specalations of the journals at home , and few can have been associated intimately with English statesmen without discovering it in their conversation . To us no circumstance appears more absurd . Commercial intercourse and mutual interests had raised up many friends to England along the American seaboard , friends who were bitterly opposed to that war , while it may be questioned if she had any but foes over the whole of the vast expanse that stretched from the great lakes to New Orleans . How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter place , it may be difficult to say ; but it is almost morally certain that the conquerors of the Month of the Mississippi could not have resisted the masses from the West that would certainly have been poured down upon them , had Packenham succeeded . To what extent England meditated conquest by the march of the army under Sir George Prevost it is difficult to determine . A forward movement in that direction , and with a sufficient force , might have insured the safety or the fall of Montreal , as the Americans employed their own resources . Nothing would have been easier than to have turned the advancing **roo , by means of either Champlain or the 81 . Lawrence , and thus to have got between them and their town , though such a movement would have required a concentration of mind and action that is not often found in the affairs of democracies . Perhaps the enemy was wise , if he acted on the supposition of this great moral defect . It is known , however , that the English commissioners , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inland waters , with the idea of securing their own colonies from future invasions , and it seems reasonable to suppose that the forward movement of Prevost might have had this end in view , coupled with others of a more strictly military character . It is not generally known that the idea of re-colonization , as respects this whole country , was not altogether abandoned among English statesmen , until after the peace of 1815 . Facts like these startle the American who has lived altogether in the retirement of his provincial home . Accustomed to the flattery of a venial and adulatory press , that is only bold in personal calumnies , but which shrinks from giving unpalatable truths to the mass , he fancies that others estimate himself and his nation as he has long seen both estimated in the columns of newspapers , Fourth-ofJuly orations , and the oratory of Congress . To this unfortunate view of the community , must be added the more healthful feeling of that innate security , which is a consequence of the unconquerable defensive power of vast democracies . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any power of earth could have had the audacity to think of reducing the republic to the dependent condition from which it emerged in 1776 . Nevertheless , gentlemen , there is much reason for thinking that projects of the nature I have mentioned were canvassed among our enemies , and hopes were long entertained by the mother-country , that internal dissensions and the vicissitudes of troubled times would throw a part of this Union back into her arms , leaving the remainder to follow as the fruits of conquest . The policy of nations is not to be estimated by the narrower views of homebred reasoning and provincial pride . The map is now in existence which partitioned France , as lately as this century ; and if that great and warlike country could be menaced with such an evil , we are not to be surprised that those who suffered America to slip from their grasp , in 1783 , should think the country , unsupported by a single ally , recoverable , in its exhausted state of 1814 . The men who imagined commercial rivalry produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the vicinity of the tomahawk and the scalping-knife in quest of fricuds , might easily make a blunder as great as this . Whatever may have been the motive of the expedition of Sir George Prevost , it is certain that , in a military sense , it // was formidable and guarded . The left flank of the English was protected by the lake , and the army itself occupied all the accessible roads by which its right could possibly be turned . By advancing to the head of Champlain , leaving posts in its rear , and keeping open the communications by means of its fleet , the British force , in the absence of the enterprise that should aim a blow direct upon Montreal , was as secure from all assaults that did not come directly in its front , and with timely notice . In this respect , then , the advance of the twelve or fourteen thousand veteran British troops , who appeared on the territory of New York in the autumn of 1814 , was menacing and skilful . The most casual examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let the inquirer after historical facts understand the importance of commanding Lake Champlain , equally to the enemy and to ourselves . It was as necessary to a repulse as it was to an advance ; to the defence , as to the attack . This important issue was decided by the result of the Battle of Plattsburgh Bay ; to a few of the leading facts , as well as to some of the more interesting details , of which , gentlemen , I now propose to invite your particular attention . When the views of the Government of this country were seriously called to the importance of securing the command of Lake Champlain , it looked about for an officer suited to so grave a trust . Its choice fell on Thomas M'Donough , then an old lieutenant but one who stood on the eve of promotion . He was a native of Delaware , and one of two gallant brothers who had joined the navy soon after its establishment , or at the close of the last century . James , the elder of the two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and La Vengeance , and was compelled to retire ; but Thomas , the younger , was retained as a midshipman under the peace-establishment law of 1801 , and lived to connect his name indissolubly with the history of his country . Young M'Donough had early acquired a reputation in his profession . He was under Decatur , during his Mediterranean service , and had ever beeui found worthy of his dauntless commander . Belonging to the Enterprise , the vessel that furnished all the men and most of the officers for the celebrated attack on the Philadelphia , in the harbor of Tripoli , he accompanied the party , and was distinguished among the boarders . M'Donough believed himself to have been the first man on board the frigate , and it is certain he was among the first , but he rarely alluded to the circumstance , and then only in the confidence of friendly discourse . No one ever heard of any troublesome claims to this distinction on his part-modesty , and a disposition not to obtrude himself in any manner on the public , forming conspicuous features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American and Tripolitan gunboats that occurred under Preble , M'Donough fought at Decatur 's side , his commander appreciating his intrepidity , and uniformly keeping him nearhis own person . The young man was in most , if not in all of the active service before the town of Tripoli , receiving his promotion on that station . An incident , which occurred soon after the peace with Tripoli , illustrates the character of M'Douough and procured him more reputation in the navy , perhaps , than any part of his previous conduct . The brig Siren , of which M'Donough was now the first-lieutenant , was lying at Gibraltar , in 1806 . An American merchant-brig was at anchor near her . The officer of the deck , on board the Siren , saw a tenoared , double-banked boat , from an English line-of-battle-ship , pull alongside this American merchantman and he closely watched the whole proceeding . This officer of the deck was Bernard Henry , Esq. , of Philadelphia , then a lieutenant in the navy , and since , for many years , consul of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a variety of ways , but the // account now given is taken from this gentleman 's statements , who was an eyewitness of all that passed . Mr. Henry saw the officer of the English boat go up the merchant-brig 's side , followed oy several of his men , saw the crew mustered , and saw the boat about to depart , carrying with her one of the brig 's people , evidently an impressed man . The commanding-officer of the Siren being on shore , these facts were promptly reported to M'Donongh , as her first-lieutenant . The last issued an order to the officer of the deck to man and arm a boat , to follow the ten-oared cutter , and to rescue the impressed seaman . While preparations were making for the execution of this order , M'Donough appeared on deck . Struck with the seriousness of the duty on which he was about to send a subordinate , the firstlieutenant took the arms which the latter was about to use , said he would go himself , jumped into the boat , and shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of the Siren approached , M'Donough called out to the English officer , " I 'll thank you to stop rowing . " The request was complied with , and the next instant the boats* lay side by side . M'Donough had placed his own boat in a favorable position for his purpose , and he now called out to the impressed man to jump aboard him . This was immediately done , when M'Donough bowed to the English officer , and pulled back to the Siren , where the man was kept for protection . The following day an English captain , in full uniform , came on board the Siren . The English officer inquired for Captain John Smith , who commanded the Siren . This gentleman being still ashore , M'Donough was sent for to receive the visitor . As soon as the two met , the English captain commenced the discourse by saying that an outrage had been committed on one of his boats by a boat from the Siren . M'Donough nclw invited his guest into the cabin , whither he conducted the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to comment on the serious character and on the impropriety of what had been done , when he was mildly but firmly interrupted by M'Donough . The latter remarked he could not consent to hear his acts censured by one to whom he was not responsible ; he was responsible to his own superior only , and to him the matter had better be referred . He would cheerfully convey any message to Captain Smith that the other might choose to send . After a little hesitation , the English captain remarked , " Suppose , sir , my officer had used force to repel you ? " " Under the circumstances , sir , " answered M'IDonough , " it is better as it is . I do not doubt the disposition of your officer to do his duty , but as I conceive I was doing mine , any disposition on his part would have brought about a collision between us . I trust no blame will be imputed to the gentleman . " The English officer departed , seemingly astonished at the quiet firmness he had encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Smith , who sustained M'Donough 's course , as being worthy of the service to which he belonged . In the end , the man was sent back to his own vessel , and remained unmolested . Gentlemen , this was in tSOO  --  a period in the history of this country when it required ten times the moral courage to perform such an act as would be required to-day . Such was the character of the officer who was selected to command on Lake Champlain , in 1814 . He had been often in battle , and a follower of Decatur , in two hand-to-hand conflicts , that partook more of the desperate personal encounters of the Middle Ages , than of the struggles of modem warfare . His reputation as a seaman and an officer was good , while his mind and conduct had been chastened , in late years , by the graces of a Christian . So little was this upright and simple-minded man infinenced by selfishness or a grasping ambition , in any thing he did , and so completely was he governed by just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scarcely at all of his own advancement or reputation . When near the // close of his life , a brother-officer once mentioned to him that his victory , certainly the first in American naval annals , as respects disparity of force , the character of his enemy , and the importance of its results , had never been duly appreciated by the country , while that of Lake Erie , a glorious exploit beyond a question , but in every sense inferior to his own , was constantly kept before the public mind , and would finally usurp its place in the pages of history . When this brother-officer said to him , " You have been too passive in this matter , and are letting pictures and imaginative written legends overshadow your own substantial deeds , " - " If I can die with the consciousness of having acted as an honest man , my friend , it is all I care for " was M'Donough 's quiet and truthful answer . His whole life was a just commentary on the sincerity of his words . While owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am happy in having an opportunity of paying a like tribute to another of very similar qualities . During the winter of 1813-14 , the American force , as it then existed , was laid up in Otter Creek . Mr. Stephen Cassin , then a lieutenant , and now the commodore of that name , was in command at this point , when the enemy approached the mouth of the Otter , in force , prepared to sink two sloops in the channel , under circumstances that would probably have secured to them the command of the lake , if successful . Cassin had not a gun mounted , nor a charge of powder at hand , when he discovered the English vessels . By means of great exertions a few guns were placed in battery , ammunition was obtained from a distance , and when the enemy drew near , he was received by so smart a cannonade as to be completely deceived , and , after a distant fire of half an hour 's continuance , he hauled off , abandoning the enterprise . I shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , under still more trying circumstances . This is one of those incidents of Champlain , that seems to have been hid behind the veil which has so long concealed the warfare of that water . Both belligerents appear to have foreseen that the season of 1814 must produce great events on the borders of Lake Champlain , if not on the lake itseig and both parties employed themselves in preparing for the conflict . As a matter of course , armaments on such a water , and hurried to meet the emergency of an important campaign by land , were not altogether composed of such vessels as would be used in a regular marine , in ordinary service at sea . On the part of the Americans , one or two of lake-craft were altered into temporary cruisers , and the bottom of even a small steamer was raised upon , and converted into the United States schooner Ticonderoga . A stout corvette and a brig of force , however , were constructed regularly , from the keels upwards , and were got into the water in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a month before there was occasion to use her in battle . The British were still more tardy in their equipments . Profiting by a knowledge of the force likely to be used against them , they laid the keel of a ship that had the gun-deck battery of a frigate like the famous Ironsides , a force of itself nearly sufficient to compete with the whole of the American squadron . In consequence of these exertions , M'Donough was enabled to assemble in Plattsburgh Bay , by the end of August , a force , including his galleys , of 80 guns . He had a ship , a brig , a schooner , a sloop , and ten galleys . All these vessels carried heavy motal , with the exception of the sloop , a craft too light to bear more than seven long nines . Among the 03 pieces of the three largest vessels , however , 34 were carronades ; a species of gun that will not admit of being double-shotted unless nt very close quarters , besides being very liable to get dismounted by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 guns , and a very heavy vessel in the Confiance , their commanding ship , were much better provided in this respect . His two principal vessels had but 0 car- // Jan. ronades among the 53 guns they carried . In addition to this essential advantage of the 37 guns of the Confiance , no less than 31 were long 24s , a formidable battery to oppose to the ordinary sloops-of-war of that day . As the English historian , James , has unhesitatingly derided the idea of the superiority of the English , and Alison has followed him , in some measure , as authority , it may be well to be a little more precise on this branch of my subject . In the first place , James gives an armament to the Confiance differing from that just stated . He says that she mounted but 26 guns , in regular broadside , on her main deck ; 4 carronades , which were placed in her bridle and stern-ports , making up the 30 guns mentioned in the American accounts . I have ascertained that this statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most respectable and efficient officers in the American marine , took possession of the Confiance after she struck , and continued in charge of her until the ship was finally laid upa period of several weeks . Mr. Lavalette commanded the Confiance six or eight times longer than any other man - after her armament was in her . He commanded her , too , after the battle , and when her precise force would be apt to be the subject of inquiry and speculation . From this officer I have written authority for saying that the main-deck battery of the Confiance consisted of 30 long 24s , mounted in regular broadside . I have also written authority from the present Commodore Reid , a careful officer , and a highly honorable man , who examined both squadrons before the vessels were broken up , for saying that the Confiance was pierced for 30 guns on her main deck , in regular broadside , and that he thinks she had no proper bridle-ports at all . Mr. James gives no authorities for what he says , and , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country , it is just to conclude that he is not to be put in opposition to the witnesses I have mentioned . James also affects to prove that the size of the Conflance was only 831 tons , while he maintains that of the Saratoga to have been but a trifle less . On this point , also , Captain Lavalette has testi fled . " I believe , " says that gentleman , in a letter written for publication , " the tonnage of the Confiance was 1,120 tons , and that of the Saratoga 630 . " Commodore Reid , in a published letter , says on this head , " The two ships ( the Confiance and Saratoga are meant ) lay alongside of each other at the time I saw them , and the English vessel was so obviously superior in tonnage and force , as to leave little doubt in my mind of her ability , I might almost say , to defeat the whole of M'Donough 's squadron . " Here* then , we have the testimony of two competent witnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced seamen , one of whom had actually belonged to both the Confiance and the Saratoga , and the other of whom had examined the two vessels as they lay side by side , as opposed to the intemperate assertions of a man who never saw either , and he , too , actually a horsedoctor ; a profession that is doubtless useful in its sphere , but which can qual ify no man to speak very authoritatively of ships . Before quitting this point , it may be well to add that Mr. James seems , in his text , to . give the official report of Captain Pring , in justification of his own account of the armaments of the English vessels , referring to the page of the Appendix , where the evidence was to be found , though in the Appendix itself he admits that this report was not forwarded with the despatches , and does not give it on any visible authority but his own naked statements . Gentlemen , the most important vessels of both squadrons were left in the quiet possession of the conquerors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the relative force of the two squadrons , it was those conquerors ; and all the testb mony I can discover goes to confirm their account . I have never conversed - with any American officer who was in the Battle of Lake Erie , who did not frankly admit the superiority of out // squadron *n that occasion , though the battle was fought under adverse circumstances , while , on the other hand , I can find no evidence whatever , of an American origin , which does not distinctly affirm the great superiority of the enemy in the affair of Plattsburgh Bay . The great struggle in the naval conflict , that was distinctly foreseen 1*y the commencement of the month of September , was for the command of the lake . M'Donough had also in view the defence of the water-flank of the works ashore , while the enemy anticipated being able to turn it , after crushing the force afloat . With these double objects before him , M'Donough discovered great wisdom in the anchorage he occupied . His squadron was drawn up in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and south line , sufficiently within the bay to compel the enemy to enter it to the westward of Cumberland Head , and thus to bring him within the effective range of the American short guns . The rear , or southern end of this line , was in a measure protected by a small island and an extensive shoal . On the part of the enemy , it was pretended that the American squadron was sustained by the batteries ashore , and some commentators have ascribed the result to this circumstance . It is a fact , beyond controversy , that the batteries of Plattsburgh rendered no assistance to the American shipping on this occasion , nor could they render any , on account of the distance . To have thrown shot over the American vessels would have been physically impossible , with the artillery of that day , and it is unnecessary to say that no sane man would attempt to hit the English fleet by firing through the American . The circumstance that Captain Ping , in his official account , says nothing of any such aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ; conclusive . Captain Downie , the officer who bad been sent by Sir James Yeo to command the English force on this lake , had collected four vessels to contend with the Americans , exclusively of thirteen galleys . The force of the four principal craft , however , was very unequally distributed . That of the Confiance has already been mentioned , in general terms . She was a huge corvette , with a poop and top-gallant forecastle , both of the latter being armed . Her lighted gun threw a 24-pound shot , and , as has been mentioned , of the 37 which composed her armament , 31 were long pieces of this calibre . The brig Linnet was a warm little craft , armed with 16 long 12s , a species of armament which , under the circumstances , made her more than equal to a vessel carrying the same number of 32 carronades . The two others of the larger craft were sloops or cutters , each carrying 11 guns of mixed calibres . One of these cutters might have been about equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter than the Ticonderoga , the schooner she was to assail . In this latter duty , however , she was to be assisted by some of the English galleys . The number of the enemy 's galleys has been disputed . M'Donough puts it at thirteen ; Captain Pring is silent on the point ; Sir George Prevost says twelve ; and James , in his usual confident manner , without giving any authority , however , affirms there were but ten . The truth unquestionably lies between the statements of Sir George Preyost and M'Donough . My own information originally told me that the English cleared Cumberland Head with eighteen sail , viz. , a ship , a brig , three sloops , and thirteen galleys ; one of the sloops being a merchant-vessel that had accompanied the squadron merely to convey spectators . A letter from the officer who was.in charge of the American guard-boat , and who first made the English squadron , and brought in the report of their approach , informs me that the enemy cleared Cumberland Head with nineteen sail , two of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this gentleman was a member of the family of Platt , of Plattsburgh , and must have had many subsequent opportunities for ob // taming local information , it is highly probable his statement is accurate . This would make the number of the galleys thirteen . Eight of these English galleys mounted two guns each , and the remaining five only one . In men , the number is supposed to have been somewhat in favor of the English . One thing is certain : having a large army in their immediate vicinity , and confessedly troops on board , it is not to be supposed that Captain Bownie would enter on an ex*terprise of such importance without a sufficiency of men . The same reasoning will apply to the vessels , as the invading party would not be likely to attack an enemy who , in 1814 , must have commanded his enforced respect , without a force that he imagined would insure success . To suppose the contrary , would infer the height of presumption and folly . We omit the details of the engagement , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained , and a very simple report forwarded to Government , the world heard but little more from M'Donough on the subject . Gentlemen , I have been familiar with the naval events of the world , from early youth-have long contemplated the work on the maritime events of this country which has since appeared ; but down almost to the day of writing the account of the Battle of Plattsburgh Bay , I was unable to ascertain even the leading facts of that great event . There had been a victory , and the main result was known ; but the rest was so completely veiled behind the modesty of the conqueror , that it entirely eluded my search , in any thing like a documentary form . If there was ever an engraving of this action , I never saw it ; no one but the actors , themselves , seemed acquainted with the details . So little was said on the subject , that I was surprised to find how many of my personal acquaintances had been in the battle without my knowing it . In a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was likely to be lost in vague generalities , unsatisfactory and loose statements , and erroneous le gends . One anecdote has been mentioned , in illustration of M'Donough 's simplicity . No accurate and conscientious historian would think of ascribing the retreat of Sir George Prevost to any thing but the capture of the English squadron . The handful of soldiers opposed to him showed spirit and firmness , but their effcrrts could have availed but little , in a general attack , against the overwhelming force that could have been brought against them . The loss of his auxiliary on the lake induced the English governor-general to begin a retreat , that may not have been conducted on strict military principles , and which was not very creditable , perhaps , to the British arms , but which would soon have been necessary , or he would have been left to meet the gathered population of the whole northern frontier in arms . To M'Donough 's success were all these great results owing , rather than to any achievement on the land . Yet , at a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honor of the triumph of the American arms , M'Donough sat as a subordinate , bearing his hard-earned honors so meekly , that most around him seemed to think that he was really the secondary agent in the recentlyacquired glory , for which he was content to pass . Gentlemen , high as were M'Donough 's claims , and lasting as must he his renown , he was not alone on that eventful day . All voices united in proclaiming the singular gallantry displayed by the younger Cassin , in command of the Ticonderoga . Left , by the retreat of the Preble , opposed to the whole weight of the assaults of the English galleys , he fought his schooner with the coolness and judgment of a highly-trained officer , and with the courage of a lion . Finding himself pressed upon by so many enemies , and fearful some might get too near in the smoke , he sprang upon the taifrail , and on that elevated and exposed position he remained , calmly directing the fire of his batteries throughout the kiottest of the engagement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ha head , was literally in rags from the effect of grape and canister ; nothing but an almighty Providence carried him safely through the arduous duties of that momentous hour . No man who wears the American uniform , ever displayed greater personal gallantry than did Stephen Cassin throughout this trying scene . Others on board that schooner were distinguished for their coolness . The manner in which young Paulding , then a midshipman and now a commander , sighted his guns , with the enemy almost at their muzzles , is spoken of with admiration even to the present hour . On board the Saratoga all behaved well , suffering from , and marked as she was by , her powerful adversary . As for M'Donough himself , quiet , unmoved , cheerful , simple , and yet attentive , he was the same in that arduous struggle as on all other occasions . Twice was he knocked down , and each time it was thought with mortal hurts , but he regained his feet , and continued at his post to the close of the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , too , was twice on the deck , once under circumstances that resembled those of his eommander , though neither was reported among the hurt . As regards M'Donough himself , he is beyond our praise , or gratitude . He died , as he wished to die , leaving behind him the merited reputation of an honest man . No American who has done so much for his country , has received so little of its attention or its praise . While the deeds of others have been extolled beyond their just claims , his have been eulogized less than they merit . This has been owing , in part , to the real , inherent modesty of the man . With M'IDonough there were no affectations on such a subject . His victory achieved , he was willing to let it be forgotten , in all things , but its benefits , and his own deep gratitude to God . Gentlemen , it is peculiarly your province to see that history does its duty ; not in senseless eulogiums , or narrow claims to provincial excellence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs exclusively to ourselves , because the battle was fought in our own waters ; but because , living so near the scene , facts are more easily obtained by you than by others , because your own immediate community derived the greatest benefit from the defeat of the enemy , and because justice requires it at your hands . Let it , then , be one of your grateful duties so to place this great achievement on the records you control , that the future historian and posterity may estimate it with a due regard to its difficulties , and to the benefits it conferred on the nation .
