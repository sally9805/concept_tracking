Characters . MR . CARR . HORACE . MARK . Main text HORACE .  --  Father , what is a white lie ? MR . CARR .  --  There is no such thing , Horace . A lie is always black and wicked . MARK .  --  But , Father , I have heard people talk about white lies , too . HORACE .  --  When Harry Howell had his cousin to tea last week , he told us he had a large party , and when we found him out , he said it was only a white lie , anyhow . MARK .  --  And Mr. Haynes , when he said the old rooster he sold last market day was a young chicken , said it was only a white lie . MR . CARR .  --  What is a lie , Horace ? HORACE .  --  A false statement , intended to deceive ; you told us that , long ago . MR . CARR .  --  What was Harry Howell 's statement , and that of Mr. Haynes ? True statements ? HORACE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARR .  --  Intended to deceive ? HORACE .  --  Yes sir . MR . CARR .  --  Then they were lies ! Never try to soothe your conscience with such mistaken ideas , as that the magnitude or importance of a lie , makes any difference in its guilt . A half lie , or quarter of a lie , is as bad as a whole one . Remember that . MARK .  --  But , father , many boys who would not tell a deliberate falsehood , will twist the truth , or evade it , to deceive a little bit . MR . CARR .  --  That is just as bad . HORACE .  --  It is very cowardly . MR . CARR .  --  If a boy does anything wrong , intentionally or accidentally , through carelessness , perhaps , or because he was ignorant of the consequences of his fault , and then tries to shuffle out of his scrape by evasion or deceit , he is as guilty of falsehood , as if he had made a direct denial of his guilt . He doubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first fault the sin of lying . HORACE .  --  But , father , our teacher is so very strict , that the boys , many of them , are afraid to own a fault . MR . CARR .  --  Is he less strict , when he finds he has been deceived ? MARK .  --  Indeed he is not ? MR . CARR .  --  Then the penalty is greater , as well as the sin . HORACE .  --  Some of the boys look mean enough when he catches them in an untruth . MARK .  --  But , father , are not exaggerations , stories made up about people , little incidents magnified into great events , white lies ? MR . CARR .  --  No , Mark . When the line is passed , by even a hair 's breadth , that divides truth from falsehood , there is no shading of difference in the grades of that falsehood . What is not true is false , and a lie is a lie , be it big or little , important or trivial . MARK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who simply exaggerates is a liar ? MR . CARR .  --  Yes ; such is the truth . A person who habitually indulges in exaggeration or story-telling is mean and worthless , despicable both to his fellow-men and in the eyes of his Maker . HORACE .  --  And I have noticed , too , father , when they once pass the barrier of truth , that they keep adding lie to lie , till they are so entangled that they must be detected . MR . CARR .  --  It is certainly much easier to speak the truth , than to invent even the most plausible falsehood . Strive , my sons , always to guard against the least deviation from the exact truth . Nothing is more beautiful than a truthful boy , and you will find no one more respected . MARK .  --  That is so . I do not believe you could torture Leon Henderson into telling a lie , and all the boys respect him , though some of them pretend to sneer at him . HORACE .  --  And our teacher will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CARR .  --  How proud his father must be of such a boy ! HORACE .  --  We will try , father , to give you the same cause for pride . MARK .  --  We will indeed , father . MR . CARR .  --  Do so , my boys . Be truthful , candid , and above deceit . Never try to palliate falsehood by thinking it is not so bad as it might me . All lies are alike , and above all , recollect that in the sight of God , there are no white lies . Curtain falls .
