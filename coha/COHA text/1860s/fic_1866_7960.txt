Dorr , Julia C. R. ( Julia Caroline Ripley ) , 1825-1913 : POEM BY MRS . JULIA C. R. DORR. from Poem , in Oration by Prof. Brainerd Kellogg ( 1866 ) O Mighty Present ! from our souls to-day Unloose thy grasp a little while , we pray ;  --  Nor frown that now upon another 's shrine , We lay the votive wreaths so lately thine . We are not fickle , though it is not long Since with glad harmony , triumphant song And waving banners , the exultant throng Proclaimed thee monarch  --  crowned thee kingliest king  --  Lord of the ages  --  mightiest and best Of the dead years that in their pallid rest Sleep undisturbed , though loud our plaudits ring ! We are not fickle . Grand , heroic , true , Faithful and brave thine earnest work to do , O glorious Present ! we rejoice in thee , Thou noble nurse of great deeds yet to be ! Hast thou not shown us that our mother Earth Still , in exultant joy , gives heroes birth ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the truest truth , Grow pale and dim before the facts sublime Thy pen has written on the scroll of Time ? Ah ! never yet did poet 's tongue , Though like a silver bell it rung , Or minstrel , o'er his sounding lyre , Breathing the old , prophetic fire , Or harper , in the storied walls Of Scotia 's proud baronial halls  --  Where mail-clad men with sword and spear , Waited entranced the song to hear , That through the stormy midnight hour , Fast held them in its spell of power  --  Ah ! never yet did they rehearse In flowing rhyme or stately verse , The praise of deeds more nobly done , Or tell of fields more grandly won ! We laud thee , we praise thee , we bless thee to-day ! At thy feet , lowly bending , glad homage we pay ! Thou hast taught us that men are as brave as of yore ; That the day of great deeds and great thought is not o'er ; That the courage undaunted , the far-reaching faith , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hastens to lay Its all on the altar have not passed away . Thou hast taught us that " country " is more than a name ; That honor unsullied is better than fame ; Thou hast proved that while man can still battle for truth , Even boyhood can give up the promise of youth , And yielding its life with a smile and a sigh , Say " ' T is sweet for my God and my country to die ! " O heart-searching Present , thy sons have gone down , To the night of the grave in their day of renown ! Thy daughters have watched by the hearthstone in vain , For the loved and the lost that returned not again . No Spartans were they  --  yet mid tears falling fast , Their faith and their patience endured to the last ; And God gave them strength to their kindred to say " Go ye forth to the fight , while we labor and pray ! " Thou hast opened thy coffers on land and on sea ; And broad-handed Charity , noble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe , Like the rain , that descending falls softly and slow On the just and unjust , and never may know The one from the other . When thy story is told By some age that looks backward and calls thee " the old , " It shall puzzle its sages , all great as thou art , To tell which was greatest , thy head or thy heart ! Mighty words thy lips have spoken  --  Strongest fetters thou hast broken  --  And in tones like those of thunder , When the clouds are rent asunder , Thou hast made the Nations hear thee  --  Thou hast bade the Tyrants fear thee  --  And our hearts to-day proclaim thee , As they oft have done before , Fit to lead the glorious legions Of the glorious days of yore ! Yet still , we pray thee , veil awhile Thy splendor from our dazzled eyes And hide the glory of thy smile , Lest our souls wake to new surprise ! Bear with us while our feet to-day Retrace a dim and shadowy way , In search of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthier thee ! And now , O spirit of the Past , draw near , And let us feel thy blessed presence here ! With reverent hearts and voices hushed and low , We wait to hear thy garments ' rustling flow ! From all the conflicts of our busy life , From all its bitter and enduring strife , Its eager yearnings and its wild turmoils , Its cares , its joys , its sorrows and its toils , Its aspirations that too often seem Like the remembered phantoms of a dream , We turn aside . This hour is thine alone , And none shall share the grandeur of thy throne . Ah ! thou art here ! Beneath these whispering trees , Thy breath floats softly on the passing breeze ; We feel the presence that we can not see , And every moment draws us nearer thee . Could we but see thee , with thy solemn eyes In whose rare depths such wondrous meaning lies  --  Thy dark robes sweeping this enchanted ground  --  Thy midnight hair with purple pansies crowned  --  Thy lip so sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thy mien , For thou hast done with dreams . Nor joy nor pain Can e'er disturb thy placid calm again . What is this veil that hides thee from our sight ? Breathe it away , thou spirit darkly bright ! It may not be ! Our eyes are dim , Perhaps with age , perhaps with tears ; We hear no more the choral hymn The angels sing among the spheres . Weary and worn and tempest-tossed , Much have we gained  --  and something lost  --  Since in the sun-beams golden glow , The rippling brooklet 's silvery flow , The song of bird or murmuring bee , The fragrant flower , the stately tree , The royal pomp of sunset skies , And all earth 's varied harmonies , We saw and heard what never more Can Earth or Heaven to us restore , And felt a child 's unquestioning faith In childhood 's mystic lore ! A hundred times the Summer 's fragrant blooms Have laden all the air with sweet perfumes  --  A hundred times along the mountain side , Autumn has flung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread His snowy mantle o'er the violet 's bed  --  A hundred times has Earth rejoiced to hear The Spring 's light footsteps in the forest sere , Since on yon grassy knoll the quick , sharp stroke Of the young woodman 's axe the silence broke . Not then did these encircling hills look down On quaint old farmhouse , or on steepled town , No church-spires pointed to the arching skies ; No wandering lovers saw the moon arise ; No childish laughter mingled with the song Of the fair Otter , as it flowed along As brightly then as now . Ah ! little recked The joyous river , when the sunshine flecked Its dancing wavelets , that no human eye Gave it glad welcome as it frolicked by ! The long , uncounted years had come and flown , And it had still swept on , unseen , unknown , Biding its time . No minstrel sang its praise , No poet named it in immortal lays . It played no part in legendary lore . And young Romance knew not its winding shore . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares for man 's smile or his frown ; In the robes of her royalty still she is clad , Though his eye may behold not her sceptre or crown ! And over our beautiful Otter the trees Swayed lightly as now in the frolicsome breeze ; And the meek little violet lifted an eye , As blue as its own , to the laughing blue sky . The harebell trembled on its stem , Down where the rushing waters gleam , A sapphire on the broidered hem Of some fair Naiad of the stream . The buttercups , bright-eyed and bold , Held up their chalices of gold To catch the sunshine and the dew , Gaily as those that bloom for you , And deep within the forest shade , Where broadest noon mere twilight made , Ten thousand small , sweet censers swung , And tiny bells by Zephyrs rung Made tinkling music , till the day In solemn splendor died away . The woods were full of praise and prayer , Although no human tongue was there ; For every Pine and Hemlock sung The grand cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looked up and whispered " Thou art God . " The birds sang as they sing to-day , A song of love and joy alway . The brown Thrush from its golden throat Poured out its long , melodious note ; The Pigeons cooed ; the Veery threw Its mellow trill from spray to spray ; The wild Night Hawk its trumpet blew , And the owl cried " tu whit , tu whoo , " From set of sun to break of day . The Partridge reared her fearless brood Safe in the darkling solitude , And the Bald Eagle built its nest High on the tall cliff 's craggy crest , And often , when the still moonlight Made all the lonely valley bright , Down from the hills its thirst to slake , The Deer trod softly through the brake ; While far away the spotted Fawn Waited the coming of the dawn , And trembled when the Panther 's scream Startled it from a troubled dream . The Black Bear roamed the forest wide ; The fierce Wolf tracked the mountain side ; The Wild Cat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and dread ; The Red Fox barked  --  a strange , weird sound That woke the slumbering echoes round , And the burrowing Mink and Otter hid In their holes the tangled roots amid . Lords of their limitless domain , Of hill and dale , of mount and plain , The wild things dreamed not of the hour When they should own their Master 's power . But he came at last ! With a sturdy hand , And a voice of deep and stern command , And an eye that looked upon friend and foe With the spell of strength in its kindling glow ; With a stately presence , a mien that told That his heart was true as it was bold , He came to his own and proclaimed his sway , And the forest fled from his glance away ! The rightful heir of the regions round , No golden circlet his forehead crowned , But he wore his youth with a kingly grace , As he proudly stepped to his destined place . Never a royal couch had he , But he made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garb of homespun brown Round the brave young limbs was folded down . Blithely the days and the years sped on ; The meed of his toil at length was won  --  A home in the wilderness , fair and sweet , Where the hill and the winding river meet . Ah ! blest was he , when the silent stars , Peering from out their cloudy bars , Looked down on the lowly cot that stood Deep in the virgin solitude ; And saw the cabin windows gleam In the pleasant hearthfire 's ruddy beam , While the children laughed , and the mother sang Till the walls with the merry music rang ! A hundred years ! A century of change  --  A century of progress vast and strange ! Ah ! could the dust that under yonder sod In patient hope awaits the voice of God , Wearing the hues of ruddy life again Come forth to mingle with its fellow men , How would the earnest , thoughtful , questioning eyes Find marvels everywhere ! In earth and skies ; On the broad seas , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Where the Black Horses , with their eyes of fire , Scale the high mountains , panting with desire , Or thundering down the valleys , onward sweep With long , persistent strides from steep to steep ; Where the tamed lightning hastes , with eager thrill , To do man 's bidding , and perform his will , Or where their river , emerald banks between , Bears on its silver tide your " Valley Queen . " Yet could our voices reach the slumbering dead Who rest so calmly in yon grass-grown bed , This truth would seem with greatest wonder fraught ,  --  That they are heroes to our eyes and thought . For they were men who never dreamed of fame ; They did not toil to make themselves a name ; They little fancied that when years had passed , And the long century had died at last , Another age should make their graves a shrine , And humble chaplets for their memory twine . They simply strove , as other men may strive , Full , earnest lives in sober strength to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subdued wild nature as at God 's command ; Laid the broad acres open to the sun , And made fair homes in forests dark and dun ; Built churches , founded schools , established laws , Kindly and just and true to freedom 's cause ; Resisted wrong , and with stout hands and hearts , In war , as well as peace , played well their parts . Their men were brave ; their women pure and true ; Their sons ashamed no honest work to do ; And while they dreamed no dreams of being great , They did great deeds , and conquered hostile Fate . We laud them , we praise them , we bless them to-day ; At their graves , as their right , tearful homage we pay ! And the laurel-crowned Present comes humbly at last , And bends by our side at the shrine of the Past . With the hands that such burdens unshrinking have borne , From the brow weary cares have so furrowed and worn , She takes off the chaplet , and lays it with tears That she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years . Hark ! a breath of faint music , a murmur of song ! A form of strange beauty is floating along On the soft summer air , and the Future draws near , With a light on her young face , unshadowed and clear . Two garlands she bears in the arms that not yet Have toiled ' neath the burden and heat of the day ; Lo ! both are of Amaranth , fragrant and wet With the dew of remembrance , and fadeless alway . Oh ! well may we hush our vain babblings  --  and wait ! He who merits the crown wears it sooner or late ! On the brow of the Present , the grave of the Past , The wreaths they have earned shall rest surely at last !
