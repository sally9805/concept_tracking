txt ART . II . - Commentaries on American Law . By JAMES KENT . Tenth Edition . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1860. 4 vols. 8vo . WE do not propose to make a special review of the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent ; but we use them simply as a representative of the innumerable text-books on the English Law . These may all be separated into two classes ; - the first including the reports and unpretending digests of cases ; the latter books written with the more ambitious design of reducing the law to general principles . The former furnish a complete , satisfactory , and tolerably well-digested history of particular cases , and therefore fully effect their legitimate object . But the latter , being composed by men altogether ignorant of the fundamental principles of the method upon which they should have proceeded , entirely fail of their aim ; for their professed design , the reduction of the law to general principles , belonging entirely to the province of philosophy , has fallen altogether into the hands of practising lawyers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , whose misfortune it is that they have to rely on text-books , good or bad ) law-books of the latter class are utterly untrustworthy . For this opinion we avouch the tacit authority of the more intelligent of the lawyers themselves , who regard the reports as the only genuine fountains of the law , and use the text-books merely as // indexes . The result is , that the lawyers , whether philosophers or fools , are Compelled , eaCh for himself , to deduce the principles of the science from the infinite collection of particular cases decided by the courts of thirty-six different and independent governments , as found in some thousand or more volumes of reports , which is very much the same as if all the books upon the science of chemistry were pronounced untrustworthy , and the student were compelled to test every principle which he might wish to use , by reference to an immense history of the innumerable experiments from which the principles of the science were derived . To render the matter worse , the opinion prevails with the profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary evil , and can not be to any great extent removed . We hold , with Demosthenes , that past errors furnish ground of hope , rather than of despair , for the future . If we had used all means possible in the past , then it might be argued that it is impossible for us to advance further than we have advanced . But when it is easily demonstrated that the excellence of the law , so far as it is excellent , is the legitimate result of a certain method of proceeding , and that the uncertainty and other defects of the law are the equally legitimate results of departures from that method , then indeed may we hope , by consistently adopting the principles of that method , unmixed with the errors which have hitherto prevailed , to carry the science of law nearer to perfection than now seems possible . We propose , therefore , to offer a few observations in regard to the true method of legal science , and also the particulars in which the present system has departed from it . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a rule of action , or to make a law for any cases except such as are known and present to the mind of the legislator ; and as it is impossible for him to conceive of the infinite variety of cases which may occur in the course of human affairs , it follows that the positive law is limited to cases similar to those which have actually occurred . For all other cases , then , there is no law but that of natural justice , which , within this scope , is part of the law of the land . That natural justice is the rule of decision for such cases // appears when we consider that in all controversies between man and man , even if there is no rule of positive law applicable , still it is absolutely necessary to decide ; and there can of course be no other standard than the native sense of right . But these remarks must be understood as applying to the civil , as opposed , in this respect , to the criminal law . For , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go beyond the precepts of the positive law . The lawyers have not been without a glimmering notion of this truth , and for their benefit we will quote a few passages in support of it . Grotius , in a passage often quoted , speaks of equity as " the correction of that wherein the law by reason of its universality is deficient " ; and in another place he says , that there are cases which " lex non exacte definit , sed arbitrio boni yin permittet . " The author of the " Treatise on Equity " expresses the same idea still more clearly . " As the rules of the municipal law arefinite , " he says , " and the subject of it infinite , there will often turn out cases which can not be determined by them ; for there can be no finite rule of an infinite matter perfect . So that there will be a necessity of having recourse to natural principles ; that what is wanting to the finite may be supplied out of that which is infinite . " Bacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , has pointed out the same truth . " There should be , " he says , " both courts and juries to decide according to conscience and discretion where the rule is defective ; for laws , as we have before observed , can not provide against all cases , but are suited only to such as frequently happen ; time , the wisest of all things , daily introducing new cases . " And in another place he says , " The narrowness of human prudence can not foresee all the cases that time may produce . " Yet no one seems to have had an adequate conception of the extent to which cases have been necessarily decided by principles of natural justice ; but , on the contrary , the lawyers have ever indulged their imaginations with the fiction , that it has been the custom of the courts simply to deliver the positive law , and not to make it , - jus dicere , non jus dare . But the truth is , that , wherever there has been no principle of the positive law applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // 333 LAW A PERFECTIBLE SCIENCE . duty , of the courts to decide according to the principles of natural justice ; and , in making the precedent , they have been as truly legislators as the Parliament of Great Britain , the Congress of the United States , or the Legislature of Massachusetts . It is in this way that the great mass of the law of every civilized nation has been made . In primitive ages , the*cases that arise are few , and the laws are necessarily limited to them . But as the business of men increases in extent and variety , new cases occur , which are successively settled either by the legislator proper , or more commonly by the courts ; and thus new principles are added to the law , and it approaches nearer and nearer to completeness and perfection . Thus the Roman laws were originally contained in twelve tables , so brief as to be easily committed to memory , and they could of course have extended to but a very small proportion of the cases which afterward arose . Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the occasional edicts of those magistrates who were invested with the honors of the state . " And thus grew up the immense body of the civil law , of which comparatively but a small proportion consists of statute law . Dean Milman , in his edition of Gibbon , remarks : " I can not but consider this confusion of the legislative and judicial authority as a very perilous constitutional precedent , " - an opinion in which any lawyer , or modern political philosopher , would agree with him . But the history of our own law presents essentially the same " confusion of the legislative and judicial authority " ; for the common law , as it originally stood , and statutes , form but comparatively a small proportion of existing law , - the rest being what has been contemptuously called " Judge-made law , " having arisen , as is well said by Kent , " from an application of the dictates of natural justice and cultivated reason to particular cases. ** Such has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the law merchant , and probably of nine tenths of all the law of personal property and of contracts . And , from the nature of the case , this could not have been otherwise ; for where the positive law was silent , which in the beginning it was in reference to a vast majority of all cases that afterward arose , // Oct. it was still necessary to decide , and the decisions , being held binding in all similar cases , became part of the positive law . The positive law of a State is contained in English statutes and common-law authorities existing at the time of the emigration , unless subsequently altered , and in the statutes and in the judicial decisions of the State . It is a rule universally received in America , that the last-named , unless plainly opposed to former precedent , are absolutely binding . Where , however , there is a conflict among the precedents , the judge must decide according to the preponderance of authority ; for it is true of our judges , as Gibbon said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require them to agree with the precedents only when the precedents agree among themselves . There is , however , a fundamental and essential distinction between statutes and judicial decisions . In the case of a statute , the duty of a judge is simply to interpret the language of the legislator , " Voluntas pro ratione stet , " and the statute extends only to cases to which a fair construction of its language makes it applicable . On the other hand , a precedent should be extended to all similar cases . The legislator , in making a rule for a certain class of cases which he has in contemplation , may either not conceive of , and consequently omit , other cases , which come equally within the reason of the rule ; or he may , by the use of too general language , extend the rule to cases where the reason for it does not exist . But this can never be the case with precedents rightly used , for they can be rightly applied only to cases presenting a similar reason . Therefore it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases should be similar in name , or in general character ; but they must be similar in those points which furnished the reason for the precedent decision . It follows , then , that when the court attempts , from the case before it , to lay down a rule which shall extend to cases not presenting a similar reason for the rule , it is a gross usurpation of legislative authority , and the rule is not law . Yet this is the every-day practice of the courts ; the judges and the lawyers all the time strenuously denying that courts should ever make law , even in those cases in which it is absolutely necessary for them to do so . It need // not be remarked that an error in regard to this principle goes to the very foundation of legal science , and that it must always introduce into the law endless confusion , uncertainty , and injustice . For the whole end of legal science is , first , to discover what is just in particular cases ; secondly , to discover what circumstances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constitute the reason for it , and to class together all cases presenting those circumstances ; and , finally , to discover , from the principles thus deduced , other more general and abstract principles . The class of cases to which a precedent applies is rightfully determined by an abstraction of those things which constitute the reason for the precedent . But the classification made by words is made by an abstraction of some other common quality . And it has been a prevalent error to extend the precedent , not only to cases within the reason thereof , but to all cases having a common name . Out of many instances of this error with which the practice of the courts could furnish us , we will select one , from the decisions of the most august tribunal in the land , the Supreme Court of the United States . In the case of Hunt vs . Rousmani*re that court decided that , where parties by a mistake of law ( that is , by a misapprehension of what the law is ) are prevented from making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party can be relieved by a court of equity ; for courts can not make contracts for parties . But afterward , in the case of the Bank of the United States vs . Daniells , the court extended this rule to all cases of mistake of law , and decided that where a party , under a mistake of law , paid money , which he Was under no obligation legal or moral to pay , he had no right to demand a repayment . Nor is the Supreme Court alone in this respect . For the question , " whether a party shall be held bound by an act done under a mistake of law , " has been a subject of contention among the lawyers for thirty or forty years ; as it was for many generations previous , to their brethren of the civil law . And after endless discussions , ( affording a melancholy instance of the imbecility of the human intellect , when it leaves the // contemplation of nature , and ' busies itself about received notions and prejudices , ) the question still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered that under the term mistakes of law are included various , and clearly distinguishable , classes of cases , differing in all those respects which constitute the reason why relief should or should not be granted . The positive law is generally supposed to be more complete and extensive than it actually is ; for lawyers have a confused notion that the judicial decisions of the courts of other States , and of England , should be regarded by our courts as precedents and positive law . But such , we apprehend , they are not . It would be ridiculous to suppose that a judge sitting in England , or in Illinois , should make law for Massachusetts ; and the same argument which proves that Eiiglish precedents are law here , proves equally well that our precedents are law in England . But it is well known that they are not so considered by the English courts ; a precedent that we are , according to the notion itself , bound by . And so the notioi ? becomes suicidal , and kills itself . In truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the mind of the judge , but should move it only so far as they are founded in reason . Their proper use is , not as a substitute for the dictates of natural justice , but only as an aid in discovering what the dictates of natural justice may be . In other words , their use is to assist , not to govern , the mind of the court ; and wherever they appear to the court to differ from natural justice , they sb*uld be disregarded . They stand , therefore , on no higher authority than the opinion of any private lawyer whose learning and ability are equal to that of the judge who made them , and who has bestowed upon the question an equal amount of unprejudiced investigation . In questions of mere rational law , that is , in all cases to which the principles of the positive law do not extend , English and other foreign precedents should not have as much influence as the far more just and philosophic notions of the civil lawyers . But the former are in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their use extends , not only to cases omitted , but to cases where the application of the principles of the positive law is in question . // 337 It must be acknowledged , that the common practice of the lawyers can not be appealed to in support of the truth of these views . But this happens from an inveterate and vicious prejudice and habit of thought , rooted in the profession by the growth of many centuries , which renders them so prone to depend for argument upon the opinion of others , that they will take the opinion of any one , rather than rely on the free and independent powers of their own understanding . In fine , in this , as in all other cases , the reason for the law indicates its extent ; and there can be no other reason for the use of English and other foreign precedents , than that which is well urged by Sir William Jones in favor of the use of the Civil Law : - " The iRescripts of Severus or Caracalla , which were laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority at Westminster ; but in questions of mere rational law , ( and , when we speak of common-law precedents , of positive law also , ) no cause can be assigned why we should not shorten our labor by resorting to the wisdom of ancient jurists , many of whom were the most sagacious and ingenious of men . What is good sense in one age must be good sense , all circumstances remaining , in another ; and pure unsophisticated reason is the same in Italy and in England , in the mind of a Papinian and of a Blackstone . " But the chief value of foreign reports is this , - that they furnish us with an infinite number of particular cases , from which to derive new principles , ( being to the lawyer what the laboratory is to the chemist , ) and thus enable us to render the law more complete . For , as is to be inferred from what we have before said , without them the law would be limited to cases that have occurred in our own courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extended , at this age of the world , to nearly all possible cases that can arise in the course of human affairs . As the law of all cases not provided for by the positive law is natural justice , it follows that this part of the law at least is purely a science , and that its principles are to be discovered only by a use of the true philosophic method . Indeed , the whole law is a science so far , and so far only , as it agrees with natural justice . And in the main it does thus agree ; for no system of law could for any great length of time exist unless // for the most part it coincided with received notions of justice . Regarding the law then as a science , the question naturally presents its6lf , How are we to treat precedents and statutes which are contrary to natural justice ? As for statutes , we have before remarked that they should never be extended beyond the plain meaning and intent of the legislator . Depending as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nature of things , the science of law has nothing to do with them , further than simply to note them as agreeing or disagreeing with its principles . The same remark is true of erroneous precedents , which by force of custom have passed into law . These should be respected as law in cases similar , not only in reason , but in name and general circumstances ; but are to be treated as arbitrary exceptions , to be extended no further . This seems to be what was intended by the profound observation of Bacon : " Let reason be esteemed a fruitful , and custom a barren thing , so as to breed no cases . And therefore whatever is received against the reason of a law , ( i. e. the true reason of a law , natural *justice , ) or where the reason is obscure , should not be drawn into precedents . " It is well known that Bacon intended the Novum Organum to apply as well to the moral and mental as to the natural sciences . " Some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - whether we talk of perfecting natural philosophy alone , according to our method , or the other sciences also , such as logic , ethics , politics . We certainly intend to comprehend them all . And as common logic , which regulates matters by syllogisms , is applied not only to natural , but also to every other science ; so our inductive method likewise comprehends them all . " And , in another place : " Man , as the minister and interpreter of nature , does and understands as much as his observations on the order of nature , either with regard to things or the mind , permit him , and neither knows nor is capable of more . " That this remark is true in regard to legal science can not be denied ; for the principles of law either are , or should be , generalizations of what is just in particular cases . And it is evident that even the received and familiar notions of justice must have had their origin in observations of // what was just in particular Cases . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as something having an independent existence , yet the truth is , it can a*tually exist only as a quality of the transactions of which it may be affirmed . Just as a color , of which , as of justice , we can form an abstract conception , can exist only as a quality of some object . It is a common opinion , that the received principles of justice are coextensive with human conduct , and that to every controversy between man and man some one of these principles will be found to be applicable . But the error of this opinion would immediately appear , if any one would collect all the received principles of justice , whether found in common use or in the writings of moral philosophers ; for we venture to assert that there are innumerable cases in the law reports that could not be decided either by any of those principles or by any deductions from them . The cause of this error is , that men have mistaken their ability to perceive what is just , for an actual precedent knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , ( whether the rule be utility , or common sense , or conscience , ) by the action of our own mind , to perceive what is just ; and we are prone to think that we decide the case by some rule of justice known to us before , when in fact we are making discovery of a truth previously unknown . In moral and in legal science , then , as well as in natural , the truth of Bacon 's remark must be admitted , that " our only hope is in genuine induction . " Fortunately for the bappiness of mankind , to which just laws are a necessity , it has been from the nature of things impossible for those who made the law to wander altogether from the right way . " We are of opinion , " says Bacon , " that , if men had at their command a proper history of nature and experience , and would apply themselves readily to it , and could bind themselves to two things , -1 . to lay aside received notions and opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - they might by the proper and genuine exertions of their minds , fall into our way of interpretation , without the aid of any art . For interpretation is the true and natural act of the mind , when all obstacles are removed . " The sagacity of this remark is illustrated by the // history of the law ; for the lawyers , by the regular course of their profession , have always been compelled to a familiarity with the pdrticulars from which their rules were to be deduced . Particular cases being held as precedents , the lawyers have always been compelled to resort to them as the original sources of the law ; and when they have fallen into the error of too hasty generalization , they have been compelled , by the necessity of again and again subjecting their notions to the test of experience , to correct them in a greater or less degree . Hence the lawyers have been necessarily more truly philosophic than the philosophers . For the latter , in this as in other sciences , have attempted to bind truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , as ileraclitus well said , in their own little worlds , and not in the great and common world . " But their theories , when founded upon the self-originated notions of their own minds , and not upon induction of particulars , could never be adopted in practice . Thus it happened that the law , though often twisted awry by the prejudices of the lawyers , has yet always enjoyed a free and vigorous growth , and has never been dwarfed by the false mei*hods of philosophical investigation , which prevailed before Bacon 's time , and which still continue in some departments of knowledge to mislead the energies and retard the progress of human thought . Thus the law , despite the prejudices and narrow notions of the lawyers , has been , by the necessarily familiar contact of their minds with the infinite particulars of human affairs , so far advanced as to afford some ground for the boast that " the law is the perfection of reason . " Therefore we unhesitatingly reject the opinion of those who regard the present system of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law as it is , and the science of law , which is the law as it should be , in the main agree , and that it is in the history of the development of the present system that we shall be best able to discover as well the true method of legal science as the sources of the errors which have crept into the law . As for the sources of error , there are some which are common to all sciences , and some ( which are of that kind called by Bacon " idols of the theatre " ) peculiar to the science of the law . Of the latter , the chief undoubtedly is that malign // agency exerted on the minds of the lawyers by the necessity of seeking in so many instances what has been decreed by man , rather than what is ordained by nature . Thought , as well as action , is influenced by habit ; and thus the lawyers have extended their reverence for authority to cases where pure reason should prevail . This defect is touched upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being bound and subject to the decrees of the laws prevailing in their several countries , have not their judgment free , but write as in fetters . " Thus errors are accumulated and perpetuated in the law . For by this method unjust precedents , instead of being confined to the cases to which a fair construction of their language renders them applicable , are made coextensive with the false reason upon which they are grounded . Thus , contrary to Bacon 's maxim , custom is made equally fruitful with reason . Hence our law ( confining the term to the civil , as distinguished from the criminal and constitutional or political law ) abounds in error and injustice to a much greater extent than the Roman Law ; for the latter has been cultivated by men uncorrupted by the practice of the law , and free to a great extent from professional prejudices and false notions , while the Common Law , much to its detriment , has hitherto fallen almost altogether into the hands of practising lawyers . Our only hope , then , for the perfecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophic , as opposed to the professional , method of treating the numberless particulars under its cognizance . To this end , it is much to be wished that philosophers should turn their attention more to law , and that lawyers , or at least those who assume the philosophic function of discovering and expounding the principles of the law , should turn their attention more to philosophy . When this is done , as we have before said , we may look to see the law approach indefinitely near to perfection ; and the absurd construction given by some courts to the maxim , " that every man is presumed to know the law , " instead of being an unjust and oppressive legal fiction , will be the simple truth . For when the law becomes identical with justice , all men will know the law , their Creator having given them the faculty of discriminating between the just and the unjust .
