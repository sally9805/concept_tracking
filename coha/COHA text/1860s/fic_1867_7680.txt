Wilde , Richard Henry , 1789-1847 : HESPERIA . End note 1 : 2Kb A POEM from Hesperia ( 1867 ) CANTO I. FLORIDA . The poet wishing to speak out a manifold world , uses the story of some personage as a thread on which he may string what he pleases . Even so are Gil Blas and the Odyssey constructed . Goethe . I. I pray thee , gentle sister , mock me not ! End note 2 : 1Kb Joy is a word unwonted to my ear Except from strangers .  --  I endure my lot , But there are sounds which the soul shrinks to hear From those that love us : if the canker spot Of grief do not upon my cheek appear , It is perhaps because , did they perceive Such spoiler 's trace , some kindred hearts would grieve . II . Perhaps I do not brook the worldling 's stare And pitying friendship 's well-disciplined eye , Which , soft , sad , self-approving , if it dare Would sympathize most superciliously ! Perhaps I fear some gossip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high , A name despair has consecrated long Deep in my heart , too sacred far for song . III . No matter where the pang , or why suppressed , I have my woes , like others . ... Let them lie Unseen within their prison-house , my breast ! All power to soothe or share them they defy : Meantime , not more than e'en thyself unblest I seem ,  --  and breathe the air , and mark the sky , My sole complaint a jest , a smile , or sneer At the heart 's ills that leave the eyes no tear . IV . And if I journey often to pursue That far-sought , found-not , meteor-blessing Peace , What mortal can the love of change subdue In an unquiet soul , whose deep disease On the whole earth finds nothing strange or new Save its own doom ? whose torments do not cease , And seeks forever , though it seeks in vain , One moment or one spot exempt from pain ? V. And if I leave my more than place of birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humble grief or rustic mirth , Went by ,  --  what matters it ? My life and lays May one day find  --  like the sequestered hearth I quit  --  obscurity their highest praise . Nor do I love it less because I roam , And , wheresoe'er I live , would die at home . VI . For here is matter that the eye and mind , Heart , fancy , memory , could brood upon , The deep pine forest waving in the wind , The rapids hoarsely murmuring as they run , The town within its zone of hills enshrined , The broad , bright river glittering in the sun ,  --  Such are the sights and sounds that might engage Man 's better thoughts in this lone hermitage ! VII . What could more beautiful or brighter seem , Were Florence and the Arno at our feet , Save the undying names and works that beam Their thousand recollections , fond and sweet , On Learning 's shrine ,  --  Art 's throne ,  --  the Poet 's theme ,  --  Immortal Beauty 's shrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that haunt thine earth and air , Fair Florence !  --  Italy 's unfading fair . VIII . And these are much and all ! End note 3 : 1Kb  --  what want we here Of Arqua but the Poet 's home and grave ? The woods are all as green , the skies as clear ; Nor is the sun less warm , less pure the wave : But wanting these , the memories that endear Spots haunted by the good or wise or brave , Stream , grove , cliff , fountain , cataract , and lake , Transient and slight emotions only wake ! IX . Sweet as Egeria 's , bore it but her name , We have full many a grotto-guarded spring : Streams not unworthy of Illyssus ' fame , Did classic recollections only fling Grace on their urns ,  --  mountains that well might claim Eagles and poets of as bold a wing As soared above Parnassus ,  --  vales that vie With Tempe , in the hues of earth and sky ! X. But the heart seeks , and has forever sought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human action , passion , thought , Nature , however beautiful , is void : ' T is from deep feeling Poetry is wrought ; Such is the spell her master minds employed . What wins for Arden 's wood one Briton 's tear , But pensive Jaques with his poor stricken deer ? XI . Could we our country 's scenery invest With history , or legendary lore , Give to each valley an immortal guest , Repeople with the past the desert shore , Pass out where Hampdens bled or Shakespeares rest , Exult o'er Memory 's exhaustless store , As our descendants centuries hence may do ,  --  We should  --  and then shall have  --  our poets too ! End note 5 : 1Kb XII . But now !  --  ' t is true in this our day and land All that is written perishes , alas !

XIII . We have not even found  --  and shall we find ?  --  One lay like his , that in the wizard 's glass Beheld his ladye-love ,  --  the gentle , kind , And knightly Surrey ,  --  he whose genius as The morning-star was herald-like assigned To the far-flashing glory whose bright mass With jealous splendor his mild beams outshone . Such usher of our dawn alas ! we ' ve none ! XIV . And shall no Phosphor ever light our sky , Predestined through long ages to endure ,  --  Gilding the wrecks of time to mortal eye With an immortal beauty bright and pure , Defying ruin ?  --  Doth Aurora sigh ? Or is all darkness ?  --  Are we blind past cure ? Or never must one lonely star-lit urn This " palpable obscure " to twilight turn ? XV . ' T is with no dreamer 's secret pride I ask This question , hoping that my rhymes reply : Such vain conceit would need a closer mask ; They have their value ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one who urged me to such task , And though my page should meet no other eye , Or dull oblivion shroud both verse and bard , Still in her wish fulfilled is his reward . XVI . And if he grieve because his words , his name , The breath of after ages will not stir , ' T is but because he would impart his fame , And share an immortality with her : So might there from the brightest , holiest flame That e'er did martyrdom of heart confer , Two shadowy , forms , of Truth and Friendship , rise , To seek their home together in the skies ! XVII . And thou , sweet Iole ! my earliest friend , Of all beloved the loveliest and most true , My heart , that breaks , yet knows not how to bend , Trembles a moment as I think of you ! What teeming thoughts of fond devotion blend As all thy charms arise to Fancy 's view , Thou sweet , calm , cold Madonna , all divine , The Virgin of St. Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must not , dare not say farewell ! Yet bear thine image with me in my breast . Affection 's talisman ,  --  a sacred spell And precious relic of the saintly blest , Within my heart it shall forever dwell , If aught so holy in such fane may rest , By fond Idolatry , and deep Despair , And Love , and Sorrow , consecrated there ! XIX . Mary , farewell ! it is a pang to part With thee I had not thought to feel again : Ours is a strange companionship of heart Dissevered love ,  --  community of pain : I am but as thy brother , and thou art But my soul 's sister ; pure and free from stain Is our adoption , solemnized with tears , Pledges of blighted hopes and hearts and years ! XX . But I must leave thee too !  --  Farewell ! farewell ! A restless spirit doth possess my mind , And here at home it may no longer dwell , Though what it seeks abroad it can not find . Could I climb mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride the wind , ' T were all the same :  --  while life and memory last The present is  --  and can be  --  but the past ! XXI . Now with my thoughts I am alone once more , And free to take , according to my mood , My way to cloud-capt peak , or surf-worn shore , Through cane-brake , barren , prairie , swamp , or wood . And if I choose scenes I have trod before , It is but to repeople solitude With beings of my fancy or my heart , Creating for myself a life apart . XXII . British America ! the yoke is broken Wherewith thy neck a tyrant step-dame wrung ; But yet throughout thy borders still is spoken That language of the heart , our mother tongue . End note 7 : 1Kb Spite of her wrongs , our love no other token Asks , than the English in which Milton sung , And Sidney wrote : so long as this remains , Even as our sires we are  --  except their chains !

XXIV . Hail to thee , Florida ! bright fairy-land ! End note 8 : 1Kb Here shall my wandering verse its course begin : Beauty hath left her footsteps on thy strand ; Lake , fountain , gulf , and forest well might win Our praise and wonder . Nature 's lavish hand Hath half redeemed thee from the curse of sin , And in thy lap with such profusion showers Her gifts , that men have called thee " land of flowers . " XXV . Escambia ! in thy wood-embosomed bay , End note 9 : 2Kb Whose crystal waters scarcely ebb and flow , Yet doth thy sunny foam-plumed billows play With sands all dazzling as the driven snow ? Still with the sea-breeze sports the glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteors so ? And thy caques by moonlight glide along , Timing their oars to some old Spanish song ? XXVI . The lovely Santa Rosa , doth she bare Her snowy bosom to the burning sun ,  --  The bay her bath and mirror , and the air Enriched by odors from her kisses won ? Still through the tangles of her fragrant hair , Doth Zephyr his enamored fingers run ? Or her olian lyre as wildly sweep , In concert with the murmurs of the deep ? End note 10 : 1Kb XXVII . And old Barrancas , greets he with a frown The rule of heretics renewed again ? How on their forts and navies looks he down ,  --  With long-remembered hate or high disdain ? How changed is all !  --  the port , the flag , the town ,  --  England , Columbia , Florida , and Spain ,  --  Men and the world ,  --  which now almost forget That boasted rule whereon the sun ne'er set !

XXIX . Thine is of human hope an ancient dream , Life-loving alchemy of desperate need ! Which , floating down Time 's dark and troubled stream , Catches convulsively each passing reed : Alas ! more sound Philosophy might deem The voyage all the better for its speed ; For who would linger upon earth alone , When all we prized , and loved , and blessed , had flown ? XXX . And if renewed or ever-during youth , With all youth 's passions , were the fatal gift , Lethe were far a better draught in sooth ; For consciousness the veil would ever lift Of love , grief , wrong , rage , pride , revenge , and ruth , Spectres of Sin and Death denied all shrift :  --  And if unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow , care , and fear !

Mark where poor Ortiz long was doomed to pine End note 13 : 1Kb In bitter bondage , amid savage foes , Dropping desponding tears in Tampa 's brine , And watching suns that rose and set , and rose , As if in mockery of his griefs , to shine , Careless or all unconscious of his woes ; Alas ! how keenly all of woman born Feel cold , unsympathizing Nature 's scorn ! XXXII . The new world hath its wonders , as the old , End note 14 : 1Kb Unlike indeed , yet not inferior . Such Are those vast swamps , in whose prolific mould Huge tangled forests flourish overmuch : Where Nature , wild , rank , ripe , luxuriant , bold , Reigns in her savage fastnesses , the touch Of Time and Man defying ,  --  rich and ripe Her various realms , and instinct all with life ! XXXIII . Here the enormous cypresses outspread Their buttressed stem , with many a cone-shaped knee , And vines , like sylvan boas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the great flowering magnolias shed The perfume that disdains all rivalry , With giant blossoms of most milky hue Scenting the earth and air and rain and dew ! XXXIV . Live oaks that number centuries are here , Their strong majestic arms outstretching far , As though they longed on mountain waves to bear , Through battle and through storm , the bolts of war ; Pines that o'er all their lofty summits rear , Shaming a royal navy 's largest spar , And poplar , maple , elm , and gum and bay , Cumb'ring the ground , almost exclude the day . XXXV . Around the mighty of the forest press The innumerable crowd of humbler fame , Obsequious courtiers in their gala dress , Whom learned naturalists alone could name ; And the vile race whose poisonous caress Lends them the parasitic rank they claim , Lichens and vines , and all the creeping things That throng the dew-decked courts of leafy kings .

XXXVII . And struggling here full often will be found The noble tree within the treacherous clasp Of the destroyer , whose fell strength has bound His careless victim in a deadly grasp . Fold upon fold the spiral snare is wound , As round Laocon and his sons the asp , Till the tormentor 's sinuous coil is sunk Deep in his tortured captive 's dying trunk . XXXVIII . To these recesses that exclude the sun , The panther and his prey alike repair ; Hither in herds wild deer and cattle run , And oft resort the catamount and bear ; Here wolves and foxes their pursuers shun , And alligators claim an equal share With tortoise , lizard , scorpion , snake , and frog , Of every depth in this Serbonian bog . XXXIX . The squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every hickory spray , And woodpeckers by hundreds tap and pierce Each withered tree and branch in search of prey ; Hither on swift and painted pinion veers Nonpareil , Parrot , Cardinal , and Jay , All but the Mocking-bird ,  --  he seldom quits Man 's haunts , like other jesters , mimes , and wits . End note 15 : 3Kb XL . Hither wild bee and wasp and hornet his , And wandering Psyches upon purple wing , The lightning-bug and spark-emitting fly , Mosquito , gnat , and all that buzz and sting ; And the ephemera , who live , love , die , One day their summer , winter , autumn , spring ,  --  Beetles , aurelias , spiders , grubs , and worms , Ants , and the insect tribe in all its forms .

This was the path Narvaz and Soto trod , Wasting a peaceful land with sword and flame : They too would govern empires with a nod , Jealous of Cortez ' and Pizarro 's fame , Each worthy to be called the " Scourge of God , "  --  In fortune different , though in heart the same . But Fame her smile to guilt for once denied , And in obscure inglorious strife they died ! XLVI .
