PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . FABLES OF BJDPAL THE Fables of Bidpai , or Kalila WaDimna , as they are more commonly named from the principal piece in the Arabic version , are of great antiquity , and have ever been very famous in the East . This appears from the number of versions that have been made in the Oriental tongues . Their origin was undoubtedly Indian ; the most remote appearance that can be traced being in an ancient Brahmanic book entitled Pantehet-tantra . The first translation was into the old Pehlvi language , of which there is a full account given in one of the Arabic Introductions . The book had become very famous for its wisdom , and for the ingenuity and elegance o* its composition . On this account Nouschirewan , sovereign of Persia , was very desirous of obtaining a copy . This , however , was very difficult , as the book was jealously guarded by the Indian monarch , and great pains taken to prevent any copy or translation of it from being carried out of the country . A secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who went to India in disguise , became familiar with its learned men , obtained the confidence of one of them , and finally , by surreptitious means , succeeded in accomplishing his object . On his return to Persia , the only recompense he would receive was the king 's promise that a special memoir of his mission should be written , and forever attached to the book . The Arabic version , in one of the introductions to which this memoir is found , was the work of Abdallah ben ' Al mokaffa , a man of Persian descent , but who became a Mohammedan in the time of the first Khalifs of the House of Abbas , Safiah and Mansour . Besides these , there were translations into the Syriac , and one into the later or Talmudic Hebrew made by Rabbi Joel . A Greek version was made at Constantinople by the Byzantine writer Simeon Seth , or Simeon son of Seth , who lived under the emperors Nicephorus Botaniates and Alexis Comnenus , about the year 1080 . This was made from the Arabic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in determining various readings , and , sometimes , in fixing the meaning of corrupt and difficult passages . The first printed edition , under the added title of Specimen Sapientics Indorum , was by Sebastian Godofr . Stark , Berolini , 1697 , with a Latin translation ; another has lately been printed at Athens , date , 1851 . From this Greek version , and the Arabic before mentioned , there have been made entire or partial translations into French and German , but none , to the writer 's knowledge , have appeared in English . The Arabic version , as published by De Sacy , de l'imprimerie royale , Paris , 1816 , is a beautiful specimen of typography , and has an introduction giving all the information that could be procured respecting this curious and most ancient production . In one of the Arabic introductions , ascribed to Bahnoud ben Sahwan , there is given the traditional account of its first Indian origin in the reign of Dabschelim , who obtained the throne after the departure of Alexander the Great . He was a monster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel , until the dangerous office was assumed by a Brahmanic philosopher named Bidpai . He succeeded in gaining audience of the king , and in interesting him in these ingenious fables , wherein political and moral truths are presented in the language and actions of animals . Dabschelim admires their theoretical wisdom , and , finally , becoming a practical convert , reigns virtuously and gloriously under the philosopher 's guidance . Each piece commences as a conversation between the king and Bidpai-the // former asking an illustration of some virtue in which he wislies to be confirmed , or of some vice to which a ruler is especially exposed , and the other replying by the narration of some one of the stories of which the book is composed . The difference between this and all other collections of fables , ancient or modern , is very striking . There are the same leading animal characters , the lion , the eagle , the bear , &amp;c. , with the difference , that the jackal takes the place of the fox , and that there are introduced more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits , showing great acuteness and fixedness of zoMogical observation from the earliest times ; but instead of being brief apologues , with a single event , and one brief moral deduced , like the Greek fables of *sop , or the Arabian of Lokman , they are long , continued histories , involving a great variety of events , havh*g each their social or political aspects , forming a narration highly interesting in itself , exhibiting sometimes the most exquisite moral , and yet , with rare ingenuity , preserving the peculiar characteristics of each species . Thus , for example , in the principal story of king lion , and his friend the bull , who are set at variance by the unprincipled jackal , the lion is alarmed at hearing for the first time the bull 's deep bellow , so different . from his own hoarse roar ; he is not afraid , not he , but then there is something mysterious about it , and prudence is a virtue . And so again , the generous monarch resists the efforts of the crafty calumniator , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh . and the other grass-as taking away all ground of rivalry in their intercourse . Sometimes , indeed , the philosopher seems to forget himself ; the peculiar animal traits are lost sight of , and they are simply men talking , wisely or absurdly , in animal forms ; but in general the dramatic proprieties are well observed . This , we think , will be seen in the one which we venture here to translate . The actors are taken from the least powerful of the animal tribes ; and this is essential to the dramatic design , which is to show how the varied adaptation of different gifts , even of the smallest kind , builds up a secure society for the weak , inspiring mutual confidence , and giving mutual help , even against the most powerful foes . Granting them speech , and a measure of reason adapted to their state , every thing else is in accordance with their animal ways and instincts , whilst the whole presents a picture of quiet friendship , of charming constancy , of tender mutual regard , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom not to be despised . The pervading moral , Love is strength , is one that appears in the aphorisms and in the songs of Scripture . See Prov. xxx . 24-28 , Canticles viii . 7 . In this introductory notice , we would only farther advert to one feature pervading the collection , and furnishing internal evidence , not only of the antiquity , but of the wide influence of these fables in the East , as shown even in the modifications they have received . The various versions , although presenting substantially the same events , and , in great part , the same unbroken narration , do yet show differen9es arising from the peculiar coloring that religious ideas have assumed in different lands , and as they have passed through successive ages . Some pious animal , such as a devout jackal , a very virtuous lion , in one pJace a very pious cat , and in another a very hypocritical one who makes religion a cloak for her atrocities , is quite a favorite personification . This recluse character has , in the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is very quietistic , eats no flesh - in other words , shows the predominance of Brahmanic and Buddhist ideas . In the Persian ( ante-islamic ) it has more of the Magian look . In the Arabic , the pious fox , &amp;e. , is an orthodox Mohammedan , a . Yaselc , or extraordinary devotee , who is ever attentive to the call of the Muezzin , says extra prayers , quotes the Koran , and makes extra pilgrimages to // Mecca . In the Greek version of Simeon Seth , on the other hand , he has become a decided monk or hermit ; to accommodate him ablutions are turned into penance , and sometimes the translator renders Arabic phrases by literal quotalions from the Scriptures . Not content with this , Simeon Seth sometimes makes all the animals talk Homerically , and parodies , in this way , entire hexameters from the Iliad or the Odyssey . In the story here given , however , there are no decidedly religious characters ; they are animals purely natural , unsophisticated , unindoctrinated , and presenting only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of diction , its beautiful simplicity of narration , and as having a convenient measure of extent between the longer and the shorter pieces . The translation from the Arabic is made as idiomatic and as colloquial as possible* whilst , at the same time , faithful to the spirit of the words as well as to the exact truth of the thought . It is entitled , BAB AIJIAMAMAT ALMOTAwWAKAT , that is , CHAPTER OF THE RING-DOVE . Said Dabseheim , the king , to Bidpai the philosopher : I have heard from you the story of the two friends , and how a liar made division between them , and alihow the matter ended ; now tell me , if you know any story of the kind , about true and constant friends , and how their friendship commenced , and how they mutually helped each other . Said the philosopher , The truly wise man will regard nothing as of equal account with friends ; for they are helpers in prosperity , and consolers in adversity ; and among the histories to this **26;83;TOOLONG , andthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was that ? said the king . They say , said Bidpai , that in the land of Sakawindajina there was a certain city by the name of Daher , and near that city a place abounding in game , to July , which huntsmen were constantly resorting . Now there was in this place a tree with numerous limbs , and thick covering leaves , and in this tree a raven had his nest . It happened then , one day , as the raven was settling into his nest , that , lo and behold , a huntsman made his appearance . A vile-looking fellow he was , and of most evil intent . On his shoulder he carried his net and in his hand a staff . As he drew nigh the tree , the raven was terribly frightened . Surely , said he , this man comes here for my destruction , or the destruction of my neighbors ; and so I will remain quietly in my place , until I see what he is about . Then the huntsman fixed his net , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself close by , he had to wait but a very short time , when , lo and behold , there passed by a dove called the ring-dove , and with her a great many other doves . As neither she nor her companions saw the net , they fell upon the grain , and began to pick it up , when suddenly the net closed and had them all as fast as a locked door . The huutsman was coming up with great joy , when all the doves began to struggle in the cords , each one seeking only his own freedom . Hold , said the ring-dove ; do not thus defeat your own effort , by being each one of you more concerned for himself than for his neighbor ; but let us all help , and all pull together upon the net , and we shall every one escape . Then they all pulled together , each one helping the other , and up they went into the air , net and alL The huntsman , however , did not despair of catching them ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dropping down . Now , says the raven , will I follow on and see what becomes of these fellows . Just then the ringdove turned short round , and saw the huntsman following . Here he comes , said she ; he is close after us . Now if we take the way of the open country , it will be impossible for us to escape his eye , and he will keep right on in pursuit ; but if we go the way of the fields and forests , he will lose sight PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . // of us and turn back . There is a certain place where lives a field-mouse , a very dear friend of mine , and if we can only reach it , he will gnaw the net for us . They followed the advice , and the huntsman turned back in despair ; but the raven followed on . When the ringdove found that they had come to the place of the field-mouse , she bid them settle down . Now the mouse had a great many holes as places of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by name-for his name was Zirak-he answered her from one of these holes . Who are you , and where do you come from ? I am your friend , said the ring-dove . Then the mouse came up very promptly . What brought you into this trouble ? said he . Do n't you know , said the dove , that nothing befalls one , whether of good or of evil , except by the decree of the Fates ? That is what brought us into this trouble ; for the is no escaping the Fates , either for great or small ; even the sun suffers eclipse , and the moon , too , when the Fates have so decreed for them . Then the mouse began to cut the knot which was near the ring-dove , when the latter cried out , Begin with the others , and after that come to me . This she had to repeat many times before the mouse paid any attention to it . Why , how is this , he said at last , that you seem to have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear lest , if you begin with me , you may become weary , and give up before doing it for the rest ; whilst I know very well that , should you be ever so tired , you would never leave me in the net . Ah , said the mouse , that is the very thing that makes me love you so . Then he went on with his work until he had finished it all , when out went the dove and all her companions with her . Now the raven had watched this proceeding of the mouse , and it produced in him a great desire for his friendship and further acquaintance . So he called , Mousy ! Mousy ! until out came the little head . What do you want ? said the mouse . Your friendship and acquaintance , said he . There can be none between us , replied the mouse ; for one who is wise should only seek that for which nature has made a way , and ever avoid the contrary . Now , you are a devourer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship between us . Not so , said the raven ; though the mouse is my meat , as you say , I could never have any satisfaction in eating you . Your friendship is *ll the more dear to me notwithstanding what you have said ; and when I thus seek it , you ought not to repel me . There is something so good and clever about you , that I can not help loving you ; you are so modest , too , and make so little show of your merits . But surely one who is wise should not seek to hide his excellency ; for virtue is like musk ; conceal it as you will , nothing can prevent the spread of its fragrant odor . Be that as it may , said the mouse , there is no stronger enmity than that of nature , and of this there are two kinds . One of them is the mutual , such as that which exists between the lion and the elephant ; for sometimes the lion kills the elephant , and sometimes the elephant kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as that which exists between me and the cat , or between me and thee ; for it never hurts you , whilst the pain and damage ever return to me . It is like water ; make it ever so hot , that does not prevent its qnenching the fire . He who has such an enemy , and rashly comes to terms with him , is like a man who carries a serpent in his sleeve ; and one who is wise will , of all things , avoid every am proach to familiarity with a shrewd and crafty foe . I understand you , said the raven ; yet such is the goodness of your disposition , that you ought to perceive the sincerity of my words , and not be hard upon me , or say that there can be no friendship between us ; for the wise seek not recompense for kindness , and friendship with the virtuous is quick to form , slow to break . It is like a golden pitcher , hard to fractures and easy to be repaired should it get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friendships of the bad are quick to break , // slow to form ; resembling in this the earthen pitcher , easy to crack with the slightest injury , and then past all mending . The noble love the noble ; the vile love no one except in appearance , through desire of gain or fear of harm . But I have need of thy love and kindness , because thou art generous , and I stand at thy gate resolved to take no food until you receive me as a friend and brother . Said the field-mouse , I accept your brotherhood , for I can repel no one from his urgent need ; but I began this talk , as I did , that I might assure myself in acting prudently , and that you might never have it to say , should you do me harm , that you found the mouse quick to be deceived . Then he went out of his inner hole and stood by the entrance . What hinders you from coming clear out ? said the raven ; and why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt i*maining , after all ? There are two things , said the mouse , in respect to which the people of the world mutually give and take , and hold friendly intercourse . These are the soul and the hand . Some give to each other of their souls ; these are the real hearty friends , pure and true . Those who give of the hand only , they are , indeed , helpers to each other , yet do they desire , each one , their own profit . Now he who acts on these worldly principles of gain , is like the huntsman who spreads grain for the birds , with no desire for any good of the birds , but all for his own . But the giving of the soul goes far beyond the giving of the hand , and that is what I have ventured to do to thee ; I have given to thee my very soul-my life . Nothing now prevents my going wholly out , but one thought that occurs to me . You know very well that you have companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without your thought and purpose ; I am afraid of them . But , said the raven , surely it is a sign of friendship that one should be a friend to his friend 's friend , and a foe to his friend 's foe ; and there is no friend of mine , I am certain , who will not love you . Should there be such a one , I could very easily cut his acquaintance . Then went forth the field-mouse to the raven , and they gave each other the hand , and pledged a pure friendship . They became , too , very familiar with each other , and after some time had passed , says the raven to the mouse , You live too near the roadside , and I am afraid that some of the boys may hit you with stones ; but if you will go with me , I know of a very retired place , where lives one of the tortoise family , a very good friend of mine , who feeds on fish , and where we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . Suppose that I take you *llong , that we may live there in all security . There is one thing I have not mentioned , says the mouse ; I know a good many curious stories that you will be delighted to hear when we get to that quiet place ; so take me along , and I will do whatever you may wish . Then the raven took up the field-mouse by the tail , and flew with him until they reached the spot . When they came to the spring where the tortoise lived , she looked out from the water , and behold ! the raven carrying the mouse by the tail . Not seeing , at first , that it was her friend , she was greatly frightened at so strange a sight . Then the raven called to her ; upon which she went out , and asked him , What is the matter , and where do you come from ? So he told her the whole story-how he had followed the doves , and the matter of the field-mouse , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the tortoise had heard the whole affair , she greatly admired the good sense and integrity of the raven 's little friend , and after she had courteously saluted him , began to ask him many questions about his coming there . Now , says the raven to the mouse , since we are in this quiet place , it is a good time to tell us some of those stories you spoke og besides answering the questions the tortoise has put to you concerning the events of your life ; for she stands to you the same as I. Then the mouse began as follows : One of the first things in my experience was // my living in the house of a very pious man who led a recluse life , with no family or servants about him , and who had every day given to him a basket of provisions . Of this he would eat what he wanted , and hang up the remainder . I used to watch the recluse until he went out , when I would leap up to the basket , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , except what I threw down to the other mice who had gathered round . Many a time did the hermit do his best to hang the basket out of my reach , but never succeeded , until once upon a time a travelling guest asked lodging for the night , when they two sat down and ate their supper together . After that they began to converse ; when the hermit asked his guest from what part of the world he came , and where are you going now , and so on . The man had passed through distant regions , and seen many curious things , and *while he was telling them , the hermit suddenly clapped his hands to scare me away from the basket . What is that ? said the traveller . Are you making sport of me , after asking me to relate my adventures ? The hermit begged his pardon , and said it was that wicked mouse ; his audacity is astonishing ; I can leave nothing in the house but he eats it all up . Said the traveller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many of them , I think . True , replied the hermit , my hut is pretty well stocked with them ; but there is one in particular who beats me in every effort I make to catch him at his tricks . That puts me in mind , replied the traveller , of what the man said to the woman who sold good sifted sesame for that which was unsifted . And how was that ? said the hermit . Once upon a time , said the traveller , I lodged with a man in a certain place , and after we had supped , they spread a bed for me in a room adjoining that in which my host slept with his wife . There being but a thin partition of reeds between us , I heard the man say , just before daylight , that he thought of inviting a few friends to dinner . So make ready for them , said he to the woman . What business , replied she , have you to give such an invitation , when there is hardly enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , that you are one who never lays up any thing . Do n't trouble yourself about that , says the man ; we will just give them what we have . As for this laying up that you talk of , no good comes of it ; it is very apt to turn out as it did with the saving wolf . How was that ? said the wife . They say , replied the man , * that once upon a time a huntsman went out with his bow and arrows , and had not gone far before he shot a gazelle . He laid it upon his shoulders , and was carrying it home , when lo , a wild boar crossed his way . The huntsman sent an arrow that pierced the boar , but did not prevent his rushing upon him , and striking him with his tusks . The bow flew out of his hands and both fell dead together . As it happened , just at that time there came along a wolf . Aba ! says the grim creature , here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog , all together ; I shall have meat enough for a long time . It is best , however , to be saving ; so I will begin with this leather bow-string ; the gnawing of that will do for one meal . He was very busy with the string , when it suddenly snapped , and the horn of the bow springing back struck him a killing blow upon the throat . So he died , too ; and all this came from saving and laying up . I have told you the story that you may know that all such hoard- * These parentheses , or stories within stories , often occur , sometimes involved to the third or fourth power . They belong to the humor of this old composition ; but they become , occasionally , so complicated , that the reader is puzzled in determining their application . Sometimes they seem quite meZ Cl prepez , unless they may be regarded as designed to show that the wise animals can now and thensay things without purpose , or talk nonsense , as well as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact point in the mouse 's version of the traveller 's story about the sesame , though the meaning of the comical wolf-parenthesis is pretty clear . And so we may say of some parts of mousie 's moralizing in what follows . Very good in itself , but seeming to have little to do with the story , unless we may suppose it intended , by Ilifipal , as a quiet satire upon commonplace experiences , and prosy moral reflections upon them , belonging , as they do , to the earliest as well as to the latest times . // ing is apt to come to a bad end . Very well , said the wife , that may be all true what you say , and I will do my best ; there may be in the house enough rice and sesame to make a dinner for six or seven persons , and in the morning I will get it ready ; so invite whom you please . When the morning came , the wife took the sesame , and sifted it , and spread it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the birds and the dogs . It so happened , however , that , when she was very busy , the boy became careless , and lo , a dog came along and stuck his nose in the meal . This made it profane , and unfit for use . So she took it to the market , and bargained with it for other sesame that had never been sifted , measure for measure . That was the time-for I was standing in the market-when I heard one say : There is some secret about this woman 's proceedings , or she never would have sold sifted meal for unsifted . Now this is what I said to you before , resumed the ' traveller , in his talk with the hermit , and that is what I have to say about this jumping mouse . You may depeud upon it , there is some mystery about him , some secret cause that enables him to perform these feats of which you complain . Now , brisg me an axe , and I will make a search for his hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the hermit procured an axe , which the guest took , and began his search . It so happened that at that time , when I heard them say this , I was in my other hole . In the one that I usually occupied there had been lying a purse of a hundred dinars-how they came there I never knew  --  and so the guest kept on his hunt until he came upon the money . Aba I said he to the hermit , here is the secret of the mouse 's performances ; this is what gives him power to make such leaps ; he never could have done it if it had not been for the dinars ; for it is money , you must know , that gives strength , and increase of wisdom , and abi ! *ty of all sorts . Now you will see , after this1 if he shall be able to leap as he did before. * When morning came , all the other mice gathered round me , complaining of hunger , and calling me their only hope ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the usual place from which I was wont to leap at the basket ; but it was all over with me . I tried my best , once and again , but could never reach it . Thus my loss of power became evident to them , and I heard them saying , Let us abandon him , for we shall never more get our living through his means ; he is not the one we took him for ; he has become poor , and wants a provider like the rest of us . So they left me , and joined my enemies , and abused me every way , and told stories about me , and persecuted me , until I said to myself : Such is the way of the world ; brothers , helpers , friends , all fail when money fails . Thus I found that one who has no money becomes utterly destitute in all things . He is like the water which the winterrains leave stagnant in the waddies ; it runs into no stream , it flows to no place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth drinks it up . I found , too , that as one who has no friends has no people , and as one who has no child has no memorial , so he who has no money loses all reputation for wisdom ; he has no share in this world ; he is regarded as having but little to expect from the world to come ; for let him become poor , and friends and brothers all cut t his acquaintance . Like a tree that grows in the desert , plucked on every side , such is the condition of one who has become destitute , and stands in need of what is abundantly possessed by others . And * we see from this how old Is the inductive philosophy . This traveller was a true 3aconian ; cum hoc proptor hoc , orpest hoc prepter hoc , was his motto . The dinars were there all the time of the mouse 's jumping ; they were an invariable concomitant-a " co-cause , " or , at least , an " occasion , " - and there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they coincided . No other causation was visible ; these were the " hard facts ; " and so the traveller 's examination might be called a " crucial experiment ; " whilst the fact of the mouse 's ceasing to leap verified it beyond doubt . // I found that poverty is , in fact , the sum of all wretchedness , the cause to its victim of all hatred , a very pit of slander and ill report . I discovered , too , that when one is poor he becomes an object of suspicion to those who had before confided in him ; he is judged hardly by those who once thought well of him . If another commits an offence , he bears the blame . There is no quality praised in the rich that is not condemned in him . His courage is called foolhardiness . Is he generous ? he gets the name of a squanderer . Is he humane ? he is called weak . Is he grave ? they call him stupid . Death itself is better than the want which drives one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and for the nobleminded it were easier , and more agreeable , to thrust his hand into the mouth of the viper , and swallow down its deadly venom , than to ask alms of the miserly churl . But to return to my story . I sAy the guest take the dinars , and divide them with the hermit , who put his part in a purse , and laid it by his head . As it grew late , therefore , and the shadow of the night came over them , I had a strong desire to get hold of it , and carry it back to my hole ; for I thought that this would restore my strength , or , at least , bring back to me my friends . So I crept up to the hermit as he slept , and had got very near his head , when*sawthattheguestwas wide awake , with a stick in his hand , with which he struck me a cruel blow that quickly sent me back . After the pain had ceased , the strong desire to get the dinars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guest was still on the watch , and hit me another blow that made the blood come , and knocked me heels over head , until I fell fainting in my hole , with such torturing pain as made the very name of money so odious to me , that I have never since heard an allusion to it without thinking of those dinars-so much of distress and terror they caused me . Then I thought with myself again , and found that the wretchedness which abounds in the world comes mainly from greediVOL. n. -6 ness and inordinate desire , and that those who have it never cease from misery , and weariness , and painful labor ; so that they are inore easily induced to make the most distant and laborious journeys in search of wealth , than the liberal man is to stretch out his hand for money when it is offered to him . There is nothing like content . This , at last , I came to see ; and then I went from the house of the hermit , and dwelt in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so I was led into this new friendship between me and the raven , who told me of the loving intimacy that existed between him and thee , and invited me to go along with him to your place . This I was very willing to do , and I will be to thee a true brother , and gladly make my residence near to thine own . The field-mouse ceased speaking , when the tortoise replied with great kindness:1 have listened , said she , to your words , and to the very interesting story you have told us . There is only one*thing I wish to observe . Begging your pardon for saying it , there seems yet to linger in your mind something of a longing remembrance of the things you have renounced. * Know , then , that excellence of speech becomes perfect in excellence of act ; for the sick man who knows the remedy for his disease , receives no benefit from his knowledge unless he takes the medicine . It gives him neither rest nor ease . Now , therefore , put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad on account of the scantiness of your means t ( that is , think no more about the di nars ) ; for one who has true fortitude , and is held thereby in honorable esteem , even though he ha*ve not money , is like a lion who inspires awe even * The Arahie text here is so very defective and confused , that the version of the sentence , as given , is taken from the Greek of Simeon Seth . I The tortoise seems to intend here a very gentle rehuke to mousie for his long moralizing , intimating that he is like some other good people , who , though really converted , have still a little hankering after a world reno , mced ,  --  showing this even in their expressed contempt for it , and in their sentimental fondness for talking about its vanities. // when he is lying down ; whereas the rich man without manliness , and who is little thought of in the midst of his wealth , is like a cowardly dog which nobody cares for , though he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . And let it not grieve you your being in a foreign land ; for the wise man in exile is like the lion , who , let him go where he will , his strength goes with him . So think well of what you have done for yourself ; for if you do so , good will seek thee even as water seeks its descent . Success belongs to the diligent and the prudent ; but as for the slothful and the shiftless , no good goes with him , any more than with the young woman who marries an old and withered man . For there are five things , it is said , in which stability and truth are not to be expected . They are , the shadow of a summer cloud , the friendship of the wicked , the love of women , . the tale of a liar , and wealth rapidly grown . Wherefore the wise man will not be sad on account of the little that he possesses ; for his wealth is his understanding , and the treasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the day of judgment ) : of this , he trusts that he shall never be robbed , whilst he has no fear of being charged with any false account for what he hath not done . He is not the one to be neglectful of his latter end , knowing that death is ever unexpected , and hath no appointed time . You need not my admonition , since you are yourself so knowing ; but I thought to do you right , for you are our brother now , and all that we can teach or give is thine . When the raven had heard what the tortoise said to the mouse , and how kindly and elegantly she had replied to him , he was vastly delighted . You have made me very glad , said he ; you have conferred a great favor upon me ; * This " sending on of good deeds " before one is a peculiar Mohammedan and Koranic phrase ; and must , therefore , be regarded as an accommodation of something of the same general import in the Thdian or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Testament idea of " laying up treasure in heaven . " and may you ever have as much joy as you have given . For the good are ever watching over and helping the good . Especially is it the case that , when such a one stumbles , or falls into trouble , it is only one like him that gives him the hand ; as when the elephant sinks in the marsh , it is only another elephant that can draw him out . Now , whilst the raven was in the midst of this speech , there suddenly dashed in among them a gazelle , running very swiftly , and giving them all a terrible fright . Down sunk the tortoise in the water ; away scud the mouse to his hole ; up flew the raven and lighted on a tree . Then he soared high in the heavens , * that he might see if any one was in pursuit of the gazelle . Nothing , however , could he discover , and so he called to his friends , who thereupon came out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking eagerly to the water , Drink , said she , if you are thirsty , and be in no fear , for there is nothing here to cause you dread . Then the gazelle * This kind of language shows great antiuiuity . It is an Old Testament style of speech . We say , " birds of the air ; " the scriptural term is everywhere ( in the Hebrew ) , " birds of the heavens . " It came from the idea of birds actuallyflying up to the heavens , the abode of the celestial powers . Hence afterwards , when superstition obscured the pure old patriarchalism , the wide-spread idea of divination by birds , as having some kind of intercourse with the heavenly beings . Thus , in Greek , there is the same word for bird and ossess . We see it , too , in the Latin cus(cvis)picissm . This higher knowledge of the birds was supposed to be obtained by us in watching the direction of their flights , listening to their notes , or examining their vital parts in sacrifice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-seeing , prophetic bird . This has been supposed by some to have had some connection with Noah 's employment of him as a messenger from the ark . It was also the bird sent to feed Elijah . We need not attach much importance to thi* but , at all events , the keen sight of birds , in their great elevation , is used , in the Bible , to represent surpassing or superhuman knowledge . compare Job xxviii. 7 : " a path which no fowl knowoth , " and v. 21 : " it is hid from the birds of heaven . " The language is employed to denote great inscrutableness ; referring to that bidden or higher " wisdom " which this sublime chapter represents man as seeking in vain through all nature . compare , elso , Ecclesiastes x. 20 : " For a bird of / the air ( Heb. , bird of the heavens ) shall carry the voice , and that which hath wings shall toll the matter . " // FABLES OF BmPAI. drew nigh , and the tortoise saluted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whence came you to us ? I have been , said he , in the wide desert , where the riding huntsmen are ever chasing me from place to place . This day , in particular , I saw an old man coming along , who I was afraid might be one of them , and so I fled as usual . Do n't be frightened , said the tortoise ; for we never see any huntsmen here ; and we will give you our love , and a place to live in ; and here is water and pasture in plenty , if you can be content in our society . So the gazelle stayed with them , and there was a shady place where they all used to meet together , and had much good discourse , and told each other instructive stories . So they lived on , until at last , one day , the raven , and the mouse , and the tortoise , were together in the arisha , but the gazelle was missing . So they waited , and wait&amp;I , hour after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , and they began to be very much afraid lest some harm might have happened to him . At last the mouse and the tortoise said to the raven , Your eyes are sharp ; fly up , and see if there is any thing near to us . Then the raven soared very high in the heavens , looking keenly out , and , lo and behold ! the gazelle lay afar off entangled in the nets of the huntsman . Down he flew swiftly , and told them what had happened . Then said the tortoise and the raven to the mouse , Here is work for you ; we must despair , without your assistance , of giving any help to our brother . Come on , then , and aid him all in your power . The mouse started immediately with all speed , and when he came to the gazelle , Alas ! said he , how came you in so sad a case as this ? for you are one of the sharp-eyed , and should have looked out . Said the gazelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in this talk , the tortoise came crawling up , and the gazelle said , Alas ! what possessed you to come ? for if the huntsmaa gets here by the time the mouse has gnawed the nets , we must leave you to the foe ; for there are holes into which the mouse can run ; but as for thee , 0 my slow friend , there is no hurrying thee , nor even moving thee . It is on your account , therefore , that I especially fear the huntsman 's coming . Said the tortoise , There is no living away from one 's friends ; for when friend parts from friend , he is robbed of his heart , he is deprived of his joy , his eye is darkened . The tortoise was proceeding in this strain ; but before she had finished her words , the huntsman drew nigh , and this was just at the time when the mouse had finished the cutting of the net . Immediately the gazelle made off with himself , the raven went soaring up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holes of the desert . Nothing remained but the tortoise . She was creeping off ; when the huntsman came up and found his net cut to pieces . Looking round , right and left , he espied her moving slowly along , and immediately seized and bound her . In the meantime the raven , the mouse , and the gazelle , had made no delay in getting together as soon as possible , after they had seen the huntsman bind the tortoise . And their grief was very great , and the mouse began to talk wisely , and said : We can never know that we have passed through all trouble until we have been in the worst of it ; and he was very right , who said that one should never cease his efforts to keep out of difficulty ; for when he has once stumbled , he will keep on stumbling , though he were walking on the smooth and level plain . Oh , how I fear for the tortoise , that best of friends , whose friendship , instead of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noble friendship-stronger , indeed , than that of a parent to his child-a friendship that death alone can destroy . Alas , for this body of ours , * so loaded * The mouse 's philosophizing here suggests some of the questions of the early Greek schools about the continual flux of matter , and change of bodily forms- " fJees any thing stand ? " It has , however , still more of a Buddliistie look . Some of the terms used hy the Arabian translator show that he did not fully understand it . It is clearer in Sinseon Seth . I 1868. 83 // with miseries , ever coming and going , ever flowing away , where there is nothing that stays , or remains the same ; - like the rising and setting star , one ever following the other , no rest , but change forever ; or like the pain of wounds that are ever breaking out anew , so bleeds afresh the heart that is wounded by the loss of friends after it has enjoyed their society . Then the gazelle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as you ; but your talk , though indeed it is very eloquent , * will give no help to the tortoise ; for it is truly said that men are tried in adversity , children and kindred are tested by poverty , and brothers are proved by evil fortune . True , said the mouse , but I can do something more than talk ; I see a way to get us out of this trouble . It is this : let the gazelle go and fall down in view of the huntsman , as though he was wounded * and then let the rayen pounce down upon him as though intending to eat him ; whilst I will dart on , keeping near the huntsman , and watching him very closely ; it may be that he will throw his stick at him , and , for that purpose , lay down the tortoise , giving his whole attention to you , that he yet may get possession of the gazelle . When he comes near , then start up again , and run on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerness , and make him think that he will , be able to catch you ; so , leading him on farther and farther from ris , keeping one side of him , and just as near as you * This looks again as though the gazelle and the raven meant to be a little quizzical , on our very friendly , but rather overrighteous , mouse . We have specimens of such continual moralizing , without much rhyme or reason , in the discourses that pass between Don Quixote and Sancho Pauza . Indeed , all through , cervantes seems to presentit as a frait of the common Spanish discourse . They may have got it from the Arabians , wins manifest this tendency very strongly in their ethics , poetry , and legends . The original unabridged Arabian Nights tales are full of it . In a sublimcr form we see soi*ething of this rhapsodic Oriental sententiousness in the long speeches of Job 's friends . dare . During thi* time I will be gnawing the cords of the tortoise , with good hope of getting her loose before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what the mouse advised them . The huntsman went in pursuit , and the gazelle led him on until he had got very far away , while the mouse applied himself to the cutting of the cords , and the tortoise had time to get off to a safe hid.ing-place . When the huntsman came back , blowing and weary , and found the cords cut again , he fell to thinking over the matter , and all about the gazelle that he had been expecting to catch , and the curious conduct of the raven , until he began to think himself utterly muddled * in his understanding . He could not imagine how it was-his cords all gnawed to pieces , and no one in sight ; whilst the look of the place grew lonely and weird . Surely , said he , this must be the devil 's territory , a land of Jins and sorcery . So he went away without hunting any more . But the raven , and the gazelle , and the mouse , and the tortoise , all came together in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their good fortune . Then said Bidpai , the philosopher , unto Dabschelim , the king : See how these creatures here , even in their smallness and their weakness , were able to deliver themselves from the bands of destruction  --  and that , too , time aftpr time-because they had love in its purity and constancy , and were ever ready to help each other . And so MAN , on whom is bestowed reason and judgment , who is inspired to distinguish good and evil , and gifted with discernment and knowledge , - above all other beings , is designed for society , and fitted for friendship and mutual help . This , 0 King , is the story for which you asked  --  a picture of true friends , and of the happy life they led.
