txt Every newspaper supporting MCCLELLAN uniformly avoids any reference to his policy and plans , if elected . They are all as silent upon that subject as upon the plans and policy of the next Khan of Tartary . Their attention is entirely given to personal abuse of President Iancour , to croaking about the burdens and the bad prospects of the war , and to general laudations of the wonderful " Mac . " This whole mode of conducting the campaign is an insult to the practical sense of the people . Here we are , in the most momentous crisis that ever came upon a great nation . It must soon be determined whether the Republic is to remain entire , or be broken in twain . Its preservation is what all who are not engaged in rebellion profess to have at heart . How to secure this is the all-important question . The Union party meet this question with the utmost directness . Their principle is that the Union can be saved only by maintaining its organic law , and by putting down all violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the last rebel yields . This principle and policy are declared in the clearest terms in the platform of the party , and are recognized and labored for by every newspaper and speaker of the party , the wide land . through . Even its opponents do not pretend that it practices any equivocation on that essential point . The party of the Opposition shows no such distinctness of conviction . Indeed it seems to have no conviction whatever , except that extreme wing of which ALEXANDER LONG is an exponent , which believes that the independence of the " Confederacy " is an accomplished fact which ought at once to be recognized . The body of this party are against this , and profess a purpose to save the Union . Yet it is impossible to draw from them any specific and entire plan for accomplishing this . The nearest approach we have had to anything of the kind is in the Chicago platform , and that is miserably deficient . It proposes " a cessation of hostilities " for the purpose of an ultimate convention ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such convention , or that they would abide by the conclusions of a convention , even if one were held . In the lack of any such guaranty , the scheme of saving the Union in this way , amounts to nothing . The rebel chief , the rebel Congress , and every responsible spokesman for the rebellion , have , over and over again , declared that they will accept nothing short of absolute independence . The Chicago Convention , in professing to present a practical policy to the country , was bound to exhibit some evidence that the rebel mind had changed , and would now consent , on certain conditions , to return to allegiance ; or if it could give no such evidence , and reckoned only on a possibility , it was at least bound to state what it was prepared to do in case that possibility should not be realized . If the " cessation of hostilities " on our part should , as is generally believed in the North , only result in strengthening the rebel confidence of final success , and induce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the subsequent policy of the Government ? A policy of letting the Confederate States go , or of again resorting to force ? It would devolve upon their nominees , if elected , to adopt one of these two courses , in case all negotiations failed . The people have a right to know before voting , which of these alternatives he would follow . They have a right to know it because it directly involves the vital issue  --  union or disunion . But that platform carefully reserves it from the people . Its peace plank is laid upon an assumption which would never be realized ? an assumption which would soon vanish into thin air . What does the party intend to put in the place of it  --  a recognition of Confederate independence , or renewed war ? On this vital point it is as silent as the grave . It is true that McCLELLAN , in his letter of acceptance , talks of " ulterior responsibilities " in case peaceable measures for restoring the Union fail . But such vagueness of phrase , at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insult to earnest men . If a renewal of the war was meant , why was it not distinctly said ? It would have cost no more words , and it would have had the ' advantage of expressing a definite idea , and a distinct purpose . " A cessation of hostilities , " with a determination to renew them in case a reasonable settlement on Union ground can not be effected , is one policy . " A cessation of hostilities , " with a purpose not to renew them in any event whatever , is a very different policy . The framer of the Chicago platform , Mr. VALLANDIGHAN , it is known , is for the latter . ilow is it with the candidate on that platform ? That question remains unanswered . The progress of the canvass does nothing to settle that practical point . Gen. McCLauda , r , with an utter lack of soldierly manliness , means that the people shall not know . All the leaders of the party are alike bent on keeping back the truth . Precisely the same craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no utterance of any kind  --  not even the vaguest . It is amazing that men in their senses should delude themselves into a belief that such a mode of managing this great canvass is likely to prevail . This tremendous conflict . of a gravity beyond anything in modern history , deterraininu destinies beyond all human power to measure , the maintenance of which has cost untold blood and treasure , is brought down to the scale of a contemptible confidence game between sharpers and dupes . It is imagined that the paltry arts of paltry politicians can blind the people to the issues involved , and the duties imposed . There could be no grosser infatuation . The people have every feeling and faculty thoroughly aroused ; and with an absolute clearness of vision they will follow a war policy , and nothing but a war policy , until the last remnant of the rebellion disappears before it . The little dodgers , who are seeking to decoy them aside , will meet the fate of all the insects of the season in the frosts of November .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
