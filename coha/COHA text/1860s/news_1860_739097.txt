txt The English people are much engrossed in discussing the effect which the new French treaty and Mr. GLADSTONE 'S budget will have on English manufactures and commerce . The former reduces the duties on a long list of British manufactured goods . These duties have hitherto been so high as to amount almost to prohibition , and this reduction will naturally stimulate powerfully commerce in the class of articles specified . As an offset to this , England reduces the duties on wine and brandy , &c.,; and various speculations are offered upon the effect that will be produced by allowing French light wines to invade the domains of port and sherry and good . old English ale . These things , of course , are treated financially , for their value is estimated in pounds , shillings and pence . But there is one little item in Mr. GLADSTONE 'S budget , viz. : the abolition of duty on paper , the effect of which neither he nor any other English statesman can estimate in figures , and yet doubtless will be more widespread and lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to the manufacturer is clear and appreciable , but its influence goes beyond the product of the mill ? it reaches the product of the brain . It is a tax taken from thought , knowledge , information . It is not merely cheap paper that England is to have , but cheap books , cheap literature , cheap periodicals , and , more than all , cheap newspapers . This general diffusion of knowledge is not an item to be defined by statistics , for its effects are felt in every department of life , and in the end reach the Government itself . However men may differ on the . question whether a literature cheap in price will not soon become cheap in character also , there can be but or.e opinion as to the influence and power which a diffusion of knowledge among all classes will exert . The effect of the abolition of duty on paper will , doubtless , be more immediately seen in the . expansion of the cheap newspaper press throughout the country . Newspapers now are sold remarkably low , considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere material ; but it must be remethbered that an English paper , 113 iShed at a penny ( two cents , ) reaches only about the same class that our dailies would if they were all four cents . The price of labor , the expense of living , and , consequently , economical habits , make the expenditure of twelve cents a week there equivalent to twenty-four cents here by the same class . The wants of the people of England , therefore , require the establishment of one cent papers . Their success or influence here furnishes no criterion for the English . Among them there will be a great demand for papers of this price , and the abolition of duty on paper will make a supply practicable . Nor is this all  --  good papers will not only be vastly multiplied , but those already in successful existence will be compelled to make great improvements to keep down competition . The duty OD paper is now three halfpennies per pound , which , on a daily paper which consumes five hundred thousand pounds a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily used , amounts to upwards of $15,000 per annum . It does not require a very vivid imagination to conceive that the removal of this heavy pressure on newspaper enterprise would have a wonderful effect in stimulating it to greater activity . We have been called a newspaperreading people . The English now bid fair to become our rivals in this respect also . Here , where transmission is so rapid and cheap , the Press overlays the country ' Like a great system of nerves , the chief centre of which is the centre of trade and commerce . Hence the influence it exerts is felt in every part at almost the same moment . Let its power be the same in England , and in time it will work changes that Mr. GLADSTONE little dreams of at present . The repeal of the window-tax was hailed with general joy by the working people of England , as it well might be . " No more tax on light ! " they exclaimed . But the abolition of duty on paper will open other windows than those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect  --  and shed a more cheerful light over the floor of the laboring man than that even which the bright sun now diffuses.
