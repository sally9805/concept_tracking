WILLIAM W. PATTON . Cincinnati : American Reform Book and Tract Soci ety . Depository , No. 28 West Fourth street . THESE are able and timely discussions of the ever-present and overshadowing topic of slavery , in its moral and religions features and bearings . Each occupies a distinct and important department of the subject . They are all well worthy of being presented in their leading features , and of being commended to our readers . The work of Dr. Thompson comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether the Bible sanctions , or teaches the rightfulness of slavery . We say whether the Bible sanctions slavery : for though his pamphlet is entitled " Teachings of the New Testament on Slavery , " it presents the teachings of the Old Testament as well as of the New . This discussion was , of necessity , brief , being presented in a single discourse , or a pamphlet of fifty-two pages ; but it is the ablest  --  the clearest and most satisfactory-within the same compass , which we have read . // Beginning with the remark , that the New Testament recognizes the existence of slavery as a fact , by various allusions to it , and by instructions given to both masters and slaves , especially in the letters of Paul , Dr. Thompson inquires : Does , then , Christianity acknowledge the propriety of slavery , or in any wise give to it its sanction ? Is it recognized in the New Testament as a rightful institution , whose abuses , only , call for condemnation , in the same way that an abuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without invalidating the institution of marriage ? Is the essence of the relation of master and slave the same with that of husband and wife , and of parent and child ? And are the abuses of that relation to be treated as only on a level with abuses of the tenderest relations of life ? In answer to these questions , he proposes to show : " 1 . That in the Apostolic age , slavery existed purely as a creature of the Porn law . 2 . That in defining the duties of the respective parties in that relation , the Apostles nowhere acknowledge the rightfulness of slavery under the law of God . 3 . That by placing the parties in that relation under the higher law of Christian love and equality , the Apostles decreed the virtual abolition of slavery , and did in time abolish it wherever Christianity gained the ascendency in society or in the state . " The first of these positions Dr. Thompson sustains both negatively and positively . He shows that slavery is not a condition of society founded in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , and of parent and child , are founded " in the very nature of things , the distinction of the sexes with their correlative instincts and affections ; ' * and are essential to society in its natural or normal condition . Not so with slavery . It is not only not essential to society in its normal condition , as is abundantly proved by the state of society where slavery does not exist , but is contrary to nature , set up by power , and then constituted by law , " contrary to natural right , " as is declared even by the code of Justinian , which teaches that " all men , by the law of nature , are born in freedorn . " Nor was slavery , existing as it did in the Apostolic age , instituted // by the command of God , or derived from his revealed word . This IDr . Thompson proves . And it is at this point that he brings in the teachings of the Old Testament . The fallacy of those who justify negro slavery on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evinces very clearly . The curse was of questionable authority , having been pronounced by Noah when he awoke from drunkenness . It was not a curse on Ham , whose oldest son , Cush , was the father of Nimrod , " the mightiest name of that dim antiquity , and the founder of the Assyrian empire ; " but upon Canaan , the youngest son of 11am , whose descendants were white men , dwelling not in Ethiopia , but in Palestine . And it was a curse fulfilled ( if it ever was fulfilled ) in the subjugation of the Canaauites by the Israelites about 1500 years before Christ . It was hardly worth while for Dr. Thompson to expose this oft-exposed fallacy , except for the purpose of illustrating the fatuity of those who defend slavery from the Bible . Domestic servitude among the patriarchs Dr. Thompson shows to be a totally different thing from modern chattelslavery-to be a condition in which servants were retained , not by force , or law , but by interest and affection , virtually a voluntary relation on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved and commended in the Bible , it would have been no warrant for the latter . He shows , also , that even if the patriarchs had practised chattelslavery , their example would not justify such slavery , any more than it does polygamy , inebriety , and equivocation . As to the Mosaic code , he shows that its " statutes respecting the relation of master and slave are obviously modifications and amendments of a previously existing common-law , and are designed to meliorate the condition of the slave , to protect him from oppression , and to promote the gradual disuse and abolition of slavery . " Such statutes of course imply that slavery is an evil and wrongful condition , even such slavery as that which existed under those statutes ; which was a very different thing from American slavery , as it is defined by law , and can never be intelligently and honestly adduced as an example for it . // Moreover , if it had been the same , its toleration by the Mosaic code would not have been a divine warrant or approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct as polygamy , and divorce at the will of the husband . Dr. Thompson admits that the Israelites were allowed to hold bondmen from among the heathen with somewhat more of rigor than they could hold Hebrew servants , ( who were almost all to be set free every seventh year , and all without exception every fiftieth year ; ) but this , he adds , like the conquest and subjugation of Canaan , was part of the special judgment decreed by Jehovah against idolaters , and inflicted through Israel as his chosen people , and is no more a perpetual divine warrant for chattel-slavery than the command given to Joshua to exterminate the Canaanites is a divine warrant for the Puritans and their descendants to exterminate the aborigines from this continent . As to later Jewish legislation , Dr. Thompson shows that the traditionary laws of the Hebrews , carrying out the spirit of the Mosaic code , tended to ameliorate the condition of boudmen , and finally to abolish all involuntary servitude , except for crime . We will here yield to an impulse which moves us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work before us , for the purpose of a little plain discourse with those who claim that the Mosaic code affords a divine warrant for slavery . To these men we say , lYe will hold you to your doctrine . Waiving for the present the difference in the moral standards of that age and this ,  --  a difference indicated by the imprisonment in the Penitentiary of polygamists now , and the toleration of them then in the high places of society ,  --  we will hold you to your doctrine , and say , make the slavery which you practise , or defend , like the pattern by which you justify it . The pattern can justify only a like thing . Let American slavery be constituted and administered according to the provisions of the Mosaic code . 1 . According to the Mosaic law , slaves could not be sold . Lev . xxv , 12 . The law is positive in regard to the Hebrew servant , and the principle of the law would apply to all others . // " There is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " no arrangement in the law of Moses by which servants were to be taken in payment of their master 's debts , by which they were to be given as pledges , or by which they were to be given away as presents . There are no instances occnrring in the Jewish history , in which any of these things were done . " There is not the slightest evidence that any Hebrew ever sold a slave and any provision contemplating that was unknown to the constitution of the commonwealth . " Apply this rule to American slavery , and you will take away one of its essential features , and that a most cruel and odious one . No husband could be torn from his wife , nor could children be torn from their parents , by sale , or by execution for debt . Nor is this all . You would strike a blow almost fatal to the system itself . How long would slavery last in Virginia , where its chief profit results from the slave-trade with the more southern markets , if fio slaves could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let no slaves be sold . And let no slavery be justified *rhich allows of such sale : 2 . The Mosaic law makes kidnapping a capital crime , and by logical consequence condemns all purchasers of kidnapped persons . " He that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his h d , he shall surely be put to death . " Ex. xxi , 16 . Adhere to the " divine warrant " in this respect , and you will put an end at once to the schemes of Gov . Adams and others for re-opening the African slave trade ; and you will also condemn virtually the whole system of American slavery , which originated in kidnapping , and is maintained only by the law of force , which is the essential element of kidnapping . 3 . It was a law of Moses , that if a servant was maimed by his master , even by the loss of a tooth , lie should be set free . The application of this law to American slavery would free many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fugitive slaves which are given in the advertisements of southern newspapers . // 1857 . Slavery and the Bible . regret that we are obliged to believe that the practices of the slave States are such , that many would be freed by the application of this law , and their mulatto offspring with them . Then , when we should see the mournfully suggestive accounts of high prices paid for young women , we should have the consolation of believing that the result would be the freedom of themselves and their children . 5 . The Mosaic law secured to the servant an important portion of time for religions and moral improvement . The whole amount of these periods of time can not be ascertained with exactness ; but it has been estimated that it would be nearly one-half of the whole , or , more exactly , twenty-three years out of fifty . During these periods of time , servants were supported by their masters , and had opportunities for receiving the same kind of instruction and enjoying the same *eligi3us privileges as other members of the copiimunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strike from the *tatnte books of the slave States ill those atrocious laws which appoinf severe penalties for any who teach slaves to read or write ; and you would also greatly ameliorate the condition of the slave as it respects labor , indeed would take so much time from the master as would come near to abolishing slavery by making it impoverishing to him . 6 . The Mosaic law forbade the restoration of a fugitive slave to his master . " Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee . lie shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place where he shall choose in one of thy gates , where it liketh him best ; thou shall not oppress him . " ( Dent . xxiii , 15 , 16 . ) The fact that this law stands in the Mosaic statutes unopposed or modified by any law requiring or authorizing the delivery of a fugitive slave to his master , gives it the aspect of universal application-an application which would make all slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the claim be allowed , as it probably should be , that this law directly applies only to servants escaping to the country of the Hebrews from surrounding heathen nations , the spirit of the law , applied to American slavery , would seriously modify it . It would cut up by the // roots the savage practice of recovering slaves by trained bloodhounds , and the whole business of professional slave-catchers , as inhuman as blood-hounds ; and indeed , denying by implication the right of a master to hold a slave who wishes to leave his service , it would wholly destroy , by its logical and legitimate effect , the system of involuntary servitude . 7 . The Mosaic law required that all Hebrew slaves should be freed every seventh year , or at the close of the sixth year of their service , unless the slave himself declared his preference to remain in his master 's service , which would be only voluntary servitude . Apply a like statute to American slavery , and you would soon destroy it utterly . For , it would free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who stand much in the same relation in which the Hebrew slave stood in distinction from slaves bought from foreign nations , especially if they are Christians spiritually or nominally ; ) and the introduction of slaves from Africa , the only other country whence any are obtained , would be forbidden by the statute against man-stealing , already referred to , as indeed it now is by the law of the United States and the laws of nations , which condemn it as piracy . 8 . Then , it was a statute of Moses , that once in fifty years all servants were to be declared free , whether they had served six years or not . " And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof . " Apply this to American slavery . It would not only sweep away all the iniquitous laws which obstruct and prevent emancipation ; but it would entirely remove slavery itself . For the better opinion is , that this statute applied to all servants held by the Hebrews ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all servants except those bought from foreign or heathen nations , of which class there are none in the United States , and can be none except by a crime against the laws of our country equivalent to piracy . Here , then , are some of the leading features of that servitude among the Hebrews , which you claim to be " a divine warrant " for American slavery . ti/onform American slavery then to your " divine warrant . " Stick to your pattern , or forever // hold your peace as to its authority-as to its vindication of the slavery which you practice or defend . Administer American slavery according to the principles of the Mosaic code . We bid you God speed in the experiment ; fully convinced that it will remove slavery from the laud quicker than any other mode which we can hope will be adopted . We revert now to our examination of the pamphlet before us . Dr. Thompsou shows that in the time of Christ and the Apostles , servitude did not exist , in any degree worthy to be spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have to do in the New Testament is Roman slavery . In the Gospels , which give the account of Christ 's history , " only three cases are mentioned of persons having servants who may be supposed to have been slaves ; and but one of these is at all positive ,  --  namely , the IRoman centurion , who held his servants by Roman law . " Christ , while he laid down principles which apply to every form of evil , made his teachings specific only with reference to evils that came under his immediate inspection . As his purpose was to labor among his own nation , he rarely addressed any specific instructions to the few IRomans in Judea ; and his silence with respect to the few instances of slavery among them no more proves , or indicates , his approbation of them , than his silence respecting cruel gladiatorial shows , and idolatrous rites , and the barbarities of war , proves his approbation of them . As to this Roman slavery , our author shows that it had its origin in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold instead of being put to death ; that it was based solely on the power of the many , or the strong , to oppress the few , or the weak ; that , in broad distinction from Hebrew servitude , in which the servant was a person under limited obligations and with guarded rights , it regarded the slave as a thing , a chattel , entirely at his master 's disposal , utterly without rights , liable to be sc*ourged , tortured , killed by his master at will , liable to be abused , maimed , tortured , slain by any one with impunity , except damages to the master . And as to their actual treatment , " Tacitus narrates an instance in which // four hundred slaves were put to death on the suspicion that one of them had murdered his master . " " The whip was always at hand . If a slave spoke or coughed without permission , he was flogged . If a maid committed the least blunder in the toilet of her mistress , her back must feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or furnished with prongs , the yoke , the brand , the pincers , the rack , were common modes of torture . There were torturers by profession , to whom masters sometimes sent their slaves for the refinements of cruelty . Cato , the moralist of Rome , was accustomed to exercise himself after supper by flogging such of his slaves as had not waited properly on the table . Worn-out slaves were turned out to die . Sometimes a slave was crucified , or burnt alive , at the caprice of his master . " " The question now arises , " says Dr. Thompson , " did Christ and the Apostles 8anction this system ? I might well leave it to your moral sense to answer that question . The Bible disciplines our moral sense to the intent that we may judge of right and wrong without the aid of , specific precepts . Apply that moral sense to the case before us . You see what was Roman slavery . Do you believe-can you believe-dare you so much as harbor the thought , that Christ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know better . Every man who has a conscience knows better . " But it is , nevertheless , said by the apologists of slavery , that they did sanction this system because they were silent respecting it . To this Dr. Thompson answers , first , that they were not wholly silent respecting it . Christ announced principles and precepts which condemn it . He was not silent respecting it , when he said he came to preach deliverence to the captives , to set at liberty them that are bound , to proclaim a jubilee from God ; nor when he denounced oppression of the poor , nor when he reasserted the unity of the race , and the equality of men before God ; nor when he reenacted the law of Sinai , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , and expounded it by the golden rule . James was not silent respecting it , when he spoke of the cries of the hire of laborers , kept back by fraud , and declared that they had entered into the ears of God . Nor // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law was for lThen-8tealer8 . But it is said that Christ and the Apostles were silent as to the abolition of slavery , and therefore sanctioned its continuance . To this iDr . Thompson gives an answer at length , which we are sorry to have to condense into a sentence . Not so , he replies . The argument destroys itself by proving too much . For , then their silence respecting the acknowledged enormities under the system of slavery , and respecting many organic laws and evils in the IRoman Empire , ( such as the murderous gladiatorial shows , and the horrible domestic tyranny under the Roman law , the complete slavery of the wife to the husband , and of the child to the father , so that4'the former could at will scourge , torture , exile , or kill the latter , ) proves that they sanctioned these ; which will not be allowed by any one for a moment . Then we should bear in mind that the Apostles , in their epistles , addressed persons living under the complete despotism of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and able to do almost nothing , legally , forthe removal of slavery . Moreover , these epistles were not tracts published to act upon society at large ; nor were they collected and generally circulated , as now , in a book ; but they were manuscript letters , which were sent to little companies composed generally of poor and uninfluential persons , to instruct them in their duties , and then , to a very limited extent , were copied by hand . These considerations seriously affect the argument that silence , respecting the abolition of slavery , gives assent to its continuance and rightfulness , and fully accounts for the omission in the epistles of many topics relating to society at large . As to the claim that the Apostles give an implied sanction to slavery by the instructions which they address to servants and masters , IDr . Thompson shows that precisely the opposite of this is true . For , in giving those instructions , they nowhere admit the rightfulness of slavery under the law of God , but often imply the contrary . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , rulers and subjects , the New Testament sets forth the divine authority of marriage , of the parental relation , and of civil government ; but , in giving instructions to masters and servants , it does not speak of slavery as existing by the authority of God , nor say one word to vindicate it , or to convey the idea that it is a desirable institution for master or slave . Servants are simply told how to conduct themselves in a relation established by law above their control . A very significant difference . Then , the around on which Christian slaves are instructed to obey their masters , is the same as that on which Christians were instructed to be peaceable and law-abiding citizens under the ( to them ) inevitable tyrannical reign of Nero-not the rightfulness of that tyrannical reign , or the rightfulness or desirableness of that slavery which robbed them of all their rights as men , but their obligation , in whatever condition , to honor Christ and his religion by meek submission to an unavoidable lot , " as the servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ; with good will doing serv ' *ce to the Lord , and not to men . " Moreover , the fact that Paul directs slaves , who are called into the kingdom of Christ , not to " care , " or fret , about their condition of servitude , if it is inevitable , but , if they have an opportunity to become free , to embrace it , to " use it rather * " the fact that Peter directs servants to be subject to their masters , not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward , and gives the reason that it " is thankworthy , if a man , for conscience ' sake toward God , endure grief , suffering wrongf ally , " and then sets forth , as an example for them in such a course , Christ suffering under the wicked and murderous conduct of Pilate and the Jews-these facts clearly indicate that those Apostles regarded slavery as an undesirable and wrongful condition . This argument , to show the fallacy and folly of the inference that slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were directed to obey their masters , is well conducted by our author . lie might have extended it , and made it still more forcible by reference to those precepts of Christ which enjoin meek and submuissive conduct towards the violent . Those who justify // slavery from the Bible , argue thus : The Apostle directs servants to be obedient to their masters . Therefore slavery is right ; the master is right in holding slaves in bondage . In the same style of logic , it might be said , Christ commands thus : " Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek , offer also the other . " Therefore this smiting on the one cheek was right ; aggressive and abusive violence is justifiable . " Him that taketh away thy cloak , forbid not to take thy coat also . " Therefore stealing cloaks , or taking them by a robber 's violence , is right . The one argument is as good as the other . The one shows the fatuity of the other . " The instructions to masters " leads Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Article . He adverts to the fallacy of supposing that because the result to be affected by Christianity was gradual and remote , therefore the principle tending to that result was left to a gradual development . That was laid down at the outset , as the supreme law for individuals , the moment they entered the kingdom of God  --  a law , which lifted them out of the pale of the Roman code in all their intercourse with one another . The rights of masters and servants were to be adjusted , not before the heathen , but before the saints ; not by the Roman slave-code , but by the law of Christ . **ONE is your master , even Christ , and ALL YE ARE BEETUREN . " " A new commandment I give to you , that ye love one another ; even as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . " Masters are commanded to render to their servants that which is just and equal . These words , enforced by a solemn reference to the judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no " respect of persons , " Dr. Thompson paraphrases thus , and declares them the death-blow of Roman chattel slavery . " Treat them as your equals in all the essential rights of men-as husbands , as fathers , as laborers worthy of their hire , as rational and immortal souls ; give to them EQUALITY . ' * * * Dr. Thompson introduces at this point the following note : Rev. Dr. lodge , of Princeton , whose learning and orthodoxy none will dispute , and whom none will accuse of " abolitionism , " thus comments on this passage in his recent work on Ephesians : // The result of this law of Christ was " the abolition of slavery , first in the Church , and by the Church throughout the Roman Empire . According to Keander , Christian masters looked upon their servants as no longer slaves , but as their beloved brethren . ' Church laws were made in favor of slaves . Even the sacred vessels of the Church were sold for their redemption ; and , in the reign of Constantine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the churches and on the Sabbath . Guizot testifies that the spirit and genius of Christianity abolished slavery throughout the world . ' The law of Christ is a law of emancipation . " " What , then , " our author asks , " is the application of this law to our circumstances and times ? " What is the duty of Christians toward the system of slavery in this country , which is not that of the patriarchs , or of the Jsraelities , but the Roman system of chattelism , originated in lawless violence and upheld by force and terror . This question is answered thus : " Those who live where the system exists , are bound to free themselves and their churches from all connection with the system of ehattelis*m and forced service . They may not be able at once to do away with the law of slavery in the state ; but they should practically abolish in the church the distiuc " Give to your servants that which is just and equal . That is , act towards them on the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men , as husbands , and as parents , should be regarded . And these rights are not to be determined by the civil law , but by the law of God . As the laws , ' says Calvin , gave great license to masters , many assumed that everything was lawful which the civil statute allowed ; and such was their severity that the Roman emperors were obliged to restrain their tyranny . But although no edicts of princes interposed in behalf of the slave , God concedes nothing to the master beyond what the law of love allows . ' Paul requires for slaves not only what is strictly just , but nW k6n7na . What is that ? Literally , it is equality . This is not only its signification , but its meaning . Slaves are to be treated by their masters on the principles of equality . Not that they are to be equal with their masters in authority or station , or circumstances ; but they are to be treated as having , as men , as husbands , and as parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a sin to deprive a slave of the just recompense for his labor , or to keep him in ignorance , or to take him from his wife or child , as it is to act thus towards a free man . This is the equality which the law of God demands , and on this principle the final judgment is to be administered . " // tion of bond and free , and give to the slave his equal rights as a man . " He refers to the resolve of the church , of which Dr. Samuel Hopkins was pastor , at Newport , iR . I. , when that place was a center of slavery and the slave-trade , and received its wealth mainly from that source ; viz , " That the slave-trade , and the slavery of the Africans , as it has taken place among us , is a gross violation of the righteonsness and benevolence which are so much inculcated in the Gospel ; and therefore we will not tolerate it in this Church . " That resolution was carried out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Southern churches practically come up to that standard , slavery will speedily cease . " * The discourse is concluded by inferring , and enforcing in eloquent terms , the duty of those , who live in that part of the country where the system of slavery does not exist , to do their utmost , in a legitimate way , to prevent its extension to soil now free . In concluding our review of this able discourse , we will advert , for a moment , to what we consider the strongest point of the pro-slavery argument from the New Testament . It is , that masters of slaves are addressed by the Apostles as Christians , believers , and are recognized by them as in good church-stand- * Our readers will be pleased to have before them an illustration of this point , which Dr. Thompson gives in a note : " Dr. Hopkins of Newport , being much engaged in urging the sinfulness of slavery , called one day at the house of Dr. Bellamy in Bethlem , Connecticut , and while there pressed upon him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was an acute and ingenious reasoner , defended slaveholding by a variety of arguments , to which Dr. Hopkins as ably replied . At length Dr. Hopkins proposed to Dr. Bellamy practical obedience to the golden rule . Will you give your slave his freedom if he desires it ? ' Dr. Bellamy replied that the slave was faithful , judicious , trusted with everything , and would not accept freedom if offered . Will you free him if he desires it ? ' repeated Dr. Hopkins . Yes , ' answered Dr. Bellamy , I wilL ' Call him , then . ' The man appeared . Have you a good , kind master ? ' asked Dr. Hopkins . Oh ! yes , very , very good . ' And are you happy ! ' Yes , Master , very happy . ' Would you be more happy , if you were free ? ' His face brightened ; Oh ! yes , Master , a great deal more happy . ' From this moment , ' said Dr. Bellamy , you are free . ' Go thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellamy , " Congregational Board. ) // ing , while masters . But the whole strength of the argument vanishes , when we consider the fact that there is not a particle of evidence that they held their servant8 to aforced servitud&amp;-that they were slave-holder8 , in the active sense of the word . The evidence is decidedly to the contrary . ( 1 , ) The enormity of slavery under the Roman law forbids the idea that the Apostles or any Christian persons , could approve of it- ( 2 , ) The Apostles , as Dr. Thompson shows , had ignored the Roman law of slavery , and had placed master and servant under the higher law of Christian love and equality , under which no master could take advantage of that savage Roman law , or of any means whatever , to hold a fellow man to forced bondage ; and the fair inference is , that these faithful and beloved converts and disciples had regarded their instructions . ( 3 , ) There is not the least intimation in the New Testament that any of these " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce service from their servants-not the least intimation that they ever employed officers of the Roman law , or blood hounds , or any force whatever , to retain a slave , or to recover a fugitive . Philemon , so far as we are informed , made no attempt to recover Onesimus . Paul found Onesimus , and sent him back free- " not now a cervant but a brother beloved . " The very strength , therefore , of the pro-slavery argument from the New Testament is weakness . It fails altogether . The service rendered to those " believing masters , " whom , by the way , the Apostle exhorted their servants not to despi8e ,  --  those " slaveholders in good and regular standing in the church , " of whom we have heard so much from pro-slavery divines ,  --  was undoubtedly a voluntary service under Christ 's law of equality and love . We pass now to our second topic , SLAvERY AND THE CHURCH . The transition is natural and logical from slavery and the Bible to slavery and the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practice , illustrate , and give triumph in the world to the principles of the Bible . We rejoice in a work on this subject , a fit sequel to his elaborate and able work on the Bible and Slavery , by Rev. Albert Barnes . For there is no name , // which on the whole is of greater authority on such a subject . His life-long and successful devotiou to the study aud exposition of the sacred Word , and his wisdom aud soundness as a scriptural theologian ; the feeling of gratitude and admiration feltfor him on account of the usefulness of his widely circulated commentaries ; the purity and excellence of his personal character ; his ability and fidelity as a preacher and pastor ; his modesty ; his meekness and firmness under the remarkable trials which he encountered as a prominent representative of a free and common-sense scriptural theology ; his candor ; his impartiality ; his freedom from the violence and passions of a partisan ; and his position as pastor of a large and influential congregation , in a city where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of out-spoken opposition to slavery , than in any city in the free States-give to his deliberate utterances on this topic an influence unequaled by that of any man in his branch , and unsurpassed by that of any man in any branch , of the church of Christ . It is a cheering sign of the times when a man of his modesty , worth and well-won authority feels constrained to speak on the great curse and peril of the nation ; saying in his introduction , " The present is eminently a time when the views of every man on the subject of slavery should be uttered in unambiguous tones . * * * There has never been a time * X * when so much guilt would be incurred by silence . It can not be right that any one who holds the system ( of slavery ) to be evil in its origin , evil in its bearing on the morals of men , evil in its relations to religion , evil in its influence on the master and on the slave-on the body and the soul-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , and in its relations to eternity , should so act that it shall be possible to misunderstand his opinions in relation to it ,  --  so act that his conduct could be appealed to as implying an apology for the system . * * * I write over my own name . It is not because I suppose that my name will have any special claim in influencing the public mind ; * * * but because I think it fair and manly that a man should be willing to attach his name to any sentiments which he holds , and which he chooses , for any reason , to submit to the consideration of mankind . // I have no wish also to deny that I desire that my name should be found associated with any well-directed effort to remove slavery from the earth . I believe that the religion which I profess is opposed in its whole spirit and tendency to slavery ; that its fair and legitimate application would remove the last remnant of it from the world ; and that in every effort which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system , or to promote universal emancipation , I am performing the appropriate duty of a Christian man , and of a minister of the gospel of Christ . " We can not serve the truth on this great question of the times , better than by giving such currency as our pages afford to a brief account of the positions and arguments of such a book from such a source . In his first chapter Mr. Barnes shows " the general relation of the church to slavery " by adducing and commenting on the following facts : ( 1 ) Not a few church members are slaveholders. ( 2 ) Not a few ministers of the gospel , and members of the churches , apologize for slavery or openly defend it , even as it exists in the United States , either practically by holding slaves , or by defending the system as one authorized by the Bible and sanctioned by the authority of God ; or by teaching and insisting that the system is not wrong in itself but only in its abuse , and is substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful relations of life , such as that of husband and wife , parent and child , guardian and ward , master and apprentice ; or by taking such a " conservative " position as to affiliate with the apologists for slavery ; or by so editing religious papers , or so writing religious books , as to aid its defenders . ( 3 ) Large portions of the church are in the midst of slavery . ( 4 ) The church necessarily has great power on all moral subjects . In his second chapter , he raises the question " what is the actual influence of the church at large in regard to slavery ? " and makes these points , ( 1 ) It is probable that slavery could not be sustained in this land , if it were not for the countenance , direct and indirect , of the churches . ( 2 ) The views entertained and expressed by Christian ministers and by others connected with the Christian Church do much to sustain slaveholders in // 1857 . Slavery and the Church . their views . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by the defenses of slavery in the church to promote infidelity . To his just and forcible remarks on this latter topic we shall refer in another part of this Article . But while admitting that the influence of the church on this subject is not , and has not been , what it might and should be , and that he can offer no apology for what a portion of the church has done , or failed to do , he endeavors to show , in his third chapter , that in the movements of some portions of the church , and in the general effect of Christianity on the system for eighteen hundred years , we may find much with which to meet the aspersions of the enemies of the church , and to justify the hope that its influence will be ultimately direct and decided in favor of the entire removal of all slavery . Here he makes the following points : ( 1 ) The spirit of the New Testament is against slavery , and its principles if fairly applied would abolish it . ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against slavery . ( 3 ) Efforts for emancipation have occurred usually in close connection with the Christian Church , and under the influence of Christian men . ( 4 ) The great body of Christians in this land and in all other lands are opposed to slavery . He then passes , in his fourth chapter , to consider more particularly the pdsition of the Presbyterian Church in this country with regard to the system . Here he examines , first , its position before the division in 1838 , regarding each of the parts as having inherited " the views , doctrines , influence and prestige of the whole . " He refers to the anti-slavery action of the Synod of New York and Philadelphia , before the General Assembly was constituted , in 1787 , and to the action of the General Assembly in 1818 . This latter action , which he considers as the platform of the Presbyterian Church , to which both its present divisions are fully committed , he particularly sets forth . He remarks respecting it , ( 1 ) That it was unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Church , and was quite in ac cordance with the prevalent sentiment of the time . ( 2 ) It was in advance of the action of any other Christian denomination in the land , except that of the Friends . ( 3 ) It contemplated the entire removal of slavery , and is such as would now // be charged with radical ABOLITIoNISM . He dwells especially upon the following paragraphs of the Assembly 's resolutions : " We regard the voluntary enslaving of one part of the human race by another as a gross violation of the most precious and sacred rights of human nature , as utterly inconsistent with the law of God , and as totally irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of the Gospel of Christ . " Again they say : " It is manifestly the duty of all Christians who enjoy the light of the present day , to use their honest , earnest , and unwearied endeavors AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE to efface this blot on our holy religion , and to obtain the COMPLETE ABOLITION of slavery throughout Christendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , again , they speak of their desire that all suitable exertion Should be made " TO EFFECT A TOTAL ABOLITION OF 5LAVERY. * ' So , again , they speak of " the duty indisputably incumbent on all Christians to labor for its COMPLETE EXTINCTION. * ' Of this language Mr. Barnes says , it " looks to the entire extinction of Slavery , " ( he might have added , as speedily as possible , ) " and the purpose expressed by the Assembly could not be carried out except by universal emancipation . The aim , the tendency , the object is abolitionism ; and the Assembly of 1818 was to all intents and purposes an abolition Assembly . " ( 4 ) According to these principles of the Assembly , the holding of slaves is presumptive evidence of a man 's not being in good standing in the Church . ( 5 ) It is clear from these resolutions that in the apprehension of that Assembly slaveholding may become a proper subject of discipline in the Church . Mr. Barnes then inquires particularly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New School ' or Constitutional ' Presbyterian Church on the subject of slavery . " He premises with regard to the Old School branch of the Presbyterian Church , that it is not his design to consider whether they have been true to the resolutions of 1818 . " How long ( he says ) those resolutions shall be suffered to lie unnoticed in their minutes ; * * * how long it may be proper for a large body of Christians to slumber over this stupendous evil , never even lifting a note of remonstrance or appeal on the subject , it is for them , subject to their responsibility to God , to decide . " But the position of the New // School branch of that Church , with which he is connected , he examines historically . He shows that the subject has been frequently and freely discussed in the Assembly . Beginning with the year after the division , 1839 , he shows that the subject was brought before the Assembly and discussed in that year , in the following year , 1840-in every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1843 , 1846 and 1849-then in 1850 , 1851 , 1853 , 1854 , 1855 and 1856 . He gives in full the papers adopted at these various times by the Assembly ; so that this chapter is quite valuable to those who wish to have access to these docunients , and to a historical view of the Asseinbly 's action . He shows that the Assembly has , at these meetings , repeatedly expressed its solemn conviction that the system of slavery , as it exists in the United States , is " intrinsically an unrighteous and oppressive system , opposed to the prescriptions of the law of God , to the spirit and precepts of the gospel , and to the best interests of humanity , " and has earnestly exhorted the churches to use all means in their power to put it away from them ; " that the holding of our fellow-men in the condition of slavery , except in those cases where it is unavoidable , by the laws of the State , the obligations of guardianship or the demands of humanity , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as used in the Book of Discipline , chap . 1 , sec. 3 , and should be treated in the same manner as other offenses ; " and then has referred the matter to the sessions and presbyteries , whose office it is to take action on offenses ; and , finally , desiring to reach the offense of slaveholding by actual discipline , the Assembly appointed a committee to report on its power in the matter , and their report , made at the last session , and adopted by the Assembly , indicated two methods in which any disciplinable offense , and slaveholding , of course , when it assumes that character , may be reached authoritatively by the Assembly . This historical examination Mr. Barnes conducts with an evident desire , indeed , to make out a good case for the church of his choice and love , yet with a good degree of thoroughness , fairness and impartiality . The only exception to this remark is in his omission to notice the fact that the Assembly , being // in session at the time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Missouri Compromise which excluded slavery from Kansas and Nebraska-that atrocious violation of plighted faith and of the principles of freedomrefnsed to adopt or even consider some very appropriate resolutions which were introduced , remonstrating against that act . That refusal , at such an exigency , has justly brought great discredit and reproach on the Assembly . And Mr. Barnes ' entire neglect to notice it is a serious omission , which , so far as it goes , detracts from the thoroughness and impartiality of his historical review . We regret the necessity of making this remark . On the whole , we think that Mr. Barnes has made out a good case for the New School Presbyterian Church . He regards its position " as a noble position . " So do we . And we express our earnest hope , that it will not now falter and fail in the work for which it has made preparation ; - that , having repeatedly declared slaveholding , with acknowledged , and ( as Mr. Barnes thinks and we think ) few exceptions , to be " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that there are two methods in which the Assembly can constitutionally reach it-having at length got ready the instrument of just and necessary discipline , it will go forward and use it , in a Christian spirit , yet firmly and thoroughly . If we regard Mr. Barnes ' declaration that this position has given that church " an elevation , in this respect , above all the other churches in this land , " as too sweeping to be true , we do not doubt his declaration that it has given that church " an elevation , in this respect , above ( very far above ) the branch of the Church from which ha* been separated ; " that " the subject has had a more full discussion in that church than in any other , " and that " the positions taken in that church have placed it , in this respect , in a condition that accords with the spirit of the age in regard to slavery , with all the noble sentiments that prevail in the world on the subject , and with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the added declaration , " I would not remain connected with a churchno , not for an hour , if I believe that it was contemplated that // slavery was to be a permanent institution in that church ; if it was held that the relation is on the same basis as that of husband and wife , parent and child , master and apprentice , guardian and ward ; if it was understood that the relation implied nothing against a man 's good and regular standing in the church ; and if the complete abolition of slavery throughout Christendom , and , if possible throughout the world , was not the aim contemplated and steadily pursued by all Christian and constitutional methods . " In the course of this chapter , while summing up the meaning of the successive steps taken by this church on this subject , Mr. Barnes makes some remarks on the question whether slavery is a 8in per *e , which are so good that we wish to present them to the eyes of our readers : " It is sometimes asked whether slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bin in itself ; and much learned dust is sometimes thrown in reference to this question , assisting much in the effort to mystify the subject and to escape from the charge of criminality . The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church has not attempted to discuss this abstract matter , as it has not in regard to the sin per se of horse-racing or lotteries ; and it might be possible to create as much mystery by discussing the question about the abstract nature of sin in reference to those subjects as in reference to slavery . The truth is , that , except for purpose of mystification ,  --  for the purpose of throwing dust in the eyes of another ,  --  for the purpose of escaping from responsibility in a fog ,  --  for the purpose of indulging in *in while the mind is diverted by an abstract question ,  --  and for the purpose of perplexing an adversary ,  --  we never start the question whether anything is a sin per se at all . When , however , a man desires to sell lottery tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is a sin per se to make this kind of appeal to chance ; when a man is hard pressed by arguments for temperance , and desires to indulge in wine as a beverage , or even in stronger drink , nothing is more convenient for his purpose than to start the question whether it is to be regarded as a sin per se to partake of fermented liquors or alcoholic drinks ; when a priest or a Levite would wish for any cause to pass by a wounded man , nothing can be more convenient than to start the inquiry whether this could be regarded as a sin per se . Few would be the clear moral decisions which men would make if they should pause at every step to settle this abstract question ; few are the questions of morals , however plain to common minds , which could not be mystified and made very doubtful if this point were to be settled before men should act . As a matter of plain , practical , every-day concern , it is not desirable to put any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and sound action in a community , it is not wise to open any of these matters to the endless logomachies which attend such abstract inquiries . // " Two things seem to be all that is needful to be said on the question whether slavery is to be regarded as a sin per se. " ( a ) One is , that , if it is meant that there may possibly be a case where the relation is not sinful , this may be 80 . This was expressly assumed in the resolutions adopted at Detroit , if slaveholding in any case is unavoidable by the laws of the State , or by the obligations of guardianship , or by the demands of humanity . ' That such cases may occur there can be no reason to doubt ; how frequent they are , is another question altogether . It is to be presumed , however , that they comprise butfen of all the cases of slaveholding in the land . Few slaveholders defend the fact that they hold men in bondage on these grounds ; few advocates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general rule and not the exceptions . All those , with very few exceptions , who regard slaveholding in general as sinful , suppose that there may be cases where the mere legal relation can not be regarded as wrong . If a pur - chase is made at the request of a slave , and with a view to his freedom ; if he is held merely in transitu , and with the design that he shall be free ; if an aged slave in a family is so held in order that he may be provided for , and so held that he might be free if he chose , and that he would not be sold if his nominal master should die ; or if the young who are inherited as slaves are held with a view to freedom , and under a proper training for freedom , and with suitable security that they shall be free when they reach a certain age or should their legal owner die ,  --  it would seem to be plain that these cases are consistent with the spirit of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty before God if he is in these circumstances . But , at the same time , it should be said that it ought to be a matter of devout gratitude to any one to be able to reflect that he is not in that condition himself , and that his mind will be more at ease if , even in this sense , he is wholly detached from slavery . " ( b ) But , if it is contemplated that a slave is to be held as a slave ,  --  as property ; if he is bought and sold for purposes of gain ; if his freedom is not contemplated or desired ; if no arrangements are made for his emancipation while his owner lives or when he dies ; if there is no express and definite trainingfor freedom ; if the whole system of discipline is such as to fit him for slavery and not for freedom ; if the slave is so held that when his master dies he will be subject to the same mode of disposal as any other property ; ' if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be separated from his wife and children , to be consigned to perpetual servitude , then slaveholding is a sin per se , and should be dealt with as any other sin is . If such be the aim and the purpose of the slaveholder , then , in reply to the question whether slavery is a sin per se , ' I answer , in the words of another , It is a sin , as murder is sin , as theft is sin , as injustice is sin . Oases there may be where slaveholders are only nominally guilty . The same is true of many acts which , in view of human law , are called murder and theft . A man may be a nominal slaveholder from necessity , and yet be a pious and benevolent man . A murderer in the judgment of man may be acquitted at the bar of God . In both these cases a false judgment exists . There is neither slaveholding nor murder in either case . But when a man kills another from malice , it is murder ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice and fraud . Here is the true distinction . Any man who holds slaves for a benevolent end ,  --  who remunerates their labor , and is only prevented from manumitting them by circumstances which he can not control ,  --  is involved in mi. *fortune , but not in guilt ; but he who holds slaves for his own gain , to increase his wealth or to promote his selfish ends , is as truly guilty of injustice and fraud as if he were a common thief ; and he is all the more guilty , because he robs the slave of rights far more precious than gold . A single act of robbery dooms a thief to the State prison ; a system of robbery is justified and de . fended , and is no bar to honor and respectability in the world . ' * " These are , in my apprehension , sound moral principles ; nor is it possible for me to see how , if a slave is held for purposes of gain and not for a purpose of benevolence , the act can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  a sin like all other sins in itself ,  --  and that it should be so treated and regarded . " - pp. 110-114 . This is good . We are not quite satisfied , however , with a statement which makes the rightfulness or wrongfulness of slavery depend on the motives of the slaveholder . The intrinsic character and tendencies of slaveholding exist in the act , the thing done , and not , surely not chiefly , in the intentions of the actor . A man has a natural right to liberty , just as he has a natural right to life ; and he who deprives him of liberty or life is guilty of a palpable wrong . The fact that he does it from a benevolent motive does not make that wrong act right . It is just as much a wrong to a man , he loses as much of his real rights , to be deprived of liberty or life from a benevolent as from a selfish motive . lilt will not convince him that he is not wronged , when robbed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persisted in through the mistake of some goodish blunderhead . If an act is evil in its nature or tendencies , as depriving a man of life or liberty is , then he who does the act does wrong-sins , whether he did it from the motive of gain , or an erring judgment , or a mistaken benevolence . A man is to be held responsible for doing wrong . He has no right to do wrong with good motives ; and if he does , his good motives , though they may palliate , do not remove or essentially alter the character of the wrong . A man may be the owner of a slave , in some circumstances , without sin , if he does not exercise the power which ownership gives to hold him to a forced servitude ; for he is not then a real slaveholder. // But if in the active sense , he holds that fellow-man in bondage-if by force without law , or by taking advantage of the civil power through an unrighteous law , he holds him to an involuntary servitude-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever his motive . The truth is , slaveholding or forced servitude-because an act in violation of the right to liberty-because an act , evil in its nature and tendencies-is in the category of sins ; it is a sinper se , a sin in itself ; and it can not be reasoned out of the category of sins by any true logic or sound philosophy . Wherever there is slavery or involuntary servitude , there is a deprivation of rights ; there is an evil and baneful condition of persons , and there , therefore , is sin somewhere . It may be wholly in the individual slaveowner , or wholly in the law-making and law-administering powers , or partly in both . But somewhere it is . And it is where the real holding to forced servitude is . Of course , when we say that men have a natural right to life and liberty , we admit the exceptions usually made in case of insanity or crime and the various exigencies of civil government . In his sixth chapter , Mr. Barnes discusses " the constitutional power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with reference to the question whether that church can do anything more to accomplish its avowed object , the abolition of slavery , or whether the Church , having given its testimony , must stand where it is , and look to the providence of God alone to interpose and check the evil . Here he makes the following points : ( 1 . ) It can steadily pursue its avowed aim or object , the abolition of slavery . ( 2 . ) It can continue to use the power of testimony against slavery . ( 3 . ) It can freely discuss the subject . ( 4 . ) It can treat slaveholding as a disciplinable offense , according to methods already declared constitutional and possible . ( 5 . ) The constitution of the Church , if necessary for that purpose , of effectually reaching slavery , can be amended . ( 6 . ) It can use the power , so successfully employed by the Friends , the moral power to induce all churches and individuals now implicated in the system , as speedily as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject with particular reference to the New School Presbyterian Church , oura uthor passes , in // his seventh chapter , to speak of the duty of the churches at large , with reference to slavery . Here he remarks that the subject should and must be agitated and discussed in all the churches ; that slavery should be everywhere treated as other sins and wrongs are ; and that the churches should , in some way , detach themselves from all connection with it . On the second of these points , that slavery should be everywhere treated as other sins and wrongs are , Mr. Barnes speaks pointedly and eloquently . We will quote one passage : " It is undeniable that there must be a great change in our religious literature before this point is reached . No one can fail to perceive that there is now a marked distinction made between this and other evils and wrongs that stand in the way of the gospeL Others are discussed freely . They are approached without the fear of giving offense , and with no desire to palliate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sunday.school Union , in the pulpit generally , in a large part of the religious papers of the country , the subjects of intemperance , gambling , lotteries , profaneness , Sabbath-breaking , infi. delity , skepticism , are approached without any desire to avoid them , and with no manifested fear of giving offense . They are met as they should be : - not in their political relations and bearings , but in their relation to the salvation of men . But this one great evil ,  --  this system , under which more than three millions of human beings are held in hopeless bondage ,  --  this system , ( I speak of the sys. tern , ' not of the feelings of many who are connected with it , ) which treats man not as man , and not as capable of redemption , but as a chattel , ' as a thing , ' - this system , which does at least as much in this country to hinder the progress of the gospel of Christ , and which involves as many violations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotteries , Sahbath-breaking , skepticism , infidelity , if not as much as all combined ,  --  is systematically , and on principle , excluded altogether from a large part of the religious literature and a large part of the pulpits of the nation . The slightest allnsion to it as an evil is suppressed ; books that refer to it as an evil are expurgated , that offense may not be given to the friends and abettors of slavery : and newspapers professing to be religious are projected and issued on the avowed doctrine that the subject is never , in any way , to be alluded to . As a matter of simple fact , also , some of the most powerful of all the organizations in the land for the diffusion of a religious lite. rature exclude this subject entirely ; and , though they speak freely of every other sin and wrong , they are wholly silent on this stupendous wrong done to the bodies and souls of men . So far as the influence of those organizations go ,  - -  and it is very far ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that this is not an evil and a wrong , and that it does not so interfere with the salvation of men and the progress of the gospel as to claim the attention of those who are organized into powerful religious associations , and who have vast public funds placed at their disposal for the spread of truth , and for advancing the kingdom of God on the earth . // " Now , what the spirit of the age and the spirit of the gospel , as I understand it , demand , is not that the subject of slavery should have any undue prominence in these discussions ; not that it should be forced into the publications of the Tract Society and the Sunday-school Union ; not that it should occupy the sole place in the pulpit ; but that it should be treated just as all other acknowledged evils and wrongs are : - as contrary to the gospel of Christ , as preventing the salvation of men , as a violation of the spirit of the gospel , and as an evil not to be perpetuated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary  --  and I am sure that in this I speak the sentiments of many thousands of others-of the perpetual deference shown to the holders of slaves in the pulpit and in the religions literature of the land . I am weary of the care taken , more than in other cases of wrong , to conciliate their favor and to avoid giving them offense . I am weary of the anxiety evinced that every approach to this subject , in so large a part of the literature of the land , should be cut off , and that at so many points we meet this as a matter that is by common consent to be regarded as inapproachable . Why should this be so ? How has it happened that in a Christian land mighty organizations have grown up , with vast power and wealth , from which all reference to slavery is excluded on principle , and that it is impossible , through any national organization , though having their seat in the North and sustained chiefly by Northern funds , to utter one word-yes , one word-in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian master , that shall direct his attention to his duty to a fellow-man that he holds in hopeless bondage ? - one word to induce him to treat him in all respects as a brother for whom Christ died ? It is clear to my mind that a great change should be effected on this subject in the Christian literature of the land , and that in religious newspapers , in the publications of the Tract Society and of the Sunday-school Union , and in all other publications , the subject of slavery should be approached precisely as any other admitted evil and wrong is approached . " The same is true in regard to preaching . * * * * The pulpit is a place where everything should be discussed , in its proper proportions , that bears on the progress of religion and the salvation of men . Everything that tends to promote religion should be defended and enforced ; everything that hinders it should be rebuked and condemned . There is no subject whatever which bears on the subject of human salvation that can properly escape the notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be exempted from that , however shielded and protected by laws and by the established customs of a nation , or however incorporated into civil constitutions , that tends to destroy the soul , or in any way to hinder the progress of the gospel of Christ . " pp. 15*-l6O . In his eighth and last chapter , Mr. Barnes sets forth the consequences of a proper position of the church at large on the subject of slavery-if all the churches in the nation were wholly detached from it . These are : ( 1 . ) The system itself could not long be sustained . ( 2 . ) The churches could engage con8i8tently in the work of spreading Christianity around the globe . Here he speaks with great plainness and force . " With // what consistency can a nation engage in the work of missions to the heathen , which systematically and on principle holds three millions of human beings in slavery ? " He asks in effect , what kind of a religion they would propagate ; and if the answer is , a slaveholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 . ) The detaching of the church from slavery would remove one of the chief hindrances to the spread of the gospel in heathen lands ,  --  and at the same time ( 4 ) to its influence in our own land . ( 5 . ) It would result in a great religious improvement in those who are now slaves , whose religion and morality is generally of a very inferior kind . ( 6 . ) One of the most plausible arguments in favor of infidelity would be taken away . We heartily thank Mr. Barnes , in behalf of the friends of freedom and pure Christianity , for the manly and Christian expression of his views in this book , on the question of the times . It will have great influence in all churches . It will have especial influence in his own , the New School Presbyterian Church . It will have influence by the justice , force and eloquence of his positions and arguments . It will have influence , and it ought to have influence , from the well-earned authority of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our last topic , SLAVERY AND INFIDELITY . Twelve years ago , the writer of this article , in a review of Gov . Hammond 's defense of slavery , in the New Englander for October , 1845 , used this language : " We should like here to discuss the question on which Gov . Hammond discourses very confidently , whether the Bible sanctions slavery ? But we have not room . Perhaps we shall take it up at another time . We will only say here to those who think that the Bible sanctions slavery , such as we have proved it to be , Meet the infidel on the question of the internal evidence of the divinity and truth of the Bible , if you can . Prove that any book , which authorizes and commands this complicated villainy , ' as John Wesley called it , is from the God of love , if yozt can 9 " And in the next year ( New Englander for July , // 1846 , p. 400 ) we used this language : " They who defend slavery from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * They bring the Bible into open conflict with truths as obvious and as certainly known a the very prelnise8 on which all proof of the divine orir , in of the Bible *nu8t reet. * * * They bring the Bible into conflict with the eternal principles of morals . " A similar thought Mr. Patton has conceived and ably elaborated in the little book which we have placed among those at the head of this article . This book maintains and will increase the reputation of an acute , sound and strong logician , which Mr. Patton has gained , as an editor of one of our religions papers , as a debater in our ecclesiastical bodies , and as a preacher . Mr. Patton arranges his arguments in the two departments of logic and of facts . Under the first , he specifies four respects in which the doctrine that the Bible sanctions slavery , destroys or materially weakens the internal evidence in its favor . ( 1 . ) In respect to the character of God . The amount of the argument here is this : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character , and thus disproves its inspiration ,  --  proves that it did not come from him . We are taught by the affirmation of the natural conscience , and by the deductions of reason from the works of creation , the infinite excellence of God . Slavery " is the most flagrant contradiction of benevolence , holiness , justice , compassion , and every other virtue characteristic of God . " Men know that God is just , and that slavery is unjust . Of course those who maintain that the Bible sanctions slavery , if they convince men on that point , make them infidels , so far as they are influenced by logical argument . They see that the pretended word of God contradicts his known attributes , and must be an imposture. ( 2 . ) His second argument is this in amount : If the Bible sanctions slavery , then it contradicts the rules of morality which God has given in the natural reason and conscience , and therefore can not be his word . It allows of robbery in its highest form , robbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , of time and labor , of liberty and happiness , and // can not be from God , who has written on the hearts of men the principle of human brotherhood and the duty of justice and love toward all . Modern infidels say : Slavery is defended from the Bible ; those guilty of it are admitted to the church ; eminent commentators , theological professors , doctors of divinity and missionary boards declare that slaveholding is in accordance with the teaching of the Bible ; " three-fourths of all the Episcopalians , Methodists , Baptists and Presbyterians in eleven States of the Union , " buy , sell and hold slaves " for the sake of gain , " according to the declaration of Rev. James Smylie , a Southern Presbyterian of high standing . We accept this exposition of the advocates of the Bible . It does sanction slavery , an outrage on the eternal principles of morals , and therefore it can not be from God , who teaches those principles in the natural reason and conscience . ( 3 . ) If the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a false or a contradictory doctrine with regard to the accountability of a large portion of the human race , and therefore can not be from God . The natural reason and the conscience proclaim the doctrine of universal human accountability , affirming divine government and man 's responsibility . But slavery divests men of responsibility by depriving them of those prerogatives and rights which are essential to it . The Presbyterian General Assembly , in their unanimous action of 1818 , prepared by Rev. Dr. Ashbel Green , say on this point : " Slavery creates a paradox in the moral Sy8tem-it exhibits rational , accountable , and immortal beings in such circumstances as scarcely to leave them the power of moral action . It exhibits them as dependent on the will of others , whether they shall receive religious instruction ; whether they shall know and worship the true God ; whether they shall enjoy the ordinances of the Gospel ; whether they shall perform the duties and cherish the endearments of husbands and wives , parents and children , neighbors and friends ; whether they shall preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and humanity . " A Southern ecclesiastical body , the Savannah River Baptist Association , decided that it is proper for slaves who are husbands and wives , when separated // by sale , to enter into new marriages , on the express ground that " slaves are not free agents , " have not control of their own actions . ( 4 . ) To teach that the Bible sanctions slavery-is to destroy the evidence for the Bible derived from its practical influence . Apply the divine test , " By their fruits shall ye know them . " The amount of the argument is this : If slavery , with all its injustice , cruelty , degradation , pollution and misery , is a legitimate fruit of the Bible , then the Bible must be condemned as neither true nor divine . In the course of his illustration of this argument , Mr. Patton says that not long since he listened to an eloquent address of a German , who had fled , an exile , to our shores , for his efforts to promote civil liberty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address : " You wonder why many of us are infidels . It is because in our own land the clergy , almost to a man , have sided with the despotisms under which we have groaned , and have quoted the Bible , ad nauseam , to prove that it was our duty to submit unresistingly to those whom God had appointed to rule over us . And then , when we come to this boasted land of freedom , we find the same thing essentially repeated ; for we see , as before , the church , and especially the ministry , arrayed against the slave , and the Bible again quoted to sustain the oppressor . How can we believe that such a religion , and such a book , were given by God ? " The second department of Mr. Patton 's book consists in a confirmation of his logical arguments by actual facts-proving by actual instances that the claim of a Scriptural sanction for slavery has made infidels . This part of his work is very effective ; and we would like to give a sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Article too long . We must refer our readers to the book itself , assuring them that they will there find convincing proof that this wretched claim of a Scriptural sanction for slavery has made infidels ; ( 1 ) among the slaves ; ( 2 ) among the free colored people ; ( 3 ) among slaveholders ; and ( 4 ) among those of other classes who condemn and oppose slavery . // We will here redeem our promise to refer to what Mr. Barnes says on this topic , by quoting two or three paragraphs : " On many minds there cart be but one result of such views . It will be , BO far as these are regarded as the teachings of the Bible , to lead men to reject the Bible ; to confirm skeptics in infidelity ; and to furnish an argument to the rejecter of revelation which it will not be possible to answer . Such views impinge on great principles of human nature , and are at war with the teachings of God in the human soul , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . All that is great and noble in man ; all the instinctive aspirations for freedom in his own bosom ; all his desires for liberty for himself and for his children ; all the deep convictions in the soul in regard to human rights and the inestimable value of liberty , is at war with such teachings ; and all the struggles for freedom in the world-all the lessons of history - go to confirm the impression that a book which contains such views of human bondage-which would place is among the lawful relations of life , and make provision for its being perpetual-cANNoT be from God . Men will say , and say in a form which can not be met , If such are the teachings of the Bible , it is impossible that that book should be a revelation given to mankind from the true God . He has written , as if " graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever , " other lessons than these on the souls of men ; and both can not be true . Nothing can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom , and that all men have a right to be free . Nothing can be more true than the declaration in the immortal instrument which asserts our national independence , that " all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; and that among these are life and LIBERTY . " Nothing can be more certain than that God has implanted in the human soul a desire of liberty which is a fair expression of what he intends shall be the settled condition of things in the world . We want no book , ' such men will go on to say , which proclaims other doctrines than these ; we can embrace no book as a revelation from God which does not coincide with the great laws of our nature ,  --  those laws which proclaim that all men have a right to be free . No book which departs in its teachings from those great laws OAN POSSIBLY BE FROM GOD . " ' " I believe that such inferences.are legitimate , and that such reasoning can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be received in the world , must not contradict the great and eternal laws which God has written in the souls of men , and which have been incorporated into the very frame-work of social life . I do not believe that any book can make its way in the world as a revelation from God , or secure a permanent hold on the hearts of men as coming from him , which by its fair interpretation would teach that either polygamy or slavery is a lawful institution ; that either is on the same moral basis as the relation of husband and wife , parent and child , master and apprentice , and that they are designed to be permanent relations in the world . But , at the same time , I do not believe that such are the fair teachings of the Bible ; and I can not , therefore , but regard all those who take this view of slavery as contributing , though undesignedly , to the defense and spread of infidelity . At // all events , it is worth the serious consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not actually produced in the land , and whether infidels arc not thus furnished with a weapon against the Bible which it is not possible for those who entertain these views to answer . " pp. 36-39 . " This one thing is as certain as anything can be : - that there are large-increasingly large-classes of men who never can be convinced that a book is a revEdation from God which abets and upholds slavery , or which can be used as a defense against slavery as it exists in our land . We must either give up the point that the New Testament defends slavery , or we must give up a very large  --  and an increasingly large-portion of the people of this land to infidelity ; for they neither can , nor will , nor ought to be convinced that a bcok that sanctions slavery is from God . I believe that this must and should be so ; and that there are great principles in our nature , as God has made us , which can never be set aside by any authority of a pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revelation from God by any fair interpretation defended slavery , or placed it on the same basis as the relation of husband and wife , parent and ohild , guardian and ward , such a book neither ought to he , nor could be , received by mankind as a divine revelation . " pp. 192 , 193 . We conclude by again expressing our conviction that the most effective weapon wielded in these days against Christianity , is the argument given by those infatuated religionists who claim that the Bible authorizes and sanctions slavery . " The New Testament , " says Francis* Newman , the English infidel , " is the argumentative stronghold of those *n the lJnited States who are trying to keep up the accursed system . " " Slavery , " say the pro-slavery divines , " is a Scriptural institution-sanctioned by the Bible . " " So much the worse for the Bible , " responds Theodore Parker , with manifest satisfaction , and with terrible effect* // ART . V.-TIIE SPHERE OF THE PULPIT . 1 . Politics and the Pulpit .

THE foregoing references , which might easily be made far more numerous , will suffice to show how deeply the question of the " True Sphere of the Pulpit , " has taken hold of the public mind . The subject must indeed be always of the deepest interest , wherever Christianity prevails . The ambassadorship of the cross is an office too solemn and important ,  --  an agency whose arms embrace society far too powerfully , not to have its functions well defined . But the question gathers additional interest from the special character of the present age . In an hour of elemental warfare ,  --  when every principle is questioned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing powers of sin and holiness are marshaled with hourly increasing strength ,  --  when " Satan hath come down , having great wrath , " and " Michael and his angels fight against him , " the cause of truth can ill afford that the batteries of the pulpit should be rendered inefficient by too high or too low an aim . To those , therefore , whose place of service is the pulpit , it is not a matter of surprise , or of complaint , that a thousand minds are addressing themselves to the question , " What is the true scope of the preaching of the Gospel ? "  --  or that so many
