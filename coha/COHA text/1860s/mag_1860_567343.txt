ARTICLE 111. - PRESIDENT WOOLSEY 'S DISCOURSE COMMEMORATIVE OF THE LIFE AND SERVICES OF REV . C. A. GOODRICH , D. D. , PROFESSOR IN YALE COLLEGE. * ROMANS XII , 11-13 . " NOT SLOTHFUL IN BUSINESS ; FERVENT IN SPIRIT ; SERVING TEE LORD , REJOICING IN ROPE PATIENT IN TRIBULATION CONTINUING INSTANT IN PRAYER DISTRIBUTING TO THE NECESSITY OF SAINTS GIVE N TO HOSPITALITY . " IT seems as if tile gre at Apostle , in this summary of practical virtues , was unconsciously sketching himself ; for who can fail to recall to mind the illustrations which Paul 's own life supplied , of the qualities here commended ? " Not slothful in business . " What statesman with the weight of government on his shoulders , what merchant with a commerce ransacking every quarter of the globe , ever showed more untiring industry , or had a greater burden of cares than the Apostle ? " Fervent " or boiling " in spirit . " But to this load of duties , this drain on time , his zeal was equal . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul rose with new desires to spend and be spent for Christ . He seemed to be made of iron , because his spirit kept boiling up through the force of the internal fire of love , and prompting him to new acthdty . " Serving the Lord , " or as the true reading requires us to translate , " serving the time , " that is , not time-serving , but watching for and seizing on the right occasions of doing work for God . flow characteristic this of Paul , who , instead of contenting himself with what he was doing , was ever on the outlook to do more ; who while others were resting or deliberating , had thrown himself into the opportunity , and was reaping the harvest ! " Rejoicing in hope . " And this untiring zeal , this mass of new labors succeeding to or heaped on the old ; could not have been endured or even undertaken without that joyful hope which so marks the Apostle 's life . Natively hopeful and inclined to selfreliance , when he " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Lord in strong confidence and in that hope which // the divine promises inspire . He felt that there was an arm lifted lip for his help : he looked on the bright side : in the discouragements of his old age at Rome , he speaks of his " earnest expectation and hope that in nothing he should be ashamed , but that with all boldness as always , so now Christ should be magnified in his body . " Animated by such hope lie was patient in tribulation , " " troubled on every side yet not distressed , perplexed but not in despair , persecuted but not forsaken , " " waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of the body . " And all this while he continued " instant in prayer . " One might suppose that he could have had no time to pray , but his epistles rather cause us to wonder that his prayers left any time for action . The fact was , prayer fitted him for business , and gave such a tone and such a spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , not in a hurry and without need of revision . And what is well worthy of remark , no man ever prayed more for others : for obdurate Jews , for unbelieving Gentiles , for the churches he had founded , for his intimate friends , his intercessions arose continually . Nor did lie stop with inter*cssions : he distributed to the necessity of saints , and according to his power was given to hospitality . Without a home , without property , lie could yet say , " these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me , " and he was engaged in distributing to the necessity of saints at Jerusalem a collection which lie had instituted among the Gentile churches , when he was seized and denounced by his countrymen . My friends , T presume that when these words of Paul , verified in his own life , were read , you all felt that they were peculiarly applicable to that departed friend , whom we meet this day to commemorate . 1e was by temperament of the Pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fervor runs into the construction of theological systems , or the presentation of divine truth in due order and sequence before the minds of men ; and they have done their work well , when they have enabled the generations of the world to form nobler conceptions of the government of God . Others are rather men of meditation , of feelings tremblin*ly alive , of shrinking sensitive genius , whose acute perceptions of beauty start back from // a fault of expression almost as if it were a crime . These do their work well , when the sermon at once profound , tender , and beautiful , remains in the memories of men , and fills their souls like an oratorio . Others calm , meek , wise , silent , gently flowing and filling their banks like a peaceful river , show by their balance of character , their self-forgetfulness and cornmunings with God , how faultless a Christian man may l ) ecome , before he goes to be with Christ . But to the class of speculative , or of meditative , or of calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was rather , like Paul , intensely earnest , fervent in spirit , not to say vehement , full of resources and ever ready with counsel , fond of impressing himself upon the events of the world and of shaping them according to his own decided convictions ; a man of the present and of the future , who linked together measures and results with far-reaching sagacity ; a man , in short , of great practical ability , made for usefulness and for accomplishing important ends among mankind . The life of a man with such a temperament , must necessarily have stood out before the eyes of his fellow-men mnoi-ethun*aizofimosf - academical and scholarly persons . Especially would this be the case in an age like ours , where so much preparation is made for every movement by the living voice and in the assembly of hearers , and where he who can advocate the cause of Christian benevolence has so munch to do . It is probable , therefore , that those whom I address , especially elderly persons if any such are among my hearers , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodrich , than with those of most public men with whom they have been brought into contact . It is not , therefore , for the purpose of conveying new , or of correcting old impressions , but rather for that of presenting in one view the labors of mind , and indications of character , which have been scattered through the last half century , that I proceed to speak of the life and services of Dr. Goodrich . He was born in New Haven , on the 23d of October , 1790 , and was the son of our well remembered townsman , Hon. Elizur Goodrich , a lawyer by profession , who at different times of his life filled important public offices , as those of // Collector of the port , Mayor of the city , Representative in Congress ; who was appointed Professor of Law in Yale College , and was for thirty years the Secretary of its Board of Fellows . He , his brother , Chauncey Goodrich , an eminent member of the old Federal party , who was ion g a Senator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of Lieutenant-Governor of the State , and the Rev. Samuel Goodrich , of Berlin , were among the children of the Rev. Dr. Elizur Goodrich , of Durham , who , in his day , was almost at the head of the Congregational ministers of Connecticut , who , at the time of the election of Dr. Stiles , was a prominent candidate for the office of President of Yale College , and for twenty-one years was a member of its Corporation . Dr. Elizur Goodrich , when he became minister in Durham , married the granddaughter of his predecessor , the Rev. Nathaniel Chauncey , of an ancient English family , whose first representative in this country was the Rev. Charles Chauncey , second President of Harvard College . From this source our deceased friend derived his first name ; his middle name , Allen , came from his own mother , a daughter of Daniel Aflen , *of Gi tDarflngn , Mas nd a *istem- of John Allen , who represented this State for several years in Congress . CIIAUNOEY ALLEN GOODRICH , after a training partly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Rev. Dr. Perkins of West Hartford , entered College in 1806 ,  --  the middle year of Dr. Dwight 's presidency  --  and was graduated among the leading scholars of his Class in 1810 . Next we find him rector of the ancient school where he received his own training , and in 1812 a Tutor in Yale College , which office he filled until 1814 . It was in this year that he gave his first literary labor to the world , ( undertaken by the advice of Dr. Dwight , ) a Greek Grammar , founded on that of a Dutch scholar , Caspar Louis Hachenberg . The helps at that time accessible for the study of this important language were exceedingly meager . The German philologists , Buttmann and Matthi* , had either not published their leading works , or these were wholly unknown in this country , and the very indifferent Westminster Grammar was the one in common use . It // was a service to the cause of education , which this young adventurer rendered , when , with the best guide within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saccessive corrections and improvements became more and more fitted to accomplish its object . This work stood its ground for nearly a quarter of a century , until new works or translations from the German masters supplanted it . Meanwhile , its author returned to this first path of his literary life in 1832 , and afterxvard by the preparation of a series of Latin and Greek lessons , which were undertaken first to initiate one of his sons into those languages , and when published came into extensive use . During his tutorship Mr. Goodrich began his studies for the ministry , under Dr. Dwight . From his early youth his mother had supposed him to be under the sway of Christian truth and principle ; but he regarded himself as having met with a great religious change while an undergraduate in College . He mentioned to one of his family , that having been for some time more than usually thoughtful on religious truth , he went one day to the room of a Christian acquaintance , and as he drew iiear the door heard shouts of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , " have a right to be happy , but I have not . " Under the feeling that there was a void in his heart which only peace with God could fill , he returned to his room , felt in a hightened degree the evil of his sins , and in no long time attained to a state of peace and hope . To the ministry of the gospel he consecrated himself , and when he had resigned his tutorship he preached with acceptance in several places , at Salisbury and Middletown in this State , and in Massachusetts at Worcester , and in the Park Stteet Church of Boston , where he labored for several months during a winter 's residence at Andover . Three calls were his hands at once from the Park Street Church , from Salisbury , and from Middleto*vn . Tie chose the call from the latter , and was ordained in July , 1816 . At about the time of his settlement he married Julia , second daughter of Dr. Noah Webster . // His stay at Middletown was brief ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to endear him to his people , and secure for him a kind remembrance of him in their hearts . But another sphere was now opened to him . Dr. Dwight having died at the beginning of the year 1817 , it was wisely determined , on the accession of President Day in the same year , to constitute two new chairs in the College  --  a measure which the prudent management of the funds through a number of years rendered possible . The chairs were those of Divinity and of iRhetonc ; and two young men , classmates as it happened and both natives of New Haven , were chosen to fill themEleazar T. Fitch and Chauncey Allen Goodrich . The chair of Rhetoric was filled by the latter-not without solicitations to go elsewhere-for twenty-two years . Dnring the first year of his professorship-I may be permitted to mention the Class to which Rev. Dr. Bacon and I belonged , being the Sophomore , fell under his instructions . The infirm health of Professor Goodrich , for a number of years after he entered - on his office wa* a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , yet he entered on them with that unshaken zeal and energy which marked his whole character . us routine of duties was something like the following . The Sophomores were instructed by him , through the summer term , in Jameson 's Rhetoric . The Senior Classes were taught out of a text-book in higher Rhetoric and Criticism , and read compositions before him which were afterwards criticised in private . The two middle Classes , with the Freshmen , were exercised in declamation , with unwearied pains ; and with equal labor to himself he introduced that careful preparation for the exhibitions of the Juniors and for the public Commencements , which has made the exercises of those public days so much more of a benefit than they were formerly , and so much more creditable to the Institution . After a time , with the growth of the number of students the busiaess of his department became too great for any one man , and he was allowed to employ an assistant in // declamation . The importance of his instructions to the Seniors meanwhile was increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chef d'oeuvre of ancient eloquence , and by a very interesting course of lectures on English Oratory . In the preface to his Select British Eloquence , published in 1862 , he speaks of his method and object in his instructions , as follows : " The Author of this volume , in entering on the office of Professor of Rhetoric , in Yale College , more than thirty years ago , took Demosthenes 's Oration for the Crown as a text-book in the Senior Class , making it the basis of a course of informal lectures on the principles of oratory . Modern eloquence caine next , and he endeavored in a distinct course to show the leading characteristics of the great orators of our own language , and the best mode of studying them to advantage . His object in both courses was , not only to awaken in the minds of the Class that love of genuine eloquence which is the surest pledge of success , but to aid them in catching the spirit of the authors read , and by analyzing passages selected for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ( whether ' they were conscious of it or not ) have always guided the great masters of the art , till he should learn the unwritten rules of oratory , which operate by a kind of instinct on the mind , and are far more important than any which are found iii the books . " The tone and tendency of the teaching of Dr. Goodrich was not so much aesthetical as rhetorical , and this harnmonized with the practical end which he had in view . His aim was to form vigorous , effective writers , men who by their eloquence should be able to move and lead their fellow-men . Eloquence , therefore , the forcible statement of arguments , the strong appeal to the conscience and to the feelings , occupied the front place . It will not be doubted that he did a good work for the College , and that he laid those foundations in his department on which the system pursued by his successor has been reared . It is characteristic of Prof. Goodrich that lie was not the man of a department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his especial province were more useful to his country , and carried with them more power , than his ordinary labors . II proceed to speak of one or two of the enterprises in which he was concerned while he held his professorship of Rhetoric in Yale College . The first of these in the order of time , and not the smallest in importance , was the formation of the Theological Department , in which he , together with Professor Fitch , had , as I suppose , the principal share . The Seminary arose in no spirit of theological antagonism or dread of heresies emanating from the earlier Institution at Andover , nor yet in the desire to form a center for the propagation of new doctrines ; for its founders , at the beginning , to say the least , were not aware that they differed from the theology long taught in New England . But it was no new thought that instruction in theology ought to be furnished at this seat of learning , and indeed this was one motive for founding the Institution : Dr. Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction Divinity Classes , consisting chiefly of graduates of Yale College ; and Dr. Dwight is understood to have desired tu *exten44he-oppertunities afforded for sacred study , and to have suggested to his son the making of an endowment for that purpose . To this , perhaps we ought to add that the great awakening in the College and town , in 1820 and 1821 , created a demand for a new theological center-an Institution where earnest , practical preachers might be educated . The Theological Institution came into being in 1822 , by a subscription of fifteen thousand dollars , in which Professor Goodrich took part , who also pledged himself , in connection with Professor Fitch , for the interest on an additional sum of five thousand dollars , in case it could not be raised in any other way . Dr. Taylor , then pastor of this Chnrch , * towards whom all these movements looked , received the appointmeut of Dwight Professor of Didactic Theology , ( so named from the principal subscriber to the fund , ) at the time of Commencement in 1822 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rev. U4auncey Allen Goodrich , f ) . D. In the inception of this Seminary , and in soliciting subscriptions , Mr. Goodrich was prominent , I may say foremost . He had been on friendly terms with Dr. Taylor before , but was flOW drawn much closer to him , and embraced his peculiar modifications of the prevalent theology of New England . And here , perhaps , as well as in any other place , I may refer to the devoted and disinterested friendship towards Dr. Taylor , of which , Mr. Goodrich gave most substantial proofs through the course of thirty-five years afterwards . Nothing in his life , full as it was of kind deeds , did more credit to his Christian heart , and , if particulars could be told , they would show him , were there no other proof , to be a mau who had spared no time , no pains , no expense , in doing good . Another department in which , during a part of these years , he showed his efficiency aud practical power , was the editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1819 as a monthly , was purchased by him in 1828 and put on a quarterly basis . He was its sole editor until about 1836 , wh*i* it passed out of his hands . As Thug as he continued to edit it , it flourished every way , but its chief peculiarity was , that it became the decided organ of what a short time before had begun to be called Taylorism. here the questions , Whether there is any sinful disposition before the first ' sinful act , What is the power of the will to choose , when motives in favor of a good are set before it , What is the nature of virtue , and its relation to the desire of happiness , What is the true conception of Divine moral government ,  - -  these and connected questions , were discussed with all the ability which the three men-*  --  the two already named , and Dr. Fitch , who took the lead in New Haven theology-could command . The discussions may be said to have begun to wane when Dr. Goodrich left the Spectator : men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thoroughly explored . Party lines had become drawn . By some , New Haven theology , in spite of its faith in the holy Spirit and zeal for revivals , and adherence to the doctrine of election , and reverence for Calvin and Edwards , had come to be viewed as // bald Pelagianism ; to others it was the only scheme on which preachers could fairly offer salvation to men perishing in their sins . Of the theological opinions of Dr. Goodrich let me say a word in this place . He had been brought up under Dr. Dwight , and in the main received the views of Christian truth taught by him , which were indeed at that time substantially the views of all New England theologians . To the peculiar opinions of Dr. Taylor he gave his adhesion , as being important for the earnest preaching of the Gospel ; and he felt towards that eminent theologian the warmth of deep personal friendship . But at no time of his life could he be called a narrow theological partisan , and during the last twenty years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerant and truly liberal of men . I have rarely seen a person who had less of what was sectarian , less theological narrowness , or bitterness in judging of religious character , or more willingness to allow and to do justice to diversities of opinion which related to the non-essentials of faith . The importance of practical religion in his mind so far outweighed that of scientific as to exclude all theological biases , and as for sectarian biases , he never had them . Passing over for the present Dr. Goodrich 's efforts in behalf of the religions interests of Yale College , which were continued through his lifetime and will be spoken of in the sequel , we pass to his transition from the academical to the theological department , which occurred in 1839 . He had long felt the necessity of another professor , besides the two already existing , whose office it should be to prepare the students of theology for the pulpit and for parochial duties . With this in view , and for the purpose of founding such a professorship , he offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider this subject , January 10th , 1839 , the sum of five thousand dollars of his own property , and was seconded by two liberal gentlemen , Aristarchus Champion , Esq. , then of Hartford , and Rev. Walter IL Bidwell , then of Philadelphia , now a well known editor of // New York , the former of whom pledged himself to contribute for the salary of the professor six hundred dollars for ten years , and the latter , three hundred for five . In Dr. Goodrich 's instrument it is provided that on the appointment of a new professor , " the President and Fellows , either as a body , or , by their committee , to consist of at least three of the clerical part of the Board , shall have a free communication with the professor elect on his views of doctrinal theology , and of the duties of the pastoral charge , such as is customary in our churches on the ordination and installation of ministers of the Gospel , and if they are satisfied of his soundness in the faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , shall proceed to induct him into the same . " By this , I understand him to express his preference of a personal examination of religious teachers over any creed subscribed and professed . In an appendix to this instrument he expresses his desire that a regular meeting should be maintained on Saturday evenimiig , especially during the two first terms of the collegiate year , for the instruction of the academical students and such others as may choose to attend , in the doctrines and duties of religion . He has , therefore , it is added , found a strong inducement to make the offer for an endowment , " in the hope that the President and Fellows would direct the Professor of the pastoral charge to exemplify in part the duties of his office before his pupils in the course of the familiar instruction before described . " But he forbears to make this an imperative condition for holding the office . The corporation of the college accepted these liberal offers , and appointed iRev . IDr . Joel Parker , then of the Tabernacle church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the next meeting of the board he signified his unwillingness to take the office , and then Dr. Goodrich himself was elected to fill it . He accepted the appointment , and continued in this professorship until his death . The reg4iar duties to which Dr. Goodrich was now called were such as his past life had qualified him for in an eminent degree . He brought to the criticism on the composition and delivery of sermons , the rhetorical practice and // judgment of the eighteen years which he had spent in his former professorship . For inculcating the duties of the pastoral care , he was qualified not only by his own brief experience , during his settlement at Middletown , but also by his truly pastoral labors in the college . The active interest which he had long taken in the various branches of the missionary work , enabled him to set before his students the claims of that branch of ministerial labor ; and oftentimes lie was the means of leading them to consecrate themselves to God 's service in that particular field . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on revivals , and on the pastoral charge , were all fitted to form practical pastors , and for years he had a religious meeting once a week with the students in theology for the purposes of practical religion . During the twenty years while he held this professorship his connection with the college proper did not wholly cease . Every week his voice was heard in the college chapel . His lectures on eloquence were delivered at once to the theological students and to the Senior Class in College , and were listened to with as much pleasure , as *ve1l as benefit , as any others in the course . Appearing no longer before the College students in the attitude of a disciplinarian ,  --  in which quality he had always been thorough and strict ,  --  freed also from some of those unpleasant collisions which his duties as an instructor and a critic brought with them , he was able now , more than ever before , to present himself to them in the light of a religious instructor and counselor . And here , I invite my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious influence on the College , which , if he had done no other work in the world , would entitle him to the name of a useful man , and to most grateful remembrance . His religious activity , which appeared in private counsel , in special efforts during revivals of religion and in his weekly religious meetings , dates back at an early period of his official life in time College . From the first he had taken , as he could not but take , a warm interest in its spiritual prosperity , but his energies were more especially directed into this channel after time great revival in 1831 , and still more systematically // May , Rev. Uhcvztneey Allen Goodrich , D. D. after he occupied a chair in the Theological Faculty . In these works of love imposed on him by no official duty his heart beat most freely and warmly ; and as he gathered experience of the hearts of others in their multiform phases of doubt and distress , as cases of conscience were poured into his ear , and Christians in despondency came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struggling against , or for conviction , brought by friends or led by their own necessities , applied to him for help , he grew in sympathy , in knowledge of ' religious life in its various aspects , in the readiness to act as a spiritual adviser , in the joy of being an instrument in God 's hands to save men . As he grew in years his authority and paternal sway increased also . He had acquired a widespread reputation , transmitted from earlier graduates , of being wise , kind , and prompt in counsel . Hence , newly entered members of the college sought him or were recommended to him by others , and over numbers he could have a healthful influence from the very first . He was a hopeful counselor , inclined to look favorably rather than otherwise on the evidences of Christian oharacter-not breaking the bruised reed nor quenching the smoking flax . Some came to him with perplexities such as so many young persons feel in regard to religious truth . He did not treat them with sternness , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but led them gently back to truth , or showed them how by a false theory they had thrown into truth the confusion of error . Some came as to a confessor ,  --  and would that there was more of private confession in the protestant churches ,  --  to open to him the secrets of a wounded soul . He prayed and wept with them , and helped them to believe in the sympathy of Jesus . The most various cases were brought to him for counsel , not only by the Christian students , and those under serious impressions , but by older persons ; some of them hesitating in the choice of a profession , deliberating perhaps whether they should enter into the missionary work , or having chosen it , how they should best engage in it ; others , perhaps , ministers , meeting with impediments in their calling ; others still soliciting his advice as to the management of great religious charities . // In short , no man probably in New Haven has been more resorted to as a counselor than he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they who went to him , as I have done , and multitudes of others scattered over this land , will not soon forget his wisdom and kindness , nor cease to venerate his memory . The counsels and wisdom . of Dr. Goodrich were especially called into requisition , whenever there was a time of unusual thoughtfulness on the subject of religion in Yale College . am not aware that he had had any experience in conducting revivals , or that any had occurred during his connection with the College before the year 1820 , but from that time onward he entered into them with zeal and hopefulness , he longed for them as the harvest times oC the Church , and ere long became the most efficient laborer in them . In the great revival of 1831 , in that of 1841 , and in others down to 1858 , his services to the cause of religion were inestimable and his labors nutiring . Amid his pressing literary labors he was ever ready to give himself up to the public speaking and private counsel required at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two essays he has given to the world his estimate of the value of religious revivals . In one of these , which appeared in Prof. Edwards 's Quarterly Register for 1838 , he follows their history down to that time in Yale College , and some years afterwards expressed an intention , which he never fulfilled , of continuing and completing the narrative . Being known as a person acquainted with the history of religions awakenings , and skilled in conducting them , he was requested by Dr. Baird to write the chapter on revivals which forms a part of that gentleman 's work on " Religion in the United States of America . " In that essay , Dr. Goodrich traces revivals from their first occurrence in this country onwards , and then shows what there is in this peculiar movement to favor the progress of religion , what helps to Christian feeling and to earnest prayer , what helps to the thoughtful enquirer in the solemnity of the season and the sympathy of others around him . Dr. Goodrich firmly believed that all the work of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during revivals as at other times , that students were more likely to enter upon a decidedly Christian life when they studied at such seasons than when they gave their whole thought and feeling to the subject of religion ; he dreaded that too great tension of feeling which , dwelling upon one absorbing subject hour after hour produces , and believed that the mind can not be absolved at such times from its ordinary laws of action . He regarded the phases of religion as infinitely diversified , and looked on the forms of piety at its birth in the soul with a most hopeful eye ; yet his chosen way of dealing with the conscience of a person under religious impressions , was to lead him without delay to consecrate himself to the service of God and Christ . The weekly religious meetings which Dr. Goodrich conducted were among his happiest means of religious influence . It had been Dr. Dwight 's custom on a Saturday evening , which was the stated time for the meetings of the Church to go into them , to make an address on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger members by themselves . This practice Dr. Goodrich and others resumed , but I can not ascertain that it was steadily followed up for any long period . In 1839 , however , on entering upon the duties of his new professorship , he determined to carry out the suggestions which I have already mentioned as accompanying his subscription for the founding of the chair . Weekly meetings , now begun , and held , either at first or not long afterward on Sunday evening , just after the evening meal , were continued by him in strength and feebleness steadily until his last illness . These meetings will be associated by the later classes in the College with the name of Dr. Goodrich whenever it is mentioned , and probably they were the most useful labors of his life . Here the sins and evils of College life came up for rehike . Here the vicious tendencies of literature and of the spirit of the time were met and counteracted . Here the sermon of the day in the Chapel was pressed upon the conscience . Here Christian fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , once a month , the wants of the heathen and the state of missionary // enterprise were brought before the minds of the young , as points of cardinal interest for Christians . The addresses , short in compass , not occupying generally more than twenty or twenty-five minutes , earnest and eloquent in manner , wisely adapted in subject for the audience , were models of the Christian homily-they were , in the language of Scripture , nails and goads fastened by the master of assemblies . Nor were these the only meetings for religious purposes in which his voice of prayer and exhortation was heard . I have already spoken of the meeting which he held with the theological students once a week for religious purposes . During several years he was the center of a religious gathering in which the families of the College professors were united . Then , on the installation of Prof. Fisher , five years since , he , with other older members of the Church , came into the meetings on Friday evening , in which , after the pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the great religious societies of the day he felt a warm interest , and generally took a very prominent place . When the movement in favor of temperance was started , he advocated it with zeal and joined in the efforts made in this town to promote its success . In the society for promoting college education at the west , he was one of the most active and most trusted directors . In the operations of the Tract Society at New York he joined heart and hand , until his disapproval of the spirit shown by the Society nearly two years since , which he viewed as time-serving and irreligious , led him to publish a powerful remonstrance against their proceedings ; he then withdrew from all share in the Society 's proceedings , and supported the Institution at Boston . In the Bible Society , at the time of his death , he was a member of the important committee whose duty it was to determine how far the Society should undo the labors of the late committee of revision . Since the news of his death reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of his worth in appropriate resolutions . Perhaps his affections were . more bound up in the American Board ( of which he was a corporate member ) than in any other of the charities of our day . Few // members had more influence or nrged the cause of the Board with more eloquence than he , when his health permitted him to attend the annual meetings . And few members gave more substantial evidences of their regard for the great work of Christian missions . During these last twenty years of his life two secular labors occupied much of his time , which our sketch would be incomplete if it did not notice . The first of these was the repeated i-ev son of Dr. INoah Webster 's English Dictionary . His con*neetion with this dictionary began soon after its publication by his father-in-law in 1828 . He had made representations to Dr. Webster that an abridgment of the original quarto in two volumes would be highly important , and indeed serviceable to the sale of the larger work . But the lexicographer , now an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing that Prof. Goodrich should undertake it . Accordingly , soon after the publication of the quarto edition , an abridged edition in octavo appeared , executed by Dr. Joseph E. WorcesteT , under the superintendence of Prof. Goodrich . It became his property , and turned out to be a very popular work . In 1840 , another unabridged edition was carried through the press by Dr. Webster , and in 1843 this veteran scholar died at the age of 85 . It was deemed important both for the interests of the family and for those of the Messrs . Merriam of Springfield , who had acquired an interest in the work , that a thorough revision of the unabridged dictionary should be attempted , and Dr. Goodrich was requested to undertake the labor . This revision , although he was assisted by several collaborators and scribes , cost unwearied pains and occupied a good part of the working hours of several years . It appeared in 1847 , in one volume , small quarto ; and being put , by the sagacity of the publishers* into such a shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be purchased by a large part of the community , it had immense success . At the same time with this went on a revision of the octavo edition to which we have referred . Several years later Dr. Goodrich began a collection of synonyms , on which he bestowed great labor , and which , in its present form , is believed to be more complete and useful // than any similar collection in the English language . This was introduced under the appropriate words first into two abridgments of the original dictionary , and then much enlarged into a new edition of the unabridged work , called the pictorial edition , which has recently seen the light , to which also an important appendix ( of new words ) was added by Dr. Goodrich . Nor did he cease to work upon Engli*h lexicog. - raphy until the close of his life . In 1852 was published his work entitled Select British Eloquence , which , in one closely printed octavo of nearly a thousand pages , contains the best speeches of the most distinguished English orators , accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This work has deservedly received high commendation . Its critical and biographical introductions are , in the case of the principal orators , as Burke , Fox , and the two Pitts , extended to a considerable length , so as to embrace all the important particulars of their lives , and a fair as well as thorough view of their styles of oratory , while the summaries of the arguments , and the notes , put the reader in a position to understand what he reads , nearly as well as could be done when the speeches were delivered . The author brought to the preparation of this work the opinions and critical estimates which many years of familiarity with British models enabled him to mature , and he took great delight in the subject . No one can help feeling that he was at home . Such were the principal occupations-many of them selfim1 ) osed-with which the life of Dr. Goodrich was crowned . A life so full of work , even in its intervals of leisure , needed all the working hours of each day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted in his pursuits by illness . In the earlier years of his office in the College the same ill health accompanied him which had required him to resign his charge at Middletown . At length , ' in 1825 , he sought to reinstate his health by a tour in Europe , upon which he was absent a year from his post . Since then he has been liable to sharp and sudden attacks which prostrated him for a while , but from which the remarkable elasticity of his constitution // enabled him soon to rally . About six years ago he had an alarming attack of an apoplectic nature , from which it was thought for a time that he would never recover . But he rallied again , and ere long threw himself into his manifold labors as earnestly as ever . Again , in the spring of 1850 , just at the close of exhausting labor in lexicography , the overworked and wearied brain threatening a new assault on the powers of life , obliged him to spend a considerable part of the warm season in repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old labors and commence new ones , with his mind as vigorous and his heart as large as ever ; through the winter he discharged his wonted duties in the Seminary , carried on his Sunday evening meetings , and was strong enough to employ himself in literary work for several hours each day . It seemed as if his tenacious aud elastic constitution might still hold out perhaps for several years to come . But God willed otherwise . On Friday afternoon , February . lTth , he returned home from a lecture to his theological class , on the pastoral charge , feeling quite unwell , and his illness , as it grew upon him , proved to be bilious pneumonia . It was severe , but not alarming , when , on Saturday , February 25th , early in the morning , he had a shock of paralysis , which took away his power of speech . Another shock , or more than one , supervening later in the day , closed his life at 4* o'clock of the afternoon . It was not given to him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel which he had taught , and by which he had lived ; but who needed from him that testimony ? It was felt to be a mercy that his life , so strong and full as it had proved itself all along , was not left to a long grapple with death . He died with comparatively little pain , and in a moment . This brief sketch of the life and efficiency of Dr. Goodrich must have made it evident , even to those who knew little of him , that he was no ordihary man . What now was the secret of his power , and where did that strength lie , which every one who was brought into contact with him felt and acknowledged . It lay not in endowments of mind by themselves , although he had a mind well constituted , and deficient in no // quality which belongs to human nature . But it Jay in that union of mental and moral traits , which makes the man effective and influential in the practical affairs of life . He had correctness and soundness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications which present themselves to us in life , disentangled them and brought the leading causes with clearness before the minds of others . He discerned the probabilities of the future , and calculated accurately the contingencies of things . He judged with great correctness the weight of arguments , what force they had in themselves , and what influence they would have on different minds . This , united with other qualities , made him most able and convincing in argument , and gave him a sway over impartial minds which was very uncommon . United with judgment , in him was a quality which often overpowers it , but over which he was able generally to hold the reins . I refer to the ardor with which he threw himself into any cause he undertook , magnifying its importance , and increasing the desirableness of its attainment . To this characteristic was allied a very great activity of mind , seen among other things in forecasting the future and laying plans which reached forward far into distant years . No man that I have ever seen was more fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devising the means by which the ends he had proposed to himself could be accomplished . Whilst lie was in the College Faculty a very large part of the changes and improvements originated with him . If now he had been a timid man , this restless activity of his would have preyed upon his own soul . But he was hopeful and fearless , sanguine of success , and afraid neither to take responsibility nor encounter opposition . We must also , in estimating his practical power , take into account his accessibleness and readiness of access to others , his native kindliness , which opened the avenues of influence . To this is to be added his power of expression , which must have been native , however cultivated it may have been by rhetorical studies . All these qualities combined , gave him , in enforcing truth , in discussing measures , in stating arguments , a very uncommon degree of impressive- // ness . I have heard him sometimes when I have thought him among the most cogent and eloquent speakers I ever listened to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward arguments in their best shape and order , his strength of appeal to the sense of responsibility , his clearness in presenting truth , he might have reached the highest eminence at the bar , if he had originally turned his talents in that direction . To these powers he joined great rapidity in the movements of his mind , in devising plans and executing them . He was thus qualified to throw off work fast . And yet , to this was joined the seemingly inconsistent quality of unwearied painstaking . I have often wondered how such a man , so natively restless , and of so nervous a temperament , could endure the drudgery of drilling in speaking and composition , day after day , as he did while he was Professor of Rhetoric . It seemed as if , when he had once made up his mind that an end was desirable , the amount of toil to secure it became of no account . Or rather he was ardent without being impatient . He had an energy of will and of principle which kept him working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of Dr. Goodrich will be remembered by his students and his fellow-citizens longer than any of his distinctive moral or intellectual traits , and by those who knew him longest will be remembered as a character that went on steadily improving in purity , zeal for doing good , and self-consecration . Some of the Christian traits which show most brightly in him deserve to be mentioned apart . And , first , he was a 1u*p*ful and joyful Christian . This was to be observed especially in the latter part of his life . I have heard him speak more than once in private df Christian joy , and that it might be reached and ought to be aimed at . His internal peace in his last years seemed to be disturbed by no serious doubts or fears . He looked out of himself at the great objects of Christian faith for consolation , and held the opinion that the tendency to search the heart and explore the motives which had been fostered by such books as Edwards 's on the affections had been pushed too far , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who by this means were shorn of a part of their power . He was a man of prayer , who believed in its efficiency with God , and not merely in its reaction on the petitioner , a man who prayed " always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints . " All who knew him knew that he was a devout man , one who held constant intercourse with God , in public and private , in set seasons and in ejaculations , who prayed earnestly over his daily toils as well as over his spiritual interests , with whom the prosperity of religion was a constant subject of interest and of fervent desire . And this prayerftilness was associated with a living faith in a present Spirit , daily dwelling in the hearts of those who seek for him and guiding them in the ways of peace . He was a man of remarkable Chrietian munificence . We have already seen that he founded the professorship which he afterwards filled in the theological department by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave another considerable sum of money , to be employed as an accumulating fund for the uses of the same department ; and in all the subscriptions made to Yale College , he was among the readiest and most liberal of its friends . In contributions to public objects , especially to the cause of missions , he was always foremost . Nor was there any means of doing good for which his purse was not opened . The wonder was sometimes expressed where a man by no means wealthy found the resources which he parted with so freely . But the explanation lay in his sagacity , thrift , and economy . The revenues from his copyrights and literary labors were managed and husbanded with skill , and were used as not his own but God 's . The large sum given for a theological accumulating fund was the fruit of years of careful saving for this express purpose . And with this munificence a 8pirit of kindness and sympathy ran parallel , which was manifested in a thousand ways towards the poor , the sick , the afflicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in any way had fair claims upon his compassion . To the widow and the female left destitute by visitations of Providence he was a // bountiful and constant friend , and none will more warmly testify to his goodness than persons of this description . To his acquaintances in their afflictions he was the first and readiest of consolers , and the most prompt visitor in illness . It was not enough for him to contribute his money , but in cases of distress he invoked the aid of other benefactors ; he found work for those who were out of employment ; he spent his valuable time in counsel to those who sought it ; he took the sick or the distressed into his house ; in short , his activity in benevolence was as large as in the literary undertakings and the official employments which were the immediate business of his life . I will only add , that he was always ready to converse on religious topics ; not merely on theological opinions , or the meaning of scripture , or the operations of Christian benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the inner life itself . He slid readily and willingly into these subjects . He showed that they were daily near and familiar . The reserve which is so habitual to many of the best men upon these deepest of subjects , had worn away from his mind ; they were great realities , in his judgment to be dwelt upon and spoken of as much as any other . In endeavoring thus to estimate the life and character of Dr. Goodrich , I am naturally brought back to those words which stood at the head of this discourse : " Not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord , ( or seizing the opportunity ; ) rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ; distributing to the necessities of saints ; given to hospitality . " Has not this whole discourse been an illustration of one or another of these practical ChristIan virtues ; of untiring and sleepless industry and activity upon Christian principles ; of ardor in doing good which took np God 's cause as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had already planned and sometimes accomplished , while other men were thinking of setting out ; of a radiant , trustful , hopeful piety ; of prayerfulness in daily life ; of a stream of charities and sympathies towards the servants and the cause of Christ , and those distressed ones whom Christ // made his own by pitying them ? There is yet one of these pencil-touches of the Apostle , which I have not noticed " patient in tribulation . " One son was taken away from him in childhood . Two bright-faced daughters graced his family , until they were given in marriage to young men of worth and promise . But in the very morning of their married life the mower 's scythe cut them down in their new homes , and in the case of one of them without the father being near to see her die . This , though they died in hope , was tril*ulcction , but it was tribulation patiently borne , and he surrendered submissively the gifts and the hopes which God had lent him . To those survivors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need not attempt to act the part of a consoler which he has sustained towards me and towards so many . There is consolation , or rather joy , suggested by his life and his death . That he lived to that epoch of old age beyond which life begins to be labor and sorrow , and just there passed away by no painful dQath , that he had spent a life full of accomplishment and results , that he had walked with God in near and nearer intimacy , these things surely are what , if anything , can take away sadness and gloom from death . To the College , to its religious interests especially , his loss is exceedingly great , and as its oldest officer , I have felt it to be appropriate for me , once his pupil , then his colleague , and brought into near relations to him , to express on my own part , on that of my colleagues , and on that of the students , upon whom his hold was strong and close , our sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest spirit of survivors , what new zeal of another and kindness like his own can perpetuate his influence ? May God , who loves his own cause better than his servants love it , and has the resources of boundless wisdom , help where man fails .
