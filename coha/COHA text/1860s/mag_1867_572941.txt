THE PHILOSOPHY OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP . WHEN the great Athenian orator was asked what was the first qualification of an actor , he replied , " action . " When asked the second qualification , he answered , " action ; " and when asked the third , he still replied " actior* . " So , if we were asked what are the first , second and third qualifications of a great political leader , we should answer every time , action ; using the word not exactly in the sense of the old Athenian , but as embracing firmness , determination , resolution , positiveness , decision and courage . To sum up all in a phrase , we would say that the highest qualification of a great political leader is mental and physical momentum . Few peoples have ever lost their liberty in consequence of the supineness or cowardice of the masses , but it has generally slipped from them by the indecision and inaction of those whom they were accustomed to look upon as their leaders . Le4* us have an illustration that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations of the civilized world awoke one morning to learn that the Republic of France had fallen in a single night , and that a throne was already erected over its ruins . The nations gaped and wondered , and went to sleep the next night still puzzled and incredulous about the whole affair . How was it all done ? How was it possible that a republic , embracing so many great scholars and intellectual leaders , could have gone out , like a snuffed candle , in a single night ? But here was precisely the difficulty  --  the iRepublic of France had not in its behalf a single great leader . It had plenty of scholars , orators , poets , philosophers , and dreamers and reformers without number , but it had no great leader . It had a host of such famous men as Lamartine and Victor Considerant . But Lamartine was a poet , and Victor Considerant was a dreamer ; both grand in ideas , but excessively small in action . Giants in thought , but pigmies in political-physical momentum . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the hour of revolution . These republican poets and dreamers thought to save their republic by protests , songs , and pacific marchings up and dowr*he street . It was a sight to make the infernal deities laugh to see even the soldiers of the republic promenading the streets unarmed that night , in order to show how pac*fique the spirit of the republic was even at the moment when the tramp of the little army of the coup d ' etat was beginning to reverberate through the streets of Paris . From the vicinity of the Palais National the people came forth crying out that unarmed citizens had been shot down on the Boulevards . But the poets and dreamers-that is , the political leaders of the republic sidestill counseled the pacific marchings and the eloquent protest ; and they // sent forth the poor people unarmed to meet bayonets , with no defense but the million-voiced cry , Vice la Constitution ! Vice la Republic ! In Victor Considerant 's own account of thousands surrendering to hundreds , he says : " For myself , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arms . I replied , no arms ! for God 's sake and the Constitution , no arms . We want a manifestation , imposing and peaceful . We must avoid all appeal to arms , place ourselves at the head of the manifestation , and there receive , if there were a rencontre , the points of the bayonets on our breasts . " And thus the republic and the constitution went down in less than an hour , amid the most unearthly noise of yelling and screaming , Vive la Republique ! Vicela Constitu*tion ! Had every voice which screamed Vice la Bepublique ! been supported by a carbine , or even a brick-bat , the Be'publique would probably be standing to-day . The populace shouted " to arms ! " " give us cartridges I " " let us erect barricades ! " But the leaders said ; " No , our true weapons are the thunderous words , " Vice la Republique ! Vive la Constitution ! ' It is true that there were more thousands of men shouting Vive Republique than there were hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that one bayonet can silence , in a short time , we know not how many of these steutor voices of " Vive la Republique ! " What a terrible lesson of incompetent leadership is written here in this sudden , this needless collapse of a republic ! The " Democratic Paas it was called , were better named Sot Paczfique ; for it was a pacific fool . The short verdict of an intelligent inquest on the French Republic would be , " died of incompetent leadership . " But lack of determination , and physical momentum , were not the only defects in the leadership of the republic . There was also a reckless disregard of political fitness in the candidates for high official trusts . Men were put forward and elevated to office who were known enemies of the new constitution . For instance , M. Thiers , who was at one time placed at the head of the government , was , of all men in France , the man who should never have been elected to such a post . He had treated the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of paper ; " and his appointment to administer its provisions was an act of folly transcending all others recorded in the history of nations , unless , indeed , we have in this country some examples to match it in the last four years . All the so-called moderate journals of France were also full of frequent sneers at the consti-. tution . It is of little use for the populace to split their throats crying " Vice la Constitution , " while they elect its enemies to high official posts . The condition of our country at the present time is a painful instance of the same national folly and crime . All the leaders of the dominant party in the northeru States are not only reckless of the sanctity of the Constitution , but they are open and avowed enemies of ifs fundamental principles . Among them all the phrase " rule of the majority " is now substituted for government of the Constitution . Instead of asking , shall not the Constitution rule ? the mischievous , the deluding question now is , shall not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shall not the Constitution rule ? " The Constitutution is the fundamental compact , the arch of principles , the inviolable guarantee of minorities , of the rights of all . The Constitution , in its spirit and principles , is the key-stone of the arch , and the only condition on which minorities accept the government of majorities . If the Constitution is violated by those who are entrusted with its administration , there is no longer any legal government . If majorities , in trampling it under foot , trample under foot the guarantees of minorities , their legal rule is at once at an end . They themselves break in pieces , as far as they are concerned , all judicial obligations . The people , every fraction of the people , every individual , falls back on his original liberty , on his original rights . The conscience of each becomes the sole rule of his duty . That is where these violators of the Constitution lahd the duty of all , with respect to themselves . They who deny the protection of the Constitution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The position of the Negro-Republican party , on this subject , is correctly stated by Mr. Raymond , in the Times , in the following para-graph : " The President has done all that was possible to carry out his own policy . He has labored with Congress , and has taken his last appeal  --  the last appeal he can take  --  to the people . The decision has upon all hands been adverse to hiss . The people have given their support to Congress and its policy as against the President and his policy . " Mr. Raymond , like all the other Radicals , seems to have no conception of the President 's obligation to respect his oath to 8upport the Constitution . The President is under no oath to follow the caprice of majorities , however great they may b* The President has taken the high and unassailable position that Congress is acting in opposition to the Constitution , which he has swor* to protect . It is no doubt agreeable to the political morality of Mr. Raymond and his fellow-conspirators , in the Negro-Republican party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of complying with the demands of a party . What they are making such a savage hue-andcry about is , for a government of a party , in opposition to a government of the Constitution . What these mad destructives call a government of majorities , is , under our system , of no higher political status than the rule of a mob . It is exactly the same . But suppose the real majorities of the citizens of all the States should take it into their heads to combine for the purpose of protecting their rights , what would take place then ? Why then the NegroRepublican party would be in a minority of not less than a million ! Then what would its secretly organized band of swindlers , thieves , impos .. tors and oppressors , say about majorities ? Ben . Butlerreceived a lesson of the government of majorities in New York city , where the crowd refused to let him speak . From the windows of the office of THE OLD GUARD we looked out upon that horribly noisy , but very perfect illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Behold here your faces as in a glass , oh , ye dolts ! See what chastisements the future may reserve for you , should you succeed in overthrowing the government of Consti // tution and laws ! But how have a naturally despised cabal of fanatics and impostors succeeded in so nearly completing the destruction of the Constitution ? How is it that the government of the country has fallen into the hands of such men as Ben . Butler , Charles Sumner , Forney , Wendell Phillips , Ben . Wade , and Thud . Stevens ? It is not because one-tenth of the people ever believed as they do . It is not because these men are not still despised by a vast majority of the people ; but it is because they have been intensely in earnest , deI.ermined , and pushing in their acLion ; while their opponents have been irresolute , infirm , vacill.2ting between policy and principle , and thus all the time giving up full half the ground to the possession of the enemy . These revolutionists have all the time adhered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they have known no such thing as a policy that did not push squarely into view that principle . No man was nominated for office who did not sharply represent this principle . No man was employed to go forth as an advocate before the public who did not on all occasions exhibit and defend the principle , and assail with determined bitterness all who opposed . Thus the party , though no more than a hated cabal , embracing only an abominated fraction of the people , moved forward with a degree of mumentum that finally everywhere threw their opponents upon the defensive . The whole management of the Democratic party , ever since the end of Jackson 's administration , has been precisely adapted to the final triumph of its enemies . Instead of putting forward men for office who fairly and boldly represented the grand principles of the party , they sought out those who were supposed to be less positive in their adherence to any determined principle . In that way the principles of the party became complex and demoralized . Gunning and not principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous policy was impressed upon the party during the administration of Mr. Van Buren . All the boldness and stern reliance upon principles that so honorably distinguished the administration of Jackson fell entirely out of sight in that of his successor . Jackson was bold and sagacious . Van Buren was timid and cunning . The qualities of *K*kson were those of a great political leader . Those of Van Buren were the reverse . The two men reflected the different political qualities of Cardinals Richeieu and Mazarin . Richeieu was never liberal in his promises , but he always performed all and more than he promised . Cardinal Mazarin denied nothing , and performed nothing . Richeieu was bold , determined , and confident . Mazarin was truckling , hesitating and fearful . It was said that he never carried power to such a pitch as his predecessor , nor exerted it so terribly ; but he was without faith in man , and without honor . Though less arbitrary and less severe than Richeieu , and , perhaps , less vindictive , he was addicted to low cunning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the place where Richeieu had proved himself a great and powerful Minister . Jackson had many of the great qualities of Richelieu . He was bold , determinQd , self-reliant , and , per- // THE PHILOSOPHY OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP . 1867. haps , despotic and vindictive ; but he was honest , straighttorward , and faithful to his principles and his friends . Van Buren was crafty , treacherous , timid , and false alike to principles and friends . He was the Cardinal Mazarin of America . And it has been a great misfortune to our country that the politics of the State of New York have occupied so controlling a part in the political destiny of the nation , because the leaders of the Democracy of that State have quite generally , since Van Buren 's time , based their party management upon his example of craftiness and policy , in opposition to the more honest and sagacious rule of fidelity to principle and faith in the public virtue and intelligence . The general policy has been for years to make political truth , at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ruled by craft and cunning , rather than by sagacity and truth . Cunning is always timid . And timidity is one of the greatest disqualifications of a political leader . Cowardice never succeeds in anything . In politics it is the sure companion of defeat . No great leader was ever timid either in his words or deeds . Pitt was one of the greatest political leaders with which English history has acquainted us , and no man was ever less cautious or politic than he where a great principle was to be defended . Hear how he dared talk to his government and the mad majority of the people of England when they were going into an unjust war against the American col-onies : " The gentlemen tell us America is obstinate . America is almost in open rebellion . I rejoice that America has resisted . Three millions of people , so dead to all feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves , would have been fit instruments to make slaves of the rest . " Another time he declared that : " Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would never lay down my arms while a hostile foot trod the shores of my country . Never ! never ! never And still on another occasion he said : " The Constitution has been greatly violated-the Constitution at this moment stands violated . Until that wound be healed , until the grievance be redressed , it is in vain to recommend union to Parliament . On that foundation I would take the lead in recommending peace and harmony to the people ; on any other I would never wish to see them united again . If the breach in the Constitution be effectually repaired , the people will of themselves return to a state of tranquility ; if not , may discord reign fore*cr . " Such was the language a brave man and a great leader dared to utter in the House of Lords . Suppose we had now any man great enough and brave enough to utter similar language in the American Congress at the present time , what an intolerable jargon would arise from hundreds of thousands of conspirators , scattered , like vermin , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " rebellion ! " But we have no such great man-no such brave man in Congress . We have no one that dare tell the whole truth in that body of usurpers and tyrants . We have no man in Congress . The bravest of the cowed and cringing minority , if he attempts to make a speech , instead of thundering into the ears of the brutal majority the truth that they are the rebels and traitors , begins with an apologetic // tone to prove that he is not himself a traitor . The misfortune of our unhappy country is that the minority in Congress and in the country is without competent leadership . This accursed war has filled the land full of cowards and knaves . There is no longer left any sap in the tree of liberty . We are in a condition like Rome , as described by Tacitus , after its fall : " The frame and economy of Rome being thus totally overturned , amongst the Ro. * mans were no longer found any traces of their primitive spirit or attachment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wretched death of manhood and liberty is as yet only apparent . The Constitution still lives in the affections of the people , if we could only get a style of leadership to call it out . The old Democratic masses have nowhere yet been kindled and filled with fire since the beginning of the Negro-Republican war . When those whom they were accustomed to regard as leaders were frightened or hired into the service of the Abolitionists , they were paralyzed with amazement and disgust ; and to this day they have not recovered confidence in , nor respect for , any leadership which has claimed their support . They have often voted , with burning mental protests , against the principles of the candidates offered fcfr their suffrage . But they have never been fully quickened with the grand enthusiasm of old days , because they have not had the grand principles of th' olden time in the canvass . The Democracy of this day looks so much like a twin brother of Negro-Republicanism that the man of sense has to look twice to see the platform he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call themselves " loyaL " But the man of sense knows that loyalty is a negro , and not a white man . He knows that loyalty is a traitor to the grand old Democratic idea of self-government and true liberty . As long as the leaders of the party pursue this course of running the campaigns round on the outer edge of the negro-loyal platform , they will be pushed off and defeated . 0 ! it is all from the incompetency of leadership ! They are without the two essentials-sagacity and pluck . Their brains seem to have descended from their head to their heels , and hence , instead of defending the truth , they dodge and run away from it . Instead of telling the truth , as a great man would , in words as forcible and hard as cannon balls , they utter it in whispers . Instead of boldly and defiantly assailing the radicals of Congress for the traitors they are , they suffer themselves to be occupied in parrying the blows aimed at their own heads . Wise leadership always contrives to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with such mendicant patriots as those of the Democratic party , who have sold themselves to the Abolition traitors . They first sold themselves , and next sold their country to get payment of the debt . 0 ! for one man-even one man in Congress-who would deal with all the guilty conspirators with such style and force of language as Grattan once used to the Hon. Mr. Flood in the House of Parliament , when he said : " Sir , your talents are not so great as your life is infamous . You were silent for years , and you were silent for money . // When affairs of consequence to the nation were debating , you might be seen passing these doors , like a guilty spirit , just waiting for the moment of putting the question that you might drop in and give your venal vote . Or , you might be seen hovering over the dome , like an ill-omened bird of night , with sepulchral notes , a cadaverous aspect , and a broken beak , ready to stoop and pounce upon your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people can not trust you ; the ministers can not trust you . You deal out the most impartial treachery to both . You tell the nation it is ruined by other men , while it is sold by you . I , therefore , tell you , in the face of your country , before all the world , and to your beard , you are not an honest man . " Now , contrast this language of one of the most cultivated members of the British Parliament , of his time , with the tame and insipid verbiage which is used against the abandoned traitors of Congress ! The truth , is that these conspirators and traitors have shown themselves much the best leaders . They have the adroitness to utter lies as though they were truths , while their opponents have the folly to utter truths as though they were lies . Instead of thundering out into the very teeth and beard of these men the epithets of traitors and conspirators , which alone can impress upon the people the real enormity of their crimes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposition . Bold , defiant , resolute and unyielding characters are met by a class of men who seem not more than half in earnest , and who appear to apologise for even the weak and foolish amount of opposition they venture to make . Under such leadership , no political party ever yet achieved or retained power , in the face of anything like a vigorous and efficient opposition . The secret of the success accomplished by the naturally unpopular Negro-Republican party is comprehended by the single word momentum-impetus , or force ; while that of their opposers is all embraced in the word inertia , inactivity , or rest . At the late election in the State of New York there were , we suppose , at the lowest estimate , thirty thousand bemocratic votes which were not polled . Out of the city of New York there was nothing deserving the name of a vigorous canvass ; and what there was of campaigning was rather a damage than a benefit to the Democratic party . The weak and ridiculous political dilution concocted at the so-called Conservative Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Democratic masses . The letters received at the office of THE OLD GUARD , from sterling Democrats from every section of the country , are proofs of the mortification and disgust which preyed upon the minds of the real friends of Democracy . Thousands did not go to the polls at all , and other thousands went reluctant , scourged and smarting with a sense of the weakness and folly of the whole style of the campaign . The speakers , for the most part , were men of second , if not third class intelligence , who treated the people to nothing but the political pap of the Philadelphia Convention . The documents used in the canvass of New York had not the name of " Democrat " upon the title pages . They were entitled " Campaign Documents of the National Union Party . " No. " 2 " of these Documents was composed of extracts from some of H. J. Raymond 's editorials in the Times , and of Beecher 's and Tyng 's letters . // January , No. " 3 " was made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of some extracts from the Times . iDid the managers of that campaign need to be told that all these names are intolerably offensive to every true Democrat and honest man ? The truth is , that the whole campaign was based upon the idea , not of arousing the old Democratic masses , but of dividing and converting Negro-Republicans . The amount of sagacity shown by the leaders of such a campaign is disclosed in the results of the election . The idea of converting a class of men who are governed solely by their passions and their habits , it would seem ought not to have entered into the imagination of any gentleman of ordinary intelligence . Such men never are canverted . Passion and hatred are beyond the reach of reason . A few weeks ago , we confess , that we were greatly mortified to perceive that the Demorcratic press was quite generally rejoicing at the idea of the conrersion of H. J. Raymond and Henry Ward Beecher ; but that delusion is already effectually broken , and the capital attempted to be made out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even after they had returned , like dogs to their vomit , their sayings constituted the chief matter of the Democratic campaign in the great State of New York ! Such leadership ! More defeats-nothing but defeats ! And yet these very leaders mourn piteously over the ruin of the Democratic party . Well , gentlemen , who has ruined it but yourselves ? But Democracy is neither ruined nor defeated . Neither ; because it has not been now , for a long time , in any canvass . The weak and watery thing which was everywhere ruined and defeated last fall was not Democracy , nor anything that bore a nearer resemblance to it than a mulatto does to a genuine white man . Democracy is purely white . But there was more or less negro blood in all these bastardly campaigns that figured in the prostituted name of Democracy last fall . For one , we do not accept these results as the defeat of Democracy , nor as any verdict whatever from the people on the subject of Democracy . Let us first have , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform of Democratic principles , before we really give up that the grand ideas of white supremacy and self-government are repudiated by the people of America . The first thing to get repudiated is incompetent leadership  --  the Negro-Republican leadership of the Democratic party ! This bastard Democracy , which was born of the war , must be repudiated before genuine Democracy can even try its strength in any campaign . We do not fear the results of a sharp and determined campaign over the whole country , of true Jeffersonian Democracy . All the citizens of the liJuited States counted , the Democrats are to-day in a majority of nearly a million . But it will be said that the people of the southern States are not to be counted . Why are they not ? Are they imaginary beings ? Have they not solid fibre , muscle and will ? Are they not a part of the physical strength of the whole land ? Every man standing in his bones and fibres in South Carolina , is *s veritably a part of the country as the man of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // 1867.1 THE ' PHILOSOPHY OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP . southern States , we say that they who are opposed to the Negro-Republican party are in a majority of almost a million . Who talks of the hopelessness of saving our country ? If we are without hope , it is because the minority of the whole people have pluck and leadership , and the majority have neither . On no other supposition can this weak and cowardlly cry of hopelessness have a shadow of justification . Oh , it is the feeble voice of a sick man which says all is lost . We know that for every man in the whole country who believes as Wendell Phillips teaches , there are two who believe as we teach . Then shall we , and this other man , give up to the treason of Phillips ? Not while the Almighty lends us breath do we propose to do so . We propose to double our diligence in writing , speaking , and in circulating THE OLD GUARD , as long as the conflict remains one of mind and opinion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of bone and sinew , we propose to continue our fight on that plain , until it shall be fairly tested whether the majority of all the people of all the States are to allow the minority to overthrow the white man 's government , established by our fathers , and fasten that of a mongrelized despotism upon ourselves and our childrens ' necks forever ! The only answer which can be made to this proposition is , that in the northern States the people who believe as we do are not prepared to act . Then prepare them . If the powerful old Democratic masses are not ready to take any step which shall be necessary to preserve the white man 's government established by Washington and Jefferson , it can not be hecause they are wanting in natural pluck , but because they are falsely taught and weakly led ; because they are counseled by shallow and venal politicians , instead of sagacious state 4-men and patriots. 0 , it is all b*-cause we do not stand by our own principles , nor by the braver men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is policy to hide at least half the truth ; and our shallow politicians do not perceive that such a policy abandons just half of all the ground to the enemy at the start . No people who are wrongly taught can be generally right in action . If , then , the people are not prepared to stand by their own liberty , or by that grand system of statesmanship and self-government which alone guarantees that liberty , the fault must be in the public press , and in those who claim the popular leadership . During all the bloody and criminal years of the war , the Democratic masses were , by every dictate of their judgment , and instinct of their soul , opposed to it . They both felt and knew it to be a crime , and every effort to obtain a Democratic victory on the basis of that war will fail . In the first place , no southern State can honestly support any party on such a basis ; nor can a majority of the masses of northern Democrats ever do so . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent in government . The war was as much in opposition to the Democratieprinciple of government as against the Democratic States . The only possible way open for the Democratic party to power , is through a perfect union of all the peoJ*le , North an ( l South , who believe in a Democratie white man 's government , on a com // January , mon platform of political ideas . And that platform can be no other thai , i the basis of the original union between the States . Every humiliating concession wrung from the southam people , and acquiesced in by the northern Democracy , is simply another fatal blow aimed at the bands of amity which alone can unite the North and South . An effort is made to completely destroy the old Conatitution under the plea of amending it . If the shades of our fathers were to return to the earth , they would hardly be able to recognize the work of their hands . And still the conspirators are marching on , because little intelligent or competent opposition is urged against them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride upon straws . Their party capital is in loyalty , and that of their opponents is a watery dilution of the same thing . What we want is an organized party of determined and unsparing patriots , who will not only prick this windy bubble of loyalty , but run the javalin through and through it . We want at an early day a convention of brave and sagacious men , representing all the States . Not a convention of shallow and venal politicians , but of farseeing , unflinching , and , as the term goes , disloyal patriots ! For loyalty , as applied to Negro-Republicans , is a traitor , and , as applied to Democrats , is a sneak . It is something which no good man would be guilty of , and which every wise man should be ashamed to own . In relation to liberty and self-government it is the same thing precisely in 1867 that it was in 1777 . One hundred years have made as little improvement in the moral character as in the manners of this hated spawn of despctism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fathers were in 1776 . A party to seize centralized despotic power by the throat , and to give it no quarter this side of eternity . A party which shall deal with those who propose to enforce taxation without representation , just as our patriotic forefathers did with a similar class of tyrants of yore . The issues before the people of this country , so far as the principles of government are involved , are the same now that they were in 1776 . The question then was , shall the Colonies be self-governing ? The question now is , shall the States be self-governing ? Let us have a party that says Y* ? s , and says it with such an emphasis and resolution as shall stir the blood of the people like the blast of a buglc.
