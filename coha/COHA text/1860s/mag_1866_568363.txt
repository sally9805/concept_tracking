NEW ENGLANDER . No . XCV . APRIL , 1866 . ARTICLE 1. - THE NEW ERA . Magnus seclorum nascitur ordo . Such is the impression even upon heathen minds , when society has been unhinged and overturned , when a state of seemingly permaneht order has succeeded the years of revolution . Such still more is the conviction of Christian minds when great principles of justice have triumphed in a contest which was forced upon a nation , when the question is finally settled whether flagrant wrong could be met in its proud and grasping course , and be overthrown while yet there is hope , or must sweep onward to utter national ruin . This Christian conviction , or hope-if it be only a hope ,  --  is an authorized one . It is built on a faith in a divine plan , and in a progress dependent , not on inevitable law , but on the counsels which originated the system and sent the Son of God into the world . It has thus a Scriptural foundation ; but more than that , the prophetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New , present the world to us as a battle field between good and evil , and the leading conflicts of the world as the steps forward , in preparation for the final establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven . The great events in this land since 1861 have been looked upon by Christian minds as the crisis which was to deter // mine our whole future history , as the crucible in which our national character was undergoing the purifying fires . Why was this view entertained ? Not because the war grew into such immense proportions , for great wars lasting longer and costing more blood , have had comparatively small results . The thirty years war of the seventeenth century in Germany , with its ten millions of lives sacrificed , and its multitude of villages desolated , did indeed bring about a compromise of hostile religions and baffled the Emperor 's hope that he might again lay the foundation of a truly imperial power ; but how little good after all was wrought by it for society , or for relieion ! So the seven years war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a million of lives , and ended in securing to Frederick the Great a province , of which he was by treaty master when the war began . And vast as were the French wars from the Revolution to the downfall of Napoleon , their effects were rather negative and destructive than positively salutary , and at the last , without solving the problem of society and government in France , they ended in a reaction which Europe still feels to its very core . Not the magnitude of our late struggle then , nor the principle of self-preservation with which it was waged at first , but the issues into which we were forced by divine providence in spite of ourselves-issues which at the opening of the war only a small part of the North would have accepted-constitute the importance of this war and inaugurate a new era in the history of the United States and of mankind . Most wars , if they do not end in loss or mutual exhaustion , gain but a few of the objects for which they were undertaken , but this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society and goveminent than we dared to hope . It began in self-preservation , it ended in the solution of a problem which no skill of ours could unravel beforehand , and in regard to which a devout mind can only cry " what hath God wrought ! * ' The new era is ushered in by the overthrow of slavery and of secession ,  --  the motive and the doctrine of the rebellion . The first , by the admission of all thinking persons had met its fate before the constitutional amendment rendering it an impossible thing wherever the law of the Union is acknowledged , and // before tie returning states had accepted its abolition as an inevitable fact . The other may be still sustained by the same arguments which multitudes at the South , and a few political " incurables " at the North , regarded five years ago as convincing . Possibly few of those who thought they were fighting and suffering for state rights will at once give up this favorite theory , which since the days of nullification in 1832 , when in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gaining by degrees a fearful power , and ha. * thoroughly controlled the Southern mind . And possibly in the future there may be movements in discontented states on a small scale , which will justify themselves on a similar view of the Federal Union . But after all , secession is extinct and can never be raised to life again . Its animating principle , the motive from which it drew its power , being itself given up , can never again quicken the dead corpse . Never again , it is probable , can a number of contiguous states adopt this dbctrine as a pretext for resistance to the general government . The immense love of the Union , which secession first revealed to us , will , as long as the memory of the years of strife shall live , or its history be preserved , prevent similar appeals to such an ultima ratio of disaffected states . The absurdity of secession , as a practical principle , needed only the experience of the Southern Confederacy to place it in the strongest light , for what security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment could not any one of the States break away from the covenant . And the right so to do they were obliged to admit , only qualifying it by the important addition that such new secession would be the cause of war . Why then had there not been a good cause of war on the part of the Northern States ? Thus secession is stript of its pretext , it has been conquered , it has been denounced , it is shown to be self-destructive , and a mean nan*e adopted to cover up a revolution . And , so , henceforth the old arguments . so often urged since the forming of the constitution , to the ef* fect that it secured its own permanence , that no power of a state or a cluster of states could dissolve it , that United States law is supreme everywhere ,  --  such arguments as these urged by Jackson , by Webster , and others without number , besides their old cogency , have gained a new and vast power from the // experience through which the country has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an inheritance of war through generations , a destruction of our highest hopes , a violation of the highest principle of our institutions . The new era resting on such foundations ,  --  on the abolition of slavery , on the rejection of the right of secession , which are not temporary , but permanent , which are not superficial but deep seated-must be permanent itself . There is no going backward . There is no evading the force of the new eveuits by any political folly , all powerful as political folly sometimes seems . Even those political moles , the demagogues , must discover , and are beginning to discover , that the old issues and the old compromises are a story of the past , that the precedents of the worst days of the republic can be applied successfuly no longer . Even those men of one idea , the conservatives of form rather than of spirit , must ere long see that the world moves . Even Southern ministers will by and by give up the argument from Noah 's curse on Ham , from ilagar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living may see the time when two or three gray headed men , too old to learn , too isolated to do harm , shall be pointed at as the last advocates of the peculiar doctrines of the " Church South . " There is then a natural exultation in every thinking mind , and a hopeful looking forward , when we take into account that a malady of the body politic that seemed incura1*le has been cured , that a stormy cape has been doubled without foundering or shipwreck . We have a right to rejoice and to rejoice in hope . We may hope on the same ground on which the Christian may hope , as he reviews his experience ,  --  that he who has begun a good work in us will carry it on , until the kingdom of Christ shall be completely established within our borders and through the world . Apd this hope may infuse strength into every endeavor to act worthily of the times ; it may and must put new power into all Christian movements , and may help us to become alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with hope , and new dangers as well as new possibilities of good attend on the beginning of a new era . The Israelites had a right to exult when they had crossed the Red Sea , because Jehovah had " triumphed glo // xiously , " and they had a right to hope that he would " bring them in and plant them in the mountain of his inheritance . " But as they wandered forty years in the wilderness for their sins , so the speed or the slowness of our course henceforth , before we can become that thoroughly Christian nation which can secure and retain prosperity , depend on our conduct , on being aware of our dangers , on perceiving what we can and ought to aim at , on having the spirit to go steadily forward in the right path . The great deliverance God has wrought for us gives us possibilities of good only , and furnishes us with encouragement , but no more supersedes our working , or relieves our anxieties , than the providential rescue of a ship from foundering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the voyage . Let us look at the dangers and the risks , at the powers and the duties which the new era brings with it . Let us do this , without entering into political questions any more than is necessary in order to take a full view of the situation as from some Christian watchtower of far looking thought . The first imagined danger we notice is suggested by the tremendous power exercised by the general government during the continuance of the war . The contrast especially between the imbecility of the former administration and the almost omnipresent efficiency of Mr. Lincoln 's government , controlling railroads , telegraphs , newspapers , arresting men for disloyal utterances imputed to them , superseding civil by martial law and stationing its troops and officers in uninvaded districts ,  --  such exhibitions of power , together with the impression produced by fleets and by armies so great as no American had ever dreamed of before , were enough to excite alarm lest the States should lose their old political standing , and a consolidated central power should introduce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a power as they admire thj* Napoleonic state , and if others would wish , for the sake of the conveniences of general intercourse , to entrust the central government with greater control over the avenues of communication and the currenc , y , the danger of ' the growth of centralism is dispersed by the facts which have occurred since the war came to an end . The States are as strong // as they ever were . The general government has gone back into the track of peace . The limits of the constitution remain . Only it has been demonstrated for the security of future times , for the confidence of faint hearted patriots , for the dismay of the rebellious , that a government seemingly weak and half asleep in peace can grow into a fearful power in war , while , when the danger is past , the habits of peace will easily resume their sway . The government thus may be compared to a goodnatured mastiff , hungry indeed and costly during the day , without seeming to pay for his keeping , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rousing the whole neighborhood by his barking and his onslaught upon the foes of society . More real and far greater danger is to be apprehended from the rehabilitation of the disaffected States , and the opening to disloyal men of the avenues of political power . ilere we must face an inevitable necessity-inevitable , because on the one hand the kind , unvindictive feelings of the triumphant North , and on the other , the prevalent doctrine of the status of the seceding States , will require that restoration with an energy not to be resisted or even long put off , and will require it probably before it can be set on foot with safety . It is impossible not to have the conviction that many of the representatives from the South will come to the legislative halls with the spirit of bitterness and disloyalty in their hearts , that they may lend themselves to disastrous compromises , that they may threaten and even attempt the repudiation of the national debt , that they may make demands for relief or compensation which will agitate and distract the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more keen sighted prophets than ourselves must tell . But to us it appears pretty certain that the evils such men can do must be done soon or not at all ; that five or ten years hence there will be no South , and no peculiarly Southern interests ; that society there , having settled down into its permanent forms and being Qngaged in the peaceful pursuits of industry , will need security and quiet development ; and that agitators , malicious or mercenary , will be regarded there , as well as here , by those who wield the influences of society , as its worst enemies . It is indeed quite possible that attempts will be made , into // which Son them politicians will enter with zeal , to overthrow the present system of protection to American* manufactures . May we be permitted to say that we should not look on such a movement with alarm , if it could carry its point by slow degrees without sacrificing the vast capital already invested in this interest , and if a considerable portion of the revenue , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles . The country , from the necessities of the war , is in a peculiar situation . Internal revenue , which was once a part of the democratic policy , is fastened upon us , while customs which waged battle against domestic taxation are equally a necessity . An honest nation is not likely to forego the power of raising the immense revenue required from both these sources . But at the same time we believe that the nation before many years will reject the protective system as false doctrine , and that the selfisliness of the manufacturers will have to come to terms with the interests of the vast body of consumers . But however this may be , it is not easy to discover any other sectional grounds of party divisions . We shall agree in the interpretation of the constitution , we shall feel ourselves bound together by common interests , and the minor differences of political doctrine will be just healthful and active enough to exercise a beneficial watchfulness over the proceedings of the party that happens to be predominant . What can there be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results have become matters of history ! On the other hand there will be everything to unite ; East and West will be bound together , West and South , North and South , by closer and vaster interests of business , by a greater assimilation of character and opinions , by more numerous and important avenues of communications ,  --  to say nothing of the dread of the evils of disunion on which four years of war have been reading a lesson never to be forgotten . Another great danger , the gravity of which will be felt during the next decade more than ever afterwards , arises from the burden of the vast national debt . Will the nation be honest ? Will demagogues , when the pressure for some temporary reason is heavier than usual , follow the example of the Mississippi demagogue , who is now a prisoner of state ? Will our popu // lar government in its measures express the conscientious convictions and enlightened views of the best , most industrious , and most heavily taxed classes , to whom the fulfillment of obligation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they pay the least , have the least principle and the least inclination to pay that little . The new era begins with a national debt of about one hundred dollars average charge on every man , woman , and child in the country , and the expenses of the general government , to say nothing of the vastly enlarged expenses of the States , will eat up not far from eight per cent . of the annual production . This debt can not be made a national blessing , as the pamphleteer of Mr. Jay Cook , " general subscription agent of the government loans , " tries to demonstrate ; on the contrary , although like every safe investment it may do good and be used advantageously , %it is the source of ramified evils , as all the political economists admit , and among them our Secretary of the Treasury of the Union . It is the burden taken on the shoulders of those who have not fallen in battle , the sacrifice necessary for our existence . Yet immense as the debt is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be paid olf not indeed as easily as some sanguine calculators have proved to their own satisfaction-for the taxes themselves present an obstacle to increase of production and to accumulation of capital , while the throes of a return to specie payments* must for a time injure the resources and facilities of the industrial classes ;  --  but still it can be discharged with greater ease than the debt of any other nation on the globe , Great Britain not excepted . This is owing plainly to the great rate of increase of population , the greater rate of increase of production , the immense undeveloped resources of the territory , the vast number of property holders , and the wonderful activity of the people  --  to which we may add as a special cause the stimulus and sense of power generated in the Northern States by the war . Owing to these causes , taxes , and consequent increase in the price of productions , which now make incomes not more than two-thirds or a half as valuable as they were five years ago , will be far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in twenty years will cease to be a burden worthy of complaint . And if it be overconfi // dent to expect that the nation will be out of debt in twenty years of peace , a cautious person will admit that the year 1900 may easily see every obligation of the government discharged . But will the nation do what it can thus do in a comparatively short term of years , and with no very great strain after a short period of exertion ? That there are persons in the North bad enough to advocate repudiation we admit , and many at the South would be glad to shake off taxes imposed for their subjugation . We believe , however , that this small minority of bad men will be powerless against the moral sense and the unmense interests of the great mass . All the trading class , all the bankers , all who live on their incomes , every ohe who feels that national honor is essential to the prosperity of all , all who have anything to lose and who shrink back from general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign bondholders must be in the end enforced by war-all these would cry out against a crime far worse than secession or rebellion . Its advocates , if any such should show themselves openly , would be disowned by every party . Still a few men without power or followers , only shameless enough to suggest such a measure as repudiation , might do vast mischief by impairing public credit ; they might ally themselves with unprincipled money-brokers , in order to create a fall in the stocks , and take a part in the gains of fraudulent speculations . These are the men to be denounced , and , if possible , to be punished . Butt supposing this danger to be passed by , the new era is to all appearance to commence an age of intense industrial activity . The United States have now reached that point in the progress of national industry , which the accumulations of capital are sufficient for almost any new and promising enterprise . In particular , the rapidity with which the resources of business have increased within the last one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census in this respect would excite only incredulity , if the money power of the country had not burst forth into view during the war like a hidden fire . Boastful as we are without ground , we knew not what great things our savings and our industry had laid up and could accomplish . The war has added the stimulus of a new feeling of power , and new avenues and hopes of gain are opening on // every side . It is indeed likely , as we have suggested , that , as ' the return of specie payments draws nigh , credit will become cautious , and borrowers be cramped ; but this can last for a few years only , and as for the ravages of war , a few seasons of profitable work will make them good ; for the largest part of the capital in an industrious country is the fruit of a few previous years of labor . This new state of things is as full of danger as it is of promise . The intense energy of business must lead to inequalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to command capital in large masses must lead to frequent speculation ; wealth will spend itself in luxury and pleasure ; . and the intellectual interests , as well as the intellectual tastes , of the nation will be apt to be overshadowed by the material . The probability of an age of great material prosperity , turning the aspirations of the hopeful and adventurous in the direction of gain , wealth , show , lavish expenditure , is not an omen of good for the culture , the morals , or the religion of the nation . A slow advance in wealth is better for these higher interests than a very rapid one . Simplicity of manners , contempt for show , moderate desires , the checks of necessary economy , are the true mine from which the ore of a refined national character is to be extracted . In pointing out this danger to the higher and spiritual welfare of the land , we are lead to the inquiry how the causes at work in the new era are likely to affect our civilization . The answer must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose what will be our true standing place and our highest duties , it may be useful , if not entirely worthy of reliance . And first , if the only effect of the last five years were to increase the intensity without changing some of the traits of the national character , we should be compelled to take a sombre view of the future . But we can hardly doubt that changes are at work which will show a better side of American life ; that we are in an education which will train the nation up to something higher than money-making , shallow knowledge , boastfulness , and self-conceit . We can only giv&amp; the most general outlines of these anticipated changes for the better . In regard to general education , twenty years of quiet , if granted to us , will initiate a system of common schools throughout all the Southem // States , and the training at the North will be both more thorough in the elements of knowledge , and will provide special instructions in all the leading arts . The publication of books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater ratio than the population ; the great extensive sales of standard works in late years can not be accounted fur merely by the fashion of possessing and exhibiting a library ; there must be a greater proportion of readers of good books , more extensively diffused cultivation of taste , more of that knowledge at least that floats over the surface of things , and gives a reputation of superior attainments , than could be found twenty years ago ; while the strides the West is taking in wealth and intelligence render it sure that the intellectual cravings of the newer States are increasing rapidly . Taste for the fine arts too is on the increase . It is true that the number of visitors to the galleries of Europe , the number of purchasers of statuary and painting prove little , since to many persons objects of art are part of the show of life , like a fine house or a fine coach , but we can not help believing that there is a refinement and a spread of taste both in these arts and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into glare and showy imitation ; nor have these vices become obselete in the plans for public edifices any more than for private , yet there does seem to be a higher conception of what a building should be , nor are even the committees for erecting churches in rural parishes content with copying those deformities which were once scattered over the land . From all that has been said on this point of ' general intelligence and taste , it is evident that they have been slowly growing for years ; but the new era , it is probable , with its wealth , its spread of education , its stimulus , will much accelerate the growth . Here we wish to call attention to one point in particular-to the spread of science and of those sciences which have the most to do with the national prosperity of the country . There is no doubt that these will be fostered for practical reasons , and even the avenues of gain that are open to men of scientific training will invite many into this field . Whether natural science will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // discipline , so necessary for soundness of mind , for breadth and ' justness of views , for a healthy faith , be disturbed , may well be a matter of apprehension . Of this we may have occasion to speak in another place . We only add here that it is of the highest importance for education , for true refinement , for genuine civilization , that the sciences which have to do with material phenomena do not usurp the place which belongs to the more spiritual sciences ; that the tangible and visible do not take the place of the immaterial ; that the knowledge of things does not claim precedence of the quickening forces of nobler truth . Indeed , as has been hinted , the new era will have to guard against one of the leading tendencies of the times-that of overvaluing the outward world . Our conquests are over the outward world , our discipline is likely to run more and more into this direction ; onr money , accumulated by men incapable to a great extent of intellectual enjoyment , seeks outward gratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in culture , will reign at the cost of religion , morals , and sound taste , unless the spiritual powers can continue and even increase their control over society . And here we approach the most momentous of the inquiries connected with the new era , namely , what part religion is called to act ; what is to be in the coming years her chief line of effort . We will consider the aspects of the times in their relations to religious faith , and then in relation to religious practice . The two great enemies of Christian faith in modern times are the materialistic and the pantheistic theories of the world In the hands of these foes , the natural sciences , and history itself , with criticism as its ally , are made to turn their guns against revelation . In our country , hitherto , the naturalists have ) to a considerable extent , been sincere believers in Christ , and even devout men , so that as we run over in thought the highest names in this field , we scarcely meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , too , nearly all the learning and the talent is with the theologians who defend both supernaturalism and inspiration ; those who have been trained in Germany , those who have studied the controversies there // 191 waged of late years , on the origin of the Gospel , and on the nature of the Old Testament , are , almost without exception , standing on the old ground , to which Germany herself is coming back-although all of them , it is probable , can not exactly subscribe to the received views of inspiration . This is a fact full of encouragement ; our scholars have drawn their final discipline from the land of rationalism and pantheism , without being essentially warped from the faith of their fathers . There are now among us accomplished theologians-not indeed in any great numbers , but far outnumbering the partisans of a contrary tendency-ready to defend the faith , familiar with the strongest arguments forged at Tilbingen , who have perhaps conquered doubt themselves by honest research and devout prayer , and who can be helpful guides of younger minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unbelief or scepticism has a secure foothold in the country . Theodore Parker seems to have vacillated between deism and pantheism , and was not the highest authority in exegetical investigations . Yet his influence has been large on the destructive side , aided as it was by the estimable points of his mind and character . More noticeable still are the intangible shapes of doubt which fill the air , so to speak , and betray a fashion of free-thinking on the part of the superficial and the ill-informed . You will see these somewhat vague symptons in several descriptions of men , in the honest young mind that judges the Bible by the rules of a verbal inspiration , and finds itself surrounded by difficulties ; in the newspaper editor or his correspondent from abroad , or the contributor to a popular magazine , who , with very little knowledge of the points at issue , sympathizes with unbelief and covertly expresses his sympathy ; in the popular lecturer , who , without intending to publish his rejection of the Scriptures , lays down principles that must lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into open infidelity ; in the student of natural science , who is unable or indisposed to refute the objections which his studies have brought before his eyes . A great part of this doubt , at present , if not exactly honest doubt , is not inclined to cavil or to sneer . It rather half laments its own uncomfortable position , and sighs perhaps for the unquestioning faith of the Christian . It is moreover // coupled with more or less of admiration for the system of the Gospel and for the character of Christ ; and it is so far from being self-indulgent or tending towards voluptuousness , that many who are its victims burn with indign ation against public wrong , and are among the most jealous and benevolent defenders of the oppressed . Still it is to a great extent superficial , caught by contact with books that skim over the surface of things , and more a sort of fashion than a morbid spirit of scepticism . That such a turn of free-thought , if it should increase and descend among the more uneducated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to religion , can scarcely be questioned ; and it certainly would then become , if unresisted , a most alarming foe of our faith , as well as throw a dark shade on the future welfare of the land . We must expect then ere long to have in this land a repetition of the same contest that has been waged in Germany during the last three-quarters of a century , and is now in progress in England-which , in fact , surprised the defenders of the faith there while they were asleep , and before they were familiar with the new weapons of controversy . In Germany , the contest has so far gone through its phases , that we can now look to a triumph of Christian believers on the fields of history and of criticism . In England , the objections of natural science , the difficulties drawn from fixed laws of nature , in short the pantheistic or atheistic tone of thinking appears in the foreground , and the struggle is less between scholars , as is the case in the land of scholars , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With us , probably , the same characteristics of the controversy will present themselves to view , as in the Englishspeaking land across the sea . But come the contest assuredly will , and Christian divines , Christian laymen of intelligence , ought to be prepared for it . if it is to be a serious contest between honest doubters and confirmed believers , no evil except in individual cases will grow out of it . Some men 's hearts will " fail for fear , and for looking after those things which shall come upon the earth ; " but the result will be to establish the Kingdom of the Son of Man on a firmer basis . But to attain this result , preparation must be necessary . The student of Scripture , history , and criticism , the student of general history // and civilization , the student of natural science , must be ready to meet the influences of unbdief which may be imported , and those assaults which may arise on our own soil . It ; however , the unbelief is to circulate through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it among large numbers of the German emigrants , if it is to be flippant , vnlgar , malignant , the cure here lies not so much in defending Christianity , as in getting a closer access to the class affected by the disease , and applying a more effectual remedy than heretofore . The Gospel itself brought home to its despisers , in love and power , must be its own witness . And here we are brought to the benevolent efforts which the new era imposes on the representatives of the Christian faitha topic which occupies many minds , which appears to all Christians full of importance , and which yet will not stand in the clearest light , until time and experiment disclose the avenues of successful effort . We can add little by what we have to say to what benevolent persons have thought and said already , yet we offer a few suggestions . First of all , it is evident that the necessities of our own land will impose on us a greater relative burden than we ever before felt ourselves called upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy for Christ a country which is to take an amazing start iii wealth , power , and vigor , which is to grow faster than ever within the next generation , to form within this period its character and to work out its destiny . The power of action , the work to be done , are offered to Christian people in such a measure as almost to overwhelm and confuse . To the duties of the war succeed the duties of entering every new field that the end of the war has opened . To do the new without neglecting the old offices of benevolence , to make equal progress with the swift advances of the country , lest Christianity come too late and find its work the harder , to leaven all parts of the land with the leaven of truth , to spread missions , churches , institutions of Christian learning , over a vastly larger space , to purify the greater centres of trade and wealth meanwhile at home-these are problems of most frightful magnitude , and which a people of less hope and vigor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war so immense was carried ' through in four years , what need aifright us ! Among the new tasks of great difficulty , is the attempt to protect , elevate , and enlighten those to whom emancipation has opened the door of citizenship . Here we abstain from all political considerations , as far as possible . We could have wished that suffrage could be given them on the same terms on which white men enjoy it-not as believers either in the right or the expediency of universal suffrage , but as hoping that a contest of races would thus be prevented , and a support for their newly acquired rights be secured . Yet the question is a practical one , and whether it shall be urged , depends on considerations such as these : Can it be forced on the returning States ? Or , if forced as the price of their return , will it give the blacks any real protection among embittered whites , who look down on them as their inferiors ? And will the attempt not prove abortive through the spirit which the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measures of the best part of the people ? Ere these words shall have come before the eyes of our readers , probably the policy of the country will be settled . But however it shall be settled , those who liberated the blacks are greatly responsible for their future welfare-whether they shall have the avenues of knowlege open to them , whether they shall have an enthusiastic religion of feeling without morality , taught by most incompetent guides of their own , or a religion more like the thoughtful Gospel of Christ , whether they shall be free without using their liberty as a cloak of maliciousness . And in addition to these things , they must be looked after in their civil rights , and the laws that are to be made for their protection be faithfully applied , as far as possible : they must be shielded from dishonest state legislation , owning them to be free and treating them as slaves ; they must be kept in quiet and peace , lest they give advantage to the worst part of society to harass them . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be managed otherwise than on the floor of Congress and through the public press , we undertake not to say . But such protection is so necessary for their future elevation and rehgious welfare , that the movements of the benevolent will in great measure fail without it- // 1866 . The Jfew Era. 195 not to say that this is demanded by the safety of the land from the insurrections of a caste made free , and yet left a prey to the malevolent . Another task , almost as new , and quite as imperative if it shall prove practicable , is the attempt to redeem the Southern States from the results of former social evils . We say , if it c/tall prove practicalie , for it is possible that an obstinate , ineradicable pride and hatred may close up a large part of the South to the efforts of Northern Christians , and above all of New Englanders . Our own prevailing opinion is , that the syinptons of such ill feeling are strongest now , and will gradually subside . We believe that the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of places of influence , the presence of emigrants with their thrift and capital , adding new value to land and reviving trade , the institution here and there of schools and seminaries of learning by benevolent Northerners , in order to repair the destructions of ' war , gradually returning prosperity , the retirement of the most disaffected , the participation of the South again in the national councils , according to their fair share of public offices-that these and like influences will *often asperities of feeling , will make men cease to ask where their neighbor was born , and to measure friends and foes by difference of latitude . The prospect is , that a very extensive emigration from the North and from Germany will pursue its silent course in the years to come , and will be one of the chief mediating and uniting powers between the parts of the country . It is , indeed , by no means certain that the emigration will always be of the best sort , or will not receive a Southern tone of feeling , from the prevalent state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they are large landholders , they will carry with them more sympathy for the poor whites than men of the same class in those States have felt in times past , and that , if they are small landholders , they will demand for themselves the same privileges of education which they left in their places of nativity , and will generally not be content without the blessings of a thoughtful , earnest relio*ion And we have the strongest hopes that the b intelligent men of the South , as they cast their eyes over the new state of things , will feel that there is but one way of bring VOL XXV. 14 // ing the country formerly burnt over by slavery to a level of intelligence , wealth , power , quiet , and morality with the rest of the Union , the way , namely , of planting schools in every district , of reviving and improving the colleges , of founding churches , of giving aid to industry , especially to a greater division of employments in every practicable way . Blessings go with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this noble work ! let them urge it forward , and not be ashamed of any offered aid ! It is possible in the course of time so to change the aspect of things , that the war , as they shall look upon it , will seem a messenger of God , bringing with temporary chastisement ultimate salvation . It is possible that years hence , the best , the richest part of the United States will be those which the war has most impoverished ; that they who have been chastised most will be blest most ; that the States south of the Potomac will be the brightest stars in our constellation . The present religions condition of the South under their old ministers , who have been most active in preaching secession , and who still with a warped conscience persist in their opinions , must be confessed to be none of the most hopeful . Who will deny that there are sincerely Christian men among these ministers ? And yet these are the bitterest of their class , the most persistent , the most unreasonable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Southern Christians be treated ? Not as one church has already treated them , as if to gain proselytes and to extend its borders on the easiest terms , by saying nothing of the past , by requiring no recantation of schism or rebellion . That may be a way of thriving after a worldly sort , but it surely indicates a low tone of feeling in those who can thus forgive without acknowledgment of wrong , and restore without doing honor to the great principles of righteousness . And what is it likely that these Southern Christians will do ? We have already expressed the opinion that the force of things will drive them from the position of a secession church ; they will not in their various schisms repeat the follies of the English Jacobites , who , with more ground for separation , dragged out a feeble existence until they passed into utter oblivion , and their last bishop , if we remember aright , died a country practitioner of medicine . The // probability is that some compromise will be effected , depending for its stringency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which they were divorced . Nor is it improbable that the two Methodist bodies , whose separation was earlier , will be again united . But what is the chance of gaining a foothold in the South for other denominations , which were unrepresented there before the war ? Can the system of polity advocated in this Journal hope to prosper there ? An affirmative answer can not be given with any assurance . Prcsent appearances are against it . As long as settlers and merchants from the North find themselves in an uncomfortable position in that quarter of the country , wrath and distrust will be cirnnently called forth by churches after a New England pattern ; and yet , in the large towns and wherever compact settlements of Northern men shall be found , they may be introduced with success . This , however , must be a work of slow degrees , rendered slower and more uncertain by the small number of the emigrants in most of their settlements , by the fact that they will for the most part find kindred denominations to a degree established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that more of them will be actuated by mere love of gain than is the case with the emigrants to the West . Turning from this uncertain and somewhat sad prospect to the boundless West , that great section of our country , which poured forth its tide of armed men for the safety of the Union , we find there a more cheering view . First of all , we can not but hope that the war has there peculiarly called forth a certain nobility of character , a generous enthusiasm , which may be turned in the direction of the Kingdom of Christ . Next , there is a real and rapid growth of religious power in that quarter , especially among the Congregationalists . Then the pecuniary condition is far stronger than it has been . The States to the east of the Mississippi are able to help the Atlantic States in sending knowledge and religion beyond that " flood , " through all the newly formed States and mining territories to the Pacific coast . This vast field is open to us in the Providence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmount . Obstacles indeed of a formidable character present themselves , such as pertain to every sparse settlement , and such // especially as belong to the general recklessness and worthlessness of miners ; but it is a comfort to think that these mining colonies put on their worst aspect first , that every blow struck among them by Christian wisdom tells something for the Kingdom of Christ . This immense field then is a hopeful one . The old West is destined to make rapid strides in knowledge and religion : the new West , destitute as it is , will not reject the laborer for Christ , but rather invite him to work in all freedom and confidence . This is the principal sphere for the East and for the West  --  the East still urging forward that work in the nearer West which they long ago begun  --  the West aiding the East to penetrate into the regions beyond , which have lately become the white man 's home . The new era then seems to promise hard work , a struggle greater than any to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must not neglect our old enterprises in foreign lands , for foreign missions have been the noblest fruit of American Christianity ; but we must add to it another work that has played a second part hitherto , but is now become more vital than all others . And we must set about this new work not in the spirit of proselytism , not to spread Congregationalisin for instance , but to spread the knowledge of Christ . Congregationalism has been eminently unsectarian in times past , almost carelessly so ; it has been content to sow for others to reap ; it has rejoiced if others have builded on its foundation ; it has supplied the leaven for others to take and put into their separate baking troughs . It is not required to do so much as this , although this has been its preeminent and exclusive glory . Its motto has been " sic yes non VObis m*ellificatis apes . " But it will be an evil day when it shall change its tone entirely . Let it provide for its own , and especially for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the arena of sectarian strife with jure divine claims , and a competition like that of merchants . Let it keep the Kingdom of God in its eye , as it has done in times past , and all men will honor it , whose honor is worth having . In closing these thoughts on the dangers and duties of the new era , we revert to the great danger and the great source of hope . The great danger , beyond all others most to be dreaded , // is that from intense worldliness . The prosperity of the church is to be fearfully tried by the prosperity of all the gainful pursuits of life . Ostentation , expensiveness , self-indulgence , false estimates of life , with false tastes and the loss of simplicity of life , and their consequences , are more dangerous enemies to religion than secession and war . New York can do more harm in the new era than slaveholding did in that which passed away . And the worst of it is , that the evil influences of unbounded prosperity are insidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , and heavenly realities kept further off . Shall we fall into or resist this evil influence ? Shall we need great disasters to bring us back to our bearings ? Who can prophesy what is to be the destiny of our land ? But faith is better than prophecy . All the old arguments that God meant something great for us , and through us for himself-the seclusion of this virgin soil and this boundless continent , the character of the first settlers , the habits of self-government preparing for a broader freedom , the great revivals , the extinction of the French power that confined the colonies as within a wall of iron , the success of the Revolution , the immense growth of religion and knowledge-all these are eclipsed by what God hath wrought to introduce this new era . When our sins and the falseness of the government to its trust portended national decay , He punished , and in punishing saved us ; He separated , and in separating united us ; He called forth our energies ; He made the slave-power its own executioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may draw dark clouds around us again , but we will trust Him the more , for we see more of Hun in our recent history . And as we believe that He has a progressive plan , we will enter into the work of the NEW ERA with faith and hope .
