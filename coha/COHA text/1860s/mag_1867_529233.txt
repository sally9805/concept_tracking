ARTICLE IV. - HERBERT SPENCER 'S PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY . Principles of Psychology . By HERBERT SPENCER . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1873. 2 vols . THIS work was first published in 1855 . It has since been revised and greatly extended , and now appears as the psychological part of Mr. Spencer 's philosophical series . Before proceeding to its direct examination , however , we wish to make some preliminary remarks about the Spencerian doctrine of evolution . It is hardly necessary to point out that some forms of the doctrine of evolution are perfectly compatible with Theism . The Theist of the last century conceived of creation as the work of a moment The Creator spake , and it was done ; He commanded , and it stood fast . In the twinkling of an eye , as the lightning flashes out of the dark night , so the worlds were " won from the void and formless infinite , " and each one started on its way , perfect after its kind . But it is claimed that the long times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher forms which these sciences seem to teach , have thrown doubt upon this conception . It is said that the law which holds for all present development is true of creation also : first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear . It was while darkness yet hung over the face of the deep that the Spirit of God brooded over nature , to bring forth the living from the lifeless . It was while yet the earth was without form and void that the Divine Sower went forth to sow . There , upon that waste theater of mist , were sown the seeds of life and mind . They were freighted with the destinies of individuals , and species , and races , for all the ages to come . In them was involved all that has since been evolved . They made for themselves form , and laid under contribution all the forces of nature , until earth , and air , and sea , swarmed with the most varied and complex existence . Such a doctrine // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has many elements of peculiar sublimity and grandeur . But there is another form of the evolution theory . The thorough-going evolutionist , availing himself of the doctrine of the unity of the forces , paces with firm step through the ammal and vegetable kingdoms , and then brings all things home to the parentage of matter and force . He drives back beyond all life , beyond all form , beyond even the present material elements , back to the raw beginnings of matter and force . At that distant point there are no such myths as life and mind : these are unimaginable ages down the future . There is nothing but little lumps of good , hard matter . These are the fountain head of existence , and need but to be left alone long enough to transform chaos into creation . This is what purports to be the scientific book of Genesis . This is evolution as it is held by the " New School ' * of philosophy , of which Mr. Spencer is one of the chief apostles . ft may be well just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Philosophy attempts to solve . It often happens that a few vague and general analogies are allowed to blind the reason to the infinite complexity of the problem , and it may even be questioned whether many of the evolutionists themselves properly appreciate the task they have to perform . Their proposition in plain words is this : all things have come by a rigid mechanical sequence from the condensation of that primeval mist . Not merely the forms of matter , but life , and mind , and their various manifestations , have all been evolved by necessary physical causation . Men think that thought and motion have nothing in common with the buzzing of atoms , but , in truth , these little lumps need only to be properly combined to become self-conscious , and think , and feel , and hope , and aspire . If there had been a spectator who could have detected the position of the forces in that nebulous mass , he could by the parallelogram of forces have reasoned down through orbital rings to solid globes , to continents and seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Homer and the Iliad , to Newton and the Principia , to Milton and the Paradise Lost , to Shakespeare and his plays . By simple deductive reasoning , as the engineer traces beforehand the track of a ball , so that spectator // could have foreseen all our art , our science , our civilization , and could have prophesied all that is yet to come . He could have foretold all the folly , and suffering , and sin of men . There is not a mote that trembles in the sunbeam , nor a leaf that is driven in the wind , whose existence , and whose exact position , he could not have foretold . The problem would have been a complex one , to be sure , but it would have been a purely mechanical one . There is not a thought that ever has toiled or that ever shall toil in a human brain , there is not an ache that has ever wrung a human heart , that was not potentially there . Our longings for knowledge were there ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but return to their early home . Mr. Spencer , and his philosophy , and the criticisms upon it , were there . Whatever we can conceive that is complex , or accidental , or free , was there . Those dancing atoms whirled and whirled until they became self-conscious , and thought , and reflected , and wrote their own autobiography in the philosophy of Mr. Spencer . We are not misrepresenting the theory . Prof. Tyndall says of it : " Strip it naked and you stand face to face with the notion that not only the more ignoble forms of animalcular or animal life , not alone the nobler forms of the horse and the lion , not alone the exquisite and wonderful mechanism of the human body , but that the human mind itself-emotion , intellect , will , and all their phenomena-were once latent in a fiery cloud . " ( Frag . Science , p. 159 . ) Tn this evolution there has been no guiding mind . Mr. Spencer demands no purpose , but only a power . The aim of his philosophy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless . He is impatient of the doctrine which makes creation the work of wisdom , and calls it the " carpenter theory . " If we consider the function of reproduction , it would seem that here is overwhelming evidence of a purpose to preserve the species ; but we are not allowed to think so on pain of being charged with " fetishism . " If we think of the eye or ear as it forms in the womb , it would seem the power at work must understand the laws of optics and acoustics , to form these organs in such exact and complex accordance with them . It would seem , too , that these organs , thus forming before they are needed , indicate a knowledge of // future needs , and a purpose of supplying them ; but this belieg too , lies under the ban of fetishism . The eyes are used to see with , but they were not made for that purpose . The ears hear , but they were not designed for hearing . The organs of reproduction serve to perpetuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Everything , no matter how complex in its adaptations , exhibits the working of a power ; nothing represents the fulfillment of a purpose . " The transformation of an indefinite incoherent homogeneity into a definite coherent heterogeneity , which goes on everywhere until it brings about a reverse transformation , is consequent upon certain simple laws of force . " ( First Prin. , p. 495 . ) Such is the theory . To many it will seem to break down from pure excess of absurdity . W* pretend not to decide ; but we insist that every one who is fond of talking magniloquently about evolution , should know precisely what he has to prove . Yet , strange as it may seem , Mr. Spencer denies that his system is atheistic . The ground of the denial is this ; he believes in an unknowable . But upon inquiry this unknowable proves to be merely the substance which underlies phenomena . It has neither sense nor intelligence nor wilL To attribute these to it is a species of fetishism . Yet Mr. Spencer thinks that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will not quarrel about names . That which we know as matter is declared to be the cause of all things . This matter , working according to mechanical laws , without intelligence or purpose , has transformed chaos into creation . This is the doctrine , and this is essential atheism . Mr. Spencer farther denies that his system is materialistic . The New Philosophy plumes itself upon rising above the contest between spiritualist and materialist , and pronounces the question to be a strife of words . The claim is the emptiest pretense . " That no idea or feeling arises save as a result of some physical force expended in producing it , is fast becoming a common place of science ; and whoever duly weighs the evidence will see that nothing but an overwhelming bias in favor of a preconceived theory can explain its non-acceptance. * , ( First Prin. , p. 280 . ) That mental force is but transformed physical force , is the primary assumption . The mind itself is // defined as a " series of states of consciousness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transformed nerve-current . Now note the result . Without a nervous system there can be no nerve-currents , and without nerve-currents there can be no states of consciousness , and without states of consciousness there can be no mind . The mind comes into existence with the organism , and both perish together . During its existence it is absolutely determined by external conditions , for Mr. Spencer denies in the most explicit terms that the soul can be free , on the ground that , if it is , the fact would be destructive to his theory . Now it is rather instructive after such teaching as this to be told that " the explanations here given are no more materialistic than they are spiritualistic " ( F. P. , p. 502 ) ; and the reason why is , " We can think of matter only in terms of mind . " But since matter is not affected by our thoughts , and since matter and force have produced mind , we fail to see how this remark helps him . It is evident , however , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , that he reafly thinks that they save his system from materialism . Yet if a system which makes the soul a product of organized matter , which must of course perish with the organism , is not materialistic , it would be hard to say what materialism is . Indeed , this is the ( loctrine which many of the leaders of the New Philosophy openly avow , whether from keener logical perception , or from greater candor , we do not decide . One more general criticism must be offered before proceedin0 to the volumes in hand . Every system of evolution which is not guided by intelligence , is merely a new edition of the time-honored theory of chance . There seems to be a very general impression among reasoners on this subject that besides intelligence and chance a third something may be found to which the universe may be referred . This third something is law . The modern atheist would be ashamed to talk of chance in the fashion of the earlier sceptics . On the contrary , he repudiates their views with indignation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is but a new name for the old idol ; it does , indeed , serve to give an aspect of freshness to the threadbare arguments of his sect , but it in no wise alters the underlying philosophy . To say that all things have been evolved by law , while denying that anything has been done for a purpose , has , to be sure , a // more respectable appearance than the old assertion that all things have happened to be as they are ; but the two statements differ only in appearance . For since to-day is everywhere determined by yesterday , we find that all days were determined by that first day . Now before - this philosophy can assume to be an explanation at all , it must account for that first day . The answer would probably be that that day needs no explanation . Simple , homogeneous matter bears no marks of origination , and may be eternal . Now if all things can be traced back to this , a sufficient account has been given ; and we need go no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no organization where we can not trace it . But Prof. Tyndall says : " It can not be too distinctly borne in mind that between the microscopic limit and the true molecular limit there is room for infinite permutations and combina. tions . It is in this region that the poles of the atoms are arranged , that tendency is given to their powers , so that when these poles and powers have free action , and proper stimulus in a suitable environment , they determine first the germ and afterward the complete organism . The first marshalling of the atoms , on which all subsequent action depends , baffles a keener power than that of the microscope . Through pure excess of complexity , and long before observation can have any voice in the matter , the most highly-trained intellect , the most refined and disciplined imagination , retires in bewilderment from the contemplation of the problem . We are struck dumb by an astonishment which no microscope can relieve , doubting not only the power of our instrument , but even whether we ourselves possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate structural energies of nature . " ( Frag . Science , p. 153 . ) Prof. Tyndall here calls attention to a fact which biologists and physiologists constantly overlook  --  the almost infinite complexity of what the microscope sees as simple . Nothing is more common than to hear physiologists , Mr. Spencer among the rest , speaking of germs as perfectly homogeneous because the microscope detects no trace of organization , and indeed their reasoning derives much of its plausibility from this utterly false assumption . If the complex animal can be developed from the homogeneous germ , it is not incredible that the complexity of creation should be derived from the // homogeneous nebula . But if what Prof Tyndall has told us is true , we see that the homogeneity of the nebula was only in seeming . Below the limits of everything but mental vision , there were structural energies of such complexity that w e must question whether we have the mental elements which will enable us to grapple with them . lit was in that realm , inaccessible to every thing but mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again we ask , who determined that first day ? The simplicity on which the atheist relied has gone . Here is the most complex play of hidden forces . What determines their action ? Who gave the atoms their primal impulse ? Who so determined their tendencies that all the wonders of life should follow ? Who guided these structural energies so that they hit upon the laws of sound and light ? Who so controlled them that they should learn how to foresee the future , and pro . vide for time to come ? We must remember that , if this evolution doctrine be true , every thing which exists now existed in its causes then . That nebulous time manifested no less intelligence and purpose than the present does . The only difference is that what was implicit then has become explicit now . But the causes were then in exact and complex adjustment , which should give birth to to-day . These are the fundamental assumptions of the theory itself No matter how far back we go ; if we assume that that nebula was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born from an antecedent nebula , still , at the earliest time , we find the exact and complex adjustment of powers and tendencies which needs only time to evolve all that is . B*it what produced that first adjustment ? Nothing is explained until that is accounted for . There is no &amp; priori necessity for such an adjustment ; there is rather the strongest improbability against it . Either that first balancing of powers and tendencies and interactions was the work of wisdom , or it was the work of chance ; and in that case all that has sprung from it was the work of chance also . Mr. Spencer denies that intelligence has had anything to do with evolution ; it follows , then , in spite of all the empty vaporing about law , that chance is the architect of the universe . Evolution under the guidance of wisdom is a sublime doctrine ; but evolution without such guidance is the old doctrine of chance over again . We have little sympathy with this mechanical way of looking at creation , and our faith // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning upon that doctrine , there is no middle ground between chance and intelligence . When we get to the naked form of Mr. Spencer s teaching it is simply this : a cloud of atoms , if shaken together long enough , will hit upon living forms ; will provide eyes and ears , and adapt them to light and sound ; will furnish all the internal organs , and balance their several functions ; will become self-conscious , and capable of thought and emotion . The New Philosophy is not so new after all , for , except in terminology , this is the exact doctrine which Lucretius and iDemocritus taught two thousand years ago . The only thing which gives the new heresy greater plausibility than the old , is the greater extension of the universe in time . Who knows what might happen in eternity ? To be sure , we do not find the atoms playing any such tricks to-day , but time works wonders ; and who can say what might not have happened back there in the dark ? And so the evolutionist becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals , and speaks of " limitless ages " and " untold millions of years " as if time could certainly correlate with intelligence . Because the work of intelligence is not stolen outright but by piecemeal , and because the robbery has been scattered over ages , the theft has been allowed to escape notice . It is the error of the old mythology over again . The evolutionist gets the world upon the back of the tortoise , and then , either he forgets to supply any footing for the tortoise , or else his faith becomes sufficiently robust to venture to stand alone . Let it never be forgotten that the problem of atheism is now , as it always has been , a contest of chance against intelligence . We have lingered thus long upon the threshold of our discussion in order to show the true nature of the Spencerian doctrine of evolution . Whatever Mr. Spencer 's own views may be , the doctrine of his books is fatalism , materialism , atheism . We do not use these words as terms of opprobrium at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occurred to us , too , as Mr. Spencer is often lauded as a great apostle of progress , it would be well to know precisely the kind of progress of which he is an apostle . He knows no personal God and no immortal soul . There is no love or sympathy in the heavens above and there is no life to come . // However , it is not for the critic to get frightened at results , but to ask for the credentials of the doctrine . It does not follow that this theory is false because it is materialistic or atheistic . If the reasoning is just , and the assumptions are well founded ; then , let the doctrine be accepted with all its dreadful consequences . But if the reasoning be contradictory , and the assumptions false and absurd ; then , let the doctrine perish . This is the question we have now to consider . It is obvious that this theory will find its greatest difficulties in accounting for the evolution of mind . For , not to mention the difficulty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms , before this doctrine can be proved , the validity of logical laws , and the trustworthiness of all our mental processes , must be established . Otherwise the results reached by reasoning will be untrustworthy ; and all science and evolution must disappear together . We expect to find upon a psychological examination that the metaphysical data of all reasoning transcend the teaching of experience . In that case the evolutionist can take his choice ; either he can admit their validity , which will prove fatal to his system , since it will put mind outside of his theory ; or he can deny their validity , which will be to commit intellectual suicide . In examining the testimony , let us bear in mind the points which must be proved : 1st , that the physical forces and sensation correlate ; 2d , that thought is only transformed sensation ; 3d , that the intuitions of reason , while valid for all space and tin*ie , are the product of experience ; and 4th , that the soul has no self-determining power . If any of these points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly in its application to mind . In applying his theory to the explanation of mental evolution , Mr : Spencer finds a philosophy ready-made to his hand . The experience philosophy has sought for ages to prove that all that is in the mind has been derived from sensation . Beginning with sensations , it aims to show , by combining these , how all the laws of thinking and all our apparently simple beliefs have been generated . The law of causation , the principles of formal logic , the reality of an external world , and the moral postulates of conscience , are only elaborated and refined sensations . The astronomer who accepts the nebular theory // seeks to show how the original mist must condense and build up solid globes with continents and seas . So the experience . philosophy seeks to show how sensations condense and differentiate and integrate until the solid framework of mind is built up . There is , indeed , much in the mind at present that seems independent of experience , as the belief in logical axioms , or in causation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parentage , and , worst of all , assume to lord it over experience itself ' . Such filial impiety deserves severe rebuke ; and the experience-philosopher proceeds to reduce these pretenders to becoming humility by showing them the baseness of their birth . The fragrance and beauty of a flower are but transformations of the mould at its root ; so all that seems independent or noble in the mind is but transformed pains and pleasures . The mind has no powers of its own , but gains them from without , and its laws are all enacted for it by experience . Whatever seems independent of this source is an imposter , whose claims must be met with becoming scorn . This philosophy is adopted by Mr. Spencer without any important modifications as illustrating the doctrine of evolution . By means of the correlation of the forces , he hooks the beginnings of mind to the physical world , and the experience-philosophy explains mental evolution . In the hands of all its defenders this philosophy has always taken an insane delight in knocking out its own brains ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it performing this interesting feat with unusual gusto under the direction of Mr. Spencer . All knowledge is subjective and begins in the mind itself . All that we know is known in consciousness , and whatever can not report itself there , must remain forever unknown . All that is known of the world without us is known only through modifications of consciousness ; and all that we know of the mental operations of others , is known only by assimilating them to our own . For this reason we must dissent from the assumption which underlies Mr. Spencer 's work , that mind can be understood only by observing its evolution in the lower forms of life . On the contrary , biological and physiological studies can of themselves throw no light whatever upon the nature or the evolution of mind . Even if we should grant to // the mind perfect perceptive powers , so that it could trace the most secret workings of nature 's molecular machinery , it could see nothing in the inorganic world , or in the brain itself but molecular motion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that the motions of animals are not automatic ? how do we know that they have any psychological meaning at all ? It is only as we infer that like motions mean the same in them as in us ; it is only as we know our own mind , that we can take the first step toward a knowledge of mind in the lower orders . Now since this is so , since human psychology must precede all other , and since the psychology of the polyps is , to say the least , a matter of pure conjecture , we submit that it is not wise to give such inquiries any very great weight Yet Mr. Speucer argues aud argues for hundreds of pages upon a psychology which is pure conjecture , to disprove the only psychology which we can directly know . But if all kuowledge begins at home , it becomes a matter of first importance to know the true nature of the cognitive act . ig then , we look closely at this , we shall see that in every act of perception there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the object perceived . Every perceptive act contains these two elements , and , we believe , contains them in exact equipoise . The mind gives itself as looking forth upon a scene which is not itself . This fact of a division is admitted by every one ; but some philosophers have denied its trustworthiness . To be sure , the mind does distinguish itself from the scene ; but this distinction represents no reality in the nature of things . The so-called object is but a representation which the mind makes to itself through the operation of its own laws . We believe that an examination would show that this primary distinction can not be argued away ; but if either member of the antithesis is to be destroyed , which shall it be ? The subjective element is given beyond the possibility of question . Self as perceiving is the most fundamental datum of consciousness . The object can be reached only by accepting the testimony of the subject . Deny that testimony , and the universe disappears in a bottomless pit of nihilism . If either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result must be absolute idealism . We insist upon it ; the subjective // element must stand to make any science possible . The only alternative is to admit the distinction , or deny the object ; and either would be fatal to Mr. Spencer 's theory . Indeed , Mr. Spencer himself insists upon this distinction , and calls it one which transcends consciousness by underlying it . He says : " Where the two modes of Being which we distinguish as Subject and Object have been severally reduced to their lowest terms , any further comprehension must be an assimilation of these lowest terms to one another , and , as we have already seen , this is negatived by the very distinction of S*ubject and Object , which is itself consciousness of a difference transcending all other differences . So far from helping us to think of them as of one kind , analysis serves but to render more manifest the impossibility of finding for them a common concept  --  a thought under which they can be united . " ( Vol. i , p. 157 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common with a unit of motion , becomes more than ever manifest when we bring the two into juxtaposition " ( p. 158 ) . Again he says : " Nevertheless it may be as well to say here , once for all , that if we were compelled to choose between the alternatives of translating mental phenomena into physical phenomena , or of translating physical phenomena into mental phenomena , the latter alternative would seem the more acceptable of the two " ( p. 162 ) . If we had not been aware beforehand of Mr. Spencer 's unbounded , almost supernatural , appetite for self-contradiction , we should have supposed on reading these passages that he intended to take his own advice , and " rest content with that duality of them which our constitution necessitates . " But to do this would be fatal to his theory ; and that is too much to ask of any one . Accordingly , though " a unit of feeling has nothing in common with a unit of motion ; " and though " analysis but serves to render more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and though " the antithesis of Subject and Object is never to be transcended* while consciousness lasts ; " Mr. Spencer , nevertheless , assures us that " it is one and the same Ultimate IRealitv which is manifested to us subjectively and objectively . " ( Vol. i , p. 627 . ) It does not occur to Mr. Spencer to give any proof of this ; and , indeed , proof is not to be expected , for this Ultimate // Reality is the Unknowable whose operations , of course , transcend criticism . Logic has no place in that realm , assertion alone can enter . But Mr. Spencer inadvertently gives us a much more concrete statement as to the way in which subject and object are united . He says : " For just in the same way the object is the unknown permanent nexus which is never itself a phenomenon , but is that which holds phenomena together ; so is the subject the unknown permanent nexus which is never itself a state of consciousness , but which holds the states of consciousness together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the definition of the subject , and then , though it is " unknown , " he proceeds to tell us what this nexus is . " For as shown in the earlier part of this work , an idea is the psychical side of what on its physical side is an involved set of molecular changes propagated through an involved set of nervous plexuses . That which makes possible the idea is the pre-existence of these plexuses so organized that a wave of molecular motion diffused through them will produce , as its psychical correlative , the components of the conception in due order and degree . This idea lasts while the waves of molecular motion last-ceasing when they cease ; but that which remains is the set of plexuses . These constitute the potentiality of the idea , and make possible future ideas like it . Each such set of plexuses perpetually modified in detail by perpetual new actions , capable of entering into countless combinations , and capable of having its several parts vanexternal ob *ously excited just as the ject presents its combined attributes in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering to the permanent external nexus for phenomena . " ( Vol. ii , p. 484 . ) Thus the great distinction of subject and object vanishes , and self is resolved into the organism . The distinction vanishes , though Mr. Spencer declares it can not be interpreted away . The assimilation is made , though he says that analysis but serves to make manifest its impossibility . Units of feeling are resolved into units of motion , though they have nothing in common . Mr. Spencer insists that the criterion of truth is the impossibility of conceiving the opposite ; and argues this at great length against the Sceptics and Jdealists . It would seem // then that a distinction which is insisted upon as the most fundamental in our mental operations , ought to be accepted as real . But this would put mind outside of the physical chain , and , accordingly , Mr. Spencer , in the teeth of all logic , denies the distinction . When it suits his purpose he admits the testimony of the mind ; when it does not , he proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that the mind says about an external world is true ; all that it says about itself is false . This is Mr. Spencer 's position . To this argument Mr. Spencer would probably reply that the idea of subject and object is of comparatively recent origin , and , instead of being simple , is consolidated from millions of experiences which stretch back through unknown ages . There was a time in the history of mental evolution when this distinction was unknown . It makes no matter that this time was in infancy  --  a period of which nothing is known , or during the development of the lower orders-which is a subject of pure conjecture ; Mr. Spencer says that this distinction is of recent birth . These ideas , then , are not elementary , but are highly complex ; and nothing can be built upon them . Admitting the fact , Mr. Spencer 's argument is not helped . Indeed the constant assumption of the experience-philosophers that everything must be measured in its beginnings , is an enormous fallacy , a gross logical imposition . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all space and time , and to the law of conscience as eternally true , they aim to throw discredit upon them by showing from what they have been built up . Do you see that cringing cur ? that is the dawn of the moral sentiment . Do you see that jelly contract when touched ? that is the raw material of mind . But , gentlemen , what do you mean ? You who talk of development , tell us whether we are developing faculty , knowledge , power ; or whether we are developing illusion , delusion , and baseless dreams . If the former supposition be true , then these faculties as we have them , not as they appeared in some early cell , or even as they manifest themselves in infancy , but as they are to-day , here in their highest form , in their latest utterances , are the most trustworthy . If we are indeed developing , we need not inquire as to the beliefs of the first polyp to reach the truth ; but the last utterances of // our faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted as of highest authority . But if the latter supposition , that we are only growing into illusion , be true , then we must seek truth in the minds of the pre-human apes , or rather in what the first polyp or pulp believed . In that case we can put away all our knowledge , all our science , and the great doctrine of evolution along with it . The experience-philosophy can not escape this alternative . The positive deliverances of our mature consciousness must be accepted as they stand or all truth must he declared impossible . We can not , then , allow Mr. Spencer to throw discredit on this distinction of subject and object on the ground of its recent birth . What , then , will he do with it ? lie can admit it , which would be realism ; he can deny the object , which would be idealism ; he can deny the subject , which must result in nihilism . But any of these alternatives would prove fatal to his system . Unless mental force is transformed physical force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true ; that nerve-currents and ideas are opposite sides of the same fact , is the postulate of the entire work . When we look for the proof it amounts to this : nervous states afibet mental states and conversely ; therefore they are one . This is the sum of all his utterances on this subject . Now the fact alleged is undoubted , and has been admjtted by all realists since the world began . It is no new revelation that sickness has a depressing effect upon the mind , that the various physical stimuli affect mental activity , that powerful emotions exalt the functions of the organism , or that a mind diseased can drag the body into ruin along with itself . But while psychologists have admitted this relation , they have claimed that there are insuperable obstacles to assuming a correlation or identity . This which is the real point in dispute , is coolly assumed without mention . Now , surely , to slur over a question which his system is bound to answer upon pain of repudiation , is strategy of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we are compelled to admire the generalship . Mr. Spencer , however , recognizes a difficulty at this point , and says : " How this metamorphosis takes place-how a force existing as motion , heat , or light can become a mode of consciousness-how it is possible for aerial // vibrations to generate the sensation we call sound , or for the force liberated by chemical changes in the brain to give rise to emotion-these are mysteries which it is impossible to fathom . But they are not profounder mysteries than the transformation of the physical forces into each other . " ( F. P. , p. 280 . ) Mr. Spencer is mistaken . If the received doctrine concerning the physical forces be true , there is no mystery at all in the change of one into another . For we are told that these forces are motions ; heat , magnetism , light , all are modes of motion . The transformation of the physical forces , then , is simply a change of one kind of motion into another , which is not so rare a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between these motions is only the difference of faster and slower , the problem becomes simpler still . Now with all deference to Mr. Spencer 's dictum , we must say that the change of one kind of motion into another is one thing ; but to change motion into thought which is not motion , and which can not by any effort be thought of as motion , is quite another . Granting that the spiritualist doctrine is true , the inter-dependence of soul and body upon which the materialist bases his arguments , is precisely what we should expect . If the soul communicates with the external world by means of a material organism , then their interests must be bound up together . If the external world reports itself through nervous tides , then the condition of the nervous system will be a most important factor of the resulting knowledge . If , on the other hand , the body is the mechanism for revealing thoughts and feelings , again it follows that the condition of the instrument must affect the manifestation . If the appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass within . If the dial plate be defaced and broken , signals can be made no longer . To suppose it otherwise would make the connection useless and the body would be of no more use or interest to us than our cast-off clothes . We think too , that there is a moral reason also for the interdependence . If the soul use the body as the instrument for sinning , it shall find itself sold into degrading bondage by its partner in crime . Or if the soul make itself the home of evil , it shall find the body dragged down into ruin with it . If it were not for this connection , the moral discipline of our present // existence would be almost entirely lost . We repeat that the inter-dependence of physical and spiritual conditions is precisely what we should expect . But there are insuperable obstacles to supposing that the mental state is but a transformation of its physical antecedent . The mind can withdraw its attention from all the ordinary aiitecedents of sensation so that they perish unnoticed . In the concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of the street , the thousand sights and sounds about us , are lost or attract no attention . This is a fact familiar to every one . The antecedents of sensation are there , the nervous tides which are said to correlate with thought are there ; but they pour over into the abyss which divides thought from motion , and are lost . What do they correlate with ? The sequence of the physical forces is rigid and unvarying ; this sequence depends upon the attention of the mind within . This undoubted fact is sufficient to disprove the correlation . But , further , if this theory be true , the same physical antecedent ought to produce the same mental states , which is far from being the case . The same words spoken in the same way may be praise or insult ; and the mental state varies accordingly . If struck by accident we have one feeling ; if struck on purpose we have quite another . The physical antecedents are the same ; why are the results various ? There are myriad facts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanical correlation of thought and motion . The only theory that will explain them is that back of nerve-currents there is a knowing , judging soul . And who knows not how the soul can maintain its powers while the body is falling into ruin and by its inn4te vigor resist advancing decay ? And often too , when it seemed to have suffered final eclipse , it has burst the shut gates of sense , and shone through its clouded windows as if to show that death may be nativity and freedom . Not to insist for the present upon the soul 's freedom , which , if it be a fact , utterly overturns the doctrine , these are some of the reasons for rejecting the correlation of the physical and mental forces . For the credit of Mr. Spencer 's system it is desirable that not only a qualitative , but also a quantitative relation should be made out between thought and motion ; otherwise some awkward questions might be asked . We have already noticed the // superior order of Mr. Spencer 's generalship in proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skill in making out the second . He is compelled to admit that no quantitative relation can be observed , but that its absence is most conspicuous . It would not do , however , to leave the argument in this condition , and Mr. Spencer introduces the saving clause : " We have good reason to conclude that in a superior nervous center , where in some mysterious way an objective change or nervous action causes a subjective change or feeling , there exists a quantitative equivalence between the two ; the amount of sensation is proportionate to the amount of molecular transformation that takes place in the vesicular substance affected . " ( VoL i , p. 120 . ) What the " good reason " may be does not appear , but Mr. Spencer says there is one . Our most diligent search , however , has failed to discover anything more than the argument we have just criticised . As far as we can trace it , the correlation is vague and indefinite , and altogether unlike the rigid sequence of the physical forces ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve-center . The truth is , the " good reason " for believing it so is not any physiological or psychological fact , but the necessities of Mr. Spencer 's system . There is not , we say it firmly , a word of proof that the physical forces correlate with sensation . That they are the antecedents of sensation is all that can be established , and this has never been denied by any realist . Yet even if an identity were made out , it would next become necessary to assimilate thought to sensation . The immediate consequent of nerve-currents is feelings , and by combining these , thought is reached . If this can not be done , the thinking power stands apart from the physical series , and the theory breaks down again . This is a problem which the experience philosophy has always found it difficult to solve ; indeed , where it is plainly stated , it seems too absurd for consideration . The problem is to show that a string of feelings which existed long before there was any one to have them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts ; and apprehends their relations to one another ; and reflects upon them ; and draws conclusions from them : and all the while is but a feeling ; and the process is but a feeling . Another difficulty is that thought and // sensation are given in consciousness as very different things . To have a feeling is one thing , to reflect is quite another . What kinship is there between sensation and a purely intellectual operation , such as the study of a mathematical problem , or any other of the reflective processes of thought ? If we are to rely upon our present consciousness , they have no common measure . But the experience-philosophy has steadily resisted this distinction , and sought to show how thought is but sensation that has grown proud and forgotten its origin . The great instrument for the contemplated reduction is the association of ideas . Sensations and feelings cluster together , and so pass into thought . Mr. Spencer says : " The cardinal fact to be noted as of c&amp;irdinate importance with the facts above noted , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , other vivid feelings simultaneous or successive , it is joined to , and identified with , faint feelings that have resulted from foregoing siniilar vivid feelings . Each particular color , each special sound , each sensation of touch , taste , or smell , is at once known as unlike other sensations that limit it in space or time , and known as like the faint forms of certain sensations that have preceded in time-unites itself with foregoing sensations from which it does not differ in quality but only in intensity . " On this law of composition depends the orderly structure of Mind . in its absence there could be nothing but a kaleidoscopic change of feelings-an ever transforming present without past or future . It is because of this tendency which vivid feelings have severally to cohere with the faint forms of all preceding feelings like themselves , that there arise what we call ideas . A vivid feeling does not by itself constitute a unit of that aggregate of ideas entitled knowledge . Nor does a single faint feeling constitute such a unit . Bnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vivid feeling is assimilated to , or coheres with , one or more of the faint feelings left by such vivid feelings previously experienced . From moment to moment the feelings that constitute consciousness segregate-each becoining fused with the whole series of others like itself that have gone before it ; and what we call knowing each feeling as such or such , is our name for this act of segregation . * * * // An idea of an object or act is composed of groups of similar and similarly-related feelings that have arisen in consciousness from time , and have formed a consolidated series of which the members have partially or completely lost their individualities . " ( Vol. i , p. 182 ) . " Consider now , under its most general form , the process of composition of Mind described in foregoing sections . It is *io other than this same process carried out on higher and higher platforms , both increasing extent and complication . As we have lately seen , the feelings called sensations can not of themselves constitute Mind , even when great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted only when each sensation is assimilated to the faint forms of antecedent like sensations . The consolidation of successive units of feeling to form a sensation , is paralleled in a larger way by the consolidation of successive sensations to form what we call a knowledge of the sensation as such or such  --  to form the smallest separable portion of what we call thought , as distinguished from more confused sentiency " ( p. 185 ) . We have in this extract a complete outline of the associational doctrine and an almost complete list of its errors . The process above described is assumed to be sufficient to account for all that is in the mind , no matter how far removed from sensation it may seem to be . In this way self-consciousness , the distinction of Subject and Object , the abstract processes of thought , memory , imagination ; all are built up . Our first criticism is that the language in which the doctrine is expressed betrays it . " Each particular color , each special sOun ( l , each sensation of touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sensations that limit it in space or time , and known as like the faint forms of certain sensations that have preceded it . " Who is it that knowns these sensations as like or unlike ? Who is it that remembers the faint forms of past sensation ? The object of these groupings and " segregations " is to account for thought , memory , judgment , etc. ; and , lo , a thinking , judging , recognizing mind is on the ground to see to its own birth . It would hardly be surprising , if under such favorable circumstances the process proved successful . Again , Mr. Spencer will not allow us to know sensations until they are // " segregated , " but insists that a knowledge of them as like or unlike must precede segregation . How , indeed , things can be known as like or unlike each other , when we know nothing about them , does not appear ; nor is it very evident how memory can be built up by a process which assumes its existence at the start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we begin to remember sensations as " past experiences . " Yet these are the absurdities into which the associationalists have always fallen . This association of ideas implies the very things it is supposed to explain away . What associates the ideas ? What separates them into like and unlike ? What recognizes them as past experiences ? What is it in all perception which combines tactual , visual , and other impressions so that the object presents itself as a unit in consciousness ? At this point , the associationalists have always left a fatal gap in their system . To suppose that the ideas and sensations know themselves as like or unlike , and then enter into combination is absurd ; yet they must either do this , or refer the association , to the action of the soul itself . To escape this alternative , Mr. Spencer ventures upon the astounding proposition , that the association takes place primarily , not in the mind , but in the nervous system . Like nervous states get together and difference themselves from others , and whenever one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others along with it . He says : " Changes in nerve-vesicles are the objective correlatives of what we know subjectively as feelings ; and the discharges through fibres that connect nerve-vesicles are the objective correlatives of what we know subjectively as relations between feelings . It follows that just as the association of a feeling with its class , order , genus , and species , answers to the localization of the nervous discharge within some great aggregate of nerve fibres , within some division of that aggregate , within some bundle of that division . Moreover , as we before concluded that the association of each feeling with its exact counterparts in past experience , answers to the re-excitation of the same vesicle or vesicles ; so here we conclude that the association of each relation with its exact counterparts in past experience , answers to the re-excitation of the same connecting fibre or fibres . And since , on the recognition of any object , // this re-excitation of the plexus of fibres and vesicles before jointly excited by it , answers to the association of each constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like feeling contained in the previous consciousness of the object ; it is clear that the whole process is comprehended under the principle alleged . If the recognized object now lacking one of its traits , arouses in consciousness an ideal feeling answering to some real feeling which this trait once aroused ; the cause is that along with the strong discharge through the whole plexus of fibres of vesicles directly excited , there is apt to go a feeble discharge to those vesicles which answers to the missing feeling through those fibres which answer to the missing relations involving a representation of the feeling and its relations* " ( Vol. i , p. 270 ) . As a specimen of creative imagination , this extract must certainly rank very high , but as a scientific statement it can hardly be considered a success . For in the first place , neither physiology nor psychology knows anything about the process here indicated . Mr. Spencer 's imagination is responsible for the whole account . How is it known that there is a " nervevesicle " answering to every feeling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vesicles represents the relation of the feelings for which they stand ? There is , and can be , no proof whatever of these statements . But supposing we admit that there is a nerve-vesicle for every idea , still the association of ideas is not explained . What is it associates the vesicles ? What separates them into like and unlike ? Has the nervous system the power of recognizing relations ? of appreciating difference ? and then of storing up in an appropriate place the peculiar nervous combination answering to a given state of thought ? That would be to attribute to the nervous system the very qualities of memory , judgment , etc. , which it is expected to explain . But Mr. Spencer is prepared with an answer . This separation of nerve-vesicles is due to the law of segregation . The law is that like tends to get with like under the operation of a uniform force . The same wind carries off dead leaves and allows the living ones to remain on the tree . A stream of water carries the sand and mud away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chaff thrown // against the wind is segregated ; the wheat gets with the wheat and the chaff with the chaff . The first two illustrations are adduced by Mr. Spencer himself and the third is as good as any he offers . Now , because dead leaves are blown away and sand is washed out of gravel , therefore , the nerve-vesicles answering to like ideas get together and pull one another back and forth through consciousness . ft seems incredible that Mr. Spencer should have deluded himself with such vague and unmeaning analogies as these . That he has deluded others is to us the highest possible proof of his statement that " most men do not think , but only think that they think . " Surely it is a sublime and touching faith in the great doctrine of evolution which enables one to accept these puerilities as science ; indeed , it would be impossible to find a better specimen of the faith which is said to remove mountains . But Mr. Spencer attempts another explanation of association : " As the plexuses in these highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plexuses in the inferior centers , call up special sets of ideal feelings and relations ; so by simultaneously exciting in diffused ways the general sets of plexuses to which these special sets belong , they call up in vague the accompanying general sets of ideal feelings and relations-the emotional background appropriate to the definite conception . In the language of our illustration , we may say that the superior nervous centers , in playing upon the inferior ones , bring out not only specific chords and cadences of feelings , but , in so doing , arouse reverberating echoes of all kindred chords and cadences that have been struck during an immeasurable past-producing a great volume of indefinite tones harmonizing with the definite tones . " ( Vol. i , p. 571 . ) This statement , which recalls the doctrine of Aristoxenus , that mind is the tune of the organism , is the completion of the statement on p. 126 that emotions are only remembered sensations , and are aroused by wandering nerve-currents which , in racing up and down the system , lit upon the vesicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , first , that there is no proof possible in the nature of the case ; and , sec ond , that this view does not explain why the " specific chords and cadences of feelings " should only " arouse reverberating // echoes of all kindred chords and cadences ; " nor does it explain why these vagrant nerve-currents should hit upon only those emotions which harmonize with the specific conception . The doctrine is that a nerve-current passing upward to the brain appears in consciousness as a vivid feeling , that is , a sensation . But the same current , after producing the sensation , diffuses itself in feebler currents throughout the nervous system , and re-excites the vesicles which answer to similar sensations in the past , and produces faint feelings in consciousness , that is , emotions . Wonderful nerve-current to hit upon the proper vesi ? des ! What directs it ? It is conceivable that mental chaos should result from such a process , but certainly mental order can not . The same process is supposed to explain memory . When any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sensations are brought out of experience by the process described ; and this is memory . The explanation misses the chief distinction of memory . To remember a thing is not to have the same idea or thought again , but to have it with the consciousness of having had it before . This relation of experience to self is entirely lost sight of in the explanation . Adopting for the moment Mr. Spencer 's philosopby , we explain it in this way : every idea has a nerve-vesicle answering to it . To the idea of self , therefore , there must be an enormous vesidc . And since every mental relation answers to a fiber in the brain which connects the vesicles corresponding to the ideas between which a relation is perceived , we must conclude that the reason why self appears in all memory , is that there is an indefinite number of fibers connecting the vesicle which represents self with the vesicles which stand for all our various experiences . Whenever , then , one of these vesicles is excited , there must go a discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , hence , both ideas must appear in consciousness together . And whoever will duly weigh the evidence must see that nothing short of an overwhelming bias.in favor of a pre-conceived theory , can explain the non-acceptance of this explanation . This account is as good as any that Mr. Spencer has given . It has just as much support from physiology or psychology as his own explanations have . Hartley 's // doctrine of vibrations arid vibratiuncles is no more baseless than this so-called science ; and , indeed , they do not differ materially except in terms . But if we should allow all of these absurdities to pass , the proposition that thought and sensation are one is not made out . Sensation is sensation and nothing more . A cluster of sensations is sensation still ; and in whatever way sensation may be massed it acquires no new character . Thought is not sensation , nor the relations of sensations , but a perception of relations and a reasoning upon them . In short , the explanations of this philosophy consist in calling the most diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling sensations nerve-currents . Mr. Spencer , when he meets with a difficulty , simply renames it , and the work is done . If ideas associate , it is explained by the magic word " segregation . " If they are united to form a unit of knowledge , it is a case of " integration . " If knowledge becomes more definite , it is called " differentiation . " And after he has grouped every thing under these vague and unmeaning terms , he seems to think that he has thrown great light upon the subject . Now we hold that the value of psychology lies in speaking clearly and directly to self-consciousness ; but the associational philosophy does not even pretend to do that All its characteristic explanations fly directly in the face of our present consciousness ; and when we complain of that , an appeal is made to the unknown . Mr. Mill requires us to look in upon the mind of the infant as it lies in its nurse 's arms ; and Mr. Spencer will have us go back through " countless ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there , we should have seen all that he claims . This is a great beauty of this philosophy . It works its wonders before the critic comes , and when he appears on the ground he is blandly told that it is too late . The wonders which have been wrought for him and in him are such as to render self-knowledge impossible . All its ingenuity is expended , not in explaining our present consciousness* but in explaining it away . There is nothing left for us now but to accept the equivalents which the philosophers choose to give ; and if the work seems to be poorly done , it is , at least , the best that the circumstances permit . We must no longer hope to walk by sight , but must be // content to walk by faith ; and if at any time the suspicion crosses our minds that this philosophy is a forgery , we have the assurance of this school that it is the genuine autobiography of mental evolution . This , to be sure , is the only proof we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming bias " this is more than enough . As was to be expected , the questions thus removed from criticism are those which this philosophy finds it most difficult to answer . ft will be remembered that when Mr. Spencer was seeking to establish the identity of thought and motion , it was done in " a superior nerve-center in*a mysterious way . " But the production of logical laws , the belief in causation , space , and time , was done " untold ages " ago . Whenever a critical point is reached , Mr. Spencer , in common with others of this school , retreats into the unknowable , and , with the aid of an obliging " mystery , " works out his system secure from molestation . The very least that should he decreed to tactics like these is an ovation , if , indeed , they do not deserve a triumph . We utterly distrust this doctrine which begins with sensations and builds up knowledge by combining them . According to this theory , our idea of an external thing is highly complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other impressions . On the contrary , we believe that we begin with a knowledge of things , that our knowledge of attributes and sensations is a later birth , that instead of reaching things by a synthesis of qualities , we reach qualities by an analysis of things . The following quotation , then , we think not far from the truth : " The postulate with which metaphysical reasoning sets out is that we are primarily conscious only of our sensations-that we certainly know that we have these , and that if there be anything beyond these serving as a cause for them , it can be only known by inference from them . " I shall give much surprise to the metaphysical reader if I call in question this postulate ; and the surprise will rise into astonishment if I distinctly deny it . Yet I must do this . * * I see no alternative but to affirm that the thing primarily known is not that a sensation has been experienced , but that there exists an outer object . Instead of admitting that the primordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assert , contrariwise , that the existence of a sensa // tion is an hypothesis that can not be framed until external existence is known . " ( Vol. ii , p. 369 . ) Mr. Spencer then goes on to show that with children , and rustics , and all who have not been disturbed by metaphysical reasoning , the certain knowledge is a knowledge of things , while sensations and attributes , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , are utterly unknown . With some qualification we accept this as true , but if it is , then mental evolution takes place in a way directly opposite to that which this philosophy assumes , and the doctrine falls to the ground . If it is not true , the argument for an external world which Mr. Spencer bases upon it , vanishes . Since nerves and nervous systems play such an important part in Mr. Spencer 's scheme , it would be interesting to notice his account of their origin , especially as he has nothing but chance for the artist . But space will not permit us to quote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters on the Genesis of Nerves and Nervous Systems . The process is , if possible , even more imaginative than the account before given of the origin of motions and the association of ideas . The entire work is done by the passage of motion along lines of least resistance . In this way protoplasm is transformed into nerves , and definite channels of communication are set up . We think that Mr. Spencer would hardly have ventured this explanation , if he had not previously worked himself into a fit state of mental confusion by the use of some of his cant words , such as segregation , intqgration , evolution , &amp;c. , words which are made to cover a multitude of logical sins . The work is done below the microscopic limit , and the chief part of the result is also below that limit , for the actual nervous system does not correspond with this hypothetical one . " It may , indeed , be objected that an actual ganglion differs from this hypothetical ganglion in a more serious way-in not displaying a definite network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and branched processes , that are not formed into a distinct plexus of connections . To this my reply is , that though I have thus far , for the sake of clearness , spoken of these structures as definite , it is not needful that they should be visibly so . A network of lines of least resistance is alone requisite ; and it may be in part so formed as to be visible and // 495 it may be in part so unformed as to be invisible . ( Vol . I , p. 530 . ) Here , as everywhere , it is the part that is out of sight that saves the system . The ganglia , though not " visibly definite , " are " invisibly definite . " As to the " network of lines of least resistance which is alone requisite , " Mr. Spencer gives no explanation . Nerves are formed by motion along these lines , but the lines which upon this theory are the real marvel , are left unexplained . Yet Mr. Spencer himself at times has misgivings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caveat that he does not insist that the primitive nervous system was formed in this way ; he only suggests this as a possible way . With this caveat , and the reminder that the first nervous systems were formed in very small animals , and hence must have been very simple affairs-something , indeed , hardly worth noticing , he goes on his way rejoicing . This luminons bit of guesswork renders an originating mind entirely superfluous . This account of the nervous system is only comparable to the explanation of frowning . Why do men frown when angry ? Mr. Spencer says : " Now if we bear in mind that during the combats of superior animals , which have various movements of attack and defence , success largely depends on quickness and clearness of vision-if we remember that the skill of a fencer is shown partly in his power of instantly detecting the sign of a movement about to be made , so that he may be prepared to guard against it or to take advantage of it ; and that in animals , as for example in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shows how much depends on promptly anticipating one another 's motions ; it will be manifest that a slight improvement of vision , obtained by keeping the sun 's rays out of the eyes , may often be of great importance , and where the combatants are nearly equal , may determine the victory . There is , in deed no need to infer this d priori , for we have a poster*ori proof : in prize fights it is a recognized disadvantage to have the sun in front . Hence , we may infer that during the evolution of those types from which man more immediately inherits , it must have been that individuals in whom the nervous discharge accompanying the excitement of combat , caused an unusual contraction of these corrugation i3lluscles of the forehead , would , other things being equal , be the most likely to // conquer and to leave posterity-survival of the fittest tending in their posterity to establish and increase this peculiarity . " ( Vol. ii , p. 547 . ) This paragraph is its own criticism . It deserves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetencies , with the statement that hens set because the eggs serve to relieve a supposed pain in the bird 's abdomen , and others of similiar nature . We quote it because it brings to view a fact which is the complete condemnation of the scheme . Mr. Spencer here specifically , and elsewhere implicitly , assumes the doctrine of evolution to be true . His work is not a proof of the doctrine but an application of it . Evolution is true ; hence , in spite of all opposing facts , matter and mind must be one . Evolution is true ; hence , when it is necessary to explain the nervous system , he begins to romance upon what might have been . Evolution is true ; hence , to account for emotions , he tells us of vagabond nerve-currents which strike upon the nerve-vesicles which represent ancient sensations . Evolution is true ; hence , nerve-vesicles which represent kindred ideas , must cling together and coalesce to form compound ideas . Evolution is true ; hence , to interpret human sentiments we are referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence the axioms of thought are but the consolidated experiences of lower forms through an " interminable past . " Whatever facts do not har . monize with the theory are stigmatized as ex parte , and their testimony is discredited . There is no fancy too wild , or too disgusting , to be believed ; there is no guess too absurd , or too ridiculous , to be greedily swallowed ; if only it support the great doctrine . And on the other hand , there is no fact of nature , no matter how well ascertained ; there is no deliverance of consciousness , no matter how nniversal , which has any rights that the philosopher is bound to respect , if it is opposed to his belief . And all this is warranted because evolution is true . The evidence brought to prove the theory gets all its force as evidence from the assumption that the theory is true . It is the most fraternal arrangement possible ; the evidence proves the theory and the theory gives weight to the evidence . Truly , all things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms , if they should take to reasoning , could scarcely do better than this . // But the greatest difficulty of the experience-philosophy has yet to be mentioned . To turn sensation into thought is difficult , but to turn it into action is harder still . How to turn passivity into activity , or how to extract from mere sentiency the various forms of effort , has always been the great problem . Why should passivity ever become its direct opposite ? Why should receptivity transform itself into the idea of power ? Mr. Bain , in his work , introduced a novelty into his system , for the purpose of answering these questions . He supposes a spontaneous activity of the muscles to be a part of the original outfit of the organism . This spontaneity , reduced to shape by experience , explains the difficulty . To this it is sufficient to say that if this activity is strictly spontaneous , it lies without the physical forces , and if it does not lie without them , it is not spontaneous . In either case , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer , however , cuts the knot ; there is no such thing as spontaneity , because if there is his theory fails . This alternative is not to be thought of ; and there is nothing left for us but to accept Mr. Spencer 's statement that our consciousness of freedom , of being the causes of our own actions , is a delusion . In reality , everything which we do , is done for us ; the sequence of cause and effect is as rigid here as it is in physics ; and the belief that we have anything to do with our volitions , is a superstition that deserves no quarter whatever . First , Mr. Spencer explains how the illusion has arisen : " Considered as an internal perception , the illusion consists in supposing that at each moment the ego is something more than the aggregate of feelings and ideas , actual and nascent , which then exist . A man who , after being subject to an impulse consisting of a group of psychical states , real and ideal , performs a certain action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and by speaking of his conscious self as having been something separate from the group of psychical states constituting , is led into the error of supposing that it was not the impulse alone which determined the action . But the entire group of psychical states which constituted the antecedent of the act*on , also constituted himself at that moment-constituted his psychical self that is , as distinguished from his physical self . It is alike true that he // determined the action and that the aggregate of his feelings and ideas determined it ; since , during its existence , this aggregate constituted his then state of consciousness , that is , himself . Either the ego which is supposed to determine or will the action , is present in consciousness , or it is not . If it is not present in consciousness , it is something of which we are unconscioussomething , therefore , of whose existence we neither have nor can have any evidence . If it is present in consciousness , then , as it is ever present , it can be at each moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound , passing at that moment . " ( Vol. i , p. 500 . ) He next explains how the illusion has been strengthened : " This subjective illusion in which the notion of free will commonly originates , is strengthened by a corresponding objective illusion . The actions of other individuals , lacking as they do that uniformity characterizing phenomena of which the laws are known , appear to be lawlessappear to be under no necessity of following any particular order ; and are hence supposed to be determined by the unknown independent something called the Will . But this seeming indeterminateness in the mental succession is consequent on the extreme complication of the forces in action . The composition of causes is so intricate , and from moment to moment so varied , that the effects are not calculable . These effects are , however , as conformable to law as the simplest reflex actions . The irregularity and apparent freedom are inevitable results of the complexity ; and equally arise in the inorganic world under parallel conditions . To amplify an illustration before used :  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single other body , moves in a direction that can be accurately predicted . If subject to the attraction of two bodies , its course is but approximately calculable . If subject to the attractions of three bodies , its course can be calculated with still less precision . And if it is surrounded by bodies of all sizes at all distances , its motion will be apparently uninfluenced by any of them : it will move in some indefinable varying line that appears to be self-determined : it will seem to be free . " ( Vol. i , p. 502 . ) This is a more explicit statement than Mr. Spencer commonly makes . As a rule , he is very careful of putting his views into // 1873 . Herbert Spencer 's Princzples of Psycholoyy. definite form ; so much so , that we do not know any writer whom it is more difficult to criticise . Leading doctrines are suggested rather than stated , and assumed rather than proved ; and the critic is forced to wade through a sea of vague and meaningless analogies in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt of the meaning of this quotation . Spontaneity , freedom , self-determination , is a delusion , and all our effort is the result of complex reflex-action . Men are automata running about on two legs , with the added absurdity of supposing themselves free . An insulting word is spoken to a man . The physical antecedent is aerial vibrations . These correlate with nerve-currents , which at once start for some superior nerve-center where an immense amount of molecular motion is disengaged . This , in turn , starts for the muscles of the arm which are violently extended in such a way as to reach the offender who is forthwith prostrated. ig however , this practical method is not adopted , the reason is that the first current , in running through the superior nerve-center , upset other nerve-vesicles which at once set about disengaging opposing molecular . motions ; and as the result of all this reflex-action the muscles were not extended and nobody was hurt . This is the true account of this matter , and of all seeming self-determination . Compound reflex-action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the muscles there is an actor who sets the muscles at work , is not to be entertained for a moment ; because , you see , that would be fatal to the great doctrine and all kinds of nonsense must be swallowed rather than give up the theory . The manner in which Mr. Spencer disposes of the ego in the previous extract , deserves notice . Ignorant people " who do not think , but who only think that they think , " are persuaded that they are not their feelings but that the feelings are theirs . But Mr. Spencer assures them that they are nothing but their feelings . " Either this ego which is supposed to determine or will the act is present in consciousness , or it is not . If it is not present in consciousness , it is some thing of which we are unconscious-something , therefore , of whose existence we neither have nor can have any evidence . If it is present in consciousness , then , as it is ever present , it can be at each moment nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound , passing at that moment . " Whenever Mr. Spencer becomes epigrammatic , he is very apt to use arguments which cut both ways . Let us apply this argument to the existence of Mr. Spencer 's unknowable . We manage our reasoning in this way : Either this unknowable which is said to underlie phenomena , is present in consciousness or it is not . If it is not , it is something of which we are unconscious-something , therefore , of whose existence we neither have nor can have any evidence . If it is present , then it can not be unknown for we are conscious of it . In either case , we must conclude that there is no unknowable . Our reasoning is as good as Mr. Spencer 's . If he insists that we can not think of phenomena without a substantial support ; we reply , that it is equally impossible to think of feelings without such support . If the argument is good for one , it is good for both ; and that , too , in whichever way it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience philosophy has probably been done over the intuitions . All our mental operations proceed upon certain assumptions . The reality of an external world , the validity of logic*ji laws , the truth of causation , the reality of space and time ; these facts are assumed in all reasoning ; and reasoning can not proceed one step without them . The transcendental philosopher assumes that these data are contributed by the mind itself ; that though not prior to experience , they do not derive their validity from it , but are intuitively known to be true . It is not taught that these are explicitly , but implicitly present in every mental operation . The savage , the boor , or the child knows as little about intuition.s or laws of thought , as he does about the doctrine of evolution ; yet each of these implicitly proceeds upon them . Now these constant assumptions of all reasoning the transcendentalist calls the intuitions , and claims that they come not as generalizations from experience , but are based upon direct mental insight . This the experience-philosopher is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these laws of thinking are like every thing else consolidated sensations . At this point Mr. Spencer has introduced something of a novelty into the discussion . The sensational doctrine hitherto has been greatly pressed for time to work its transformations . It is not claimed that these changes have been wrought within // the scope of our present consciousness ; and it has been necessary to do the work in infancy , and to complete it before the critical faculties make their appearance . Besides , too , the slightest observation shows that every individual brings with him tendencies which determine both the line and the measure of his development ; and these tendencies , so far as they go , are transcendental elements in our mental character . Physically and mentally , we are determined by our constitution more than by our own experience . The philosopher , then , who attempts to deduce everything from individual experience , can not maintain his position now that the fact of transmitted tendencies has become so prominent . But Mr. Spencer thinks that he has reconciled the two schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the individual , they are empirical for the race . He , too , would derive everything from experience , but from a race-experience . It is evident that Mi* Spencer has greatly increased the resources of his school by this suggestion , but he has not saved the experience-philosophy from the sceptical conclusions which Hume drew from it . The intuitionist claims that the mind has the power of knowing , and of knowing some things to be true , without any process of verification . This supposition is the only one which corresponds with our matured consciousness ; why should it not be true ? Why deny all that is in the mind to-day , and fall to groping in the dark for opposing possibilities , which can never be brought to a test ? But if this snpposition is not true , if sensation is the raw material out of which mind is built up , then whatever is not in sensation , has no claim to reality . All the higher powers and beliefs of the mind which differ in kind from sensation , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth , set up a claim to the throne . The existence and the infinity of space and time , the idea of power , the belief in causation , the axioms of mathematics , the universal and eternal validity of logical laws , have no warrant whatever . They are not found in sensation , and bear no resemblance to it ; and as this is the only legitimate source of knowledge these beliefs must be looked upon as pretenders whose claims can not be tolerated . Experience alone can teach nothing . It is only as there is a mind with an outfit of princi // herbert iSpertcer 's Principles of Psychology . July , pies to organize experience , that we can advance one step beyond it . Facts alone are dead and can tell us nothing of other facts , except we assume the reality of causation , and the validity of logical laws . Otherwise , the syllogism begs the question , and the induction concludes from particulars to a universal . Argument in either form is illogical , unless the mind is allowed to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead materials of experience be put in motion , and a real advance be secured . The experience-philosopher must reduce his intuitions to the scale of experience , and deny their universal validity . In that case the great doctrine of evolution which postulates the universal and eternal validity of the law of causation , would find itself without foundation . But the evolutionist can not prove even their limited validity , for they are only consolidated experiences , and if experience had been otherwise the intuitions would have been otherwise ; so then they represent no external fact , but only subjective delusions which have been born and nourished by habit . As a necessary result , science disappears and knowledge is reduced to the scale of our own experience . Mr. Spencer , however , has a short answer to this : In spite of logical objections , we can not help trusting these intuitions ; and this , he says , is our highest warrant for believing anything . But by his own principles our subjective inability to get rid of them , is no proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inveterate association . Besides , Mr. Spencer is the last man who should appeal to our necessary beliefs in support of anything , for no one has done them greater violence . We have already seen how he insists upon the duality of sub - ject and object as the most fundamental datum of thought , and as one which it is impossible to transcend ; yet in spite of the impossibility Mr. Spencer declares them one . He further insists that no effort will enable us to think of thought and motion as one ; and that all analysis but serves to render the impossibility more apparent ; yet Mr. Spencer assumes as a first principle that thought and motion are identical . We can not believe that personality is but a bundle of feelings ; we can not help believing ourselves more than our feelings ; but Mr. Spencer turns this belief out of doors without ceremony . We // can not help thinking that we perceive things as they are , that the qualities which we attribute to them are really in them ; but this too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are causes of our own volitions , that we are not dragged back and forth by motives as a bone by snarling dogs ; but Mr. Spencer insists that this too is a delusion . There is scarcely a deliverance of our mature consciousness which he has not insulted and denied . However , something must be saved in the midst of this universal denial , or evolution would vanish in the abysses of idealism ; accordingly Mr. Spencer comes and asks us to believe in the existence of an unknowable , and the persistence of force on the evidence of the same mind which he has loaded with opprobrium as a false witness . He insists upon these principles because he can not even start his system without them ; he denies all the rest because they are hostile to his system . Can anything be more convenient than this privilege of taking what we like and rejecting what we like ? Who could not build up a system if we should grant him this one little thing ? We can not grant it , however . The elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no one of them has any better warrant than the others . IDoubtless , the exigencies of his system may be sufficient reason for Mr. Spencer for accepting some and rejecting others , but they will hardly seem so to any one whose interest in the great doctrine is less paternal . Mr. Spencer 's tumbling over the doctrine of causation is so surpassingly lofty as to deserve especial notice . The persistence of force , as Mr. Spencer admits , is but a disguised statement of the law of causation ; and this doctrine he assumes to be universally true . Now we shall not insist upon the impossibility of learning universal truths from a limited experience , but shall merely call attention to the genesis of the idea of causation . We do not learn it from nature ; the external world presents us with nothing but a succession of phenomena . The causal connection can never be a matter of observation ; it is given as a mental datum , and never as an observed fact . The veriest tyro in metaphysics now admits this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our conscious effort . A mind merely perceptive could gaze forever on the regiments // of phenomena which maneuver in the world about us , without gaining any idea of power . It is only as we put forth effort , as we are conscious of being ourselves causes , that a belief in external causation arises . Deny that we are causes of our actions , and even a dream of external causation becomes impossible . Yet Mr. Spencer , in the passage we have quoted concerning the soul 's freedom , denies in the most explicit terms that it has any causal power whatever . Not to mention the violence this does to our consciousness , let us note one result : if there is no causation within , there is not the slightest warrant for believing in it without . Yet Mr. Spencer , after obtaining the belief in external causation from the fact of internal causation , then proceeds to deny the fact on which the belief rests , and asks us still to accept the belief . It is hard to resist such an appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer 's svstem would have no power to work with ; and if the internal fact is not denied , his system breaks down . And this is science ; this is evolution . Whoever does not accept it is convicted of an " overwhelming bias in favor of a preconceived theory . " It is hard to believe that Mr. Spencer is really serious . Is it not possible tbat this work is meant only as an elaborate satire upon the loose reasoning and baseless assumptions of much that calls itself science ? We think the internal evidence of this theory complete , while the opposing view , that the book was meant as a sober exposition of fact , seems beset with insurmountable difficulties-it is positively incredible . Sensational philosophy has never been able to escape idealism . In its zeal to deny the existence of a knowing power which takes direct cognizance of external existence , it has been forced to build up the external world as well as the mind from the raw material of sensation . There is sensation , according to this doctrine , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self and of an external world is the residuum of countless sensations . But if this be so , then the deposit which is named self has just as good warrant as the deposit which represents the outer world . It is impossible to reject one and accept the other . In the attempt to do this , materialism has always tumbled into a bottomless gulf of idealism . Mr. Mill makes matter an affection of mind and mind a product of matter . // Mr. Bain reduces mind to nerve-currents , and then says that nerve-currents and the outer world generally have only a hypothetical existence-indeed they are but abstract names for our sensations , and have no existence save in the mind that framed them . ( Senses and Intellect , p. 376 . ) Mr. Spencer follows in their footsteps . " By reality we mean persistence in consciousness . * * * The real , as we conceive it , is distinguished solely by the test of persistence for by this test we separate it from what we call the unreal . " ( F. P. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistence . " ( Vol. i , p. 146 . ) Add to this the statement that the reality of external things is entirely unknown , and that all we think we see in them , is but a shadow of the mind 's own throwing ; and we have the blankest idealism possible . If a madman 's vagaries should persist , they would be as real as the objects of our normal perception . Let any fancy whatever persist long enough , and it must be looked upon as an independent existence . Mr. Spencer does indeed repudiate idealism with great vehemence and calls it insane . When he is pressed by the idealist or sceptic he calls the " Universal Postulate " to his relief This is , that we can not help believing in an outer world . But the reply is close at hand . Mr. Spencer teaches that this inability is the result of habit . Besides , his theory of the unknowable stands in the way of such an appeal ; we are as sure that we know things as they are , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get clear of one belief we could get clear of the other . There is no help for it ; Mr. Spencer 's solid-looking , sensational ground tumbles from under his feet , and leaves him in the abysses . Now what shall we say of this theory ? Has it not failed at every point which we indicated in opening the discussion ? Even permitting it to ransack imagination for its arguments and facts , it utterly breaks down . Faith like a grain of mustard seed might , possibly , enable one to receive it , but nothing less would . And the purpose of all this subtle misconstruction of our experience , of this labored denial of what we know , of these fanciful guesses at the unknown , is only to escape admitting that , back of nerves and muscles , there is a knowing , self-active mind . // Of Mr. Spencer 's theory in general we must say that we utterly dissent from the common verdict upon it . The system has , to be sure , a certain element of grandeur ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any doctrine which deals with solar systems , and with forces and times and spaces which are infinite , necessarily has an air of vastness about it which proves attractive . Mr. Spencer has painted a big picture with a big brush ; and the popular imagination , which finds it easier to wonder than to understand , will have it that he must be a great painter . Upon a sober survey it can hardly be claimed that he has added much to our stock of knowledge . The elder Mill has expounded the associational doctrine with greater lucidity and better logic . Bain has given a better account of cerebral psychology . Mr. Spencer 's attempt at universe-building it would be a kindness to pass over in silence . Bad as the old book of Genesis is said to be , it is certainly better than the new . The sum of Mr. Spencer 's labors is a huge , contradictory system which kills itself and do n't know it . The doctrine began in a fog and never succeeded in getting out of it . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal failure . Science has fallen upon evil days . Every department is flooded with assertions which can never be put to a test , and on the strength of propositions which are not amenable to proof or intuition , the most extravagant theories are built up . In many quarters , especially in biology and physiology , science seems to have ( legenerated altogether from the severe adherence to fact which has won for it its present distinction . Contradiction and absurdity go for nothing , so long as the doctrine falls in with prevailing tendencies . But that such a work as the one in hand should be accepted by so many as being at once the profoundest philosophy and the most assured science , is most discouraging . It is extremely fashionable , just now , to decry metaphysics as a useless study , but a very small amount of logical culture and metaphysical knowledge , would serve to render such systems as this impossible . We have not much hope of a speedy revival of metaphysical study , but we must express a wish that before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual buffoonery than merely to call it science . // ARTICLE V.-POPULAR SONGS AMONG THE DRAVID IAN NATIONS . The Folk-Songs of Southern india . By CHARLES E. GOYER. pp. xxviii , 296 . London : Triibner &amp; Co . Madras : iligginbotham &amp; Co. 1872 . MR . GOVER has given to the public one of the most interesting and instructive books relating to a little worked field of Indian literature , which we have lately read . In this book we gain almost for the first time an insight into the every-day life and thoughts of that portion of the people of India , which has been least studied and most imperfectly understood . Since the British occupation of the country opened an unexpected chapter in the antiquities of the race , the efforts of scholars have naturally been expended chiefly upon the Vedas and the classical Sanskrit literature , which , however , represents but a singe caste , the Brahmans . In this way the great majority of the people , the common people , are liable to be misunderstood . The philosophical speculations of the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales respecting the gods , inventions of a crafty priesthood , may serve to amuse them at their public festivals , but probably have little influence upon their daily lives . Especially is this remark true of the hill tribes of Southern India , who have not so completely succumbed to the Brahmauic caste as the people of the plains . There is certainly no better way to discover the character of these people than to collect the songs , which pass from mouth to mouth in their every-day life . There is ample evidence that when the dominant Hindu race entered India , they found the country already possessed by a darker-skinned people , whom they gradually subdued or drove into the inaccessible mountain fastuesses of Central and Southern India . What the family connections of these early settlers were we are perhaps not in a condition to say with certainty .
