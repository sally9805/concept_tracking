ARTICLE 11. - PRINCIPLES OF ART . ART , like Poetry , hardly admits of being precisely defined , because it is a complex truth . Of the more general term Art , we have , however , many definitions , both new and old . Art occupied a large space in the ancient world , and was treated by classic writers with subtlety and depth ; it entered into all their conceptions of education and life . One of these ancient definitions was the following : " Art is a power working its effects by method . " In this is presented to ns the idea of a certain result , brought about by the use of certain prearranged means employed by an intelligent agent . It is the effect of no accidental , unintelligent , or unconscious power . Cicero confirms this when he says , in the IDe Oratore , " Art lies in things which are-Art lies in things thoroughly understood and fully known . " Among modern definitions of the general term Art , the first and most approved is that of Lord Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature by human thought and experience , so as to answer the several purposes of mankind ; in which sense Art stands opposed to Nature . " By this , Nature is supposed to furnish the material , which an intelligent and skillful Art rightly perceives , handles , and arranges- ( &amp;pe&amp;v , to join or fit together , from which the word " Art " comes ) - for its own ends . Hazlitfs definition is also good and generally accepted- " Art is principally used for a system of rules , serving to facilitate in the performance of certain actions ; in which it stands opposed to Science , or a system of speculative principles . " A more philosophical definition than either , perhaps , is this , that Art comprises " a system of means to an end forming one united whole ; " for true Art seeks to reach and embody some one definite purpose or idea  --  to combine all the scattered elements of that idea in one , making a perfect whole . Thus the Art of authorship is that system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can most fitly produce in words the perfect conception of the work which he had already formed in his own mind . But this perfect end sought for in Art must be some good end , and must be sought for by good means , else it becomes nothing better than mere artifice ; as if true Art really meant anything false , anything that seemed to be and was not . Thus some good men would not have Art intoduced into the sanctuary , even into the music of the sanctuary , not knowing that it is really the meretricious and the false which their hearts are opposing , and justly so ; but true Art in music would make it just what good taste and genuine devotion would have it to be . Art seeks to free nature from whatever is false , crude , and accidental , and to bring out the true and perfect idea . It is , in fact , nothing more than intelligently grasping and using the very laws and principles of nature . These things then enter into all true Art-  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained principles ; and the production of some definite result that is complete in itself , like a work of nature . The artist , by a penetrative glance into nature , seizes upon her hidden laws , controls them , and reduces them to something like regular rules or principles of action , by the guidance of which , effects worthy of being called Art , or works of Art , are produced . This general idea of Art has had many subordinate divisions and modifications . One ancient author ( Quintilian ) makes three divisions or classifications of Art . 1 . Theoretic-to which Astronomy would belong , as being con fined to the mere understanding of the matters contained in it ; simply to understand them is the only result sought for . 2 . Practical-to which Oratory would belong , as being fulfilled or finished in the act itself of speaking ; this is the end of the Art , to speak well . 3 . Productive  --  to which Painting and Sculpture would belong , as being visible and permanent representations of the invisible thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been made of Art , divides it into the Mechanical , the Scientific , and the Liberal . The man of liberal education , in whatever field of knowledge , was formerly // called the " artist , " of which an apt instance occurs in Shakspeare 's Troilus and Cressida , ( 1 , 3 ) . " The wise and fool , the artist and unread . " But the most familiar classification of the general idea of Art , that the modern world seems finally to have settled down into , is into the Useful ( which of course comes first , as men 's physical wants must be first supplied ) and the Fine Arts ; or , as a modern author , who loves pure Anglo-Saxon , chooses to call them , the Coarse and the Fine Arts . This name , " Fine Arts , " we need hardly add , owing to the influence of German writers , is made convertible into the far more dignified , appropriate , and comprehensive term of " iEsthetic Arts . " Without attempting any transcendental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article , which confines itself to simple and elementary principles , we would define " iI*sthetics " to be that instinctive feeling or perception of what is beautiful in Natnre and Art , which has its basis in the mind itself ; and the reducing of this , so far as such a subtle , mental sentiment is thus reducible , to a more clear and positive system of rules or principles , which may be said to constitute the philosophy of Art . The principal end or aim , therefore , of tEsthetics , is a search after what is beautiful for its own sake , both in nature and in the productions of human genius . This frees ? sthetics , or the iEsthetic Arts , from the whole world of utilitarian ideas , and lifts it into a world of its own , where it exists from its inherent loveliness and nobleness . Let us for a moment inqnire into the origin of iEsthetie Art , or what are some of its chief sources . Architecture seems to have sprung more directly from the idea of utility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fine " art ; for men wished a roof over their heads before they wished to adorn it . The beautiful tradition of the still more purely aesthetical art of Painting is somewhat mythical , but is so natural that it ought to be true . The Greek maiden , about to part from her lover-going away perhaps to some fierce war to save his native state-catches and traces the simple outline of his profile shadowed upon the wall , to preserve it as a memorial of the absent one . Whether this old story be true or false , " the art origi // nated with the first man who was born with such acute sensibility to the beauty of form , color , light , and shadow , as to be compelled to convey his thoughts by positive imitation. *** In other words , the art is in man , who can not be man and not be in some sense the artist . Indeed , one definition of man is , a being who is capable of art . He mediates between the material and spiritual worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the last . The child who draws the rnde likeness of his pet dog on his slate , or plays the hero in his simple way and with his simple materials ; the rough sailor whose eye kindles in describing the lines of his ship ; and the Pacific Island savage , who ornaments his war-club with fantastic carving , and adds a feathered diadem to his head-dress , these show a susceptibility to beauty , to something that goes beyond the useful , and satisfies a higher feeling . It is only necessary that there should be inman this " acute sensibility " to the beauty there is in the world , and the power to express or even to imitate it , to make the artist . In this sensibility to the beantiful which God has placed in man , lies the root of iEsthetic Art . " The artist , " says IRnskin , " is to see and feel . The thoughtful man is gone far away to seek ; but the perceiving man must sit still and open his heart to receive  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be enough to receive what God has to give him . " But although art thus chiefly springs from , or lies in , the receptive and perceptive faculties , or the more truly sensational part of man 's nature , yet these faculties alone are by no means enough to make the artist ; they must call also to their aid the higher intellectual and spiritual powers . To quote again from the same anthor ,  --  " All our moral feelings are so inwoven with our intellectual powers , that we can not affect the one without in some degree addressing the other ; and in all high ideas of beauty it is more than probable that munch of the pleasure depends on delicate and untraceable perceptions of fitness , propriety , and relation , which are partly intellectual , and through which we arrive at our noblest ideas of what is commonly called intellectual // beauty . " The true artist , then , who is to rightly read and represent what there is of the beauty of God 's mind in this world in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to devote them to a high aim . Fra Angelico , the old Florentine painter , it is said , never sat down to paint without first consecrating himself to his work by prayer . Michael Angelo , so the tradition goes , labored ten years on the building of St. Peter 's , without receiving any remuneration , and as he declared , for the honor of God solely . Man with an eye and heart in a world like this , must have those feelings , that , possessed and developed in a marked degree , lead one to become the artist , lie who begins to observe nature ; he who studies a tree , or a single leaf ; he who looks closely at the small grass under his feet , that nevertheless covers the whole globe ; he who notices the striking effects of light ; he who watches the sky at morn , eve , and night ; he must come to believe that there is something in nature above the merely practical , or that which gives us rain and bread from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ns of a beauty and a truth beyond this world . It is said that so philosophic and severe a mind as that of Immanuel Kant was always greatly affected by his observation of the heavens , and the varying changes of the sky . In the actual history of the orgin of Art , without speaking of the earlier crude though wonderful efforts of the Egyptian , Assyrian , and Indian minds ,  --  the Greek mind had just that sensibility to the beautiful in nature , that perceptive faculty , and that mental force in the highest degree , that made it the artist , - *XV***the skillful contriver , maker , creator ,  --  as he was whom their myth chained to the barren rock , because he strove to educate , elevate , and soften the human race . True art really sprang from Greece ; or from the religion of Greece , for it constituted the old Greek immortality  --  the only immortality the Greek mind knew or hoped for . The love of Beauty was also a prime principle of the Greek religion ; hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the forms of Greek art even now hold their place , not only in the plastic arts of Sculpture and Architecture , but also in Poetry and Oratory , as supreme standards of Art . The pure air of Greece , // the popular games which brought out the manly beauty of the body , the mountain scenery , the intellectual strife , the simplicity of manners , and the civil freedom , aided this marvelous artistic development of Greece , a country hardly larger in size than the half of England . Yet even in Greece it was a thousand years from the crude beginning to the perfbction of Phidian art . Art , like everything else great , is a slow plant ; and we should not therefore expect that in America it will come to perfection in a day . Before considering some of the principles of true Art , let us ask for a moment the not uncommon question , if Art has aught to do with morals and religion , and if it be of any special use after all ? Schiller , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty never furthered the performance of duty , or strengthened the feeling of moral obligation . He does not say that it om* , iht not to do so ; but he thought that the pride and grossness of the human heart was the great reason , why the beauty of God 's works had so little moral effect upon the heart and life of men . But may we not take exceptions to this assertion of Schiller ? If the sense ( if the beautiful be implanted in us by God , and if Beauty itself lies first of all in the idea , and if the idea of pure and absolute Beauty is to be found only in God himnselS the AIl-Lovely ,  --  the perfect Idea as well as perfect Being-then to say that Art has no connection with , or relation to , the deeper religious nature , is , we believe , going too far . A writer in the Westminster IReview has , in this instance , taken a juster view of the matter . He says , " The meaning which Art detects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sentiment . To find room for this mode of conception , something must be added to the ethical representation of God . He must be regarded as not always and throughont engaged in processes of intention and volition , but as having , round this moral center , an infinite atmosphere of creative thought and affection , which , like the native inspirations of a pure and sublime human soul , spontaneously flow out in forms of beauty and movements of rhythm , and a thousand aspects of divine expression . Religion demands the admission of this free element , and without it , will cease to speak // home to men of susceptible nature , and must limit itself more and more to the fanatical minds that have too little regulation , and the **oral , that have too much , " i. e. not freedom enough . It is sufficient to know and say that Art is and never can be religion ; and yet we think that he who is sensible of the true and beautiful in God 's works , has that in him upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment to a freer development . Art in worship may indeed pass into heartless Form ; but still there is the necessary principle of " Representation " in all public worship . There is the fit , proper , and most beautiful mode of expressing by word and symbol , devotional feeling . The mode is entirely secondary , but not entirely useless and vain . " The idea produces the symbol , not the symbol the idea. *** First comes Religion , and then religious expression , or representation ; and therefore Art should never appear in worship solely as Art . It were wrong and contemptible for it to do so . We would not then be under stood as asserting that Art holds any primarily essential place in Religion , or religious worship ; but that it has its own not unimportant place in both , for Art belongs to humanity in all its expressions . Take away Art entirely , and you take away preaching ; that is , so far as preaching is Thought , or the human presentation of Divine Truth in its fit form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authoritative claims . Art , too , has certainly afforded help to the religious emotions , even as Architecture aids the devotional sentiment for all that is high and skyward . And we need but call to mind here that familiar picture of IDa Vinci 's " Last Supper , " which has nourished and elevated the religious sentiments of millions ; though we would add that this noble painting , which gives us perhaps the highest and tenderest conceptions of the Saviour , just at that affecting moment when the question was asked , " Lord , is it I , " really belonged to a Catholic age ; and we are of the opinion that such a subject , as well as all the more purely spiritual and divine themes of our religion , are beyond the sphere of Art ; according to the principle quoted from Cicero , that " Art concerns // itself with things that are known ; " and therefore its true field is nature , and it should confine itself chiefly to this field . But is there no moral worth in Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple idea ,  --  in such an idea , for instance , as that of Justice ? Is there not a worthy beauty in a principle of pure mathematics ? Does it not shine with a light of its own ? Is it not noble in itself as a divine thought , even if it be not applied to a practical end ? Pericles strongly maintained the utility of Art . He said to the Athenians : " The city being well supplied with everything necessary for supporting the war , the superfluity of their treasure should be spent in such works as , when finished , would be an eternal monument to their glory , and , during the execution of them , would diffuse riches and plenty among the people ; for , so many kinds of labor , and such a variety of instruments and materials being requisite in those undertakings , every art should be exerted , and every hand employed ; and the city would not or*ly be beautified , but maintained by itself . " As a preservative also of the fame , manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , Art has done a work for which we should be grateful . The Moors have long vanished from the plains and sierras of Granada , but the graceful architecture of the Alhambra , of Cordova , and Seville , is still a witness of their power in Spain , and of their elegant genius . IRuskin says , " there are but two strong conquerors of the forgetfulness of men , Poetry and Architecture  --  the day is coming when we shall confess that we have learned more of Greece out of the crumbled fragments of her sculpture than even from her sweet singers or soldier historians . in the Palazzo Spada at IRome , one may at this day , there is every reason to believe , look upon the same " austere statue ' * of Pompey , at whose base Ca*sar fell . And where is there an historic proof that links together sacred and profane history , that can at all be compared to that wonderful carving on the inside of the Arch of Titus , in which is represented the triumph which bore up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jerusalem ? Ages of history are in that crumbling arch . Art refines a nation and a man as nothing else does under religion . Heart-wrought and spiritual refinement comes , it is true , from a deeper source than Art furnishes , but true Art ennobles . The great fear in our country is , that the love of Nature and Art being once tasted of ; with our impulsive tendency to exaggeration we shall push it too far , and shall carry it to an absurdity , so that it will be set in the place of higher things . The relative value of things will not be maintained . The simple truth is , that a man who does not feel something of the true and sweet influences of nature , or who does not know at all how to appreciate a noble work of Art , is a rude person . Such a man needs planing and polishing . ile is a boor still , although he may be a brave man . And let us not be misunderstood here . We do not refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham Lincoln , though in some superficial respects he was perhaps simple and rough . But Abraham Lincoln was a thoroughly genial man ; he loved nature ; he loved poetry ; he loved eloquence ; he had the true aesthetic sense . This gave him a finer perception of the beauty and fitness of things , which aided him even in the highest questions of statesmanship and government , and did not rob him of a particle of his honest strength . But the absurdity and danger which must be confessed is , to confound this taste , or this aesthetic sense , with things of infinitely more value , with manliness , sqlf sacrifice , and goodness . One of the greatest of modern poets ( Wordsworth ) , on the testimony of one of the greatest of modern writers ( De Quincey ) , was a selfish man . Now in the estimate of God , and in the estimate of the best human reason , could all the poet 's exquisite appreciation of nature outweigh the essential selfishness of his character , granting this to be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the view of taste itself , is the superior quality , the appreciation of the beautiful , or the love of God and man ? Which is the eternal attribute of character , a refined mind or a pure heart ? There can be no question ; but why may not one possess both qualities ? Let it once be settled // that the love of the beautiful in Nature and Art is not religion , aud beneath that truth , we may legitimately cul ivate the love of the beautiful . Our American nature woulif be enlarged and improved by it . Its sources of healthy enjoyment would be increased . As to the apology for Art , it may be all summed up in a single word , God himself is the true Artist . In his works , every principle of true Art , every combination for the highest effect , every nobleness of form , every method for the production of the most perfect beauty , may be found . What blue is like the blue of the Rosenlaui glacier ? Who can paint like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one star ? " For this cause , it may be , Novalis says , that a work of Art belongs to the sphere of spiritual things ; * and also , that the poet comprehends nature better than the scientific reason . We have not left ourselves too much space to speak of some of the principles which seem to lie at the foundation of all Art . The first of these is the imitation of Nat ' ? tre . It is a common and true remark that Art springs from Nature ; that its rules are nothing more than an intelligent following of the laws and instincts of Nature ; that the artist draws his ideas originally from Nature . But yet Art is not the mere copy of Nature . That fine critic , ilaydon , indeed says : " The most perfect imitation of reality was not incompatible with the highest Art . This was the great principle of Greek Art . " It is true that the Greek artists did evidently copy the noble forms they saw before them at the public games ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a familiar fact , took his most beautiful faces from those of the common Italian people who passed daily through the streets of Rome ; but did he not do something more than this ? Is there not a world-wide difference between him and Gerard Dow , or the Flemish school of painters , who imitated precisely what they saw before them , to every individual hair , laboring for months on a fur collar ? The best Art is not this servile following of Nature-it joins to this an action of the artist 's own soul , reasoning , selecting , // individualizing . It thus gives back to its own works the appearance of fresh creations of Nature . It combines , as says Finet , both *ie true and the extraordinary . If it copies a tree , it is a free imitation catching the specific character of the tree , rather than painting every limb and leaf . Painting after all is an illusory effect . It is not the thing itself , nor the exact transcript of the thing , but rather the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . In painting three miles of landscape it would be absurd and impossible to copy precisely every tree , shrub , rock , and tuft of grass . If this were so , a canvas on the same scale would be needed ; and , as one has remarked , Madame Tussaud 's wax-work imitations of Nature would constitute the highest Art . iRuskin well describes the true imitation of Nature in Art . He says : " High Art , therefore , consists neither in altering nor in improving Nature , but in seeking throughout Nature for whatsoever things are lovely , and whatsoever things are pure , ' in loving these , in displaying to the utmost of the painter 's power such loveliness as is in them , and directing the thoughts of others to them by winning Art . " This leads us on to speak of the second great foundation principle of Art , which may be called the true Ideal . This is something which is more purely subjective still , and has its source in the thought of the artist 's own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imaginative power of the artist ; and it makes the difference between the great and small artist in all departments of Art , in oratory and poetry , as well as painting and sculpture . And here let us remark that there is a connection between the arts , thereby making the study of Art an exceedingly comprehensive and useful part of a true education . The ancients understood this . Cicero says that there is a common chain running through all the Arts , so that each contains the other in itself . Another says , " There is a secret union through all the Arts , which makes them fade and flourish together . " The principles that apply to the art of Painting , apply also to that of Rhetoric , so that the study of Art helps the preacher and lawyer ; for both must go to Nature for their power , and must // draw from her laws . And has not the preacher , too , his own sacred and beautiful ideal ? The true meaning of the ideal in Art seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dreamland of the imagination ; but in separating a natural object from its accidental and perhaps degrading circumstances , and , by a pure act of the imagination , conceiving the object in its most complete , universal , and perfect form . It is therefore the true idea of the thing , rather than the thing itself It is the perfect species of the tree , or flower , or man . It is " the perfect idea of the form in which all the properties of the species are fully developed ; and in which it is best fitted to discharge the functions for which it was made . " Thus he who has a perception of the true ideal of any work of Nature , - even though it be a hedge1*og ,  --  who sees its perfect adaptation to the functions of its being  --  to him it is beautiful . And how varied are the ideals of objects ! The genius of the artist is shown in profoundly comprehending these ideal varieties in form , spirit , events , and scenes . The man of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , and a landscape in the tropics-have their ideals , and their deep radical differences , which the artist must penetrate , else a simple imitation of Nature would be really untrue . Coleridge went so far as to say , that " All which we find in Nature must be created by ourselves ; and that alike , whether Nature is gorgeous or powerless , we receive but what we give , and in our own life alone does Nature live . " Yet the artist should not carry his search for the ideal to an absurdity , so as to get away from the truth and impulse of Nature . In this way the false ideal arises , and we need the Pre-Raphaclites with their " painful fidelity to Nature , " to correct it . But there is the true Ideal ; which is the striving to bring out the ideas of truth and beauty which are in Nature . Man 's thought is thus permitted to grasp the very ideas of Nature , or to make the real objects of Nature the means of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great enough to be the depository of the higher truth or ideal perfection of Nature herself . // Under these two great general principles which have been mentioned , of the Imitation of Nature and the true Ideal , there are other specific and subordinate , but still essential principles of Art , the first of which , above and beyond all others , may be comprehended in the simple principle of Truth . Truth is not precisely Beauty , but there can be no real Beauty that is not closely related to Truth and Fact . How true are the touches of such an artist as Shakspeare ! His description , in King Lear , of Dover Cliff , is exquisitely true to this day . Lady Macbeth , in the night scene , when watched by the doctor and nurse , is hardly more than the bare and powerful description of psychological phenomena that would occur under any circumstances where commanding mind and deep-dyed crime are brought together . Indeed , a modern commentator claims for Shakspeare the prophetic announcement of the Hunterian theory of the circulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Art , it is not allowed that even ornament should be ever designed for ornament 's sake alone . In our country towns , where the passion for wooden pillars to dwelling-houses obtains , it may be noticed that now and then one of these useless appendages gets its base worn away , or is wrested out of place by some strain or blow , so that the pillar actually hangs suspended from the pediment above , without touching the ground at all , and instead of supporting , it is itself supported . We here see the ridiculous sham of using pillars when they are not wanted to support anything . In the magnificent interior of Milan Cathedral , the ribs and panelings of the groined vault overhead are of wood painted to imitate stone ; when one knows this , how much it takes from the power of the impression ! Nothing , in a word , in Art , any more than in life , may be without a good reason , or above all , false . It has been well said that we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so it is also in Art . Some have gone so far as to say that nothing which is not really useful , in Art , or which does not spring from utility , can be truly beautiful . " The true ideal is based upon and grows out of the real . It is the artist 's first duty to be true to the real . He // may be sure that the greatness is in the thing God has made , and if he keeps his heart and eyes open , it may please God to reveal it to him . As the perceptions are cultivated , the more exhaustless God 's works seem to be ; so that no true lover of Nature can ever look away from her to the ideal . " This is quoted from a Pre-Raphaelite writer ; and what is Pre-IRaphaelitism ? It is , if we understand it , a comparatively recent English , Oxford creation , its chief source being in the bold thought of the author of " Modern Painters , " although it claims to belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called Pre-IRaphaelite , because from the time of Giotto , in the early part of the fourteenth century , to the time of IRaphael , Art is esteemed , by this school , to have been based upon true principles of humble , devout , and close study of Nature , and of sincere delight in all God 's works ; principles which Raphael , and those of his day and after him , have , more or less , departed from , or have not worked upon . The PreRaphaelites then bring back the world of Art to its primitive truth and simplicity . Their watchword is Truth-truth in nature , truth in feeling , truth in expression . Human imagination can not mend God 's work . They therefore drive the artist out of his study into the fields and woods , and set him to drawing the plants , stones , weeds , and commonest objects of nature about him , with absolute precision-without attempting to paint the lily . The author must put implicit faith in nature , and go unhesitatingly where she leads ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exhaustless God 's work is seen to be , so that no true lover of nature can ever look away from her to the ideal . " The difference is thus a marked one between the two schools ; and the Pre-IRaphaelites fling down the gauntlet to the whole system of idealism , in which nature forms but the basis for the artist 's own combinations and creations , and declare that " it is the primary object of Art to observe and record Truth , whether of the visible universe or of emotion . " The results of this school have as yet been incommensurate with their pretensions , although William flunt , Millais , and others , have painted wonderful pictures , so far as spiritual purity and unequaled finish are concerned ; // Overbeck has a bloodless celestiality , which proves that he is , as was said of Fra Angelico , " great in angels , though weak in men ; " and if Turner indeed belong to this school , then it has produced the greatest landscape painter of modern times ; for though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crazy man , yet his elaborately finished pictures have in them every quality of the sublimest works of art . The Pre-IRaphaelites , we believe , notwithstanding their dogmatism , have laid hold of at least one true principle ,  --  a principle which has the germ of progress in it . They have come back in humble confession to nature-that Art is nature iii its origin , and can not in one sense rise higher than its source . The highest Art is nature . One sight of the Alps is worth more than all the rules of Sir Joshua Reynolds . Here they have found a solid basis . They seek sure inspiration in the patient study of God 's inexhaustible works , whether they be grand or minute , rather than in the uncertain workings of their own minds . But they must go on and use the truth they thus wrest from Nature , in the higher forms of the imagination . They must not confine themselves to one truth . They must themselves become creative artists . No man ever was or will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always remain the same small copyist of nature . Yet the best rules of Art are nothing unless there be the genius that cares little for rules , whether Pre-ZRaphaelite or Post-iRaphaelite . In the rare constitution of the mind , fitting it to delicately correspond to the whole symbolic world of nature , the true artist is found ; and as a great poet was never made by the " Ars Poetica , " or a great orator by " Quintilian 's Institutes , " so a great artist will not come through the study of the " Modern Painters . " Something of the same conditions of original mind , and of those shaping moral influences that made the great artists of one age , must combine to make the great artists of another age . This Article has already grown too long to notice other essential principles of Art , such , for example , as Unity , where all is developed from one central idea , and which the human mind demands in every true work of art ; as Simplicity , which is upposed to exuberance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unity , produces the sublime ; as Proportion , which springs from the nature of the object itself which exists first in nature , and which preserves that fine consistency of parts with the whole , that gives delight in any beautiful object ; as Grace , which flows from internal sympathy and freedom of mind ; as character , by which a distinctive and appropriate spirit is stamped on works of Art , expressive of the age , the history , and the idea ; as Form , to which everything in art comes at last , and which is the highest intellectual expression of Art , making in some sense Sculpture , a more true a*sthetical art than either Painting or Architecture , and perhaps Music , than all of these . We hold that there is such a thing as Christian Art , which is purified from whatever is base in Paganism , or that fosters immorality ; which teaches lessons of love , duty , and humanity ; which memorializes heroic deeds ; which breathes the spirit of freedom ; which draws out and beautifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which may even claim an humble place in the offices of Christian Faith .
