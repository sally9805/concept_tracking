txt ART . X. - COMMERCIAL IMMORALITY AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION . ARE not all the great communities of the Western World growing more corrupt as they grow in wealth ? In other words , Is not the power of money over human conduct increasing with alarming rapidity ? If it is , what are the chances of change , or reformation ? Where are we to look for the means of arresting this tendency , and purifying the commercial and political atmosphere ? These are questions which many thoughtful men are asking themselves , in England , America , and France , but much more earnestly and constantly in England and America than in France , because the commercial spirit in the former countries is much stronger , and the power of money much greater , than it is in the latter . It is not necessary to dwell on the phenomena which suggest these inquiries . Everybody is familiar with them . Foremost amongst them is the prevailing love of luxury . The luxury of this age , too , differs from that of all preceding ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , a thing appropriated to one class in society , and which other classes can only enjoy as a spectacle . The idea that certain modes of living , // and no others , are suitable to certain callings or conditions , is one which modern democracy has destroyed , or is destroying . The advice of Polonius to his son , " Costly thy habit as thy purse can bear , " was , in Shakespeare 's age , a good rule for a gentleman ; in our day it is considered a good rule for everybody . And , not only is all the luxury which anybody can reach considered legitimate , but every one has a secret belief that luxury is within his reach . The rising commercial tide of the last hundred years , and the innumerable examples which within this period have been afforded , in every country , of a phenomenon , previously rarely witnessed , - the rise of men of low beginnings into great opulence , - have diffused through all classes such hope of material enjoyment as has never pervaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual possession of luxury , and whose revelhings in it attract most attention , and give point to most of the denunciations directed against it by moralists is a very small one , and , in fact , can hardly be said to exist outside the large cities , there is no portion of the population of the great commercial countries which is not influenced by luxury , which does not long for it , and half expect to attain it . This love of luxury , combined with the great quickening which all commercial processes have received from steam , machinery , the electric telegraph , and the opening of new continents , has greatly increased the impatience of.prolonged effort , and the indifference to distant results , which all men naturally feel . So many great fortunes are now made , every year , by lucky strokes , or by a sudden rise in the value of property over the vast field opened , in our day , to enterprise and speculation , and the feeling already referred to , that what is possible to one is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mode of achieving wealth and reputation in business , by slowly " working one 's way up , " by the practice of industry and frugality , by the display of punctuality and integrity merely , may be said to have fallen into disrepute . I do not say this as part of a commonplace lament over " the degeneracy of the age . " The decline of these virtues , considered simply as commercial instruments , and // not as moral qualifies , has a good foundation in reason . It must not be forgotten , that the ideal trader , who has furnished young business men with a model down to our day , and whom Franklin had constantly in his mind , was formed in the walled towns of the Middle Ages , when commerce and manufactures began to revive . The artisan 's or dealer 's career then lay in a narrow street , under the eye of his neighbors . Neither the city nor the country nor the state of society afforded him any opportunity for either enterprise or speculation . The road to fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plain living , small economies , and the watchful subjugation of restlessness . As usual , therefore , a code of morals grew up for his assistance , which sweetened his lot , and in which he educated his children , and which , as usual , promised worldly success , as the reward of obedience . But the practice of these old-fashioned virtues will not bring success now as it once did . In the present state of society , a man who relies on them solely , as his ancestors did , is pretty sure to be left behind in the race . The prizes of commercial life - nay , even a fair amount of distinction in it - are won by quickness of perception , activity , and courage . Five out of six of the great fortunes are made rapidly , by happy hits , or bold and ingenious combinations . This increased facility in making money , too , has shortened the period within which a man must make it , in order to be deemed , in the popular estimation , successful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now expected of a man of forty ; and a man whose avowed object in life is to accumulate a fortune , and who depends only on industry and frugality , respectable though he may be considered in the forum of morals , is justly regarded as wanting in some of the higher qualities of his profession . Love of small savings , for instance , - the habit of collecting and preserving odds and ends , which played so prominent a part amongst the means of commercial success in old London and old Amsterdam and old Ghent , - can hardly be said to be any longer a commercial virtue . It would , in our day , if fully indulged , be a vice , because the time spent in saving , and the atten* // tion devoted to it , could be better employed ; and the man who gave much time to it would be pretty sure to be outstripped by his competitors . In short , the changes which have taken place in the art of making money , within the last century , are even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . The old merchant 's training in youth was naturally also different from that received by his successor in our time . It was a kind of training which is now almost impo*sible , owing to the changes in the processes of business . Little is done for boys who are being prepared for mercantile life , in these days , beyond the communication to them of knowledge of details . Habits there is no attempt to teach them ; and yet the major part of the old merchant 's education consisted in the acquisition of habits , rather than of knowledge . A long apprenticeship , in which he was treated with considerable severity , and during a large portion of which he was engaged in repulsive drudgery , taught him obedieiice and patience . He was literally " broken in . " He was , day by day , for years , exercised in punctuality , in frugality , in order , in toiling for distant results ; and in these things , and these only , he was taught to put his faith . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was severe , to be sure ; and it was not suited to everybody . It was essentially heroic treatment . It made young men either saints or devils . The apprentice who had gone through it was , by the time he was ready to set up for himself , a model of virtue , or an abandoned scamp . Like the examples drawn by Hogarth , he either married his master 's daughter , and succeeded to his business , or died on the gallows . The modern merchant can not be said to undergo any discipline at all . He gets in his youth a large amount of instruction on various subjects , but he is not launched on life with habits ready formed , and opinions and feelings tolerably well settled , as his grandfather was . Apprenticeship can no longer be said to exist , or exists only in name . Even in those callings in which manual dexterity as well as theoretical knowledge are necessary , it is found almost impossible to get boys to serve a real // apprenticeship . They remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudiments of the art , and then , setting up as journeymen , begin to do their share of the bad work which is one of the curses of the day . In mercantile business , properly so called , apprentices are unknown ; and not only this , but young men learning the business are not brought into close personal relations with their employers , and do not acquire from them any ways of thinking or feeling which may in after life serve as a rule of action . They see , too , from the very outset , that the prizes of their calling are won by quickness and audacity , rather than by patient industry , and that , in fact , fixed habits of any kind , instead of helping a man , hinder him ; so that restlessness , which was a commercial vice in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , is now actually cultivated as a virtue , and is the most prominent characteristic of what is called , in the slang of the day , " a live man . " Bad habits have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of good habits , or in fact of indifferent habits , as aids to law and morality , has rarely been duly appreciated , although the " force of habit " is a sufficiently commonplace subject of declamation . How much of the work of government is done by habit we could not understand , without seeing a people sudden*y released from the control of those political and social habits , which , and not the formula of words on paper , in nearly every country make up the " constitution " under which they live . One of the finest and wisest passages in Carlyle 's " French Revolution " is that in which he calls attention to the fact , that it was in this breaking up of old habits that the Revolution mainly consisted . But this we all know , in a general way , that , were the habit of obedience to the law in which people are bred , and which sits so lightly on them that they do not feel it , to be greatly weakened or destroyed , no amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve order and save civilization . If a people once loses it , and has not sufficient mental and moral culture to take its place , the iesult , as we see in Mexico , is anarchy , until long suffering has roused the social instinct into activity . We are , at present , witnessing in the immorality which pervades the commercial world , and taints nearly every branch // of business , the results of the decline of habit as a social force , before mental and moral culture has reached a sufficiently advanced stage to take its place . Every man at present may be said literally to live by his wits ; hardly anybody lives by tradition , or authority , or under the dominion of habits acquired in youth . The result is a kind of moral anarchy , from which we are learning , for the first time , how much the old bonds did to supplement and aid both the law and the gospel . Of course , it would be absurd to say that the decline of the old discipline is respoiisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of affairs . But it has removed one powerful barrier to immorality , in lessening the power of self-restraint which all discipline communicates . If the old merchant 's training did not fit a man for making money in the way required in our day , it supplied him with a kind of artificial conscience , which , if not virtue itself , was a powerful help to virtue . The ways of making money that it prescribed were ways that strengthened some very valuable moral qualities . Another striking change which has occurred in the commercial world , and which is doing something to promote unscrupulousness , is what may be called the diminished value of character . Of course I do not mean to say that character is still not valuable , is not in fact the most valuable of a trader 's possessions ; but it does not do so much as it once did for him , or , to state it more correctly , he can get on better without it than he once could . Character is valuable in proportion as public opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about every other trader ; when intercourse between places even a short distance apart was costly and difficult , a man required very strong inducements to make him leave the place of his birth , and as long as he remained in it he lived under a supervision to which nobody is now subjected . In our day , the growth of population , the facilities which exist for change of abode , and the number and variety of objects by which every one 's attention is attracted , have greatly increased individual freedom of action , and correspondingly diminished social checks on conduct . Opinion is not nearly so intense as it was , because it is not nearly so concentrated . Nobody 's happiness or // success is nearly as much dependent , therefore , on what his neighbors think of him as it used to be , and nobody 's neighbors think nearly as much about him as they used to think . The result is , that both here and in England the outer edge of the well-established and respectable eircle of the commercial world swarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is not necessary in order to do a considerable amount of business , and whom no number of failures seems to daunt or drive from the field . At meetings held recently , in Manchester and Liverpool , to discuss the best mode of repressing the prevalent recklessness and unscrupulousness , the indifference of these people to the opinion of the commercial world - that is , their carelessness about their " standing " - was admitted to be one of the great difficulties of the case . It was urged as worthy of consideration , whether greater stringency in the bankruptcy laws was not needed to make up for the increasing indifference of this class to the social penalties attaching to fraud . There is one other feature of the commercial democratic age which is probably doing a good deal to increase the power of money over conduct , and it is one which we are generally in the habit of regarding with satisfaction , namely , the doctrine which we are all taught , and which has done much to overthrow feudalism , that all employments not immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecuniary reward . The effect of this doctrine in promoting industry , in making idleness discreditable , and in fostering a spirit of manly independence , can not well be overrated , it is , in fact , a necessary doctrine in modern society ; but , like other useful things , it may be and is abused . It has done much , and is doing much , to make all rewards but pecuniary rewards seem worthless , and , what is more mischievous , to make every service seem worthy of a pecuniary reward . The practice of paying commissions , for instance , is a perfectly harmless one , within certain limits . It is , in fact , the only good mode of remunerating certain commercial services ; but it has been carried out of its legitimate field into almost every relation of life . Men now charge commissions unblushingly , not simply for doing what they would not have done without a commission , but for doing their ordi // nary duty . There can hardly be a doubt , too , that the constant familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that money is an appropriate and sufficient reward for all kinds of services , and that all kinds of services deserve money , does much to familiarize them also with the idea that money is the best kind of reward , and that he who has it has all . The commercial age has yet to provide an adequate substitute for that large class of motives to exertion. of what may be called the imponderable kind , such as " honor , " class pride , decorations , dignities , titles , and rank , by which men in all other ages have been powerfully influenced . The only proper substitute for them , of course , is to be found in high religious and moral culture ; but there is little question that the world is discarding them before the substitute is ready , and that we are passing through a period in which the strongest motive to exertion of ordinary life - I put periods of excitement out of the question - will be supplied by a much baser , even if more substantial agent . The connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscrupulousness in money-getting , with political corruption , hardly needs explanation or illustration . The form taken by the latter in free countries seems to depend mainly on the constitutional arrangements . If the constituencies are small , and the legislators are not paid , it will prevail mainly amongst the voters , as in England . If the constituencies are large , and the legislators are paid , it will prevail mainly amongst the legislators , as here , provided always the " commercial spirit , " that is , the general belief that money is the most desirable thing in life , be widely spread . In England the non-payment of members of the legislature excludes poor men from it ; the social distinction conferred by a seat in it attracts rich men who are not accessible to pecuniary bribes , but are very easily influenced by the prospect of a rise in the social scale . The constituencies , on the other hand , at least the boroughs , being small and the voters poor , the bribing of them has been hitherto comparatively easy work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual rather than moral , and the attempts to suppress it feeble and ineffective . In France , where , in spite of the material progress of the // last twenty years , the commercial spirit is still very feeble , pecuniary corruption may be said to be almost unknown . Under the Orleans dynasty , the Ministers kept their majority in the Chambers by a gigantic system of jobbing in offices and decorations ; but the use of direct bribery as a means of influencing votes , either in or out of doors , is a charge which is scarcely heard , even in the fiercest political contests . At present the government has too many ways of rewarding its adherents to make the coarser forms of corruption necessary to secure them , and the liberal cause is still too weak and lowly to attract to its service any but men of high principle . One of the peculiar characteristics of the C*esarist regime is , that the demagogues are all on the side of the Ca*sar . In the civil and military service , the system of accountability is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rare . Moreover , the love of luxury among the French , and the perfection to which they have carried the art of material enjoyment , render them , strange to say , fonder of spending a little than of gaining much , - a feature in French character which makes an enormous difference between the spirit of French and that of English or American society . French society may be said to be comparatively free from that love of money-getting as a pursuit , and as a road to distinction , by which all Anglo-Saxon communities are devoured . This passion has no doubt received a great stimulus since the establishment of the Empire , but its effects are as yet mainly confined to Paris . Enterprise - that is , willingness to run great risks for distant results , and to sacrifice present ease in the game of speculation - is not a marked characteristic as yet of any Continental nation . Frenchmen think there has been a great change in this respect since the Revolution . M. de Barante , the recently deceased Academician , speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , - narrow , that is , for persons in their social position , - says : " Tout dans l'ordre de soci6t6 &amp;ait alors regl6 de telle fa*on que le d6sir d'ambition ne pouvait pas *tre aiguis6 par l'esp6rance ; on ne pouvait pas changer sa situation , et sa fortune , dujour au lendemain ; les positions sociales n ' 6taient point , comme elles l'ont 6t6 depuis soumises sans cesse aux chances d* la loterie des 6v6nemens . " Yet Englishmen and Americans , // who have had an opportunity of comparing French society with that of their own countries , find difficulty in conceiving of greater calm than it still enjoys or labors under . They are astonished by the cheerfulness with which the great mass of the people resign themselves to run in fixed grooves worn by tradition , at the resignation with which they accept hereditary social position , however humble , and rely on small savings for accumulation , and at the eagerness with which they embrace present certainty , however small , in lieu of all chance of gain , however great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest government offices are competed for , eveii at the present day . The comparison suggests one or two other reflections as to the differences between French and Anglo-Saxon society , in the matter of commercial or rather pecuniary morality , which are worth consideration . French traders have never stood high in the estimation of Englishmen , as regards integrity . This has been partly one , no doubt , to national antipathy , but in a great measure to the fact that , in a country which is wanting in the commercial spirit , its merchants , like its emigrants , never come from the 6lite of the population , and never are controlled by public opinion to the same extent as in the countries in which this spirit reigns . Where there is no taste for trade , and where the traditions of trade are not respectable or inspiring , many of the persons who engage in it will be persons who have been unable to secure a firm footing in the more regular and honorable walks of life . The army , and the bench and bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French society , - using the word in its large sense , - and to their keeping French honor was committed . The merchants were little better than hucksters , struggling for existence iii a few ports under government surveillance , and blighted by the sense of social inferiority , while their brethren in England were building up a great empire in the East , and carrying their flag , sword in hand , to every corner of the world , - flattered by the monarch , taken into council by the ministers , and every year sending fresh blood into the veins of the aristocracy . But it is very doubtful whether , after all , the general feeling of French society , with regard to fraud and peculation , is not healthier than ours . I believe it is , although my opinion is not based on // practical experience , and I therefore express it with diffidence ; and yet French honesty is mainly based on honor , that is , sensitiveness to the opinion of others , while ours is based on conscience , or sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention than to put these two rules of life on the same footing ; but I think it is unquestionably true , that , in the present day , the former , in regard to all pecuniary transactions , acts with much more force than the latter . A Frenchman of the bourgeoisie , who has lost his honor , has no refuge for himself or his children : he is literally a ruined man . He has been drilled , both by his own family and by the world , from his earliest years , into regarding his honor as the highest and dearest of earthly possessions , the loss of which is the loss of all . Now , among us , honor , that is , the good opinion of one 's neighbors , does act also with considerable force . But if it breaks down in any particular case , the defaulter , or deceiver , or trickster , or peculator has still a retreat open to him , in which he is often able to find , not only an anodyne for his own conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - I mean the Church . The extent to which the Church is still in our day made a sanctuary of fugitives from social justice is at this moment one of the most discreditable features of Anglo-Saxon civilization . Cases not only abound , but increase , in which men who , having in the commercial arena lost most of the things which made life comely or respectable , including the good opinion of their neighbors , find in connection with a prominent ecclesiastical organization , and in zealous devotion to its interests , not only a sedative for their own moral sense , but a tolerably strong shield against public opinion . IDid not church organizations play the part they do in society , and did they exercise no more influence over the imagination of Americans than over that of the French , tainted speculators , or trustees , or officials would more frequently be compelled to make terms with the world , as the Frenchman is at the moment of his fall , - that is , not only to admit their fault , but come down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for the young , than the one frequently witnessed in our great cities , of men sitting in front pews , and taking an active // part in church work , and treated by pastor and people as their equal , while out of doors their credit is gone , their name tarnished , and they have made neither confession nor reparation , and have taken no steps towards reform , can hardly be conceived of . It is a spectacle the like of which , I venture to assert , is impossible in France ; and I am inclined to believe that , taking everything into consideration , a stouter resistance to fraud , which seems to be the peculiar vice of this age , has thus far been offered by what is called honor than by what is called religion . Religion is , in fact , doing more just now for humanity than for honesty . Honor is cruel and unfeeling , and it never lifts its eyes from the earth , and its heart may be full of impurity , but it pays its debts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , no society is in a sound or healthy state in which morality is not under the guardianship of something higher . When we come to ask ourselves where the remedy for all this is to be found , we get , as every one knows who has considered the subject at all , to the difficult part of it . We are met on the threshold of this inquiry , however , by one encouraging fact , and this is , that , as far as we can learn , luxury does not produce in our day the evil effects , either moral or physical , which are alleged of it in the ancient world . Of the luxuria sa ? vior armis to which the Roman satirist ascribed the ruin of the Empire we know nothing . The wildest of wealthy voluptuaries in our time are far from displaying the depraved ingenuity , the beastly excess , the inane absorption in trifles , the sloth and effeminacy and animal selfishness , which seem to have characterized the possessors of great fortunes in the ancient world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was accumulated , and the great bugbear of the philosophers . The causes of this are of course various . We might sum them up by saying that the modern rich man is a more highly civilized man , in the best sense of the word , than his classical prototype . Society , travel , books , art , science , and a certain atmosphere of selfsacrifice , by which all Christian communities , however far removed from the Christian ideal , are pervaded , have made the most besotted votary of luxury in our day a far superior being to the Domitians or Crassuses of antiquity . // It is one of the familiar facts of modern life , too , that the classes most given up to luxury respond as readily as any others to great demands on their endurance , and meet danger and suffering with even greater readiness . Consequently , the military spirit , instead of declining as it did in ancient states , with the growth of wealth , in our day seems to rise . The modern horror of war , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual than a physical feeling . It flows rather from a rational disapproval of it , a mental perception of its evils , than from personal fear of its burden or hardships . In fact , the more highly civilized communities of our time , if they are convinced of the necessity or justice of a war , rush into it with an ardor which was unknown in antiquity , and sacrifice life in it with a prodigality which has certainly never been surpassed . What is even more remarkable is , that the city population , which in the decline of Rome became worthless for military purposes , is found in modern times to be the most valuable . The Londoners , the Viennese , the Parisians , make better troops than the peasantry , are more ardent under fire , and endure the ordinary hardships of active service with much less injury . Some very striking testimony to the same effect , as regards the comparative merits as soldiers of the American population , has just been furnished in the medical reports of the United States Sanitary Commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no great social reformation has taken place , in any society , without some new agent or element being brought into play . Corruption , for instance , whether in manners or in politics , has never been got rid of by the mere disgust or repentance of the persons or class affected by it . Some external influence has had to be brought to bear on them , either in the shape of exposure to a new set of circumstances , or to the action of a new set of ideas . Powerful as Christianity proved as a moral agent , it was not equal to the political salvation of Rome . It did nothing , or next to nothing , in spite of its effect on manners , to drive away the moral languor under which the Empire finally perished . The moral renovation of European society was only effected by the influx of a fresh population , whose social education was still to be begun , and who , under the influence of Christianity , // constructed an entirely new framework of ideas on political and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline of chivalry , and the loss of the rough vigor of the barbaric period left it at the close of the Middle Ages , it was , in like manner , lifted by the combined action of the Reformation , the revival of learning , and the extinction of the great fiefs . It may , of course , be said , that these things were amongst the consequences or accompaniments of the general progress of society , but the important point is , that they brought to bear on society a new set of agents , which had not previously been at work . The corruption of the English government , - that is , the purchase of votes of the members of the House of Commons , for money , by the minister of the day , - was , during fifty years preceding the close of the American War , deep and notorious . What with members holding places , or receiving pensions , at the pleasure of the Crown , and members receiving a certain sum , in pounds , for their vote at certain divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's representatives in the House were , during a greater part of that period , in a miserable minority . Measures were seldom decided on their merits , the debates were an unmeaning farce , and it is hardly extravagant to say that political morality was extinct . Now , a great number of persons among us , when mention is made of the corruption in the American government , are in the habit of consoling themselves with the reflection that , inasmuch as the English government has worked itself pure , and got rid of the canker which was eating it away , in the last century , so , in due course of time , will ours , without the aid of extraordinary means . But this does not follow . The long wars of William and Anne left England completely exhausted . There was no middle class ; there was no press ; and public opinion , in so far as it existed at all , was feeble and inactive . The Crown was practically omnipotent . But in the following thirty years of peace , the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the press began to assert its power ; the House of Commons was exposed to the action of public opinion , by the publication of its debates ; and the Puritan element in the population , which had kept // alive , both during the coarse profligacy of the Stuart period , and the philosophical indifferentism of the Anne-Augustan period , the fires of religious and moral feeling , began to show itself on the surface of affairs , and to exert a real influence on the government . By the close of the American War , the practice of pecuniary corruption had died out , and the government found itself under the eye of a new England , which fifty years later wrested the control of affairs from the hands of the oligarchy , and proceeded to administer them in its own way . The work of purification was done by the appearance on the scene of a new social force , and not by any voluntary effort to mend their ways on the part of the corruptionists themselves . In France , before the Revolution , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption which flourished in England under Walpole was unknown . The king held the purse , and he was the supreme legislator ; but in the administration of the government everything that could be sold was salable . The judicial offices were salable , the military commissions were salable , and the collection of the taxes was farmed out . A place of honor or profit could not be had , or could be had only with great difficulty , unless it was paid for . The judicial offices were hereditary ; no one could hold a commission in the army who could not show four generations of noble ancestors . The court circle swarmed with jobbers , and dealers in places and pensions . In fact , it was composed of little else . Thirty years later , and the French service , both military and civil , was one of the purest in the world ; but the reformation had not come from the penitential exertions of the corrupt classes . It had been effected by a tremendous social and political convulsion , which had swept them out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a totally different order of men , - different in character and training , in history , and even in blood . The Tiers Etat reformed France . Now it seems , at first sight , as if these examples opened rather a melancholy prospect , not simply for democratic society in this country , but for democratic society everywhere . It seems as if it had no reserves to call up , no matter how hard pressed it might be . It has no class shut out from participation in , or influence on , public affairs , whose voice , if allowed to // make itself heard , might prove useful for warning or instruc tion , or whose self-interest , if allowed free play , might let light in on the dark places of politics . All its forces - liberty , equality , publicity , pulpit , press , and schools - are constantly and actively at work . If these do not save it , whither shall it look for succor ? It can not look for a new religion ; and if it could , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newest of the new philosophies is simply stoicism slightly retouched , and the Stoics have been preaching for two thousand years the vanity of both earthly pains and pleasures . Moreover , for some time to come , the main source of distinction , in new countries at least , must be wealth . The owners of wealth will be the possessors of real power . Birth will never again have much chance . Learning , in the nature of things , can not count for much , both because the wide diffusion of education will make the possession of a little learning common , and because the possessors of great learning will always be too few in number , and too much given to seclusion , to make much figure in society , to say nothing of the frequency with which high intellectual attainments are dissociated from the moral qualities which give men weight amongst their fellows . Nor will there be any class or organization , the membership of which will be a clear and generally recognized title to distinction . In short , it is reasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing to the nature of the work the people have to do , and in old ones , owing to the prodigious impetus given by science to the work of production , wealth will command a more general recognition as the great test and sign of success in life than anything else . He who acquires it will be a winner in the race in which everybody is engaged , and will prove himself possessed of the one talent which the majority of mankind try to cultivate . We consequently can hardly look for much immediate help in the work of mere commercial or political purification from material progress . Some special effort directed to this end will undoubtedly be necessary . What the nature of this effort should be , or how originated and how directed , it is very difficult to say with any confidence . Of course the ordinary work of education must be relied on for a great deal of what can ever be done by tak // ing thought . The feelings and practices of every man , in money matters , must largely depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears and sees at home in his boyhood . But one thing is certain , that , in the absence of any course of discipline , the mere communication of oral instruction on questions of morals , either by teacher , preacher , or parents , will do little to beget a horror either of commercial or political corruption , so long as boys see that neither one nor the other is visited by severe social penalties . Children take less on trust , or in deference to naked authority , than they used to do ; and when a boy sees his father in habits of friendly intercourse , as many a New York boy does , with persons whose knaveries and peculation he has heard him discuss and describe times without number , general homilies on honesty will not convince him of its value . The good-nature which is cultivated in society , and which , during the last forty years , for reasons which it is not necessary to go over here , has taken an inordinately , I might add mischievously , high rank amongst the virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , has done and is doing much to blunt the moral sense of the young , - how much can not be known till the generation now growing up assumes the control of affairs . No one , therefore , who wants to aid the work of reform can begin better than by displaying in his walk and conversation a sincere and hearty detestation , not of corrupt practices alone , but of those whom he and others know to be engaged in them , and of the newspapers which gloss over ill-deeds and defend evil-doers . This is an indispensable supplement to all teaching and preaching . The denunciations of the pulpit and the press have lost or are losing , their power through iteration . Nay , like heavy artillery turned against earthworks , in many cases they seem only to harden corruption into a denser and more compact mass . The most thorough-paced knaves expose themselves to this sort of fire with great readiness , and even pursue their schemes under cover of it . We must also by our legislation give human nature a fair chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out how much we do to discourage efforts towards improvement , how much to throw temptations in the way of the weak or the // wicked , - temptations more insidious and hardly less debasing than the class legislation of feudalism , - would require an article in itself . The elective judiciary furnishes one illustration . It is a fountain of corruption , sending its poison through every portion of the body politic . Experience has shown , that , if a lawyer of good character and education is put on the bench as a judge , his office made independent and surrounded with dignity , and his services fairly paid , not only will his good tendencies be strengthened , but his bad ones will be arrested . Temptation is removed from his path , and his interest to be virtuous is made so strong that , in the vast majority of cases , he will be virtuous . In electing judges for short terms , experience in this matter has been entirely disregarded . For the sake of securing a trifling good , - greater courtesy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continued strain , furnish them with the strongest temptation to be dishonest , and diminish the inducements to be upright and independent . Another and even more striking illustration is to be found in the organization of the civil service . Steady , faithful men , of real business capacity , can not , as a general rule , get appointments in it ; if , by chance , they do get into it , they find their honesty not onl f no value to them , but a positive hindrance and *5e of poverty and insecurity . In fact , it may be said , without exaggeration or misrepresentation , that the civil service of the United States is so arranged as to afford strong encouragement to dishonesty of nearly every degree .. The loss of money to the government is but a small part of the evil which flows from the system . Instead of proving , as the service of every great nation should , a school of order , economy , exactness , integrity , to which every private individual might look for instruction and example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character should be stimulated and developed , the chief influence it exerts is exerted on the side of vice and immorality . What makes its condition the more striking , is the contrast it offers to the military and naval serdces . In these organizations human nature gets a fair chance . A man can , in either of them , find constant use for all his good qualities . If he has not brilliancy , he may have honesty , and his honesty tells ; if // he has not ability , he may have steadiness , and it tells . They call into activity one of the most powerful incentives to the elevation of character , next to pure religious and moral culture , that is , professional pride , - the feeling that a man belongs to an honorable calling , the respectability of which reflects credit on him , and exacts from him in return some aid in maintaining it . Mr. Jenekes , in his late speech on the reform of the civil service , dwells most impressi*vely and instructively on the wa8te of moral power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of confirming self.respect and nourishing integrity . Frauds are almost unknown in the army and navy , and yet the opportunities of peculation are great , and the officers are generally poor ; but they are influenced by a generous pride in their calling , and a generous anxiety for the fair fame of the brotherhood to which they belong ; and though they are drawn from the same race and the same rank of society as the officers of the civil service , they are as much a credit and protection to the nation as the others are , as a class , a disgrace and a canker . After all , then , we have instruments of reform lying unused . Many others might be enumerated beside those already pointed out . Social improvement depends on the application of obvious remedies . Even those who are most despondent about the future of society may find comfort in the assurance afforded by a careful reading of history , that there is always a force at work , as constant as that which makes the grass grow and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the eye in this century , or in that country , nevertheless , on the whole , carries the race forward , and leaves each generation in a position which it would not willingly exchange for that of the generation preceding . The world said to have recognized the existence and activity of this forceX till after the downfall of the Roman Empire ; but ever since then it has filled the earth with a hope , the very strength and luxuriance of which often make special efforts towards reform seem too puny to be important ; and this has a tendency to paralyze individual exertion . It is in this that the modern reformer finds his greatest stumbling-block.
