txt Messages received at the War Department , dated at Gen. McCracts.AN 's headquarters , 12 M. , state that all was quiet in that vicinity . Preparations for Crossing the Chickahominy ? Sudden Rise in the **  --  Scenes on the Line of the Rebel Retreat  --  Consternation in Richmond . NEAR MECHANICSVILLE , Va. , Monday , 10 A. M. , June 2 , 1862 . Yesterday passed without the right wing of the Union army being engaged in battle , although at about noon an action was manifestly anticipated . All the preparations for crossing Chickahominy River were completed , and the troops were under orders to march at a moment 's notice . The river , however , which had commenced rising during the preceding night , increased in depth at a rapid rate throughout the day , making the process of constructing bridges so excessively difficult , besides delaying other important movements to such an extent , that it was considered advisable to postpone for a time the advance movement . From 9 A. M. till 9:30 A , M. the river rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy shower , the effect of which will be to swell the river still more ; thereby extending the period of our delay . Our non-appearance on the other side of the river this morning may be attributed solely to the fact of the inundation . Yesterday afternoon CARLISLE 'S Battery gave the rebels the benefit of some 20-pounder Parrot 's , but failed to elicit a single response . The firing on the left wing had nearly ceased at about noon . But few particulars of the battle have as yet reached us . Shortly after 1 P. M. , a dispatch was read to the troops to the effect that our force on the left wing had defeated the rebels at every point , which Intelligence was received with loud and continued cheers . Later in the day it was reported that the rebels were retreating toward Richmond , which proves to have been th ? case . A messenger from the left wing who came in late last night , stated that two contrabands had escaped from Richmond and reached our camps , bringing with them important information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond  --  a distance of six miles  --  was one continuous line of dead , dying and wounded men , and presented a sight so horrible that they would not return to the spot upon any consideration whatever . They added further , that every house on the way and numerous houses in Richmond were filled with the rebel wounded . The utmost consternation existed among all classes , the citizens having no confidence in the troops , and the troops having no confidence in themselves . A panic was raging , and everything looked dark and ominous for the rebel army . Their loss was fearful to the extreme . At daylight this morning the rebels seemed to have abandoned their position on the left , and taken a position directly in our front , as if they expected us to cross the river . They also got into position a battery of six pieces of artillery , pointing toward Chickahominy Bridge . Two hours later , and they were returning to Richmond , taking with them the artillery above alluded to . The cause of this sudden retreat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our left wing , or an anticipated attack from our gunboats on James River , which are now moving up toward the city , the obstructions in the river having been swept away by the recent freshet . The following communication , which speaks for itself , was received yesterday by Col. MASON , of the Seventh Maine Regiment : STATE OF MAINE . EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT , AUGUSTA , May 23 , lbti2 . MY DEAR COLONEL : We have heard in Maine of the splendid fighting of the Seventh Maine in the late engagement at Williarnsburgh , and we feel to honor and bless that noble band of brave and devoted men .
