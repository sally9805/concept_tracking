Foes come for booty , blood , and spoil ; Remember Howard , who beat back , At Cowpens , Tarleton 's fierce attack , A chief that feared not ruin black , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! Last signer of our glory 's scroll , Maryland ! Was Carroll , of the dauntless soul , Maryland ! Avenge the blood by heroes shed , When Treason trampled on the dead , And streets of Baltimore were red , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! The land that gave the nation Key , Maryland ! Who sang the war-song of the Free , Maryland While the sun rises in the east , And patriots throng to Freedom 's feast , Shall be our poet and high-priest , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! When aimed our cannon in the fray , Maryland ! Remembered on the battle-day , Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noblest son of fame  --  Fell treason they would brand with shame , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! One sword-stroke for the good old flag , Maryland ! Down with secession 's shameless rag , Maryland ! The glorious Stars and Stripes uphold , That over Yorktown were unrolled  --  Oh ! march beneath that banner fold , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! The land we fight for shall not fall , Maryland ! While blown is Union 's bugle call , Maryland ! Up from the sleep of years , and fight While treason 's banner is in sight , And shout : " Let God maintain the right ! " Maryland ! Our Maryland ! We come with banner , lance and sword , Maryland ! To guard the soil by Wirt adored , Maryland ! In God alone we place our trust , Blood on our sword instead of rust , Our star flag shall not trail in dust , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! Up for the conflict , one and all , Maryland ! Earth will be darkened like a pall , Maryland ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare , no arm to save , Above the free soil of the brave , Maryland ! Our Maryland ! Let the drums beat " to arms ! to arms ! " Maryland ! Leave cottage homes , and shops , and farms , Maryland ! Rush , as your sires to conflict rushed , Rebellion 's war-cry must he hushed , The serpent of Secession crushed , Maryland ! Our Maryland !
