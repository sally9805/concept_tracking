Main text I ( BACK-ROOM AT PORTER 'S  --  DICK , SOLUS . ) I am not well to-night  --  methinks the fumes Of overheated punch have something dimmed The cerebellum or pineal gland , Or where the soul sits regent . Strange that things Born of the grosser elements of earth Should cloud the mind 's own heaven with fantasies ! I am no baby  --  look upon that leg All laced with steely sinews  --  see that arm , Embossed with swelling muscle  --  and this shape Of nature 's best expansion  --  were they made But to be sneered at by the grinning imps That leave the dotard 's slumbers visionless , To play their antics in the teeth of manhood ? ( Fellow , another measure of your compound , And be less liberal of your aqueous tincture . ) A man who hath been elbowed out of office , A poet who hath sown some score of verses , And reaped one sorry sentence of damnation , Look down i ' the mouth , and feel unutterably  --  But one who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save at dinner time , And is not snarled at by the world about him , Can do but little , save to fume and fret At air-born hydras of imagination . And yet , in these same most degenerate days , There be some things that do much gall a man ( Looking at his boots . ) Methinks the polish of these nether casings Is not so radiant as it was of old  --  Perhaps the varlet who doth give them lustre Hath ta'en to reading of philosophy , For learning has of late put off her wings , And creeps along with beggars in the dust .  --  Why , I have seen a kitchen-nurtured wench , With feet that seemed like mountain pedestals , And fingers redder than the peony , Who tripped so daintily upon the earth , As she were stepping on Elysian flowers ; And did so dally with the household stuff , As if a saucepan were an instrument Fit for the music of angelic choirs . She 'd quote you loving ditties by the hour , And scribble verses in your Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flowers , And mind , and metaphysics . Out upon them  --  I 'd rather have a Patagonian savage , One that can grapple with the mountain bear , And eat him as a Christian eats a chicken , Than such a mincing thing to wait upon me . Fellow , here 's money for thine aliments , I must away . ( Exit . ) II ( DICK , SOLUS WITH A NEWSPAPER .  --  SMOKING PITCHER ON THE TABLE ) No murders and no robberies ,  --  speeches  --  speeches , Column on column one eternal speech ; Now I had rather read your pirate-stories , Of men minced up and shovelled overboard , Your slitting throats , and knocking out of brains , And such well-spiced misdoings  --  ( Enter TOM . ) Save you , Tom , How goes your nothingship ,  --  and gentle Julia , How does she fare ,  --  the lady of thy love . Tom . Her good old grandam 's dead  --  Dick . Why then the devil May sharpen up his claws to deal with her ; She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to tread less rudely on the ashes Of one that was a woman . You are wont To speak unfitly of the fairest thing That stepped on Eden 's roses . Why should man Scoff at the creatures he was made to love ? It is as if the iron-fibred oak Should tear the clasping tendrils .  --  Dick . Save your nonsense To feed your starving poetry withal ; I hate to see resuscitated thoughts Come sneaking back to life in ladies 's albums . Pray talk to me as if I were a man ,  --  Look ,  --  do I wear a petticoat or breeches ? Have I long locks ? Is this a woman 's foot ? Is aught of silver in these brazen tones ? Fill up your glass ,  --  here 's to thy sanity . Tom . O beast ! You drink as if you were a Titan , Just hot from Etna . What would Julia say , If she could dream of such abominations ! Dick . Would she might taste this punch ! I much opine She 'd soon forswear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' t would vivify a statue , Could statue but its marble lips unclose : I would I were upon an ocean of thee  --  A bowl my boat  --  a ladle for mine oar : Green islands in the ever-blooming south Should scatter flowers upon thee  --  and the fires That roll and flash in earth 's unfathomed bosom , Should keep thee steaming hot . That 's poetry . Tom . Insensate wretch ; can nothing stir thy soul , But tempests brewed from earthly elements ? No light break through thy darkness , save a gleam , The offspring of corruption ? Is there nought Can cheat thee for a moment of thy grossness ? Dick . He 's talking big ,  --  I 'll wake the imp within him . ( Aside . ) I can not blame thee  --  nay , I pity thee For such unseemly license of thy tongue ; Touched in the brain ,  --  I feared it might be so ; ' T was wrong  --  it was most cruel in the girl , To play so false a game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parson , and a man in whiskers . Tom . Oh devil ! what ! speak , let me hear it all  --  Not Julia ! Parson ! whiskers ! tell me all , And I will love thee . Dick . Who has spoke of Julia ? Are there no women in the world but Julia ? I was but thinking of an ancient spinster , Miss Sally or Miss Celia Somebody , That ran away from Time to play with Cupid . Tom . Lend me your kerchief  --  I am much exhausted : What if I 'd drawn that razor  --  Dick . There 'd have been Another tombstone , and a lie upon it . I would have dressed you an obituary , That should be really decent , and have written With mine own hands a fancy epitaph . Tom . Come , you are caustic ,  --  but you know my nature . I 'll show thee something for thine age to dream of , A token of her beauty and her love ; Look at that auburn ringlet , boy , and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her own white fingers did unweave the ray From the soft coronal of light and beauty . Dick . Call you that auburn ? it is hardly crimson . There is a something of Aurora red  --  A something like to filaments of flame ,  --  And yet they are not cobwebs in their texture , Right thick and rosy . Tom . Ha ! what is't you say ? Take that to help you in your rhetoric . ( Striking DICK . ) Dick . Infant ! I will not beat thee . Here 's a chair . And here 's a neckcloth  --  yes , and here 's a towel , And I will truss thee like a callow goose . ( Trying him to the chair . ) So , thou art fixed , thou paralytic tiger  --  I 'm sorry to have been so rough with thee , How is it , do you call it auburn still ? Tom . Were every muscle beaten to a pulp , And my bones powdered , I would call it auburn . Dick . There 's tragedy ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step with something leaden in it , As one that is not full of merriment ,  --  I 'll fling my cloak upon you  --  there , keep still . Tom . I 'm d  --  dly battered , an ' it please the Tutor . ( Enter TUTOR . ) Tutor . Men ye are troublous ,  --  there has been a noise , As of exceeding vehement discussion . If ye must talk of controverted things , Wait till your beards do give you gravity . ( Exit . ) III ( DICK , solus . ) Ay  --  if a viper coiled upon her doorstep  --  If the broad river were a stream of fire And I must cross it on a raft of tinder  --  If Cerberus stood keeper of the toll , And I were penniless  --  I 'd see the girl . A vixen and a jilt  --  but still I love her . An arrant baggage , who would tear my letters To paper up her hair  --  but still I love her . Not that the rose is fairer on her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Than half the seraph sisterhood can boast . Where lurks the influence that thus can steal , Like the sweet music of a prisoned lyre , Through all the marble barriers of the heart ? So are we tempered , that we know not why We love or hate , we follow or we shun . Is it in outward seeming ? do we stoop To meet the bending statute ? do we press The lips that glow unbreathing on the canvas ? Nay , are there not a thousand living shapes That are like shadows to the listless soul , Lifeless and pulseless ? yet we turn from them To one less fair , and think her born of heaven . Who sees the bow when Love lets loose the shaft ? A plague upon the nice anatomy That cuts up feeling into curves and angles . Her eye is blue  --  and so too is her bonnet  --  Her forehead white  --  so is a sheet of paper  --  Her hair is golden  --  I can buy enough Of just such hair to fill a bushel basket  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ; And this is what you get for analyzing . But take her in the whole , form , voice , and motion , I love the compound .  --  If she loves not me , Why , she has lost a  --  might pretty fellow ; A six-foot man , with most effulgent whiskers , And two good hands to put in empty pockets . I wonder how my grandam stood the frost . How the old spider hangs upon her cobweb ! They say her will is made , and when she tumbles , Perhaps a pension to her gray-beard tom-cat , Some small post mortem acts of piety , To crutch her poor rheumatic soul upon , And I shall dust the dear old lady 's guineas . Ha ! when we rattle in our own good tandem , And crack the ivory-handled whip we paid for , There 'll be a stir among the plumes and ribbons ! Lightly he treads who steps on golden slippers  --  Sweetly he speaks whose purse has music in it . Pray die , dear grandam ; we will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a sermon To call you pretty names , and buy some kerchiefs To soak up bitter tears , and feed your tomcat , As if he never scratched us  --  curse upon him . ( Enter six BORES . ) All . A pleasant evening  --  Dick . Yes a pleasant evening , A devilish pleasant evening out of doors . 1st Bore . What have you here to eat ? I am not hungry , But I might taste a pie ; I am not thirsty , But I might drink to please these honest fellows ; Or , as I mean to sit , I 'll smoke a little . Dick . We 're out of victual and we 're out of wine , There 's water in the pail  --  smoke and be d  --  d. 2d Bore . Lend me a book , I mean to sit a little , And I am not in mood for conversation . Dick . Here 's Worcester 's Walker 's Johnson 's Dictionary ; Open at Ass  --  a very fitting subject . 3d Bore . I saw your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely hearty . O what a blessing such a woman is ! In all the circle of domestic love There is no greater  --  Dick . No , there is no greater  --  Just as you say  --  a most eternal blessing . 4th Bore . I 'll take a nap  --  you 'll wake me in an hour , Or two at farthest  --  so I 'll shut the door . ( Goes into the bedroom . ) Dick . And I will lock it . Sleep till bedbugs wake you . ( Locks the door. ) 5th Bore . Come boy , let 's have a game or two of chequers Before we try the chess , and then backgammon , Or else a little whist  --  just run along And order up some claret and some oysters . Dick . My board is broken and my foot is lame . 6th Bore . I think of making something of a call , And so I 'll take my coat and waistcoat off , Wait a few hours until the rest are gone And I will read you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five Bores . O , there 's a row  --  good night  --  we 'll call again . ( Exeunt five BORES . ) Dick , solus . Go , blessed boobies , and the devil singe you  --  Sleep , snoring lubber , and the night-fiend gnaw you  --  Another step before the door is bolted ! ( Enter TOM . ) Ah , soft Lothario , with thy lady cheek , Didst thou exhale upon us from a dew-drop ? Or wast thou wafted on an evening zephyr ? Tom . I hang myself to-morrow  --  Julia 's bolted ! Off in a tangent with that ugly captain ! I did not care for Julia  --  I was tired Of all her tricks and fancies  --  but to think Of such a rocket tied to such a stick Would make one hang himself for human folly . So once again , for universal woman ! Does the new coat sit close about the waist ? Dick . Ay , put a pismire 's girdle on a porpoise , It will sit closer than a sailor 's jacket . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose or two of bleaching salts , And run a razor round the barren course , And when you 're hanged for stealing , men will say He was a pale , thin pigmy , with a beard . Tom . Why , man you 're biting as a seedling radish . Did Clara pout ? nay , do not look so rosy , Her mother told me all about your love , And asked me of your prospects and your standing ; I told her  --  but no matter what I told her . Dick . The wrinkled hag  --  and thou , infernal imp , What didst thou say ? Tom . I only now remember Some general hints about your evil habits , Your sad propensity to gin and water , Your singular asperity of temper  --  I did not call you absolutely dirty , But only rather slovenly and careless  --  For rank , that you was like a serpent 's rattle , That makes some noise , though very near the tail  --  That as to money , save the bills you owed , You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like it , but it was my duty , And I am honest , so I tell you all . Dick . Now , fellow , I will mash you to a pumice , Or beat thee to a tumor  --  Tom . Hold a moment It was all stuff  --  I never saw the woman ; But since you seemed in such a frosty mood , I fired a squib at your philosophy And laughed to see it catch  --  so keep your beating To make your children grow .  --  Now come along And drown your anger in a good potation . Dick . And you curry people down with lies , And smooth it with a julep . But I 'll go , And leave that sleeping carrion in the bedroom , Among his brother vermin ,  --  peace be with him . ( Exeunt. )
