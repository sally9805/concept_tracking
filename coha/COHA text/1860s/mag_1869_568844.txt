ARTICLE 11. - THE AMERICAN COLLEGES AND THE AMERI CAN PUBLIC . III . Ix the two preceding papers with this title we have treated of the studies and the methods of instruction which are best aiapted to the American colleges , in their present condition , and in their present relations to the sentiments and the culture of the country . A few topics of a somewhat general and miscellaneous character remain to be considered . These are no less important and are perhaps more interesting than those which have hitherto occupied our attention . The most of these topics relate to the college as a commun*-ty . Sufficient prominence is not always given to the social and common life which characterizes most of the American colleges . There are a few of these institutions , it is true , in which these influences are not especially noticeable . Those colleges in our large cities in which nearly all the students reside at home , and none live in common lodgings , have a much less marked and energetic public life . The students in these institutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are not separated from the life of the family ; but this continues to exert its accustomed , though a somewhat divided influence . The excitements of society out of the family are as much within the reach of the student as before he entered college , and are likely with the progress of his student-life to be more and more attractive and engrossing . The intellectual influences of the students upon one another are mainly restricted to the class-room and the occasional debate . They do not proceed from a social life which is created by residing in common lodgings , eating at common tables , and participating in common conversations , sports , and festivities . Those colleges in which the number of students is very small , furnish a public opinion which , it may be , is less active for evil ; possibly one that is less efficient and controlling for good . It may not be // easy to analyze this subtle but most potent agency into its various elements and to assign to each constituent its relative force . Indeed the product itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same in any two institutions ; each individual college having a genius loci of its own , which is in part dependent on traditionary influences and in part affected by the force of living men and of current events . This spirit varies in the same college , and it may be with each college generation . There are , however , a few salient features that are common to all these colleges and that are active at all times , which it is not difficult to enumerate . These influences are not always adequately estimated even by those who have enjoyed the exhilaration and hare been stimulated by the force of this highly oxygenated atmosphere . Those who have not experienced them find it difficult to estimate them at their real value , and often listen with incredulous questionings to tl ) e representations of their great importance , or look with silent wonder upon the excitement which they occasion in the young collegian as he begins to feel the stimulus of this peculiar life , and in the gray-headed student whenever he greets an old classmate with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with a special enthusiasm . It is important that they should not be overlooked in any attempt to vindicate the college system against the prejudices or misconceptions which are entertained by its censors and judges of the American public . Possibly the discussion may result in a higher appreciation of the indispensable value of such an agency in a state of society like our own and of the duty r*sting upon the philanthropist and the patriot to make it more efficient and abundant in its influences for good . The college community is emphatically an isolated commu nity ; more completely separated and farther removed than almost any other from the ordinary and almost universally pervading influences of family and social life . When the student leaves his home to enter college , it is true that in a most important sense he leaves it forever . He literally leaves father and mother , not in his affections or his respect ; for both of these feelings may remain with him and grow // stronger and tenderer with absence and the progress of years ; but he does leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert over his opinions , sentiments* and aims . He may do this unconsciously and most unwillingly , but he does it none the less truly and emphatically . When the father has carefully provided for the comfort of his son in the apartments which are henceforward to be his new home , he little thinks of the import of what he has done . When the mother takes her affectionate and most anxious leave of the boy who goes forth into his new life , she little dreams how true it is that she loses him as a boy forever . The public opinion of the little community which has hitherto formed his aspirations and his hopes , his principles and his prejudices , is henceforth to cease to be controlling ; in the future it will either entirely give way to another , or will share with it a doubtfhl and divided influence . The public opinion of the larger community of mankind which had begun to be felt through the openings which the family life had allowed , is swept away by the new atmosphere that rushes around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Removed from the restraints of home , not yet subjected to the restraints and responsibilites of society and its public opinion , the college student is abruptly introduced into an isolated and peculiar community , which is eminently seWcontained and self-sufficing , most energetic in its action and all-pervading in its presence . This common opinion is sensitive and changeable ; often it is capricious and unreasonable ; it exerts over all the members of the commonwealth a subtle and resistless fascination . Something of this influence is exerted in a large public school  --  but the influences of the college community are immensely more energetic and enduring . This is owing to many reasons . The college student is older and though for that reason he should be less pliable and more self-relying and independent , yet the first form in which the developing man asserts his being is ordinarily to attach himself to a society of those who like himself are ready to withstand the control of his natural enemies . " It is no paradox to say that the first essay of the student 's independence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of the college community . This // opinion he at first has little share in forming : he does little else than yield himself to the opinion which he finds already formed . This community has its traditions , which are represented to be sacred by age and uniform observance ; its customs , which are so ancient that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary , i.e. for one college generation ; its self . constituted and venerable lawgivers in the guise of certain loud mouthed personages who are often little better than disguised sons of Belial ; its natural aristocracy of eminent scholars , distinguished writers , prize and honor men , boating men , and gymnasts . To these should be added its ladies ' men , its fancy men , its fast men , its witty men , and its stupid and silly men , through all the varieties of the Dii majoruim et minorum gentium* who make up the college mythology . It is eminently a law unto itself , making laws and enforcing them which no other community would recognize or understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received commandments of God and of man . It has standards of character which are peculiar to itself , unlike those which the great world recognizes , but which are well understood and most efficient within its own limited circle . It has an intellectual atmosphere of its own , stimulating to extraordinary and long continued labor , and to austere self-denial , sometimes unwise in the aims and methods of activity which it enforces . Its social customs , laws , and criteria , are the products of its isolated and peculiar life , and are an unsolved enigma to all other societies . Jts ethical and religious life is marked by singular excellencies and as striking inconsistencies and defects ; sometimes sinking far below the rules and attainments of men in other communities and sometimes soaring loftily above them . No community is swayed more completely by the force of public opinion . In none does public opinion solidify itself into so compact and homogeneous a force . Before its power the settled judgments of individual conviction are often abandoned or overborne , the sacred associations of childhood are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misinterpreted or defied . Notwithstanding the unnatural virulence of the morbid epidemics with which this community is occasionally visited , and the steady operation of certain endemic tendencies to evil , justice // requires us to assert that the prevailing influences are not only healthful but are eminently vitalizing . In no community of persons of immature age is the intellect more likely to be efficiently awakened , and on the whole to be more wisely directed , than in this commonwealth . In none is real merit more likely to be discerned , or when discerned is it more generously acknowledged . In no community are the fictitious distinctions of life , as of wealth , birth , and mariners , of so little account in comparison with intellect , generosity and openheartedness . In none do the rich and poor meet together on terms more honorable to the rich and more acceptable to the poor , than on the arena dignified by the presence of earnest intellectual labor , and cheered by the sunshine of youthful sympathy . In none are shallowness , pretension , and shams more quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no community in which young men live together are that conceit and assumption which are as natural to many youth as teething is to infancy , more effectually rebuked and more quietly abandoned . Even the resident traditionary follies and sins of the place , its antagonisms against the faculty and the law , the occasional frightful evasions and untruth in the acts and words of otherwise honorable and honest students in their dealings with the government , and the jealousies and fends between classes and factions , are many of them exaggerated and perverted virtues , so that the very " failings of college students , however inexcusable and injurious they are , may be truly said to " lean to virtue 's side . " In respect to the moral dangers which attend a residence in this peculiar community , very superficial and very unjust impressions prevail . Our opinion is , and we believe it will be confirmed by the most extended observation and the most accruate statistics , that there is no community in which this preiminently critical period of life can be spent with greater safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken to describe the dangers and enumerate the failures which oefall an equal number of young men selected from families of similar conditions in life , whether at home or among strangers , whether passing their youth as farmers or mechanics , as clerks or students , it would be found that the moral results // alone would be in favor of the life at a well-regulated college . Many of the dangers and evils of the college are eminently short-lived , being quickly ended by their own excess and extravagance ; maiy are abandoned , outgrown or repressed by means of the very intensity and publicity which they assume . Many of them are the results of artificial crises , somewhat like those which are superinduced by a physician , for the expulsion of morbific matter . Many of them are laughed at and are frowned down by the better sense and the mature experience of the older students and the more advanced classes . It is noticed in some of our colleges  --  and we believe it is true of many-that some of the lower vices and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less prevalent among the older than among the younger classes , as the natural result of the public and private influences exerted by the college community , apart from any special moral or religious improvement . The consideration of the common life of the college is essential to a just estimate of its importance . Without it the college can neither be understood nor appreciated . It is a true and pregnant saying , " You send your child to the schoolmaster , but t is the schoolboys who educate him . " The studies , the systems and methods of teaching , the knowledge and skill of the instructors , do not constitute the whole of the educating influences of the college . Often they do not furnish half of those influences which are most effectual , which are longest remembered or which are most highly valued . It is true that without the first the second could not be exerted , for they could not exist . The more obvious and essential elements of the college also exert upon its common life a positive and formative influcuce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the crystalline material is gathered in bright and beauteous order , but they act as living germs which shoot vitalizing influences through an organized body . But they are not themselves the whole of the body , nor do they include all the forces which it has at command Yery many eyen of those college graduates who have turned to the best account all the resources which their alma mater could furnish feel themselves quite as much // indebted to the educating influences of its community for the awakening and direction of their energies , as to their studies or their instructors . The examples of successful effort which are constantly present , the inspiration that is derived from the striking achievements witnessed by themselves , the kind words of a classmate or a college-mate , the encouragement spokei at a critical momeut , the prevailing estimate of literary and artistic tastes above the vulgar aspirations after wealth and power which is inwrought into the very fibres of the soul of every genuine college alumnus , his pronounced aversion to all sorts of Philistinism  --  the inbreathing for years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pervaded by " light ; " these ,  --  together with the warmth of college friendships , the earnestness of college rivalries , the revelations of character , the manifestations of growth , the issues of villainy and passion in retribution and shame , the reward of perseverance and fidelity in triumph and honor-all make the college world to the student to be full of excitement in its progress and to abound in the warmest recollections in the retrospect . The men whom the student knew so thoroughly in college become ever afterwards the representatives and types of all other men ; the incidents which there occurred are examples of all other events ; its loves arid its hatreds , its triumphs and defeats are those by which he ever afterwards reads and interprets society and literature , politics and history . The intellectual stimulus and education which are furnished by the college community are of a kind which neither circumstances nor instructors can impart . They are eminently a selfeducation . Most of the efforts at self-improvement which are prompted by the independent movements of one 's fellows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the voluntary activities of awakening manhood and of dawning responsibility . They train to the dignity and duty of self culture . The studies which they directly foster and inspire are preeminently literary and rhetorical studies , because these studies are more dependent on individual tastes and individual culture , and from their very nature can not be successfully prescribed nor enforced in the regular curriculum . // Studies and ambitions of this sort are indeed not unfrequently irregular , desultory , and unwise . They often interfere very seriously with the thorough mastery of the curriculum of the college . Excessive attention to them sometimes weakens the intellectual energies , induces bad intellectual habits , depraves the taste , and perverts the judgment . But with all these abatements , the intellectual excitement and guidance which are indirectly furnished from the community of fellow students are to many a man the influences of all others which leave the strongest impression bec*use , it is with these that he connects the first consciousness of awakening power , the earliest sense of independent activity and the beginnings of a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , some incident casually occurring in the varied course of college experience , some conversation of a wise and faithful adviser , some achievement of a classmate or friend , is remembered as a starting or turning point in the intellectual life . Nor are the social influences less important in the formation of the character and the furnishing of the man with the beginnings of all kinds of practical knowledge . It may be said that the college world is a narrow and peculiar world , is artificial and factitious in many of its workings , is greatly unlike the larger and freer world of mankind , and is therefore incapable of serving as a preparation for the actual life for which it must so soon be exchanged . Whatever may be its disadvantages in these respects , the advantages which it brings are manifold . The intimacies are most unreserved , the opportunities for the study and interpretation of character are various and long continued . It is at this period of life that the man is , if ever , proverbially frank and transparent , open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations , which are open to the inspection of one 's fellows and often are forced upon their attention . The leisure and curiosity of this morning of life , together with the zest with which its novel experiences of research and discovery are enjoyed , all contribute to give energy and interest to this study of character . This study of character must involve the constant exercise of ethical judgments and the training of the moral // powers . That there are peculiar exposures and dangers of a practical sort from this excited aud one-sided life in an isolated and self-sufficing community , can not be denied . That not a few are misled by its special temptations , not merely nor chiefly to vices and prodigalities of a grosser sort , but to a refined and subtle insensibility to good that is more insidious and not less really evil , will be confessed by many . That the moral power often become paralyzed in some of their functions and incapable either of right judgments or active feelings on certain classes of ethical questions , is one of those ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the guardian and instructor of one or many victims of these abnormal ethical paroxysms , the question will often present itself whether he ought to be more vexed or amused at these instances of suspended animation in the conscience . And yet with all these biassing and perverting influences , it is found to be true that the observations and experiences of college life are often eminently effective in educating and quickening the conscience and in awakening and directing the moral faculty . The failures and derelictions of college life , and even the occasional paralysis of the conscience of which we have spoken , may serve most important uses as warnings from similar repetitions . The moral lessons of college life are indeed sometimes learned at a i ) ainful and bitter cost . But similar experiences are not uncommon with youth in every situation of life . Perhaps under no circumstances can they be made with a more wholesome and permanent ethical effect . The religious influences of this common life should not be omitted . We suppose that the college is a truly Christain institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers are concerned . There are not a few reasons why the public life of such an institution should be favorable to earnest religious thought and a positive religious faith . The life of the student is necessarily intellectual and reflective ; whatever subjects are studied , the study of them involves intellectual effort and studious attention . During the period of college life the earnest mind often encounters those questionings which require a decided answer , and it awakes to thoughts which can not be repressed . It is haunted by the presence of mysterious // realities which can not be dispelled . The prospect of coming manhood with the responsibilities of individual character and of independent life , at once sobers and elevates . It often happens that many nearly allied as friends and classmates , ate moved to similar earnest emotions and to like searching inquiries . The common sympathies of a familiar circle thus occupied quicken the better emotions and favor the happiest results . The temptations in college to sensualisti and to unbelief are manifold ; but so are the influences which favor an earnest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small who look back to the common life of the college as the beginning or the helper of the higher life of the Christian . Were the religions influences that proceed from the colleges of this country to be withdrawn or sensibly diminished , it would seem that the Gospel itself might almost cease to be acknowledged ,  --  so manifold are the relations of each generation of college students to the faith and life of the whole Christian Church . The effects of these varied intellectual , social , ethical , and religious influences are so powerful and salutary that it may well be questioned whether the education which they impart does not of itself more than repay the time and money which it costs , even to those idlers at college who derive from their residence little or nothing more than these accidental or incidental advantages . The constant companionship with the members of a community professedly devoted to intellectual pursuits and elevated by literary tastes , the constantly renewed interest in those incidents which will ever break forth from its exuberant and irrepressible life , the pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be unheeded even by the most thoughtless and perverse , elevate the life of the merest laggard and drone at college immeasurably above the life of the luxurious do-nothing who haunts the saloons , promenades the streets , and lounges at the concerts and theatres of a large city , or who drones away the animal , most likely the sensual life , of a rich man s son in the country . Such idlers sometimes awake to manliness and to duty when they leave college . However heavy may be the burden which they carry through life as the result of folly and waste , they // rarely fail to have stored up an abundant stock of rich experiences as well as of pleasant recollections which makes their college life to have been anything rather than a want and a loss . Even if they sink downward with no recovery , their descent is retarded by the associations of dignity and self respect with which their previous access to culture has enriched them . We have dwelt somewhat at length upon the features of the college as pre*iininary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable that these influences should be cherished and fostered , and how far would any proposed changes in the college system be likely seriously to impair their beneficent influence ? Is it desirable that this peculiar life of the college should be retained and fostered or should it be curtailed and crippled ? We reply with an indignant defiance of all sorts of low auct highlived Philistines , let it he retained ! Let it not only be retained but let it be intensified and turned to far more effective results . We are sure that in these answers we have with us not only the warm hearts , but the sober convictions of all classes of collegians . The experiences of the college life are too valuable and its manifold recollections are too precious to be sacrificed , to satisf*y the vulgar prejudices of envious illiterates , and the prosaic theories of Quixotic reformers . Whatever else is taken from the college , its associations , its friendships , and its inspiring influences must all remain . The low-lived utilitarianism of this money-loving age may grudge the waste of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counting house or in the field . The self-seeking rivaiships of hard faced greed may scorn its generous impulses . The sharp-faced and venal politician may see but little money in ite elections and offices . The cold blooded realist may laugh at its romantic dreams . The man of wide experience may sneer at the inordinate conceit and the extravagant expectations of the great men of the college year or of the college society as " carpet-knights , " but it still remains true that there is in college life , with all its ignorance and its romance , its follies and its conceit , a wellspring of living waters , of which these Gentiles of the outer court may never taste , and a sanctuary into which these inhabitants of Philistia are not worthy to be admitted . Of // these living fountains and this hallowed sanctuary let all the initiated say , they shall ever be guarded by our loyal arms as they are hallowed in our best and most generous recollections . Though the ignorant may despise them we know their worth , though the vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have drunk of these refreshing waters and wandered in the sacred shades , can never forget , because we can never lose their life-giving and ennobling influences . To all the prosaic arguments of educational reformers and the passionate appeals of envious Philistines , we lift up the triumphant song of reply , * Gaudeamus igitur * * * * Pereant osores , quivis anti bursc , 4ius atque irrisores . " We will not , however , appeal solely to the feelings of those who are already convinced , nor to the unreflecting preferences of those who judge from their own direct experience . We think it is susceptible of satisfactory proof that in such a country as ours , the peculiar influences of the common life of the college are of the greatest consequence , to deliver it from that gross vulgarity of taste and superficial conceit of knowledge to which we are especially exposed . Among the conservative and elevating influences which are most efficient in the promotion of general culture there are few so important as the refining influences of the college life . It takes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of life which io most susceptible of permanent influences -- at the period when they are not too old to be easily moulded , and not too young to lose the forms into which they are shaped . It isolates them from the world . It surrounds and permeates their very being with the intense and quickening atmosphere ofa community of youths slightly older than themselves , who are already at home in the place , and therefore masters of the situation , and with a public opinion as overpowering as heat and as searching as light . These strangers are by natural attractions and repulsions drawn closely together as allies and friends , and before they are aware they begin to understand the s*icrcd import of the words " class " and " classmate . " Within the class , like soon finds its like , and friendships are speedily formed on the basis of mutual sympathy which are so closely cemented under the varied experiences of the college as to // continue unbroken for life . The pursuits of this community are professedly intellectual . The thoughts and opinions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intellectual themes . The labors and anxieties , the strifes and victories , the discussions of persons and things , the loves and the hostilities , turn chiefly upon subjects . of an elevated character . For four consecutive years , beginning as boys and ending as men , the members of this community make a common experience , with interruptions frequent and long enough to give greater zest to their peculiar excitements . This life has conventionalities and factitious distinctions of its own , but they are grounded on no such false and superficial reasons as are those of the great world without , but are far more just , more honest , more sagacious , and more generous than are the distinctions of that coarser world . True manhood in intellect and character is in no community so sagaciously discerned and so honestly honored as in this community . Pretensions and shams are in none more speedily and cordially detected and exposed . Whether displayed in manners or in intellectual efforts , conceit is rebuked and effectually repressed . Modest merit and refined tastes are appreciated , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many . Each individual spectator of the goings on of this active life is learning intellectual and moral lessons which he can not forget if he would , and which he would not if he could , and he comes away with a rich freight of the most salutary experiences , of culture in his tastes , his estimates of character , his judgments of life , as well as in the positive achievements of literary taste and power . Let any reflecting man think for a moment of the kind of education which society furnishes to . a great extent in this country , apart from these higher influences . Let him reflect on the trickery of business , the jobbery of politicians , the slang of newspapers , the vulgarity of fashion , the sensationalism of popular books , the shallowness and cant that dishonor the pulpit and defile worship , and he may reasonably rejoice that there is one community which for a considerable period takes into its keeping many of the most susceptible and the most promising of our youth , to give them better tastes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them to despise all sorts of intellectual and moral shams . Whatever overweening importance the college student may attach to his own artificial life , with its factitious distinctions and its one-sided tastes , it is at least satisfactory to know that what he values and rejoices in is not in the direction of the ignoble , the selfish , the pretentious , and the trickish ; that he has been taught to honor what is true , solid , and permanent , and perhaps brings away from the scene of his discipline refined tastes for the beautiful in literature and art , which shall adorn his own life and brighten that of others . Were we to tear out of our American life the civilizing and culturing influences which proceed from college residence and college associations , we should do much to vulgarize and degrade it . If we vulgarize and degrade the life that is so depressed by materialistic tendencies , and beset by grosser temptations , we shall certainly demoralize it . We can not safely dispense with a single agency which tends to elevate and refine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so conspicuous in its history , and been so closely interwoven with all the subtle forces of its better manifestations . It is enough for us to be able to assert that thousands of the noblest men who stand foremost in the ranks of social and professional life , would be forward to acknowledge that they are indebted to the cultivating influences of college friendships and college associations , for the germs of their best principles , their noblest aspirations and their most refined tastes . With the views which we have expressed there are many who do not sympathize . Not a few regard the peculiar influences of college life as anything but refining , as tending rather to barbarism than o civilization , to grossness and conceit rather than to refinement and modest self-estimation . To such we have no further arguments to offer . Whether they are honestly or dishonestly ignorant and unjust , they are hopelessly irreclaimable . With those who do nothing but rail , it is useless to try to reason . There are others who propose changes which would materially modify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would remove or introduce features which would weaken or set aside the influences which we have enumerated . They would do so with the // express design of avoiding some of its alleged social evils , or with the desire indirectly to accomplish other important ends . The first of these changes which we notice is the abandonment of the dormitory system . This has been seriously urged by not a few of the friends of higher education as a most desirable iniprovetnent in the college economy . The reasons adduced in its favor are that if the students lived in lodgings they would be brought within the amenities and restraints of the family , and would be prevented from contracting the exclusive and perverse esprit de corps , which is thought to be the curse of colleges ; iii short , they would live , and feel , and think , and act more as other human beings do , and less like that particular variety of the human species which is cloistered within the walls of a college and secluded from the ordinary influences of human society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair a large number of dormitory buildings is also insisted on , as well as the duty and desirableness of appropriating the money required for these purposes to objects that are more properly educational . It is often asked , " why invest so much money in brick and mortar , in houses for students to dwell in , when so much is needed for salaries , for endowments , for prizes , for books , and apparatus ? It is time that the system of cloisters and quadrangles , in herited from other titnes* should be abandoned with the changes required by modern life . More than half of the barbarism and absurdity of college life would cease if the students were distributed generally throughout the community and in a certain sense were members of its families , subject , to their restraints and elevated by their refining influence . " To these questions and arguments the following considerations are pertinent . First of all , the advantages which it is thought would follow from the distribution of students in families can not be realized . It is not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient number of families which would at once be competent and willing to exert a wholesome influence over the students even of a small college . Families which are independent in respect to income are not willing to receive lodgers , least of all students , unless they can assert some claim of acquaintance or friendship . If the families are // dependent upon the students for a part or the whole of their living , the students will control so many , either by a direct or indirect influence , that they can not be relied upon for restraint , except against the grossest excesses , and not always against them . The experiment has been tried sufficiently often to be hardened into an intractable fact , that students who reside in the most faithful and conscientious families often succeed in making them their allies rather than their guardians and guides , arid that when a crisis or conflict arises between the students and the faculty , the families in which any considerable portion of them reside , even the best and most reasonable families , more usually side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense or custom of the students is not very serious in its immediate consequences , the interference of the faculty is complained of as officious and unreasonable . Even if it is plainly mischievous to the community and dangerous to life and limb , if it has been often forbidden and punished and is yet pertinaciously persisted in , the necessary discipline of the college is often greatly weakened by an antagonistic or at least an unsympathizing feeling in the families in which many students reside . It has almost passed into a proverb , that when a college is situated in a village even of considerable size , the college controls the public sentiment of ' the community , and the faculty are compelled to contend against the public opinion both of village and college united . It is often the case in a much larger community that the families in which a few students reside , or with whom they visit , are strongly moved by their representations and their prejudices to a not inconsiderable excitement in a direction which is anything but favorable to the order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraints and refinements of family life should not be expected , for they can not be realized for a large commu nity of students , except by those collegians who reside at their own homes in a large city . It may be questioned in respect to these students , and in respect to all who can reside at their own homes when the college is situated in their own city or village , whether they do not lose more by the absence of the salutary excitements and educating restraints of the common life of the college , than they gain by the restraints and refinements // of their own families . This leads us to observe that the residence in dormitories by a very considerable part of the students is absolutely essential to any vigorous and definite common life . This is foremost among the advantages of the dormitory system . If the maintenance of such a common life is desirable , then dormitories are essential . The students , in order to enter into a common fellowship , must have ready access to each other 's society on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night , so that they can see one another under every variety of circumstances . They must chat and talk with one another as they walk and as they lounge . They must be able to discuss the topics of graver and of lighter interest , the politics of the country and the politics of the college , the characters of the leading statesmen of the time , and the character of the leading men of their class and college , the literature of ancient and modern times and the prominent writers of their own circle ; the last lesson , thelast lecture , the last boat race , and the last party ; they must be able to report and circulate the latest joke , the latest news , and the latest canard . If college students are distributed in lodgings throughout the village or city they will form sets and associate in cliques , which , the more intimate and exclusive they are , are likely to become more narrowing , but they can not partake of a general public life with its manifold cross and counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which upon the plastic minds of active minded and sagacious youth is liberalizing in an eminent degree . The dormitory system gratifies the student 's desire of independence . It fosters that feeling of self-reliance which is suitable for his time of life , which can not and ought not to be repressed . At the same time it tempers and tones it down by the manifold restraints of the community in which he dwells . At the age when a boy enters college it is usually time for him to be released from the petty and minute oversight of the domestic household and to be thrown somewhat upon himself . " The wise instructor , " says Emerson , " will press this point of securing to the young soul , in the disposition of time and the arrangements of living , periods and habits of solitude . The high advantage of university life is often the mere // mechanical one , we may call it , of a separate chamber and fire , which parents will allow the boy , without hesitation , at Cambridge , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life he must in some form or other make the experiment which is inevitable for all of passing fro:n the restraints of the family into those of the great community of men . He makes it under reculiar advantages , to which are incident special but not undesirable perils . He can not be effectually nor can he be advantageously subjected to the restraints of another family than his own . It is not desirable that he should be restricted to the uncertain chances and the narrowing influences of a private and exclusive clique . It is far better . and far more safe that he should be cast upon the common life of a college that is properly restrained by skillful discipline , that is guarded by wise supervision and invigorated by a healthful ethical and religious life . Residence in dormitories is also morally 8afer than the distribution of students in lodgings . Should it be conceded that it is attended by certain peculiar temptations , it is also attended with certain more than counterbalancing advantages , so far as it subjects the student to a more direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthful public sentiment . Residence in lodgings withdraws the student from supervision and opens abundant opportunities for secret mischief and gross vice . In those colleges in which the students are largely distributed in lodgings it is notorious that the grossest outrages against decency are plotted and executed in apartments which are remote from the inspection and interference of the college officers , and that the most deplorable examples of abandoned sensualism and sin are more frequent among that class who hide themselves in remote and obscure habitations that they may indulge themselves in secret and undetected vice . Whatever may be said and said with truth of the energy of temptation and the facilities to sin which inevitably arise in a congregated mass of excitable and passionate youth is offset by what may be said with equal truth of the restraining and elevating influences which such a community develops within itself when its sentiment is properly directed and reinforced . Residence in a dormitory is less expensive // than residence in lodgings , and is therefore , in a large institution , absolutely necessary , unless such an institution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would involve a great calamity for both rich and poor . It is said that the college is not obliged to furnish lodgings at a rate below that which the ordinary and natural demand would justify . We reply by two considerations . First , the college can furnish apartments in public dormitories at a cheaper rate than private parties will do it , even without loss to itself ; and second , the college may as properly furnish room rent as tuition to its pupils at less than remunerative rates to itself . But it is notorious that the instruction is furnished at less than half its cost , to both the rich and the poor . The American colleges in their theory and administration are all beneficiary institutions . As long as they remain such , it follows that public lodgings should be furnished either at comparatively high rates , because the colege can do it more advantageously to the students or at rates which are lower because they are beneficiary . Public dormitories may and should be made more convenient and comfortable than private apartments . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , with water , gas , and heat , and everything else which conduces to health and morality , to neatness and self-i'espect . We have nothing to offer in excuse or defense for those dormitories which are not so constructed and provided , except the excuse or defense of poverty , and for this the guardians and officers are not responsible as long as they themselves suffer in common with the students . But we have delayed too long perhaps upon this topic . We were led to speak of the dormitory in connection with the common life of the college . To the general topic we again return and observe that the class system is essential to an efficient and energetic common college life . The class is the organic centre , or rather one of the organic centres , the combination of which constitutes the college into an organic whole . Indeed , we do not see how an American college without fixed classes can have an efficient common life . The English universitives find in the separate colleges the proper central forces , which work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The // separate colleges are distinct communities in separate buildings . The number of undergraduates in each is so small , and they are brought so frequently and so closely togethe* , that though they may differ in age and in a3quisitions , they make up a separate family , with family interests , family traditions , and family pride . Closeness and frequency of intercourse , and a sense of family honor , with their common relation to the elder fellows who eat at the same table and lodge under the same roof , unite them all by many ties and connect together men of different years and attainments by warm and intimate friendships . In the American college , the class is the charmed circle within which the individual student contracts the most of his friendships , and finds his fondest and most cherished associations . The sentiment of his class is that which influences him most efficiently , and is to him often the only atrnos phere of his social life . He enters the college community as a timid and often an uncultivated novice , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers to the place , its customs , and its inhabitants . These are all supposed to have reached the same grade of intellectual culture and are destined to be associates and competitors for four years in the same studies and the same amusements-in the same relations and the same rivalships . The members of this community are at once united by a sense of their common strangeness to the place and by the mutual sympathy which it engenders . This union is usually cemented by the antagonism in which this newly formed society finds itself with respect to the superior classes , and is more firmly fixed by the necessity of protection and defense . Its members soon become interested students of each other 's powers and observers of each other 's progress . They meet in the same class-room , or hear from one another of the achievements and characteristics of a few prominent individuals . Not a few of those who at first stand in the foreground become less conspicuous and others take their place , till under the searching tests of the class*roomn the capacity of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacious and nearer scrutiny of youthful companions . the character and temper as well as the practical sense and judgment of each are thoroughly tested . Like is // attached to its like and the foundations of friendships begin to be laid , some of which do not survive the fortunes of the college generation , while others endure through all the changes of the earthly life . Each term has experiences and a history which is limited to the class , but in which every member of the class takes a lively interest . Each college year carries this community through its appointed cycle . As the yonthful excitements of the beginning are gradually sbered into the more thoughtful anticipations that gather around the close , the fervor of its friendships increase rather than abate , till at the hour of parting the class feeling becomes more intense and the ties of its union are welded into links of iron . But while the class is the most important society to the college student , the class itself shares largely in the sentiment of the college commuhity , being largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class lives upon the common life of the whole body , while it in turn ministers to and modifies th t life . It is , however , as essential to an efficient common life , as an energetic and efficient local community , whether it be township , county , or state , is essential to an energetic national life . Should the class be destroyed or set aside by the substitution of the regime of the university for the r%iime of the college , the energy and interest of the common life that at present characterizes the American college , must inevitably go with it . Such intimacies can only be developed by the common studies and common interests , the common enjoyments and common antagonisms of a succession of years , during the most plastic age . If we substitute for them the cla*ses that are held together for a few weeks or months by common attendance in the same lecture room , and these classes are then broken up and re-formed of new materials in new combinations , we shall lose much of the charm and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this common life is worth in its manifold training of the intellect to practical judgments and of the heart to its finer affections , must be sacrificed if the class system is greatly weakened or practically abandoned . The value of these influences is in our view another weighty argument in favor of retaining fixed classes , in addition to those which have already been urged . // We ought not in this connection to omit entirely another prominent feature of the college as a community , viz. , the arrangements for culture and enjoyment furnished by the so-called college societies , secret and open , larger and smaller . These societies are common to all the universities and colleges of Europe and America . Their existence in some form is a necessary outgrowth of human nature . In similar circumstances ardent and ambitious young men will devise some expedient for self-improvement , particularly in rhetorical and literary exercises . The university can not furnish all the culture of this sort which is required , nor if it could would it be either as acceptable or as efficient as that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not surprising that in the American colleges , animated as they must be with the practical arid independent spirit of the country and symj ) athizing most warmly with every public movement , whether political or literary , these associations should have assumed great prominence and should have exercised a powerful educating influence . The social tendencies of young men would naturally lead to associations for other than exclusively literary purpOseS . The clannish tendencies which result from their warm likings and their violent antagonisms , as well as their newly developed feelings of independence would tend to make these societies exclusive and secret . We do not propose to discuss the general question of the desirableness or the nudesirableness of some associations of this sort . It is scarcely open for discussion . They are so natural to young men , indeed to men of all ages , as *ot to need defense or justification . Whether it is desirable that they should be secret or guarded by a mysterious reserve , and so involved with a factitious importance , admits of more question . The love of secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in boyish nature , to be easily thwarted . We doubt the expediency because we disbelieve in the possibility of destroying or preventing secret societies . That such societies may be , and sometimes are , attended with very great evils , is confessed by the great majority of college graduates . Prominent among these evils is the fostering of an intriguing and political spirit , which is incongruous with the general tendencies // of college life toward justice and generosity , and the division of the community and the classes into hostile factious . Whatever excesses attend them , of late hours , late suppers , noisy demonstrations , and convivial indulgences , should be repressed by the good sense and manlier spirit of the college community . Could the continuity of these societies , from one college year to another , be broken up , the college life would be greatly ennobled . The consideration of this subject suggests another which is nearly akin , and that is whether the arrangements for social life in the college are sufficiently numerous and complete . Is it practicable and desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have provided bowling alleys for exercise and relaxation . Ought billiard rooms and club rooms to be added ? Is it desirable that public parlors should be furnished , or places convenient for rendezvous and conversation ? Questions of this sort are more easily asked than answered . It is safe to say that whatever withdraws the students from resorts for eating and drinking or gaining , which may furnish facilities for other excesses , is so much gain to academic manners and morals . An accessible and cheerful reading room , furnished amply with the best newspapers and journals , should be esteemed a necessity , and if it were made attractive and tasteful in its appointments and furnished with retiring rooms for conversation , and could be rigidly controlled by the rules of gentlemanly etiquette , would be a most desirable and useful agency in the college community . The tendencies to barbarism and roughness are manifold in the college . Jeremy Taylor enumerates as among the miseries of our human life , that the boy at a certain age yields himself in subjection to " a caitiff spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every college and sometimes takes possession of scores and hundreds of its inhabitants is too notorious to need any evidence . Whatever may impede its influence or repress its manifestations is obviously most salutary . That this spirit has sometimes been exasperated and rendered more brutal and barbarous by barbarous methods of punishment may be safely admitted , without abating at all from the authority of any existing government // or without conceding in the least to the fine delusion that a college community can be managed without rigid authority ; and even in entire consistency with the doctrine that the government must be absolute in its commands and summary in its administration . Whatever removes the occasion for the exercise of mere authority or even for the semblance of its assertion is usually acknowledged to be a real blessing with men and brutes , and a college student may surely take rank somewhere between the extremes of the series . That a college community requires rules and that rules must be enforced by discipline will not be disputed . That a certain measure of inspection and supervision should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartments and grounds , would scarcely be denied . It is not , however , easy to answer the question how minute the supervision of the college authorities should be . Upon this subject opinions differ very widely , and these opinions differ in the case of the same persons with their varying circumstances . One class of critics contend for the constant and minute supervision of a Jesuit seminary , every rule and provision of which is founded on suspicion and distrust . Another class would abandon all special rules and inspection and leave the students entirely to their own sense of honor and decorum . One class of advisers would proceed on the principle that all students are liars and scoundrels , another that they are all gentlemen and men of truth ; neither of which opinions happens to bejust . The complaint is often heard and urged with special earnestness for or against this or that college , that in one college the instructors are on intimate and familiar terms with their pupils and exert over them a paternal supervision , while in the other they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if students reside together they should be inspected in their apartment by day and carefully locked in at an early hour by night . Others would leave them alone by day and night , without even the presence of an officer in the building in which they congregate , and to and from which they have ready access and egress at all hours . Many insist that all special laws and penalties provoke disorder and mischief , while others insist that college laws should be many and be strictly enforced . We can not dis // cuss these questions in detail , nor need we in order to vindicate the system of college residence and general supervision . The English system of locking in at an early hour is manifestly unsuited to the general freedom of our institutions , and it is chiefly valuable as a security against a single vice . It is better adapted to their system of small colleges in each of which the inmates live in some sort a family life . It is the supplement or counterpoise to the greater freedom of their students in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in daily examinations of the work performed . It is in fact the single controlling influence which the college can constantly enforce , in place of which the American college has manifold more efficient substitutes . Frequent visitation of the students by day and evening has been recommended by many as essential to the faithful supervision and the parcutal care which the college is bound to exercise . This was practised in many of our colleges in other times and has not been entirely disused . In some instances the lodgings of students have been attached to and been alternate with the residences of professors for the purpose of making this inspection more constant and complete . it has been generally found that such minute and constant supervision is exceedingly ungrateflil and annoying , because it presents the aspect of meddling ; and it provokes in return an antagonistic attitude in manifold petty annoyances . The aggression of constant interference provokes the resistance of boyish mischief and arouses the wrath of the manhood that is half developed and is therefore intensely jealous for its invaded rights . The proper medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the government to maintain and occasionally to assert its right of visitation , to provide for the presence in every dormitory by day and night of officers clothed with complete authority , but to exercise its supervision chiefly by methods that are indirect . The judgment of what students are doing and the control of their movements can be most efficiently exercised by their presence at all the required exercises , by constant responsibility for the work of every day , and by the manly and scholarly sentiment of the college community . The monitor 's returns and the instructors ' record book , when closely watched and efficiently used , if conjoined with // occasional personal interviews with students who are any way derelict are , we are persuaded , the most efficient as well as the least oppressive instruments of official supervision . That the sentiment of the college community is far more important and far more efficient than is commonly supposed we have already sought to establish . It is a most interesting and important enquiry whether any system of measures can be devised by which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be maintained in greater efficiency . Can any formal arrangement be made by officers , discipline , or studies which shall introduce into the community better and more efficient influences . It is manifest that these influences must to a great extent be personal and individual . The selection of officers of high personal character and of ardent and self-sacrificing devotion to the interests of the students is the first condition of success in this respect . The maintenance of a certain degree of free and familiar intercourse between them and their pupils is equally essential . The traditions of some of the colleges in this country are unfavorable to a too familiar intimacy , and the feelings of the students themselves demand a measure of reserve and isolation on both sides . Too much advice , especially if it is obtrusively administered , is if possible more offensive than too much supervision . The students themselves naturally withdraw from the society of those who are older than themselves and who hold official relations which involve some constraint on both sides . The opinions and sympathies of their fellows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of their instructors . While all this is true there is room even under the present arrangements , for the exertion of a very efficient influence over the college community , by those who are disposed to use it . The English universities have one advantage however which we should seek to engraft upon our system . The intercourse of the tutor with his pupil is constant and intimate . It is often generous and confiding . The tutor works with his pupil and teaches him how to work . lie sympathizes with his difficulties as well as corrects his mistakes . He inspires his ambitions and elevates his aims , he liberalizea his drudgeries and imparts to the flagging somewhat of his own // enthusiasm . He lays the foundation for life-long friendships , and in this way perpetuates his own influence , and the spirit of his own attainments and culture . Can we do anything of the sort ? We could if we had the means . We could avail ourselves of all the advantages of the system of " fellows " and " private tutors " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system of instruction of terminable fellowehi or scholars of the house has already been insisted on . The services which they might render as connecting links between officers and students are if possible still more important . The presence in a college community of a sufficient number of recent graduates , of eminent attainments and of attractive characters , who should share in the sympathies and have access to the opinions of the undergraduates , whose associations should be constant with the better men of all the classes , while their services as tutors and guides to the weaker should open to them abundant opportunities for befriending them intellectually and morally , could not fail to be most efficient in elevating the tone of college opinion and of college scholarship , manners , and morals . Such a provision would go farther than any other towards redeeming these communities from much of the reproach which rests upon them , however undeserved and exaggerated it often may be . Dr. Arnold remarks more than once in his letters to this effect , if the sixth form is with me I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs to us in connection with the enquiry whether the higher classes , and especially the highest of all , should not have the plane of a somewhat more decided manhood than is allowed it , in respect to its methods of study , its relations to the instructors , and its responsibility for the controlling sentiment of the institution . lEnder the operation of natural laws a somewhat different position has been accorded to it in all these respects than has been conceded to the other classes . The studies pursued are at once more directly liberal as well as more practical . They are at least more practical in the sense of having a more vital relation to the principles which underlie individual faith and character , to the historical and political questions which agitate the world of living men as well as to the literature in which men of // culture find at once their refreshment and inspiration . The methods of instruction may he less constrained , and the intercourse with instructors more free and confiding . Some have advised that the freedom of the university should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection of their studies as well as for irrdsponsibility in pursuing them the Seniors should be more largely left to themselves . We have already given the reasons why elective studies can not to a very great extent be allowed and why private 8tudies are to be preferred . It is however altogether essential to the perfection and the full development of the college system , that the last year of college life should be turned to its best account in self-culture . With its beginning there begins to be developed even to the frivolous and the idle the sense of individual responsilibity for the future . Many of the studies invite to manly and moral reflection . Many of them exercise the inventive and aesthetic powers to an unwonted degree . All of them introduce the students to the thoughts and opinions of cultivated men on subjects of comprehensive and general interest . During this year the student begins , perhaps for the first time in his life , to read , and is tasked to learn how to read . All these influences tend to awaken whatever of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into life some sense of his responsibility for his influence over the community in which he lives . Whatever can be done to turn these advantages to the most efficient use will elevate the tone of feeling in the whole college . We do not advise the release of the Senior from any of the obligations of an enforced system of study . He needs them as much as ever and can profit by them more than ever . But he can certainly be made to understand the value of a manly sympathy with the decorum and order of the college and the importance of his own influence in this regard . It is not desirable that he should be instructed without constant responsibility for his work . But he may certainly be treated as a man who has ceased to be a school boy , and has begun to feel his responsibility for his influence . The Senior year ought to be the busiest year of all , but it ought not to be overburdened with manifold and novel studies . The habits of thorough // work and the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things well and carefully done , is worth quite as much to the character as it is to the intellect . Whatever gives tone to either in the management of the Senior class in any American college will give elevation and tone to the sentiment of the whole community . It is not too much to labor and hope for , that in the future development of the college system the Senior class may feel its responsibility and exercise its influence for good with greater efficiency , and as a consequence the American colleges may attain a nobler and more healthful common life . Our discussion of this common life requires us to consider the moral and religious influences which may properly be employed in invigorating and controlling it . This subject opens a somewhat wide and perplexing field of discussion and must be reserved for another paper .
