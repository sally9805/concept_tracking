" THE CHARLIE BOY , " 182 DOTTY DIMPLE AT HER GRANDMOTHER 'S . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning in May , as if God had just made the world . The new grass had begun to grow , and the fields were dotted over with short , golden-topped dandelions . The three Parlin children had come to their grandmother 's much earlier in the season than usual ; and now on this bright Sabbath morning they were going to church . Dotty Dimple , otherwise Alice , thought the fields looked like her Aunt Maria 's green velvet toilet-cushion stuck full of pins . The spiders had spread their gauzy webs over the grass , and the dew upon them sparkled in the sunshine like jewels . " Such nice tablecloths as they would have made for the fairies , " thought Dotty , " if there only were any fairies . " " The world is ever so much handsomer than it was a week ago , " said Prudy , pointing towards the far-off hills . " I 'd like to be on that mountain , and just put my hand out and touch the sky . " " That largest pick , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blueberries , and that 's why it 's so blue . " " Who told you that ? " asked Susy , smiling . " It is n't time yet for blueberries ; and if it was , we could n't see them forty miles off without a telescope . " " Jennie Vance told me , " said Dotty ; " and she ought to know , for her father is the judge . " By this time the children had reached the church , and were waiting on the steps for the rest of the family . It was pleasant to watch the people coming from up and down the street , looking so neat and peaceful . But when Jennie Vance drew near with her new summer silk and the elegant feather in her hat , Dotty 's heart gave a quick double beat , half admiration , half envy . Jennie 's black eyes were shining with vanity , and her nicely gaitered feet tripped daintily up the steps . " How d'ye do ? " said she , carelessly , to Dotty , and swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jennie Vance need n't talk so about her new mother , " whispered Prudy , " for she gives her fifty-two new dresses , one for every Sunday . " Dotty 's brow darkened . Just now it seemed to her one of the greatest trials in the whole world that the dress she wore had been made over from one of Prudy 's . It was a fine white organdie with a little pink sprig , but there was a darn in the skirt . Then there was no feather in her hat , and no breastpin at her throat . Poor Dotty ! She did not hear much of the sermon , but sat very quiet , counting the nails in the pews and the pipes in the organ , and watching old Mr. Gordon , who had a red silk kerchief spread over his head to guard it against the draught from the window . She listened a little to the prayers , it is true , because she knew it was wrong to let her thoughts wander when Mr. Preston was speaking to God . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Sabbath school class , she passed Jennie Vance in the aisle . " Where are you going , Jennie ? " said she . " Going home . My mamma says I need n't stay to say my lessons and miss a warm dinner . " Jennie said this with such a toss of the head that Dotty longed to reply in a cutting manner . " It is n't polite to have warm dinners on Sunday , Jennie Vance ! But you said your father had a step-wife , and perhaps she does n't know ! " " I did n't say my papa had a step-wife , Dotty Dimple . " But this was all Jennie had time to retort , for Dotty now entered the pew where her class were to sit . Miss Preston was the teacher , and it was her custom to have each of her little pupils repeat a half dozen verses or so , which she explained to them in a very clear manner . The children did not always understand her , however ; and you shall see hereafter how Dotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of her verses to-day was this :  --  " The Lord loveth a cheerful giver . " " Suppose , " said Miss Preston , " there were two little girls living in a beautiful house , with everything nice to eat and wear , and there should come a poor man in rags , and beg for charity . One of the little girls is so sorry for him that she runs to her mamma and asks , as a favor , to be allowed to give him some of her Christmas money . The other little girl shakes her head , and says , ' O , sister what makes you do so ? But if you do it I must . ' Then she pours out half her money for the beggar , but scowls all the while.  - -  Which is the ' cheerful giver ? ' " " The first little girl . O , of course , Miss Preston . " Then Dotty fell to thinking :  --  " I do n't have much to give away but just pieces of oranges ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more ' cheerful ' than Jennie Vance ; for I never saw her give away anything but a thimble after the pig had chewed it . ' There , take it , Lu Piper , ' said she , ' for it pinches , and I do n't want it . ' I should n't think that was very cheerful , I am sure . " Thus Dotty treasured up the lesson for the sake of her friend . It was really surprising how anxious she was that Jennie should always do right . Now it happened that before the week was out a man came to Mr. Parlin 's back door begging . Dotty wondered if it might not be the same man Miss Preston had mentioned , only he was in another suit of clothes . She and Jennie were swinging , with Katie between them , and Susy and Prudy were playing croquet . They all ran to see what the man wanted . He was not ragged , and if it had not been for the green shade over his eyes and the crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of his being a beggar . He was a very fleshy man , and the walk seemed to have taken away his breath . " Little maidens , " said he , in gentle tones , " have you anything to give a poor tired wayfarer ? " There was no answer , for the children did not know what to say . But the man seemed to know what to do ; he seated himself on the door-step , and wiped his face with a cotton handkerchief . Little Katie , the girl with flying hair , who was sometimes called ' Flyaway , ' looked at him with surprise as he puffed at every breath . " When um breeves , " said she to Dotty , " seems 's um whissils . " " Come here , little maiden , " said the beggar , pointing to Dotty ; " you are the handsomest of all , and you may take this document of mine . It will tell you that I am a man of great sorrows . " Dotty , very much flattered , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumpled , looking as if it had been lying beside bread and butter in a dirty pocket . She gave it to Susy , for she could not read it herself . It was written by one of the " selectmen " of a far-away town , and asked all kind people to take pity on the bearer , who was described as " a poor woman with a family of children . " Susy laughed , and pointed out the word " woman " to Prudy . " Why do you smile , little ladies ? Is n't it writ right ? ' T was writ by a lawyer . " " I will carry it in to my grandmother , " said Susy ; and she entered the house , followed by all the children . " Who knows but he 's a griller ? " said Jennie . " Lem me see paper , " cried Katie , snatching at it , and holding it up to her left ear . " O , dear ! " sighed she , in a grieved tone ; " it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear nuffin ' tall . " " She 's a cunning baby , so she is , " said Dotty . " She s'poses writing talks to people ; she thinks that 's the way they read it . " Grandmamma Parlin thought the man was probably an impostor . She went herself and talked with him ; but , when she came back , instead of searching the closets for old garments , as Dotty had expected , she seated herself at her sewing , and did not offer to bestow a single copper on the beggar . " Susy , " said she , " he says he is hungry , and I can not turn him away without food . You may spread some bread and butter , with ham between the slices , and carry out to him . " " What makes her so cruel ? " whispered Dotty . " O , Grandma knows best , " replied Prudy . " She never is cruel . " " What makes you put on so much butter ? " said Jennie Vance ; " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dotty , whose Sunday school lesson was all the while ringing in her ears , looked at the judge 's daughter severely . " Would you pour cold beans into anybody 's hands , Jennie Vance ? Once my mamma gave some preserves to a beggar ,  - -  quince preserves , she did . " Jennie only tossed her head . " I 'm going to give him some money , " continued Dotty , defiantly ; " just as cheerfully as ever I can . " " O , yes , because he called you the handsomest . " " No , Jennie Vance ; because I am not stingy . " " Um is n't stinchy , " echoed Katie . " I 've got some Christmas money here . I earned it by picking pins off the floor , six for a cent . It took a great while , Jennie , but I would n't be selfish , like some little girls . " " Now , little sister , " said Prudy , taking Dotty one side , " do n't give your money to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But there was a stubborn look in Dotty 's eyes , and she marched off to her money-box as fast as she could go . When she returned with the pieces of scrip , which amounted in all to fifteen cents , the children were grouped about the beggar , who sat upon the door-step , the plate of sandwiches before him . " Here 's some money , sir , for your sick children , " cried Dotty , with an air of importance . " Blessings on your pretty face , " replied the man , eagerly . Dotty cast a triumphant glance at Jennie . " Ahem ! This is better than nothing , " added the beggar , in a different tone , after he had counted the money . " And now have n't any of the rest of you little maidens something to give a poor old wayfarer that 's been in the wars and stove himself up for his country ? " There was no reply from any one of the little girls , even tender Prudy . And as Dotty saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it suddenly occurred to her that she had not done such a very wise thing , after all . " Why do n't you eat your luncheon , sir ? " said Jennie Vance ; for the man , after taking up the slices of bread and looking at them had put them down again with an air of disdain . " I thought , by the looks of the house , that Christians lived here , " said he , shaking his head slowly . " Have n't you a piece of apple pie , or a cup custard , to give a poor man that 's been in prison for you in the south country ? Not so much as a cup of coffee or a slice of beefsteak ? No . I see how it is , " he added , wiping his face and rising with an effort ; " you are selfish , good-for-nothing creeters , the whole of you . Here I 've been wasting my time , and all I get for it is just dog 's victuals , and enough scrip to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , puffing . Dotty longed to run after him and call out , " Please , sir , give me back my money . " But it was too late ; and summoning all her pride , she managed to crush down the tears . " Tell the people in this house that I shake off the dust of my feet against them , " wheezed the stranger , indignantly . " The dust of my feet -- do you hear ? " " What a wicked , disagreeable old thing ! " murmured Jennie Vance . " Dish-gwee-bly old fing ! " cried " Flyaway , " nodding her head till her hair danced like little tufts of corn-silk . " I 'm glad I did n't give him any of my money , " said Jennie , loftily . " So am I , " returned Susy . Prudy said nothing . " I did n't see him shake his feet , " said Dotty , changing the subject ; " and the dust would n't come off if he did shake ' em . " " Have you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twirling her gold ring on her finger . " O , yes , ever so much at home . And I shall soon have more , " added Dotty , with a great effort to be cheerful ; " for people are always dropping pins . " " I 've got any quantity of scrip , " pursued Jennie ; " and I do n't have to work for it , either . " " O , dear , " thought Dotty , " what 's the use to be good ? I ' sposed if I gave away my money cheerfully , they 'd all feel ashamed of themselves ; but they do n't ! I wish I had it back in my box , I do ! " CHAPTER II . PLAYING KING AND QUEEN . " What are you hunting for on your hands and knees , Alice ? " said grandmamma , next day . " O , nothing , only pins , grandma ; but I ca n't find any . Is n't this a hidden-mist carpet ? " " No , dear ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want of pins ? " " She has given away what Aunt Ria paid her for Christmas , " said Prudy , speaking for her ; " she gave it all to the beggar . " " Yes , she did ; one , two , free , four , nineteen , tenteen , " said Katie ; " and the gemplum did n't love little goorls . " " Why , Alice ! to that man who was here yesterday ? " Dotty was frowning at Prudy behind a chair . " Yes , ' m , " she answered , in a stifled voice . " Were you sorry for him ? " " No , ma'am . " " Did you hear me say I did not believe he was in need of charity ? " " Yes , ' m . " Grandma looked puzzled , till she remembered that Alice had always been fond of praise ; and then she began to understand her motives . " Did you suppose Jennie Vance and your sisters would think you were generous ? " asked she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but made no reply . " Because , if that was your reason , Alice , it was doing ' your alms before men , to be seen of them . ' God is not pleased when you do so . I told you about that the other day . " Still the little girl did not understand . Her thoughts were like these : " Grandma thinks I 'm ever so silly ! Prudy thinks I 'm silly ! But is n't Jennie silly too ? And O , she takes cake , all secret , out of her new mother 's tin chest . I do n't know what will become of Jennie Vance . " Mrs. Parlin was about to say more , when Miss Flyaway , who had been all over the house in two minutes , danced in , saying , " the Charlie boy " had come ! It was little lisping Charlie Gray , saying , " If you pleathe , ' m , may we have the Deacon to go to mill ? And then , if we may , can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Cauthe , if you ca n't , then you muth n't . " Deacon was the old horse ; and as Mr. Parlin was quite willing he should go to mill , Harry Gray came an hour afterwards and led him away . With regard to the other request , Mrs. Parlin had to think a few minutes . " Yes , Charlie , " said she , at last ; " you may have the milk , because I would like to oblige your mother ; and you may tell her I will send it every night by the children . " Now , Mrs. Gray was the doctor 's wife . She was a kind woman , and kept one closet shelf full of canned fruit and jellies for sick people ; but for all that , the children did not like her very well . Prudy thought it might be because her nose turned up " like the nose of a tea-kettle ; " but Susy said it was because she asked so many questions . If the little Parlins met her on the street when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire what they had been buying at the store , or took their parcels out of their hands and felt them with her fingers . She was interested in very little things , and knew how all the parlors in town were papered and carpeted , and what sort of cooking-stoves everybody used . Dotty hung her head when her grandmother said she wished her to go every night to Mrs. Gray 's with a quart of milk . " Must I ? " said she . " Why , grandma , she 'll ask me if my mother keeps a girl , and how many teaspoons we 've got in the house ; she will , honestly . May n't somebody go with me ? " " Ask me will I go ? " said Katie , " for I love to shake my head ! " " And , grandma , " added Dotty , " Mrs. Gray 's eyes are so sharp , why , they 're so sharp they almost prick ! And it 's no use for Katie to go with me , she 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much little , " cried Katie . " I 's growing big . " " I should think Prudy might go , " said Dotty Dimple , with her finger in her mouth ; " you do n't make Prudy do a single thing ! " " Prudy goes for the ice every morning , " replied Mrs. Parlin . " I wish you to do as I ask you , Alice , and make no more remarks about Mrs. Gray . " " Yes , ' m , " said Dotty in a dreary tone ; " may n't Katie come too ? she 's better than nobody . " Katie ran for her hat , delighted to be thought better than nobody . The milk was put into a little covered tin pail . Dotty watched Ruth as she strained it , and saw that she poured in not only a quart , but a great deal more . " Why do you do so ? " said Dotty . " That 's too much . " " Your grandmother told me to , " replied Ruth , washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed down and running over . ' That 's her way of doing things . " " But I do n't believe grandma ' spected you to press it down and run it all over . Why , there 's enough in this pail to make a pound of butter . Come , Katie . " " Let me do some help , " said the little one , catching hold of the handle , and making the pail much heavier . Dotty endured the weight as long as she could ; then , gently pushing off the " little hindering " hand , she said ,  --  " And now , as we go along , we might as well be playing , Flyaway . " " Fwhat ? " " Playing a play , dear . We 'll make believe you 're the queen with a gold crown on your head . " Katie put her hand to her forehead . " O , no , dear ; you have n't anything on your head now but the broadest-brimmedest kind of a hat ; we 'll call it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " " O , yes , mallied . " " And we 're going -- going --  " " Rouspin , " suggested Flyaway . " No ; great people like us do n't go raspberrying . Sit down here , Queenie , under this acorn tree , and I 'll tell you ; we 're going to the castle . " " O , yes , the cassil ? " " Where we keep our throne , dear , and our gold dresses . " " Does we have any gold dollies to the cassil ? " " O , yes , Queenie ; all sizes . " " Does we have , " continued Flyaway , winking slowly , " does we have -- dip toast ? " " Why , Queenie , what should we want of that ? Yes , we can have dip toast , I s'pose ; the girl can make it on the gold stove , with a silver pie-knife . But we shall have nicer things than ever you saw . " " Nicer than turnipers ? " " Pshaw ! turnovers are nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall live on wedding cake and strawberries . Tea and coffee , and such low things , we shall give to ducks . O , what ducks they will be ! They will sing tunes such as canaries do n't know how . We 'll give them our tea and coffee , and we 'll drink -- what d'ye call it ? O , here 's some . " Dotty took up the pail . " You see how white it is ; sugar frosting in it . Drink a little , it 's so nice . " " It tastes just like moolly cow 's milk , " said Flyaway , wiping her lips with her finger . " No , " said Dotty , helping herself ; " it 's nectar ; that 's what Susy says they drink ; now I remember . " " Stop ! " said a small voice in the ear of Dotty 's spirit ; " that is what I should call taking other people 's things . " " Poh ! " said Dotty , sipping again ; " it 's grandpa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked , because -- because it is . This is only play , you know . " Dotty took another draught . " Come , Queenie , " said she , " let 's be going to the castle . " Katie sprang up so suddenly that she fell forward on her nose , and said her foot was " dizzy . " It had been taking a short nap as she sat on the stump ; but she was soon able to walk , and shortly the royal pair arrived at the castle , which was , in plain language , a wooden house painted white . " So you have come at last , " said Mrs. Gray , from the door-way . " They do n't milk very early at your house -- do they ? " " No , ma'am , not so very . " " Have you seen anything of my little Charlie ? " " No , ma'am , not since a great while ago ,  - -  before supper . " " How is your grandfather ? " " Pretty well , thank you , ma'am . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly ; " he 's deaf . " " And what about your Aunt Maria ? Did n't I see her go off in the stage this morning ? " " Yes , ' m , " replied Dotty , determined to give no more information than was necessary . " She 's gone off , " struck in Katie ; " gone to Dusty , my mamma has . " " Ah indeed ! to Augusta ? " repeated Mrs. Gray , thoughtfully . " Any of your friends sick there ? " " No , ma'am , " replied Dotty , scowling at her shoes . " She 's gone , " continued Katie , gravely , " to buy me Free Little Kittens . " Mrs. Gray smiled . " I should think your mother could find kittens enough in this town , without going to Augusta . I thought I saw Horace on the top of the stage , but I was n't sure . " Dotty made no reply . " Hollis was , " cried Katie , eagerly ; " he goed to Dusty too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In jail ! " exclaimed Mrs. Gray , throwing up her hands . " He stealed , Hollis did , " added Katie , solemnly . " Hush , Katie , hush ! " whispered Dotty Dimple , seizing the child by the hand and hurrying her away . Mrs. Gray followed the children to the door . " What does she mean , Dotty ! what can she have heard ? " " She does n't mean anything , ma'am , " replied Dotty , beginning to run ; " and she has n't heard anything , either . " Dotty 's behavior was so odd , that Mrs. Gray 's curiosity was aroused . For the moment she quite forgot her anxiety about her little Charlie , who had been missing for some time . " What made you say Horace stole ? " said Dotty , as soon as they were out of hearing . " Hollis did , " answered Katie , catching her breath ; " he stealed skosh seeds out of gampa 's razor cupbard . " " What did Horace want of squash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawed him ! " " There , you 're the funniest baby , Katie Clifford ! Now you 've been and made Mrs. Gray think your brother 's carried to jail . " This was not quite true . Mrs. Gray had no idea Horace had been taken to jail ; but she did fancy something had gone wrong at Mrs. Parlin 's . She put on her bonnet and ran across the road to Mrs. Gordon 's to ask her what she supposed Horace Clifford had been doing , which Dotty Dimple did not wish to hear talked about , and which made her run away when she was questioned . " I ca n't imagine , " said Mrs. Gordon , very much surprised . " He is a frolicsome boy , but I never thought there was anything wicked about Horace . " Then by and by she remembered how Miss Louise Parlin had lost a breastpin in a very singular manner , and both the ladies wondered if Horace could have taken it . " One never can tell what mischief children may fall into , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reminds me how anxious I am about my little Charlie ; he ought to have been at home an hour ago . " While Mrs. Gray was saying this in Mrs. Gordon 's parlor , there was a scene of some confusion in Mr. Parlin 's door-yard . " Who 's this coming in at the gate ? " cried Dotty . It was Deacon , but Deacon was only a part of it ; the rest was two meal-bags and a small boy . The meal-bags were full , and hung dangling down on either side of the horse , and to each was tied a leg of little Charlie Gray . It was droll for a tiny boy to wear such heavy clogs upon his feet , but droller still to see him resting his curly head upon the horse 's mane . " Ums the Charlie boy , " said Katie ; " um ca n't sit up no more . " " Ah , my boy , seems to me you take it very easy , " said Abner , who was just coming in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one-wheeled coach , " or wheel-barrow . " Why do n't you hold your head up , darling ? " said Dotty . " O , bring the camphor , " screamed Susy ; " he 's fainted away ! he 's fainted away ! " " Not exactly , " said Abner , untying the strings which held him to the bags . " Old Deacon has done very well this time ; the boy is sound asleep . " As soon as Abner had wheeled away his weeds , he mounted the horse and trotted to Mrs. Gray 's with the meal-bags , singing for Katie 's ear ,  --  " Ride away , ride away ; Charlie shall ride ; He shall have bag of meal tied to one side ; He shall have little bag tied to the other , And Charlie shall ride to see our grandmother . " The little boy stood rubbing his eyes . " Why , Charlie , darling , " said Prudy , " who tied you on ? " " The man'th boy over there . Hally did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy tied me on . " Charlie made up a lip . " Let 's take him out to the swing , " said Prudy . " That will wake him up , and then we 'll make a lady 's chair and carry him home . " " Do n't want to thwing , " lisped Charlie . " What for you do n't ? " said wee Katie . " Cauthe the ladieth will thee me . " " O , you 's a little scat crow ! " " Hush , Katie , " said the older children ; " do look at his hair ; it curls almost as tight as dandelion stems . " " Thee the dimple in my chin ! " " Which chin ? " said Prudy ; " you 've got three of them . " " And the wuffle wound my neck ! Gueth what we 've got over to my houthe ? Duckth . " " O , ducks ? " cried Dotty ; " that 's what I want to make me happy . There , Prudy , think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this yard . " " People sometimes take ducks ' eggs and put them in a hen 's nest , " said Prudy , reflectively . " O , there now , " whispered Dotty , " should n't you think Mrs. Gray might give me three or four eggs for carrying the milk every single night ? " " Why , yes , I should ; and perhaps she will . " " I gueth my mamma wants me at home , " said Charlie , yawning . Prudy and Dotty went with him ; and in her eagerness concerning the ducks ' eggs , Dotty quite forgot the secret draughts of milk she and Katie had quaffed under the acorn-tree , calling it nectar . But this was not the last of it . CHAPTER III . THE WHITE TRUTH . Dotty continued to go to Mrs. Gray 's every night with the milk . Sometimes Katie went with her , and then they always paused a while under the acorn-tree and played " King and Queen . " Dotty said she wished they could ever remember to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would taste a great deal more like nectar . The " nipperkins " were a pair of handled cups which the children supposed to be silver , and which they always used at table . Dotty knew she was doing wrong every time she played " King and Queen . " She knew the milk was not hers , but Mrs. Gray 's ; still she said to herself , " Ruthie need n't give so much measure , all pressed down and run over . If Queenie and I should drink a great deal more , there would always be a quart left . Yes , I know there would . " Mrs. Gray never said anything about the milk ; she merely poured it out in a pan , and gave back the pail to Dotty , asking her at the same time as many questions as the child would stay to hear . One night Dotty begged Prudy to go with her ; she wished her to ask for the ducks ' eggs . When they reached the acorn tree Dotty did not stop ; she would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudy ; she was afraid of her sister 's honest blue eyes . I am not quite sure Mrs. Gray would have given the eggs to Dotty , though Mrs. Parlin promised her several times the amount of hens ' eggs in return . Mrs. Gray did not think Dotty was " a very sociable child ; " and then so many people were asking for eggs ! But Mrs. Gray could not say " No " to Prudy ; she gave her thirteen eggs , with a hearty kiss . " Now whose will the ducklings be ? " asked Dotty on the way home . " Yours and mine , " replied Prudy ; " half and half . Six for each , and an odd one over . " " Then , " said Dotty , " we 'll give that ' odd one over ' to Katie . " " But they may not all hatch , Dotty . " " O , dear ! why not ? Then we ca n't tell how many we shall have . Perhaps there will be two or three odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prudy ? " Prudy laughed at the idea of " two or three odd ones . " The eggs were put in a barrel under the white hen ; and now began a trial of patience . It seemed to all the children that time stood still while they waited . Would the four weeks never be gone ? One day Dottie stood with Katie by the back-door blowing bubbles . The blue sky , the white fences , the green trees , and even the people who passed in the street , made little pictures of themselves on the bubbles . It was very beautiful . Dotty blew with such force that her cheeks were puffed as round as rubber balls . Katie looked on in great delight . " See , " she cried , " see the trees a-yidin ' on that bubbil ! " Dotty dropped the pipe and kissed her . " Dear me , " said she , the next minute , " there 's Miss Polly coming ! " Katie looked along the path , and saw a forlorn woman tightly wrapped in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking sadly down at her own calf-skin shoes , which squeaked dismally as she walked . " Is um the Polly ? " whispered Katie ; " is um so tired ? " " No , she is n't tired , " said Dotty ; " but she feels dreadfully all the whole time ; I do n't know what it 's about , though . " By this time the new-comer stood on the threshold , sighing . " How do you do , you pretty creeturs ? " said she , with a dreary smile . " Yes , ' um , " replied Katie ; " is you the Polly , and does you feel drefful ? " The sad woman kissed the little girls , for she was fond of children ,  - -  sighed more heavily than ever , asked if their grandmother was at home , and passed through the kitchen on her way to the parlor . Mrs. Parlin sat knitting on the sofa , Mrs. Clifford was sewing , and Miss Louise crocheting . They all looked up and greeted the visitor politely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Miss Polly seated herself in a rocking-chair , and began to take off her bonnet , sighing as she untied the strings , and sighing again as she took the three pins out of her shawl . " I hope you are well this fine weather , " said Mrs. Parlin , cheerily . " As well as ever I expect to be , " replied Miss Polly , in a resigned tone . Then she opened the lids of her basket with a dismal creak , and took out her knitting , which was as gray as a November sky . Afterwards she slowly pinned a corn-cob to the right side of her belt , and began to knit . At the end of every needle she drew a deep breath , and felt the stocking carefully to make sure there were no " nubs " in it . She talked about the " severe drowth " and some painful cases of sickness , after which she took out her snuff-box , and then the three ladies saw that she had something particular to say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always called Mrs. Clifford Maria , for she had known her from a baby . " Horace is at Augusta ; I left him there the other day . " " Yes , " said Polly , settling her mournful black cap , " so I heard ! I was very , very sorry , " and she shook her head dolefully , as if it had been a bell and she were tolling it --  " very , very sorry ! " Mrs. Clifford could not but wonder why . " It is a dreadful thing to happen in a family ! I 'm sure , Maria , I never heard that stealing was natural to either side of the house ! " " Stealing ! " echoed Mrs. Clifford . " What in this world can you mean , Polly Whiting ? " said Aunt Louise , laughing nervously ; for she was a very lively young lady , and laughed a great deal . Miss Whiting thought this was no time for jokes . Her mouth twitched downward as if there were strings at the corners . Mrs. Clifford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , " do speak , and tell me what you have heard ? It is all a mystery to me . " " You do n't say so , " said Miss Whiting , looking relieved . " Well , I did n't more than half believe it myself ; but the story is going that your Horace stole his Aunt Louise 's breastpin , and sold it to a peddler for a rusty gun . " Miss Louise laughed merrily this time . " I did lose my pearl brooch , " said she , " but Prudy found it yesterday in an old glass candlestick . " " What an absurd report ! " said Mrs. Clifford , quite annoyed . " I hope the children are not to be suspected every time their Aunt Louise misses anything ! " " They said you had decided to take Horace to the Reform School , " added Miss Whiting , " but your friends begged you to leave him at Augusta in somebody 's house locked up , with bread and water to eat . " " Now tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise . " Why , Mrs. Grant told me that Mrs. Small said that Mrs. Gordon told her . I hope you 'll excuse me for speaking of it : but I thought you ought to know . " Miss Polly Whiting was a harmless woman , who went from family to family doing little " jobs " of work . She never said what was not true , did no mischief , and in her simple way was quite attached to the Parlins . " I heard something more that made me very angry , " said she , following Miss Louise into the pantry . " Mrs. Grant says Mrs. Gray is very much surprised to find your mother does n't give good measure when she sells milk ! " Aunt Louise was so indignant at this that she went at once and told her mother . " It is a little too much to be borne , " said she ; " the neighbors may invent stories about Horace , if they have nothing better to do , but they shall not slander my mother ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this mischief , were just returning from Mrs. Gray 's . " O , grandma , " said Dotty , coming in with the empty pail ; " she says she do n't want any more milk this summer , and I 'm ever so glad ! Come , Prudy , let 's go and swing . " " Stop , " said Mrs. Parlin ; " why does Mrs. Gray say she wants no more milk ? " " ' Cause , " replied Dotty , " ' cause our cow is dry , or their cow is dry , or Mrs. Gordon has some to sell . I do n't know what she told me , grandma ; I 've forgot ! " " Then , my dear , she did not say you brought too little milk ? " Dotty winced . " No , grandma , she never . " " Ruth , " said Mrs. Parlin , " you are sure you have always measured the milk in that largest quart , and thrown in a gill or two more , as I directed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never failed . " " Then I 'm sure I can not understand it , " said Mrs. Parlin , her gentle face looking troubled . " Unless the children may have spilled some , " remarked Mrs. Clifford . " Dotty , have you ever allowed little Katie to carry the pail ? " " No , Dotty do n't ; her do n't ' low me care nuffin -- there now ! " cried Katie , very glad to tell her sorrows . " She 's so little , you know , Aunt ' Ria , " murmured Dotty , with her hand on the door-latch . There was a struggle going on in Dotty 's mind . She wished very much to run away , and at the same time that " voice " which speaks in everybody 's heart was saying ,  --  " Now , Dotty , be a good girl , a noble girl . Tell about drinking the milk under the acorn tree . " " But I need n't , " thought Dotty , clicking the door-latch ! " it wo n't be a fib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will , Dotty Dimple ! " " What ! When I squeeze my lips together and do n't say a word ? " " ' Twill be acting a fib , and you know it , Alice Parlin ! I 'm ashamed of you ! Take your fingers out of your mouth , and speak like a woman . " " I will , if you 'll stop till I clear my throat.  - -  O , Grandma , " cried Dotty , " I ca n't tell fibs the way Jennie Vance does ! ' T was we two did it , as true as you live ! " " Did what , child ? Who ? " " The milk . " " I do n't understand , dear . " Dotty twisted the corner of her apron , and looked out of the window . " Drank it -- Katie and me -- under the acorn tree . " " Yes , she did , " chimed in Katie ; " and ' twas n't nuffin but moolly 's cow milk , and her ' pilled it on my shoe ! " Grandmamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But Dotty , how could you do such a thing ? " " I telled um not to , " cried Katie , " but her kep ' a-doin ' an ' a-doin ' . " " Ruthie gives too much measure , " replied Dotty , untwisting her apron --  " ' most two quarts ; and when Katie and I ask for some in our nipperkins , Ruthie says , ' No , ' she must make butter . I was just as thirsty , grandma , and I thought Mrs. Gray never would care ; I did certainly . " " Yes , gamma , we fought Mis Gay would care ; did cerdily ! " " My dear Dotty , " said Mrs. Parlin , " you had not the shadow of a right to take what belonged to another . It was very wrong ; but I really believe you did not know how wrong it was . " Dotty began to breathe more freely . " But you see , child , " interposed Aunt Louise , " you have done a deal of mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and explain matters . " Dotty was distressed at the thought of Mrs. Gray , whose nose she could seem to see " going up in the air . " " Do n't feel so sorry , little sister , " said Prudy , as they walked off with their arms about each other 's waist ; " you did n't do just right , but I 'm sure you 've told the real white truth . " " So I have , " said Dotty , holding up her head again ; " and mother says that 's worth a great deal ! " CHAPTER IV . DOTTY 'S CAMEL . Matters were soon set right with Mrs. Gray , who was sorry she had not spoken frankly to Mrs. Parlin in the first place , instead of going secretly to the neighbors and complaining that she did not receive her due allowance of milk . Perhaps it was a good lesson for the doctor 's wife ; for she ceased to gossip about the Parlins , and even took the pains to correct the wrong story with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the milk as usual ; only they never stopped under the acorn tree any more to play " King and Queen . " Not that Dotty felt much shame . She held herself in high esteem . She knew she had done wrong , but thought that by telling the truth so nobly she had atoned for all . " I am almost as good as the little girls in the Sunday school books , " said she ; " now there 's Jennie Vance -- I 'm afraid she fibs . " Jennie called one day to ask Dotty and Flyaway to go to school with her . " Jennie , " said Miss Dimple , gravely , as they were walking with Katie between them , " do they ever read the Bible to you ? " " Yes ; why ? " " O , nothing ; only you do n't act as if you know anything about it . " " I guess my mother is one of the first ladies in this town , Miss Dimple , and she 's told me the story of Joseph 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " said Dotty , looking very solemn , " it has n't done you any good , Jennie Vance . Now , I learn verses every Sunday , and one is this : ' Lie not one to another . ' What think of that ? " Jennie 's black eyes snapped . " I heard that before ever you did . " " Lie not one to another , " repeated Dotty , slowly . " Now , I 'm one , Jennie , and you 're another ; and is n't it wicked when we tell the leastest speck of a fib ? " " Of course ' t is , " was the prompt reply ; " but I do n't tell ' em . " " O , Jennie , who told your step-mother that Charlie Gray was tied up in a meal-bag ? I 'm afraid , " said Dotty , laying her hand solemnly on little Katie 's head as if it had been a pulpit-cushion , and she a minister preaching ,  --  " I 'm afraid , Jennie , you lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " echoed Katie , breaking away and running after a toad . Jennie knitted her brows . " It does n't look very well for such a small child as you are to preach to me , Dot Parlin ! " " But I always tell the white truth myself , Jennie , because God hears me . Do you think much about God ? " " No , I do n't know as I do ; nobody does , He 's so far off , " said Jennie , stooping to pluck an innocent flower . " Why , Jennie , He is n't far off at all ! He 's everywhere , and here too . He holds this world , and all the people , right in His arms ; right in His arms , just as if ' t was nothing but a baby . " Dotty 's tones were low and earnest . " Who told you so ? " said Jennie . " My mamma ; and she says we could n't move nor breathe without Him not a minute . " " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long breath ; " I breathed way down ever so far , and I did it myself . " " O , but God let you . " Dotty felt very good and wise , and as she had finished giving her benighted friend a lesson , she thought she would speak now of every day matters . " Look at those little puddles in the road , " said she ; " do n't they make you think of pudding-sauce -- molasses and cream , I mean -- for hasty-pudding ? " " No , " said Jennie , tossing her head , " I never saw any pudding-sauce that looked a speck like that dirty stuff ! Besides , we do n't use molasses at our house ; rich folks never do ; nobody but poor folks . " " O , what a story ! " said Dotty , coloring . " I guess you have molasses gingerbread , if your father is the judge ! " Dotty was very much wounded . This was not the first time her little friend had referred to her own superior wealth . " Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear Prudy 's old clothes , when Jennie had new ones and no big sister ? She 's always telling hints about people 's being poor ! Why , my papa is n't much poor , only he do n't buy me gold rings and silk dresses , and my mamma would n't let me wear ' em if he did ; so there ! " By the time they reached the school-house , Dotty was almost too angry to speak . They took their seats with Katie between them ( when she was not under their feet or in their laps ) , and looked over in the Testament . The large scholars " up in the back seats , " and in fact all but the very small ones , were in the habit of reading aloud two verses each . This morning it was the nineteenth chapter of Matthew , and Dotty paid little heed till her ear was caught by these words , read quite slowly and clearly by Abby Grant :  --  " Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven . " And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . " Dolly 's heart gave a great bound . That meant Judge Vance just as sure as the world . Was n't he rich , and did n't Jennie boast of it as if it was a great thing ? She touched her friend 's arm , and pointed with her small forefinger to the passage ; but Jennie did not understand . " It is n't my turn , " whispered she ; " what are you nudging me for ? " " Do n't you see your papa is n't going to heaven ? " said Dotty . " God wo n't let him in , because he 's rich . " " I do n't believe it , " said Jennie quite unmoved . " O , but God wo n't , for the Bible says so . He ca n't get in any more than a camel can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " But the needle can go into a camel , " said Jennie , thoughtfully ; " perhaps that 's what it means . " " O , no , " whispered Dotty . " I know better'n that . I 'm very sorry your papa is rich . " " But he is n't so very rich , " said Jennie , looking sober . " You always said he was , " said Dotty , with a little triumph . " Well , he is n't rich enough for that ! He 's only rich a little mite ,  - -  just a little teenty tonty mite , " added Jennie , as she looked at Dotty 's earnest face , and saw the rare tear gathering on her eyelashes . " But my father is n't rich the least bit of a speck , " said Dotty , with a sudden joy . " Nobody ever said he was . Not so rich , at any rate , Jennie , but you could put it through a needle . You could put it through a needle just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . This was a new way of looking at things . " Of course he 'll go to heaven , you know , " said Dotty ; " there 's no trouble about that . " " I s'pose he will , " sighed Jennie , looking at her beautiful gold ring with less pleasure than usual . She had been in the habit of twirling it about her finger , and telling the little girls it was made of real " carrot gold . " But just at this moment she did n't care so much about it ; and it even seemed to her that Dotty 's little hand looked very nice and white without any rings . Perhaps people had not admired the glitter of her forefinger so very much , after all . How did she know but they had said , " Look at Judge Vance 's little daughter . Is n't she ashamed to wear that ring when it 's a sign her father is rich , and ca n't go to heaven ? " The child began to wish there would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ; for she supposed he kept it all in his pockets , of course . " I shall tell my mother about it , " mused she ; " and I do n't believe but she 'll laugh and say , ' That Dotty Dimple is a very queer child . ' " But just at this time little Katie began to peep into Jennie 's pockets for " candy-seeds " ( that is , sugared spices ) , and to behave in many ways so badly that Miss Prince said she must be taken home . So the girls led her out between them ; and that was the last Jennie thought of the camel . But Dotty remembered it all the way home . CHAPTER V. A SAD FRIGHT . But the next afternoon , as the two little girls were walking home together , Dotty said to Jennie , with a very wise face ,  --  " Grandma has told me what the Bible means . Now I understand every single thing . " Jennie did not seem as much delighted as had been expected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " O , I remember , " said Jennie ; " you mean that Bible camel . " " There is n't anything He ca n't do , " continued Dotty ; " the richest men , richer than your father , can get to heaven if God 's a mind to take ' em . " " Not bad people , " said Jennie , shaking her head . " I do n't know about that ; she did n't say , " said Dotty , looking puzzled . " O , no , I s'pose not . God would n't be a mind to . For do n't you see , Jennie Vance , it 's just like a camel . There ca n't anybody go through themselves unless God pulls ' em through . " I do n't know what Grandma Parlin would have thought if she had heard her words chopped up in this way ; but it made very little difference to Jennie , who paid no attention at all . " You 're father 'll get there , " added Dotty ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your shoestring 's untied , " said Jennie , coolly . " And I do n't care now if you are the richest , " said Dotty , stooping to tie the string ; " for God loves me just as well when I wear Prudy 's old things ; and so do all the good people in this town , and the minister too ; grandma said so . I do n't care how much you talk about our old Deacon , or our eating molasses . That is n't anything ! Grandma says its harder for rich children to be good , and I told her I was real glad I was half-poor . " " You 're stepping right in the mud , " cried Jennie . " And then Grandma said that it did n't make any difference any way about that , if I only loved God ; but if I did n't love God , it did . " " There , " said Jennie , " I have n't heard half you 've said ; and I guess you 've forgotten all about going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be willing , " replied Dotty ; " we 've got company , too ; see those ladies in the window . " " All the better , " replied Jennie , cheerily . " You go in and behave as beautifully as ever you can , and your grandma 'll be so busy talking , she 'll say yes before she thinks . That 's the way my mamma does . Say ' Crossman 's orchard , ' remember , but do n't tell which one . " So Jennie staid outside while Dotty entered the parlor softly , and stood by her grandmother 's chair , waiting the proper time to speak . " Strawberrying , did you say ? " asked Mrs. Parlin , presently . " Yes , grandma ; the berries are just as thick . " " O , just as fick ! " repeated Katie , clapping her hands . " In the Crossman orchard , " added Dotty . " Prosser Horcher , " put in Katie , choking a little at the large words . " May her , gamma ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there were two orchards ; and the one she meant was a mile and a half away . " Yes , you may go , Alice ; it is only a few steps ; but put on an old dress , and do n't stay late ; you know you are hardly well since your sore throat . " Dotty had not actually told a wrong story , but for almost the first time she had deceived , and she knew the sin was the same . While she was exchanging her pretty pink frock for one of dark calico , her conscience pricked so painfully that she almost wished to stay at home . " Just as soon as we get out of the village , " said Jennie , " I 'm going barefoot ; mother said I might . " " How splendid your mother is ! " sighed Dotty . " Grandma 's so particular ! But any way I 'm going without my stockings ; I declare I will . My throat 's so far away from my feet , what hurt will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the troublesome voice . " Grandma is n't my parent , " thought Dotty , tugging away at her boot-lacings . They went out through the kitchen , to get Dotty 's red and white picnic basket ; but they crept like a pair of thieves , lest Ruthie , who was mixing waffles , should hear them , and take notice of Dotty 's bare ankles . Once out of the village , it did not take long for Miss Dimple to slip off her boots and tuck them in her pocket . " O , how nice and cool ! " murmured she , poking her little pink toes into the burning sand ; till presently , a thorn , which appeared to be waiting for that very purpose , thrust its way deep into her foot . She sat down in the middle of the road and screamed . Jennie tried her best to draw out the thorn , but only succeeded in breaking it off . Then , with a clumsy pin , she made a voyage of discovery round and round in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or coming anywhere near it . " O , dear ! " said Jennie , petulantly ; " we 've wasted half an hour ! What 's the use for you to be always getting into trouble ? A great many berries we shall have at this rate ! and I was going to ask my mamma to let me have a party . " " There ! " said Dotty , bravely , " I 'm going right along now , and no more fuss about it . " It was hard work ; Dotty limped badly ; and all the while the cruel thorn was triumphantly working its way farther in . The Crossman orchard was not very far away now ; but when they had reached it , and had crept under the fence , why , where were the strawberries ? What the boys had not gathered they had trampled down ; and the truth was , there had been very few in the first place . There was nothing to do but pluck here and there a stray berry , and make the most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sighed Jennie ; " and look at the sky ; it 's growing as black as a pickpocket . " " Why , yes , " moaned Dotty ; " how fast that sun has gone down ! " But this was a mistake . It was only six o'clock . The sun , understanding his business perfectly , had not hurried one jot . The clouds were merely spreading a dark background for some magnificent fireworks ; in other words , a thunder-shower was coming up . " Let 's go right straight home , " said Jennie ; and Dotty was glad to hear the words , for in her own brave little heart she had determined not to be the first to surrender . " Let 's go across the fields , " she replied ; " it 's the nearest way home . " By this time heavy drops were pattering down on the long grass , and making a hollow sound on the little girls ' hats . " Why , it 's raining , " remarked Dotty . " You do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset , " perhaps you think you 're telling some news . " Then came the frightful boom of thunder . " What 's that ? " whispered Dotty , with white lips . " I 'm afraid , Jennie ; I certainly am . " " For shame , Dotty Dimple ! I thought you were the girl that knew all about God and the Bible . I should n't think you 'd be afraid of thunder ! " " O , but I am ! " was the meek reply . " I 'm as afraid as I can live . " " There , hush up , Dotty ! When you 've been and got us into a fix , you 'd better keep still . " " I , Jennie Vance ? I never ! What a story ! " " You did , Miss Dimple ; you spelt it out in the Reader ,  - -  'straw- bry ; ' or I should n't have thought of such a thing . " " Well , I did n't care much about going , now truly , Jennie ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be very much pleased . You said , ' How nice ! ' as much as twice ; and did n't you almost laugh out loud in the spelling class ? Hark ! what a clap ! " " I should think you 'd be ashamed , " said poor Dotty , hopping on one foot . " When I laughed it was to see Charlie Gray make up faces . And should I have gone barefoot if it had n't been for you ? " " Well , there , Dotty Dimple , you 're a smart little girl , I must say ! I do n't mean to ask you to my party , if my mother lets me have one ; and I 've a great mind not to speak to you again as long as I live . " " I should n't think you 'd dare to quarrel , Jennie Vance , when you may die the next minute . Let 's get under this tree . " " Lightning strikes trees , you goosie ! " " O , Jennie Vance ! is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Men do n't keep barns in their pastures , Dot Dimple ; and lightning strikes barns too , quicker'n a flash ! " Dotty covered her face with her hands . " You do n't seem to know scarcely anything , " continued Jennie , soothingly . " I do n't believe you know what a conductor is . " " Of course I do . It 's the man on the cars that takes your ticket . " " No ; that 's one kind ; but in storms like this a conductor is a -- a conductor is a -- why , I mean if a thing is a conductor , Dotty ,  - -  why then the thunder and lightning conducts it all to pieces , and that 's the last there is of it ! My father 's got a book of hijommerty that tells all about such things . You ca n't know for certain . Just as likely as not , now , our baskets are conductors ; and then again perhaps they are non ; and I do n't know which is the worst . If we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em away ! that 's a fact ! " " Yes , indeed ! " cried Dotty , tossing hers behind her as if it had been a living scorpion . " Do you s'pose hats will conduct ? " " Nonsense ! no . I did n't say baskets would , did I ? " returned Jennie , who still held her own dangling from her arm . " Yours was a perfect beauty , Dot . What a fuss you make ! " As Dotty had all this while been stifling her groans of pain , and had also been careful not to express a hundredth part of her real terror of lightning , she thought her friend 's words were , to say the least , a little severe . " Why , this is queer , " cried Jennie , stopping short . " It 's growing wet here ; have n't you noticed it ? Now I 've thought of something . There 's a bog in this town , somewhere , so awful and deep that once a boy slumped into it , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more he tried to get out the more he could n't ; and there he was , slump , slump , and got in as far as his neck . And he screamed till he was black and blue ; and when they went to him there was n't a bit of him out but the end of his nose , and he could n't scream any more ; so all they could do was to pull him out by the hair of his head . " " Is that a true story , now , honest ? " cried Dotty , wringing her hands . " How dreadful , dreadful , dreadful ! What shall we do ? " " Do ? " was the demure reply ; " stand as stock-still as ever we can , and try not to shake when we breathe . Next thing we might slump . " " I do shake , " said Dotty ; " I ca n't help it . " " Do n't you say anything , Dotty Dimple . I never should have thought of going across lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better keep still . " So even this horrid predicament was owing to Dotty ; she was to blame for everything . " Stock-still " they stood under the beating rain , their hearts throbbing harder than the drops . Yes , there certainly was a bottomless pond -- Dotty had heard of it ; on its borders grew the pitcher-plant which Uncle Henry had brought home once . It was a green pitcher , very pretty , and if it had been glass it could have been set on the table with maple molasses in it ( only nobody but poor people used molasses ) . O , there was a deep , deep pond , and grass grew round it and in it ; and Uncle Henry had said it was no place for children ; they could not be trusted to walk anywhere near it , for one false step might lead them into danger . And now they had come to this very spot , this place of unknown horrors ! What should they do ? Should they stand there and be struck by lightning , or try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till they choked and drowned ? Never in all Dotty 's little life had she been in such a strait as this . She cried so loud that her voice was heard above the storm , in unearthly shrieks . She did n't want to die ! O , it was so nice to be alive ! She would as lief have the sore throat all the time , if she might only be alive . She said not a word , but the thoughts flew through her mind like a flock of startled swallows , not one after another , but all together ; and so fast that they almost took her breath away . And O , such a naughty girl as she had been ! Going barefoot ! Telling a story about Crossman 's orchard ! Making believe she never fibbed , when she did the same thing as that , and she knew she did . Running off to play when grandma wished her to stay with Flyaway . Feeding Zip Coon with plum cake to see him wag his tail , and never telling but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , and people . Doing all manner of wickednesses . Dotty was appalled by the thought of one sin in particular . She remembered that in repeating the Lord 's prayer once , she had asked for " daily bread and butter . " Her mother had reproved her for it , but she had done the same thing again and again . By and by , when her mother positively forbade her to say " butter , " she had said " bread and molasses ; " " for , mamma , " said she , " you know I do n't like bare bread . " " I s'pose Miss Preston would say that was the awfulest wickedness of all , and I guess it was . O , dear ! " Well , if she ever got home she would be a better girl . But it was n't likely she ever should get home . " Why , Jennie , " said she , speaking now for the first time , " here we are ; and when we stand still we do n't move at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennie . " " Of course not , Dotty Dimple ; that 's a very bright speech ! I 've thought the same thought my own self before ever you did ! " Another silence , broken only by the pitter patter of the rain ; for the thunder was growing less and less frequent . " But we must go home some time , " cried Jennie with energy . " If it kills us to death we must go home . Just you put your foot out , Dotty dear , and see if it sinks way down , down . I thought it was beginning to grow a little soft right here . " " O , dear , I do n't dare to ! " groaned Dotty , shaking with a nervous chill ; " you put your foot in your own self , Jennie Vance , and see where it goes to . I do n't want to slump down up to my hair any more'n you do . What do you s'pose ! " " Fie ! for shame , Dotty Dimple ! I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! What if I should give you my ring , made of all carrot gold , would you do it then ? Just nothing but put your foot out ? " " Would you give me the ring now , honest ? " said Dotty , raising her little foot cautiously ; " certain true ? " " Why , you know , Dotty , if I said I would , I would . " Illustration A sudden thought was darting across Dotty 's mind , like another startled swallow ; only this one came alone , and did not take her breath away ; for it was a pleasant thought -- Where were they ? Whose field was this ? Why , it was Mr. Gordon 's pasture . And Johnny came here for the cow every night of his life . And , as true as the world , there was the Gordon cow now , the red and white one , standing by the fence , lowing for Johnny . " A great deal of bottomless pond this is , and so I should think ! " said Dotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go I guess I can go with my little feet . Soft ? why , it is n't any softer than anybody 's field is after it rains . " So , without saying a word , the little girl put her foot out , and of course it touched solid earth . " There ! " she cried , " I did it , I did it ! You said I was a coward ; and who 's a coward now ? Where 's your gold ring , Jennie Vance ? " " Why , the ground is as hard as a nut , I declare , " said Jennie , walking along after Dotty with great satisfaction . " I did n't much think there was a swamp in this field all the time . Only I thought , if there was , what a scrape it would be ! Come to think of it , I believe that bottomless pond is in the town of Augusta . " " No , " replied Dotty , " it 's on the other side of the river . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . But where 's my ring ? " " I do n't know anything about your ring ; did n't know you had any . " " I mean yours , Jennie Vance ; or it was yours ; the one on your forefinger , with a red stone in it , that you said you 'd give to me if I 'd put my foot in it . " " Put your foot in what ? " " Why , you know , Jennie Vance ; in the mud . " " Well , there was n't any mud ; ' t was as hard as a nut . " " You know what I mean , Jennie , " exclaimed Dotty , growing excited . " So you need n't pretend ! " " I 'm not pretending , nor any such a thing , " replied Jennie , with a great show of candor ; " it 's you that are making up a story , Dotty Dimple . I did n't say I 'd give you my ring . No , ma'am ; if ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ! " " O , Jennie Vance ! Jane Sidney Vance ! I should think the thunder and lightning would conduct you to pieces this minute ; and a bear out of the woods , and every thing else in this world . I never saw a little girl , that had a father named Judge , that would lie so one to another in all the days of my life . " " Well , " said Jennie , coolly , " if you 've got done your preaching , I 'll tell you what I said . I said , ' What if I should ; ' so there ! I did n't say I would , and I never meant to ; and you may ask my father if I can get it off my finger without sawing the bone in two . " " Indeed ! " replied Dotty , poising her head backward with queenly dignity ; " indeed ! " " I did n't tell a story , " said Jennie , uneasily . " I should think any goosie might know people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's just as well , " said Dotty , with extreme dignity ; " just precisely as well ! I have one grandmamma who is a Quakeress , and she do n't think much of little girls that wear rings . Ahem ! " Jennie felt rather uncomfortable . She did not mind Dotty 's anger , but her quiet contempt was another thing . " I think likely I may go to Boston next week , " said she ; " and if I do , this is the last time we shall go strawberrying together this summer . " " O , is it ? " said Dotty . After this the two little creatures trudged on in silence till they reached Mr. Parlin 's gate . Jennie ran home in great haste as soon as she was free from her limping companion ; and Dotty entered the side-door dripping like a naiad . " Why , Alice Parlin ! " said grandmamma , in dismay ; " how came you in such a plight ? We never thought of you being out in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Mrs. Gray 's , and wait till it was over . " " We were nowhere near Mr. Gray 's , " faltered Dotty , " nor anywhere else , either . " " I should think you had been standing under a water-spout , " said Aunt Louise . " Grandma , ca n't you put her through the wringer ? " asked Prudy , laughing . Dotty sank in a wet heap on the floor , and held up her ailing foot with a groan . " Why , child , barefoot ? " cried Aunt Louise . Dotty said nothing , but frowned with pain . " It is a cruel thorn , " said her good grandmother , putting on her spectacles and surveying the wound . " Yes , ' m , " said Dotty , finding her tongue . " I almost thought ' t would go clear through , and come out at the top of my foot . " Katie took a peep . " No , it did n't , " said she ; " it hided . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother ; " we 'll put her right to bed . Ruthie , do n't you suppose you and I can carry her up stairs ? " Not a word yet about the naughtiness ; but plenty of pity and soft poultices for the wounded foot . " She 's a very queer child , " thought Ruth , coming down stairs afterwards to steep hops for some beer ; " a very odd child . She has something on her mind ; but we sha n't be any the wiser till she gets ready to tell it . " CHAPTER VI . MAKING POETRY . But when Prudy had come to bed , Dotty could talk more freely . " O , dear , " said she , hiding her face in her sister 's bosom ; " I do n't want them to laugh at me , but I 've lost my boots and my basket , and been dripped in the rain , and got a thorn in my foot too , till it seems as if I should die ! " " But you 'll never do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could think of no other consolation to give . " And lightning besides , Prudy ! And she made me throw away my beautiful picnic basket , and she kept hers , and it never hurt her a bit ! Do n't you think she was just as mean ! What makes grandma let me go with her , do you s'pose ? I shall grow real bad ! Wo n't you tell her to stop it ? " Dotty moaned with pain , and between her moans she talked very fast . " And all this time , " said she , " we have n't any ducks ! " Prudy , who was dropping off to sleep , murmured , " No . " " But it 's real too bad , Prudy . I never saw such a lazy old hen -- did you ? Prudy , did you ? " Presently , when Prudy thought it must be nearly morning , there was a clutch upon her shoulder , and a voice cried in her ear ,  --  " I do n't see what makes you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ! And O , how I want a drink o ' water ! " Prudy thought she should never find the match-box ; but she did at last , and lighted the lamp after several trials . It was dreary work , though , going down stairs with those sticks in her eyes , to get the water . Dotty drained the nipperkin at two draughts , and said it was n't half enough . " O , you shall have all you want , little sister , " said Prudy , kindly ; " you may drink up the whole barrel if you like . " So down she went again , and this time brought a pitcher . On her return she found Dotty weeping in high displeasure . " You told me to drink up that whole barrel , you did , " cried the unreasonable child , shaking her head . " Did I ? " said Prudy ; " well , dear , I did n't mean anything . " " But you said so -- the whole , whole barrel , " repeated Dotty rocking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I -- was -- black ! " " Hush ! " said Prudy , " or you 'll wake grandma . Let me see ; do you want me to tell you a conundrum ? Why does an elephant carry his trunk ? " " I do n't know ; I s'pose he ca n't help it ; it grows on the end of his nose . " " That is n't the answer , though , Dotty ; it 's because -- because he 's a traveller ! " " An elephant a traveller ? Where does he travel to ? I do n't believe it . " " Well , " replied Prudy , " I ca n't see any sense in it myself . O , stop a minute ! Now I know ; I did n't tell it right . This is the way ; ' Why is an elephant like a traveller ? Because he carries a trunk ! ' Is n't that funny ? " " I do n't care anything about your elephants , " said Dotty ; " if you do n't try to please me , Prudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call her in here , or I shall cry myself sick ! " Patient Prudy crept into bed , but left the lamp burning . " Suppose we make up some poetry ? " said she . " Why , you do n't know how to make up poetry -- do you ? " said Dotty , leaning on her elbow , and looking with dreamy eyes at the engraving of Christus Consolator at the foot of the bed . " I love poetry when they read it in concert at school . Do n't you know ,  --  ' Tremendous torrents ! For an instant hush ! ' Is n't that splendid ? " " Very splendid , indeed , " replied Prudy , pinching herself to keep awake . " I think Torrence is such a nice name , " pursued Dotty ; " do n't you tell anybody but when I 'm married and have some boys , I 'm going to name some of them Torrence . " " Not more than one , Dotty ! " " O , no , I could n't ; could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same name ; I forgot . ' Tremendous Torrence ! ' I shall say ; and then he 'll come in and ask , ' What do you want , mother ? ' " Prudy suddenly hid her face under the sheet . The absurdity of little Dotty 's ideas had driven the sleep out of her eyes . " It would do very well for a name for a very queer boy , " said she , stifling a laugh ; " but a torrent generally means the Niagara Falls . " " Does it ? " said Dotty ; " who told you so ? But I guess I shall call him by it just the same though -- if his father is willing . " Dotty looked very much interested . " What will you call the rest of your boys ? " asked Prudy , glad to talk of anything which kept her little sister pleasant . " I sha n't have but two boys , and I shall name the other one for his father , " replied Dotty , thoughtfully ; " I shall have eight girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall dress them in silk and velvet , with gold rings on their fingers , a great deal handsomer than Jennie Vance 's ; but they wo n't be proud a bit . They never will have to be punished ; for when they do wrong I shall look through my spectacles and say , ' Why , my eight daughters , I am very much surprised ! ' And then they will obey me in a minute . " " Yes , " returned Prudy ; " but do n't you think now we 'd better go to sleep ? " " No , indeed , " said Dotty , drawing herself up in a little heap and holding her throbbing foot in her hand ; " if you do n't make poetry I 'm going to make it myself . Hark !  --  ' Once there was a little boy going down hill ; He leaped , he foamed , he struggled ; and all was o'er . ' " Do you call that poetry ? " said Prudy , laughing . " Why , where 's the rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it in . Tell me what a rhyme is , Prudy ; maybe I do n't know ! " " A rhyme , " replied her wise sister , " is a jingle like this : ' A boy and a toy , ' ' A goose and a moose . ' " " O , is it ? how queer ! ' A hill and a pill , ' that 's a rhyme , too . " " Now , " continued Prudy , " I 'll make up some real poetry , and show you how . It wo n't take me more than a minute ; its just as easy as knitting-work . " Prudy thought for a few seconds , and then recited the following lines in a sing-song tone :  --  " When the sun Had got his daily work done , He put a red silk cloud on his head , ( For a night-cap you know , ) And went to bed . He was there all sole alone ; For just at that very time the moon ( That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ) Was dressed and up , And had eaten her sup- Per . ' Husband , ' said Mrs. Moon , ' I ca n't stop to kiss you good by ; I 've got to leave you now and go up in the sky . ' " " O , how pretty ! " said Dotty ; " how it jingles ! Did you make that up in your own head ? " " Yes , indeed ; just as fast as I could knit once round . I could do a great deal better if I should spend more time . I mean to take a slate some time and write it all full of stars , and clouds , and everything splendid . I shall say , ' What a pity it is that a nice husband and wife , like the sun and moon , ca n't ever live together , but have to keep following each other round the sky and never get near enough to shake hands ! ' I 'll pretend that it makes the moon look very sober indeed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear it better . O , Dotty , do n't you let me forget to put that into poetry ! I can jingle it off , and make it sound beautiful ! " " I should think you might put my verse into poetry , too . Ca n't you say ' a pill rolled down hill ? ' " said Dotty . " O , I can make poetry of it easier than that . You do n't need to change but one word :  --  ' There was a little boy going down hill , He leaped , he foamed , he struggled ;  - -  and all was still . ' " Dotty repeated it several times with much delight . " That 's beautiful , " said she , " now honest ; and I did almost the whole of it myself ! " After this she began to grow drowsy , and , forgetting her troubles , fell asleep , to the great relief of poor sister Prudy , who was not long in following her . Next morning Prudy awoke at nearly the usual time ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she stole out of the room without disturbing her . " Grandmamma , " said she , " Dotty has had an awful night ! I 've had to be up with her , and trying to pacify her , most of the time . " " A whole hour , " said grandma , smiling . " O , grandma , it was nearly all night , but there did n't anybody know it ; we talked low , so we need n't disturb you . " Grandmother and Aunt Maria smiled at each other across the table . " I dare say , my dear , " said Aunt Maria , " you thought you were as quiet as two little mice ; but I assure you you kept everybody awake , except grandpa and Susy . " " Why , Aunt ' Ria ! " " But we learned a lesson in poetry-making , " said Aunt Louise , " which was worth lying awake to hear . Do n't you suppose , Maria , that even prosy people , like you and me , might jingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitting-work ? " Prudy blushed painfully . " I thought , " said Grace , " the sun must look very jolly in his red silk night-cap , only I was sorry you forgot to tell what he had for breakfast . " " Nothing but cold potatoes out of the cupboard , " said Horace ; " he keeps bachelor 's hall . It 's just as well the old fellow ca n't meet his wife , for she 's made of green cheese , and he 'd be likely to slice her up and eat her . " A tear glittered on Prudy 's eyelashes . Horace was the first to observe it , and he hastened to change the subject by saying his johnny-cake was so thin he could cut it with a pair of scissors . By that time Prudy 's tears had slyly dropped upon her napkin , and she would have recovered her spirits if Aunt Louise had not remarked carelessly ,  --  " Seems to me our little poetess is rather melancholy this morning . " Prudy 's heart was swollen so high with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute ; but Horace exclaimed suddenly ,  --  " O , mother , may I tell a story ? Once there were two old -- two maiden ladies in Nantucket , and they earned their living by going round the island picking up the ' tag-locks ' the sheep had left hanging to the bushes and rocks . Now , you would n't believe , would you , mother , that those two women could get rich by selling tag-locks ? " " I certainly should not , " replied Mrs. Clifford , smiling fondly on her young son ; for she saw and approved of his kind little scheme for diverting his cousin 's attention . " Well , mother , they lived to be more than sixty years old ; and when they made their wills , how much money do you suppose they had to leave ? I wish you 'd try to guess . " " Dear me , " said Mrs. Clifford , " I 'm sure I ca n't imagine : I shall have to give it up . " " So must I , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing : I suppose they lived very frugally ? " " A thousand dollars ? " suggested Grace . " A million ? " said Susy . " A shilling ? " chimed in Aunt Louise . " Not one cent ! " replied Horace . " Well , well , " said grandmother , " you 've caught us napping this time . " But only she and Aunt Maria appreciated Horace 's gallantry towards his sensitive cousin Prudy . CHAPTER VII . A DAY ON THE SOFA . When Dotty Dimple awoke that morning , she was very much astonished to see the sun so high . " The sky looks very clean , " said she , " and I should think it might after such a washing . " She did not know it , but for some reason the pure blue of the heavens made her feel dissatisfied with herself . Since she had slept upon it , her last night 's conduct seemed worse to her than ever . All this while her grandmamma 's forgiveness had not been asked . Must it be asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she offered her morning prayer , and promised God that henceforth she would try to be good . " If Jennie Vance only stays away , " added she , meekly . The fact was , Dotty was losing faith in herself . She had boasted that she never told a lie ; she had " preached " to Jennie Vance ; and now , behold , what had she been doing herself ! The child was full of good resolutions to-day , but she began to find that her strongest purposes did not hold together any longer than her gingham dresses . Her foot was so lame and swollen that she made believe the staircase was a hill , and slid down it accordingly . As she hobbled by the parlor door , she saw her Aunt Maria seated on the sofa sewing . It must be very late , she knew . Little Flyaway , who had been chasing the cat , ran to meet her , looking very joyful because her cousin had overslept herself . " It 's half past o'clock , " said she , clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimple ! " Dotty felt quite ashamed , but her grandmother assured her that although it was nearly ten o'clock , she was perfectly excusable . She seated her in an easy chair , and gave her a cracker to nibble ; for Dotty said she was not hungry , and did not care for breakfast . There was one thought uppermost in the little girl 's mind : she must ask her grandmother 's forgiveness . Some children might not have seen the necessity , but Dotty had been well instructed at home ; she knew this good , kind grandmamma was deserving of the highest respect , and if any of her grandchildren disobeyed her , they could do no less than acknowledge their fault . But Dotty was a very proud child ; she could not humble herself yet . Mrs. Parlin dressed the lame foot , and pitied it , and was very sorry the little girl had any soreness of the throat ; but not a word of reproach did she utter ; she was waiting to see if Dotty had anything to say for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , till " the Charlie boy " came , there was no one at home for company but little Katie . Dotty did not wish to think ; so she made the best of the little ones , and played " keep school . " Black Dinah was the finest-looking pupil , but there were several others made of old shawls and table-covers , who sat bolt upright , and bore their frequent whippings very meekly . Katie and Charlie each held a birch switch , and took the government of the school , while Dotty did the teaching . " Spell man , " said Dotty , sternly , pointing with a bodkin at Dinah . Dinah was sulky , and kept her red silk mouth shut ; but Dotty answered for her : " m , a , n , man . " " To , " said she to the black and white shawl : " t , o , to . " " Put , " to the green table-cover : " p , u , t , put . " " We ' shamed o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school unmercifully . " Why do n't you mind in a minute ? Let me spell ' em ! Hush , Dinah ! Say put ! T , o , put ! " " I think , " said Dotty , laughing , " it is time now for Dinah to take her music lesson . " " Yes , " said Katie , " lady wants um to packus . " So the colored miss was set on the music stool , and both her kid hands spread out upon the keys . " Do n't um packus booful ? " said Katie , admiringly . But next moment Charlie was punishing the pupil because she did n't " breeve . " " Kady wanth her to breeve when her packithith . " As it was an ingrain misfortune of Dinah 's that she could not breathe , she showed no signs of repentance . " Stop ! " said Dotty ; " she looks faint ; it is rheumatism , I think . " " O , O , roosum-tizzum ! Poo ' Dinah ! " said Katie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Dotty . Katie was sent to the kitchen for a towel and a basin of water ; and very soon Dinah 's clothes were removed , and she was rolled up in a pack ; like the boy in the swamp , with " not a bit of her out but the end of her nose . " " Ow ! Ow ! " cried Katie , in a tone of agony , speaking for Dinah . " Ow ! O , dear ! " This was what the black patient would have said , no doubt , if she had had her faculties . Aunt Maria came in , a little alarmed , to inquire what was the matter with Katie . " Nuffin , mamma , only we suffer Dinah , " replied the child , dancing round the patient ; " her wants to ky , but her ca n't . Gets caught in her teef comin ' out ! " " Very well , " said Mrs. Clifford , kissing the small nurse , " you may ' suffer ' Dinah as much as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is grandma busy , Aunt ' Ria ? " said Dotty ; " because I 'd like to see her a moment . " The child had seized her knitting-work . Her face was flushed and eager . She thought she felt brave enough to open her heart to her grandmother ; but when Mrs. Parlin entered the nursery , her face beaming with kindness , Dotty was not ready . " O , grandma , " stammered she , " are there any ducks hatched ? Do n't you think that hen is very slow and very lazy ? " Mrs. Parlin knew her little granddaughter had not called her out of the kitchen merely to ask about the poultry . She seated herself on the sofa , and drew Dotty 's head into her lap . " Please look at my knitting-work , grandma . Shall I seam that stitch or plain it ? " " You are doing very well , " said Mrs. Parlin , looking at the work ; " you seamed in the right place . " Dotty cast about in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what fireflies are ? Well , if you scratch ' em will they light a lamp ? Susy says they have fosfos under their wings , like a match . " " No , Alice ; with all the scratching in the world , they could not be made to light a lamp . " Dotty sighed . " Grandma , there are some things in this world I hate , and one is skeetos . " " They are vexatious little creatures , it is true . " There was a long pause . " Grandma , are skeetos idiotic ? You said people without brains were idiotic , and there is n't any place in a skeeto 's head for brains . " " Dotty , " said grandma , rising with a smile , " if you sent for me to ask me such foolish questions as these , I must really beg to be excused . I have a pudding to make for dinner . " " Grandma , O , grandma , " cried Dotty , seizing her skirts , " I have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I -- I --  " " Well , my dear , " said Mrs. Parlin , encouragingly . " I -- I -- O , grandma , which do you think can knit the best , Prudy or I ? " " My dear Dotty , " said the kind grandmother , stroking the child 's hair , " do n't be afraid to tell the whole story . I know you have a trouble at your heart . Do you think you were a naughty girl last night ? " Illustration : DOTTY AND " THE CHARLIE BOY . "  - -  Page 113 . Dotty 's head drooped . She tried to say , " Yes , ma'am ; " but , like Dinah , " the words got caught in her teef comin ' out . " " We did n't go where you thought we did , grandma , " faltered she at last . " Mr. Crossman has two orchards , and we went to just the one you would n't have s'posed . " " Yes , dear ; so I have learned to-day . " " I deceived you a-purpose , grandma ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have let me go . " There was a sorrowful expression on Mrs. Parlin 's face as she listened to these words , though they told her nothing new . " Has you got a pain , gamma ? " said little Katie , tenderly . " I did another wickedness , grandma , " said Dotty , in a low voice ; " I went barefoot , and you never said I might . " " Poor little one , you were sorely punished for that , " said grandma , kindly . " And another , too , I did ; I threw my basket away ; but that was n't much wicked ; Jennie made me think perhaps ' t was a non . " " A what ? " " A non , that catches lightning , you know ; so I threw it away to save my life . " Grandma smiled . " And now , " continued Dotty , twirling her fingers , " can you -- can you -- forgive me , grandma ? " " Indeed I can and will , child , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dotty , looking distressed , " you think I do n't feel sorry because I do n't cry . I ca n't cry as much as Prudy does , ever ; and besides , I cried all my tears away last night . " Dotty rubbed her eyes vigorously as she spoke , but no " happy mist " came over them . " Why , my dear little Alice , " said grandmamma , " it is quite unnecessary for you to rub your eyes . Do n't you know you can prove to me that you are sorry ? " " How , grandma ? " " Never do any of these naughty things again . That is the way I shall know that you really repent . Sometimes children think they are sorry , and make a great parade , but forget it next day , and repeat the offence . " " Indeed , grandma , I do n't mean ever to deceive or disobey again , " said Dotty , with a great deal more than her usual humility . " Ask your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Parlin , solemnly . CHAPTER VIII . WASHING THE PIG . After her grandmother had left the room , Miss Dotty lay on the sofa for five minutes , thinking . " Then it does n't make any difference how much anybody cries , or how much they do n't cry . If they are truly sorry , then they wo n't do it again ; that 's all . " Then she wondered if Jennie Vance had asked her step-mother 's pardon . She thought she ought to talk to Jennie , and tell her how much happier she would feel if she would only try to be a good little girl . " That child is growing naughty every day of her life , " mused Miss Dimple , with a feeling of pity . There was plenty of time to learn the morning 's lesson by heart , for Dotty was obliged to keep very quiet all day . The thorn had been removed from her foot , but the healing must be a work of time ; and more than that , her throat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never come ; and when at last their cheerful voices were heard ringing through the house , it was a welcome sound indeed . They had brought some oranges for Katie and Dotty , with sundry other niceties , from Aunt Martha 's . " Did you know , " said Dotty , " I have n't had any breakfast to-day ? I 've lost one meal , and I never shall make it up as long as I live ; for I could n't eat two breakfasts , you know . " " I 'll tell you what we 'll do , " said Aunt Louise , laughing ; " if you 'll wake me up at twelve o'clock some night , I 'll rise and prepare a breakfast for you , and that will make it all right . " Dotty looked at her auntie as if she did not know whether to take her in earnest or not . " I 've been sick at home all day , Prudy , " said she ; " and I s'pose you 've been having a good time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who 's Lightning Dodger ? " " Why , Aunt Martha 's horse ; do n't you know ? They call him that because they say he goes so fast the lightning do n't have time to hit him . " " O , you do n't believe it -- do you ? " cried Dotty ; " I guess that 's poetry . " " Little sister , " replied Prudy , speaking in a low voice , " do n't say ' poetry ' ever again . There 's something about it that 's very queer . I thought I knew how to make poetry , but they all laugh at me , even grandma . " Dotty looked greatly surprised . " Yes , " continued Prudy , with a trembling voice ; " I can rhyme verses and jingle them ; but there 's something else I do n't put in , I s'pose , that belongs there . Some time I 'll look in the big dictionary and see what it is . " " Is Prudy telling about the party ? " asked Susy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Dotty , dancing on her well foot . " There , now , do n't feel so happy , darling , for you ca n't go ; its a family party , and Cousin Lydia wrote she had n't room for the two youngest ; that 's you and Flyaway . " Dotty looked as if she had received a blow . True , she knew nothing about Cousin Lydia , who lived twenty miles away ; but if that individual was going to have a party , of course Dotty wished to go to it . " Uncle John is going , all his wife and children , " said Prudy ; " and I do n't see why Dotty ca n't . " Uncle John was Aunt Martha 's husband , and " all his wife and children " meant only Aunt Martha and Lonnie . " Cousin Lydia wanted to make me cry , " exclaimed Dotty , her eyes shooting out sparks of displeasure ; " she ' spected I 'd cry , and that 's why -- Katie , " added she , drawing the little one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to her house . " " What for she wo n't ? " cried Katie , looking defiant . " If I good would her put me in the closet ? I do n't like her tall , tenny rate . " This was the strongest expression of wrath Katie dared use ; and when she said she did not like a person " tall tenny rate , " it meant that she was very , very angry . " Has Cousin Yiddy got some heart ? " asked she indignantly . " Not a bit , " replied Dotty , fiercely . Mrs. Parlin now tried to explain . She said Mrs. Tenny did not intend any disrespect to the two youngest ones ; but she really had no room for them , as her guests were to spend the night . " The mistake she made was in asking Susy and Prudy , " said Aunt Louise ; " but I suppose she was curious to see our little poetess . " Prudy blushed , and hid her face behind the curtain . " Poor little sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For Dotty sat in the rocking-chair , as stiff as a jointed doll , looking as if she loved nobody and nobody loved her . Her beautiful eyes had ceased to shoot sparks of fire , and now appeared hard and frozen , like thick blue ice . In fact , a fit of the pouts was coming on very fast , and gentle Prudy dreaded it . She had been so happy in the thought of riding to Bloomingdale ; could she give up that pleasure , and stay at home with Dotty ? Nothing less , she knew , would satisfy the child . All her life Prudy had been learning to think of the happiness of others before her own . She cast another glance at the still face . " I 'm not going to Bloomingdale , " sighed she , behind the curtain . But when she told Mrs. Parlin so , that night , her voice was very tremulous . " You dear little girl , " said grandma , giving her a hearty kiss ; " you need not make any such resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as you . You are going to Bloomingdale with us , my child ; so bring your blue dress to me , and let me see if it is in order . " Though Prudy 's offer to remain at home had been made in all good faith , and though she was really sorry to think of leaving Dotty alone , still I can not say her heart did not bound with delight on being told she must go . Thursday morning came clear and bright , and with it Miss Polly , downcast and sad , in a mournful brown bonnet , the front of which , as Prudy said , was " making a courtesy . " Miss Polly was , however , in as good spirits as usual , and had come to keep house with Ruth , and help take care of the children for this day and the next . Till the last minute Prudy and Dotty walked the piazza , their arms about each other 's waist . " I s'pose , " said Dotty , sullenly , " when you are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't think anything about me and Katie , left here all alone . " " Why , little sister ! " " Maybe , " continued Dotty , " the ducks will hatch while you 're gone . I saw the white hen flying over the fence with one of those eggs in her mouth . " " A piece of the shell ? " " O , no , a whole egg , right in her bill , " replied Dotty , who supposed she was telling the truth . " And you know those big strawberries that cost a cent apiece , Prudy ; you 'll be sorry you could n't be here to help eat ' em in cream . " Perhaps Dotty hoped , even at this last moment , that Prudy would be induced to stay at home . If so , she was doomed to be disappointed . " Well , " said Prudy , " I 'm glad you 'll have such nice times , Dotty . " " O , it wo n't be nice at all . Something will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dotty , determined to be miserable . After the two carriages , with the horses " Deacon " and " Judge , " had driven off , and grandpa had given his last warning about fire , and Horace and the girls had waved their handkerchiefs for the last time , Dotty proceeded to the kitchen to see if she could find anything wherewith to make herself unhappy . Ruth stood by the flour-board kneading bread , and cutting it with a chopping-knife in a brisk , lively way . Polly sat by the stove sighing and rubbing silver . " Dear me , child , what are you doing with my starch ? " said Ruth as she saw Dotty with the bowl at her lips , and a sticky stream tickling down her apron . " Starch ? " cried Dotty , in disgust ; " and you never told me , Ruthie ! How did I know it was n't arrow-root ? " " You see , Polly , " said Ruth in a discouraged tone , " just what we are to expect from these children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Katie will be running away . They are enough to try the patience of Job when they both of them set out to see what they can do . And if Jennie Vance comes , the house will be turned upside down in five minutes . " Ruth might have known better than to complain to Polly , who always had something in her own experience which was worse than anybody else had known . " We all have our trials , " sighed that sorrowful woman ; " if it is n't children , it 's aches and pains . Now , for my part , I 've been troubled for ten years with --  " Here followed a list of diseases . Ruth shut her lips together , resolved to say nothing more about her own trials . " They do n't either of them like me , " thought Dotty . " I 'm going off in the barn , and perhaps they 'll think I 'm dead . Katie , " said she , sternly , " I 'm going off somewhere , and you must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else who felt quite alone in the world , and that was little Katie . Her cousin had pushed her one side as if she was of no value . Katie was a very little child , but she was old enough to feel aggrieved . She went into the parlor , and threw herself face downwards on the sofa , thinking . " Somebody leave me alone . O , dear ! Some naughty folks do n't think I 'm any gooder than a baby . " Then the poor little thing ran out to " breve the fleshy air . " No , she was n't quite alone in the world after all , for there was Charlie Gray at the gate . " Is um you ? " she cried gleefully . Charlie said it was . " You did n't came to see big folks -- did you ? You camed to see Katie . I love you deely . " Then she tried to kiss him ; but Charlie drew away . " O , is your face sore ? " asked the little girl . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trees , and Charlie had found his tongue . " I did n't come thee you , " said he . " I came thee your grandpa'th pig . " " O , " said Katie , perfectly satisfied . Off they started for the pig-pen . Illustration : WASHING THE PIG.  - -  Page 137 . " I 'm glad Dotty Dimble goed away , " said Katie , swinging Charlie 's hand ; " her 's stinchy and foolidge . " " Good girlth do n't thay tho , " said sweet little Charlie rather shocked . " Well , I do ; stinchy and foolidge ! " repeated Katie , as severely as if she had known what the words meant . The pig was not expecting any visitors , and when he found that Charlie and Katie had brought him nothing to eat , he did not seem very glad to see them . " How you do , piggy ? " said Katie , swinging a stick through the opening by the trough . Piggy ran away , looking very unamiable ; and then he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulkily . " He do n't look pleathant , " said Charlie . " No , " replied Katie , archly ; " I guess um do n't want to be kissed . " Piggy winked his pink eyes , as if to say , " Ah , but I do . " " Does you ? " said Katie , kindly , " then I 'll frow you one ; " and she did it from the tips of her clean fingers . " But piggy 's velly dirty , " said she , wiping her lips on her apron . " Do n't they wath him ? " said Charlie ; " they wath theep . " " Um is n't a sheep , " returned Katie ; " um 's a pig . " " But your gwampa could wath him . " " No , gampa could n't ; gampa 's deaf . I 'll tell Ruthie , and Ruthie 'll wash him with the toof brush . " " I with thee would , " sighed Charlie ; " thee ought to . O ho ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you got a mop ? " " A mop ? " " Yes ; a bwoom ' thout any bwoom on it ; only wags . " Katie knew what he meant in a minute ; and soon her hair was flying in the wind , as she ran into the house for her handled mop . She looked first in the parlor , and then in the front hall ; but at last she found it in the wash-room . She was very sly about it , for she was not sure Ruthie would approve of this kind of housework . Then Charlie tugged out a pail of water , and dipped in the mop ; and between them both they thrust it through the opening of the pen , upon piggy 's back . But the dirty creature did not love clean water . When he felt the mop coming down , he thought the sky was falling , and ran as fast as Chicken Little frightened by the rose-leaf . It was of no use . The mop was wilful , and fell into the trough ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the forenoon in vain attempts to hook it out . When Ruthie went that noon to feed the pig , she found the trough choked with a mop , a hoe , a shovel , and several clothes-pins . She did not stop to inquire into the matter , but took the articles out , one by one , saying to herself , with a smile ,  --  " Some of that baby 's work . I could n't think what had become of my mop ; she 's enough to try the patience of Job . And now , " added Ruth , throwing her apron over her head , " I may as well look up Miss Dimple . There 's not a better child in the world than she is when she pleases ; but deary me , when things do go wrong ! " Just then a wagon drove up to the gate , and Ruth said , as she saw a burly figure alight from it ,  --  " Why , that ca n't be Uncle Seth ? I 'm afraid something has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAY . Meanwhile Dotty was lying on the hay in the barn scaffold . It is very easy to be unhappy when we particularly try to be so ; and Dotty had arrived at the point of almost believing that she almost wished she was actually dead . And , to add to her gloom , a fierce-looking man , with a long horse-whip in his hand , came and peeped in at the barn door , and screamed to Dotty in a hoarse voice that " Ruth Dillon wanted her right off , and none of her dilly-dallying . " And then , on going into the house , what should she learn but that this man had come to take Ruth home , because her mother was sick . The children -- so Ruth said -- must stay with Polly and be little ladies . O , dear , it was as lonesome as a line-storm , after lively Ruth had gone away . Dotty began to think she liked her brisk little scoldings , after all . " Does you feel so bad ? " said little Flyaway , gazing on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way ; " and , putting up both hands , she drew down her own little lips at the corners . " Yes , I feel bad , " said Dotty . " You need n't talk to me ; where 's your orange ? " " I squoze it , " replied Flyaway ; " and falled it down my froat . But I did n't had enough . If you pees , um , give me some more . " " Why , what an idea ! " said Dotty , laughing . But when she began to divide her own orange into sections , Katie looked on expectantly , knowing she should have a share . Dotty ate two quarters , gave one to Katie , and reserved the fourth for Polly . She longed to eat this last morsel herself , but Polly had praised her once for giving away some toys , and she wished to hear her say again , " Why , what a generous little girl ! " But when she smilingly offered the bite , what was her surprise to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , child , you need n't have saved such a tiny piece for me ; it does n't amount to anything ! " At the same time she ate the whole at a mouthful . Dotty felt very much irritated . Did Miss Polly think oranges grew on bushes ? What was the use to be generous if people would n't say " thank you ? " " I do n't feel much better than I did when I gave the beggar my money . But I did n't do my ' alms before men ' this time , though , " said she , looking at her little fat arms and wondering what her grandmother meant by talking of her giving them away . " I s'pose it 's my fingers that grow on the ends of my arms , and that 's what I give with , " she concluded . On the whole she was passing a dismal day . She had been told that she must not go away ; and it happened that nobody came , not even Jennie Vance . " If Prudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have come to see her , " thought the forlorn Miss Dimple , putting a string round one of her front teeth , and trying to pull it out by way of amusement . " O , dear , I ca n't move my tooth one inch . If I could get it out , and put my tongue in the hole , then there 'd be a gold one come . But I ca n't . O , dear ! " " Where is your little cousin ? " said Miss Polly , coming into the room with her knitting in her hand . " I thought she was with you : I do n't wonder they call her Flyaway . " " I do n't know where she is , I 'm sure , Miss Polly . Wo n't you please pull my tooth ! And do you ' spose I can keep my tongue out of the hole ? " " Why , Dotty , I thought you were going to take care of that child , " said Miss Polly , dropping her knitting without getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her usual slow pace . " There 's nothing so bad for me as worry of mind : I shall be sick as sure as this world ! " Dotty knew she had been selfish and careless . She not only felt ashamed of herself , but also very much afraid that something dreadful had happened to Katie , in which case she would be greatly to blame . She anxiously joined in the search for the missing child . I am sure you would never guess where she was found . In the watering trough ! Not drowned , because the water was not deep enough ! " I was trying to srim , " said she , as they drew her out ; " and THAT 'S what is it . " Even Miss Polly smiled at the dripping little figure with hair clinging close to its head ; but Flyaway looked very solemn . " It makes me povokin ' , " said she , knitting her brows , " to have you laugh at me ! " " It would look well in you , Dotty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this baby , and let your teeth alone . " Dotty twisted a lock of her front hair , and said nothing ; but she remembered her grandmother 's last words ,  --  " Alice , I depend upon you to amuse your little cousin , as your Aunt Maria told you . You know you can make her very happy when you please . " " Seems to me , " thought Dotty , " that baby might grow faster and have more sense . I never got into a watering-trough in my life !  - -  Why , how dark it is ! Hark ! " said she , aloud ; " what is that rattling against the windows ? " For she heard " the driving hail Upon the window beat with icy flail . " " That is hail , " replied Polly --  " frozen drops of rain . " " Why Miss Polly , " said Dotty , giving a fierce twitch at her tooth , " rain ca n't freeze the least speck in the summer . You do n't mean to tell a wrong story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her 's made a ' stake , " said Katie . " Now , look , Polly , it 's stones ! They 're pattering , clickety-click , all over the yard . Dear , dear ! The grass will look just like the gravel-path , and the windows will crack in two . " " Never you mind , " said Polly , knitting as usual ; " if it does any harm , ' twill only kill a few chickens . " Upon this there was another wail ; for next to ducks Dotty loved chickens . But lo ! before her tears had rolled down to meet her dimples , the patter of hail was over . " Come and see the rainbow , " said Polly , from the door-stone . It was a glorious sight , an arch of varied splendor resting against the blue sky . " That is n't a rainbow , " said Dotty ; " it 's a hail-bow ! " " What a big , big , big bubbil ! " shouted Katie . " She thinks somebody is blowing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dotty ; " I guess ' t would take a giant with a ' normous pipe -- do n't you , Polly ? " " There , now , " said Miss Polly , " I just want you to hold some of this hail in your hand . What do you call that but ice ? " " So it is , " said Dotty ; " cold lumps of frozen ice , as true as this world . " " And not stones , " returned Polly . " Now you wo n't think next time you know so much better than older people -- will you ? " " But I do n't see , Miss Polly , how it got here from Greenland ; I do n't , now honest . " " I did n't say anything about Greenland , child . I said it was rain , and it froze in the air coming down ; and so it did . " " Did it ? Why , you know a great deal -- do n't you , Miss Polly ? Did you ever go to school ? " Polly sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then a day . I was what is called a ' bound girl . ' I did n't have nice , easy times , like you little ones . You have no idea of my hardships . It was delve and dig from sunrise to sunset . " " Why , what a naughty mother to make you dig ! Did you have a ladies ' hoe ? " " My mother died , Dotty , when I was a creeping baby . The woman who took me to bring up was a hard-faced woman . She made me work like a slave . " " Did she ? But by and by you grew up , Miss Polly , and , when you had a husband , he did n't make you a dog -- did he ? " " I never had a husband or anybody else to take care of me , " said Polly . " Come , children , we must go into the house . " They all three entered the parlor , and Miss Whiting fastened the window tightly to exclude the air , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to take cold . " " I do n't see , " queried Dotty , " why your husband did n't marry you . I should have thought he would . " " He did n't want to , I suppose , " said Polly , grimly . Dotty fell into a brown study . It was certainly very unkind in some man that he had n't married Miss Polly and taken care of her , so she need not have wandered around the world with a double-covered basket and a snuff-box . It was a great pity ; still Dotty could not see that just now it had anything to do with Polly 's forgetting to set the table . " I 'm so hungry , " said she ; " is n't it ' most supper time ? " " It 's only five ; but you appear to be so lonesome that I 'll make a fire this minute and put on the tea-kettle , " replied the kind-hearted Polly . " What does your grandmother generally have for supper ? " " Cake sometimes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And perjerves , " added Katie ; " and -- and -- yice puddin' ' . " " She keeps the cake in a stone jar , " said Dotty , eagerly ; " and the strawberries are down cellar in a glass dish -- cost a cent apiece . " " The slips they grew from cost a cent apiece ; that is what you mean , " said Polly ; " you hear things rather hap-hazard sometimes , Dotty , and you ought to be more careful . " Illustration : A DARK DAY.  - -  Page 154 . The tea-kettle was soon singing on the stove , and Dotty forgot her peculiar trials when she saw the table covered with dainties . She was not sure grandma would have approved of the cake and tarts , but they were certainly very nice , and it was a pleasure to see how Polly enjoyed them . Dotty presumed she had never had such things when she lived with the " hard-faced woman . " " It was n't everywhere , " she said , " that she saw such thick cream as rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured it freely over the strawberries and into her own tea , which it made so delicious that she drank three cups . Then after supper she seemed to feel quite cheery for her , and , taking Katie in her arms , rocked her to sleep to the tune of " China , " which is not very lively music , it must be confessed . " Aunt ' Ria puts her to bed awake , " said Dotty . " She 's going to sleep in my bed to-night . " " Very well , " said Polly , " but you will sleep with me . " " Why , Miss Polly ! what if Katie should wake up ? " " She wo n't be likely to ; but I ca n't help it if she does . I may have the nightmare in the night . " " What is the nightmare ? " " It is something perfectly dreadful , child ! I sincerely hope you 'll never know by sad experience . It 's the most like dying of any feeling I ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if I do n't move it 's sure death ; and somebody has to shake me to bring me out of it . " Dotty turned pale . " Miss Polly , O , please , I 'd rather sleep with Katie ! " " But how would you feel to have me die in the night ? " " O , dear , dear , dear , " cried Dotty ; " let me go for the doctor this minute ! " " Why , child , I have n't got it now , and perhaps I sha n't have it at all ; but if I do , I shall groan , and that 's the way you will know . " Dotty ran into the shed , threw her apron , still sticky with starch , over her head , and screamed at the wood-pile . " O , if grandma were only at home , or Ruth , or Abner ! " " Why , what 's the matter , little Goody-Two-Shoes ? " said a manly voice . Abner had just come from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " gasped Dotty . " She 's afraid she 's going to die in the night , and she wants me to shake her . " Abner leaned against a beam and laughed heartily . " Never you fear , little one ! I have heard that story about Polly 's dying in the night ever since I can remember ; and she has n't died yet . You just say your prayers , dear , and go to sleep like a good little girl , and that 's the last you 'll know about it till morning . " So saying , he caught Dotty by the shoulders , and tossed her up to the rafters . The child 's spirits rose at once . It was such a comfort to have that strong Abner in the house in case of accidents . She said her prayers more earnestly than usual , but it was nearly five minutes before she fell asleep . The last thing she heard was Miss Polly singing a very mournful hymn through her nose ; and , while she was wondering why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into dreamland . Very little good would such a heavy sleeper have done if Miss Polly had had an ill turn . It was Polly who was obliged to shake Dotty , and that rather roughly , before she could rouse her . " Where am I ? Who is it ? " said she . " O , Miss Polly , are you dead ? " " Hush , child ; do n't speak so loud ; or you 'll wake Abner . Little Katie is sick , and I want you to stay with her while I go down stairs and light a fire . " CHAPTER X. THE END OF THE WORLD . Dotty shuddered . It seemed so unearthly and horrible to be awake at night ; to see a lamp burning , and Katie looking so very white . It was the strawberries which had made her ill , as Miss Polly confessed . When that good but ignorant woman had gone down stairs , Dotty had much ado to keep from screaming outright . " I thought somebody would die , " said she to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Katie . O , Katie , Katie Clifford ! you 're the cunningist child . We ca n't have you die ! " " Somebody leave me alone , " moaned Katie ; " and ' t was you'n the Polly woman . I do n't love anybody in this world ! " " Darling ! I did n't mean to , " said Dotty , " now honest . Polly said , ' O , dear ! she was going to die ' ; but I might have known she would n't . She told a wrong story -- I mean she made a mistake . " " You was naughty , " said Katie , " velly naughty ; but you did n't mean to . " " No , Katie ; ' t was Polly that was naughty . " " The krilt got off o ' me , " said Katie , picking at the tufted coverlet ; " and then I was sick . " " Miss Polly said it was the strawberries , darling ; and the cream poured over them so thick . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , uneasily . " Yes , " sighed Katie : " ' t was the stawbollies . Did I ask for the stawbollies ? No , but the Polly woman gave ' em to me . Did n't want ' em ; I wanted to be well . " After two weary hours , which seemed as long as days almost , poor little Katie was easier , and fell asleep . Dotty , who had taken several naps in her chair , would now have gone to bed again ; but Miss Polly was dressed , and said she could not close her eyes if she tried ; she meant to go down stairs to her knitting . Dotty was afraid to stay alone . She was always a little timid , and to-night her nerves had been considerably tried . The lamp cast frightful shadows , and the newly-risen moon shone through the white curtains with ghostly light . She could " preach " to Jennie Vance about God 's " holding the whole world in his arms ; " but she could not always remember it herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , looking like a wimpled nun , followed Polly down stairs . If she thought of wee Katie at all , she thought there were good angels in the room to guard her ; but she could not trust herself with them ; she would rather keep close to Polly . " I think , " whispered Polly , unlocking the back door and looking out at the sky , " it must be very near morning ; but the clocks have both run down , and I can only guess at the time by my feelings . " Then Polly made a brisk fire in the stove , and set the tea-kettle to humming . " Now I will get the milk-pail , " said she , " and you may put on the tea-pot . I am faint for want of something to drink . " It was one of Polly 's peculiarities that she always talked to children as if they had as much judgment as grown people . Dotty did not know where to look for any tea-pot except the very best one , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brought and set on the stove , empty . " Let me go too , let me go too ! " cried she , as Polly was walking out with the milk-pails . The daisies , with " their little lamps of dew , " seemed still asleep , and so did all the " red-mouthed flowers " in the garden . The cows looked up with languid surprise at sight of their visitors , but offered no objections to being milked . Dotty gave one hasty peep at the white hen sitting on the venerable duck 's eggs ; but the hen seemed offended . Dotty ran away , and took a survey of the " green gloom " of the trees , in the midst of which was suspended the swing , looking now as melancholy as a gallows . " O , what a dreadful night this is ! " thought the child , standing bolt upright , lest she should fall asleep . " Where 's the sun ? He has n't taken off his red silk night cap . He has n't got back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back at all ! I heard somebody say , the other day , the world was coming to an end . Miss Polly , " said she , aloud , re-entering the barn , " is n't this the longest night you ever saw in all the days of your life ? " " Yes , it has been considerable long , I am free to confess , " replied Polly , who thought she had had a very hard time keeping house , as was indeed the truth . " Do you s'pose , Miss Polly , that some morning the sun wo n't rise any more ? " " O , yes , " replied Miss Polly , who was always ready with a hymn :  --  " ' God reigns above ,  - -  he reigns alone ; Systems burn out , and leave His throne . ' " Why , yes , dear ; the world will certainly come to an end one of these days ; and then the sun wo n't rise , of course ; there wo n't be any sun . " And Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating time with the two streams of milk which dripped mournfully into the pail . " She is afraid this is the end of the world , " thought Dotty , with a throbbing heart , and a stifling sensation at the throat ; " she do n't believe the sun is ever going to rise any more . " The music suddenly ceased . " These are very poor cows , " said Polly , in a reflective tone ; " or else they do n't give down their milk . I understood you to say , Dotty , that Ruth milked very early . " " If everything 's coming to an end , it 's no wonder the cows act so , " said Dotty , to herself , but she dared not say it aloud . They went into the house , the trail of Susy 's long wrapper following after little Dotty Dimple like the closing feet in one of Polly 's long-metre verses . Still the moon shone with the same white , ghostly light , and the sun continued to keep away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she washed her hands , strained the milk , and set the pans away . " If I judged by my feelings , I should say it must be six o'clock , or very near it . At any rate , I 'm going to have a cup of tea . What 's this smell ? " On the stove stood a pool of something which looked like liquid silver , and proved to be the remains of the best tea-pot . At any other time Dotty would have felt very sorry ; but now the accident seemed a mere trifle , when compared with the staying away of the sun . Who could tell " if ever morn should rise ? " Even Miss Polly , with her constitutional gloom , was not just now so miserable as Dotty , and never dreamed that it was anything but sleepiness which made the little girl so sober . Dotty was not a child who could tell all the thoughts which troubled her youthful brain . " Well , well , " said Polly , giving another inquiring glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you what it is , Dotty ; we might as well go to bed . " But hark ! As she spoke there was a loud report as of a pistol . It seemed to come from the cellar . Miss Polly clapped both hands to her ears . Dotty shrieked , and hid her face in her lap , and shrieked again . " It has come ! It has come ! " cried she ,  - -  meaning the end of the world ,  - -  and stopped her ears . " What , what , what ! " whispered Polly , in sore affright , walking back and forth , and taking snuff as she went . It was certainly startling to hear a pistol go off so unexpectedly , at that solemn hour , under one 's very roof . Polly naturally thought first of housebreakers . She had barred and double-barred every door and window ; but now she remembered with dreadful remorse she had not fastened the outside cellar door . No doubt it had been left open , and burglars had got into the cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! and why had n't somebody particularly warned her to attend to that door ? Perhaps the burglars were stealing pork . But they would not have fired a pistol at the barrel -- would they ? O , no ; they were trying to blow up the house ! Polly took three pinches of snuff , one after the other , as fast as she could , slipped off her shoes , went to the kitchen window , and peeped through the blinds . Not much to be seen but moonlight , and the deep shadows of the ragged trees . Another pistol-shot ; then another . The sound came from that part of the cellar called the soap-room , directly under Polly 's feet . She did not wait for further warning . Every moment was precious . She meant to save what lives she could , for Polly was strictly conscientious . She took the nearly frantic Dotty into the china closet , dragging her like a sack of meal , and turned the key . " Stay there , child , if you know when you 're well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house is blowing up . I 'm going to call Abner . " In her consternation Polly had not reflected that Dotty was as likely to be blown up in the closet as anywhere else . The unfortunate little girl screamed and struggled in her prison in vain . There was no way of escape . Night of horrors ! As far as she was concerned , there were two ends to the world , and they were coming right together . Her agony is not to be described . Abner came very soon ; but it seemed an age . Being a brave man who had served three months in the army , he had the courage to walk down cellar and face the enemy . He found nothing worse , however , than a few bottles of beer which had blown off their own heads . He brought them up in his arms . " Here , " said he , " are your burglars , with their throats cut from ear to ear . " " Well , if I ever had such a fright in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the bottles , and catching her breath . Abner poured some of the beer into a goblet , and drank to the health of Miss Dimple , who climbed upon his knee , and felt as if the world had suddenly stopped coming to an end ; and she was greatly relieved . " But who fired the guns ? " said she , not understanding yet what it all meant . " It was only the beer coming out to get the air , " said Abner , taking another glass . " You could n't expect beer with the spirit of a hop in it to stay bottled up with a stopper in ! " " I never had such queer feelings , " exclaimed Polly , rolling up her eyes ; " and now it 's all over , I feel as if I was going to faint away . " " I would n't advise you to , " said Abner , coolly . " The enemy is routed , and victory is ours . Drink a little beer , Polly ; it will revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask , of your prowling about the house with this poor little girl at this hour of night ? " " Why , what time is it ? I thought by my feelings it must have been daybreak long enough ago . " It was Abner 's private opinion that Polly would do well to think less of her " feelings " now and always ; but he only said , consulting his watch ,  --  " It 's just one o'clock , ladies ; time for respectable people to be in bed . " Polly said she had never felt such surprise before in her life . She was afraid she should be sick ; for sitting up in the night was always too much for her . Dotty said her prayers over again , and fell into a sleep " sweeter than a nest of nightingales . " And with her last waking thought she thanked God the round red sun was not worn out yet , and the world had not come to an end . CHAPTER XI . CRAZY DUCKLINGS . When the family came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Katie 's experiment in the watering-trough , the child 's illness , the explosion of the beer , and her own fright and " dreadful feelings . " Mrs. Parlin regretted the loss of the tea-pot ; Miss Louise said she had heard of " witches making tea , " and perhaps this was the way they did it . In return for Miss Whiting 's laborious services in taking care of the children , Mrs. Parlin gave her various articles of food to carry home ; for Polly had one room in Mr. Grant 's house , which she was accustomed to call her home , though she did not stay there very much . Polly sighed her gratitude , put on her dark bonnet , and said , as she went away ,  --  " Now , Mrs. Parlin , if it should so happen that you should all go away again , do n't fail to ask me to come and keep house . You have always been so kind to me that I feel it a privilege to do any such little thing for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but a " little thing , " and it cost her a great effort to promise to undertake it again . Mrs. Parlin thanked Miss Polly very politely ; but for her part she thought privately it would be a long while before they would , any of them , be willing to trust such a nervous person with the care of the children a second time . " Good by , all , " said Polly , going off with her double-covered basket on her arm ; " remember me to Margaret when you write . " " What a funny thing to say ! " remarked Prudy ; " how can we remember people to anybody , or forget them to anybody either ? " " O , it was awful , " said Dotty , linking arms with Prudy and walking her off to the seat in the trees . " Miss Polly scared me so I do n't believe I shall ever be afraid of lightning again ! " Little Flyaway ran after them , holding her nipperkin of milk close to her bosom , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was defful sick , " said she ; " and did I ask the Polly woman for the stawbollies ? No , she was naughty ; I did n't want ' em . She gived me stawbollies and stawbollies . " Prudy had to hear over and over again the trials which both the children had suffered . She had had a delightful time herself , as she always did have , wherever she was . She told Dotty and Flyaway of several interesting events which had happened ; but , best of all , she had brought them a quantity of beautiful shells , which they were to divide with Ruthie . The brisk Ruth had come back again as energetic as ever . It proved that her mother had not been so very ill , after all . " Bless that Prudy 's little white heart , " said she , kissing her on both cheeks ; " she never forgets anybody but herself . " Ruthie did not praise children as a general thing ; but she loved Prudy in spite of herself . Aunt Maria had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she , " I knew you would try to take good care of my little Katie . " " O , thank you ever so much , Aunt ' Ria , " cried Dotty , handing the dolly at once to Prudy to be admired . But next minute her conscience pricked her . She had no right to a present . True , Katie ought to have known better than to try to swim ; still , as Dotty acknowledged ,  --  " I need n't have felt so sober , I s'pose , and then I should have taken care of her . " Dotty was learning to pay heed to these little pricks of conscience . Slowly and sadly she walked back to her Aunt Maria , who was standing on the piazza training the clematis . " I s'pose , auntie , you thought I took care of the baby ; but I did n't . I let her swim . Miss Polly said she had the ' blues , ' and so did I. " Aunt Maria smiled . " Very well , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the suffering you have endured . I hope you will not see two such gloomy days again during the summer . " " O , you darling auntie ! May I keep the dolly ? " There was no sting now to mar Dotty 's pleasure in her new possession . Her troubles seemed to be over ; life was blossoming into beauty once more . " Good news ! Good news ! " she cried , rushing into the house , her head , with its multitude of curl-papers , looking like a huge corn-ball . " Two duckies have pecked out ! " " You do n't say so ! " said Susy , coolly . " High time , I should think ! " So thought the patient and astonished old hen , who had been wondering every day for a week if this was n't an uncommonly " backward season . " But at last the eggs , like riches , had taken to themselves wings . The soft , speckled creatures found plenty of admiring friends to welcome them as they tried their first " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the world , however , for some time , it must be confessed , on account of the corn-meal dough which the children sprinkled into their eyes . " We wo n't let you starve , our ony dony Ducky Daddleses , " said Dotty . " Our deenty doiny Diddleses , " said Katie after her , running hither and thither like a squirrel . It was a time of great satisfaction . Dotty regretted that Jennie Vance had gone to Boston , for it would have been pleasant to see Jennie envious . What were gold rings compared to ducklings ? The blunt little beaks pecked out very fast . As soon as they were all out , except the two eggs which were addled , the step-mother hen gathered her family together and went to house-keeping , gipsy fashion , in the back yard . She clucked to the ducklings , and they followed her , their little feet going pat , pat , on the soft grass . A nice time they had , no doubt , eating picked-up dinners , with now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five for Dotty , five for Prudy , and one for Katie , the little girl with flying hair . After they had been alive two days , Prudy thought they ought to have a bath ; so she took the large iron pan which Ruth used for baking johnny-cakes , filled it with water , put the tiny creatures in , and bade them " swim , " to Madam Biddy 's great alarm . They did it well , though they were as badly crowded as the five and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie . Katie wished the Charlie boy to see the ducklings , which were " velly difrunt from a piggie ; " but dear Charlie was very ill , and when the children went with the milk , they were not allowed to see him . I may as well give you here the history of the ducklings . The next morning after their " swim " there were only ten left , and Dotty 's lamentations could be heard all over the house . It was Katie 's odd one , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture on his back that looked like a clover . Next morning there were nine ; and on the tenth day there was but one solitary duckling left to pipe out his sorrows all alone . The anguish of the children was painful to be behold . Dotty 's grief affected her somewhat like the jumping toothache . Who could have carried away those dear , dear little duckies ? Who indeed ? About this time the unprincipled old cat was found in the cellar , wiping her lips and purring over a little soft , speckled down . " It was you that did it , was it , you wicked mizzable kitty ? " burst forth the bereaved Dotty behind the swinging broomstick . " I must strike you with the soft end . I will ! I will ! If I 'd known before that you 'd eat live duckies ! O , pussy , pussy , when I 've given you my own little bones on a plate with gravy ! " " Whose little bones did you say , my dear ! " asked Abner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Dotty , dancing about in her rage . " Why , dear little damsel , do I really understand you to say you eat chickens ? Then you are as bad as the cat . " " Why , Abner ! " " And worse , for you have no claws . " " No claws ? " " No -- have you ? If you had , I should conclude they had been made to tear little birds and mice in pieces . " " Is that what kitty 's claws were made for ? " " So I am told . The truth is , she behaves much better for a cat than you do for a little girl . " Dotty scowled at her feet and patted them with the broom . " And better than I do for a young man . " " But she ate my duckies -- so there ! " " And Prudy 's too , " said Abner . " But Prudy does n't beat her for it . It is n't pleasant to see nice little girls show so much temper , Dotty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ducklings were a little crazy , and it did n't make much difference what became of them . " " Crazy ? " " Yes , their minds were not properly balanced . There 's one left , I believe . I 'm going to make a lunatic asylum for him , and put him in this very day . " Dotty calmed herself and watched Abner as he made a pen with high stakes , and set in one corner of it a pan of water for swimming purposes . The " speckling , " as she called him , was Dotty 's own ; and when he was put into this insane hospital , all safe from the cat , his little mistress was in a measure consoled . " I am sorry he is crazy , " said she ; " but I s'pose the hen did n't hatch him well . Maybe he 'll get his senses by and by . " All this while dear little Charlie Gray was very ill . But I will tell you more about him in another chapter . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charlie 's illness every day ; but , like all young children , she thought very little about it . Some one said he was " as white as his pillow . " Dotty was amazed , for she had never seen any one as white as that . Then she heard her grandmother say she was " afraid Charlie would die . " " Die ? " It sounded to Dotty like a word heard in a dream . She only knew that people must die before they went to heaven , and when they died they were very , very cold . Illustration : DOTTY IN THE SWING.  - -  Page 189 . One night , when she went with the milk , Mrs. Gray was weeping . She asked Dotty if she would like to see little Charlie " once more . " Dotty entered the darkened room with a strange feeling of awe . There he lay , so still she hardly dared to breathe . Darling , darling Charlie ! But when she had touched the little hot hand and kissed the sweet wasted face , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to heaven ? He did not look any more like an angel now than he had always looked . His face was not as white as the pillow ; no , indeed ; and he was not cold ; his lips were warmer than hers . " He used to have three chins once , " whispered Dotty , " darling Charlie ! " " You love my little Charlie -- do n't you , darling ? " said Mrs. Gray ; and then she clasped Dotty in her arms and sobbed over her ; but Charlie did not seem to notice it . " Yes , ' m , I do love him , " said Dotty ; " Prudy says he 's the cunningest boy there is in this town . " And then she softly kissed Mrs. Gray 's cheek , though she had never kissed her before , and did not know why she was doing it now . " When he gets well , wo n't you let him come to our house and play croquet ? We play it now with marbles , a teenty-tonty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out wide . " Dotty spoke very low , and Charlie did not pay the least attention ; but Mrs. Gray sobbed still more , and held Dotty closer in her arms , saying ,  --  " Do n't talk so , dear ! " " How sorry you do feel to have him so sick ! He wo n't grow up , I s'pose , if he ca n't play . When he stays in bed it makes him grow littler and littler ! Why , how little his neck is ! It looks like a dandelion stem ! " " Do n't , do n't , dear child ! Every word you say strikes right to my heart ! " Dotty looked up in Mrs. Gray 's face with surprise . What had she said that was wrong ? Perhaps she ought not to have talked about dandelions ; she would not do it again . " Dotty , " said Mrs. Gray , looking sorrowfully towards the bed , " when fathers and mothers are not very wise , and do not know very well how to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their little children away . " Dotty knew what she meant now . She meant that Charlie was really going to heaven . " O , Mrs. Gray , " said she , " how Prudy and I will feel ! " She would have said more , but was afraid she should make another mistake . She kissed the unconscious little sufferer good by , though still it all seemed like a dream . Was this the same boy who had tried to wash the piggy ? The same who had meal-bags tied to his feet ? " A long kiss is a heart-kiss , " she repeated to herself ; and somehow she wondered if Charlie could n't take it to heaven with him . Then she walked home all alone with her thoughts . Next day they told her Charlie was dead . Dotty sat on the sofa for a long time without saying a word ; then she went into the nursery , and staid by herself for an hour or two . When she returned she had her new doll in her arms , dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own neck , and had caught Flyaway long enough to put one upon her arm , as well as upon the knobs of the nursery doors . " Prudy , " said she , " it is polite to do so when we lose people we love . Charlie was my friend and Katie 's friend , and we shall treat him with the respect of a friend . " " Yes , " said Katie , skipping after a fly , " spec of a fend . " Dotty had never looked on death . " You mus n't be frightened , little sister , " said Prudy , as they walked hand in hand to Mrs. Gray 's , behind the rest of their own family , on the day of the funeral . " Charlie is just as cold as marble , lying in a casket ; but he does n't know it . The part of him that knows is in a beautiful world where we ca n't see him . " " Why ca n't we see him ? " said Dotty , peering anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , " replied Prudy , " but Grandma Read says God does n't wish it . And He has put a seal over our eyes , so an angel could stand right before us , and we should n't know it . " " Ah ! " said Dotty in a low voice ; and though she could see nothing , it seemed to her the air was full of angels . " But I think likely Charlie can see us , Dotty , for the seal has been taken off his eyes . O , it is beautiful to be dead ! " After this Dotty was not at all afraid when she touched the cold face in the casket , for she knew Charlie was not there . " It is beautiful to be dead ! " said she next day to Katie . " Charlie is very glad of it . " " Yes , he 's in the ground-up ,  - -  in heaven ! " said Katie in a dreamy way ; for , in her small mind , she believed heaven was a place called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared about it . " Yes , Charlie is in the ground , " replied Dotty , " but he does n't know it . That dog Pincher was put in the ground ; but I think likely he knew it , for his soul was n't in heaven ; and he had n't any soul , not a real one . " " Well , " said Katie , dancing out at the door , " when will the Charlie boy come back ? I want um play . " " Why , Katie , " said Dotty , in a tone of reproof , " have n't I told you he is all dead ? " " Well , YOU is n't dead -- IS you ? Less us go an ' swing ! " The little girls ran out to the trees , and soon forgot all about their old playmate . But , after this , whenever any one spoke of Charlie , Katie thought ,  --  " The Charlie boy 's in the ground-up ,  - -  in heaven , " and Dotty thought ,  --  " O , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * For the present , we will leave them swinging under the tree at Grandma Parlin 's ; but if we see Miss Dimple again , she will have been spirited away to her own mother 's home in the city of Portland .
