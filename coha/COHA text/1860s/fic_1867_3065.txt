CHRISTMAS STORY , BY DR . SAMUEL W. FRANCIS . PUBLISHED BY GEORGE H. MATHEWS , 929 BROADWAY , NEW YORK . 1867 . A CHRISTMAS STORY . MAN IN HIS ELEMENT : OR , A NEW WAY TO KEEP HOUSE . BY DR . SAMUEL W. FRANCIS . PART I. A WOMAN 'S PLAN . ' My dear Mary , ' said I , one morning , to my widowed sister , as she sank into an arm chair in front of my library fire , and heaved a sigh replete with exhaustion and sadness : ' What is the matter ? ' ' Enough for a woman , William , but of course , nothing for an old bachelor like you , who have only to pay your own bills , eat your meals without the trouble of ordering them ; lounge through a clean house with no chasing after servants to sweep and wash and dust ; sit in your study , heaping log after log on your devoted andirons , and always meeting me with such a provoking cheerfulness , while I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give out stores to one girl ; soap and starch to another ; candles and linen to the chambermaid , and orders to the coachman ; and , even then , I have no peace ; for , no sooner do I sit in the nursery , hoping to derive a few minutes comfort from a quiet sew , than my ears are filled with the dissatisfaction of one girl ; the complaints of another ; the threatenings to leave of another , and the quarrels of all . I declare , William , I think it was too bad in you to insist on our leaving that comfortable boarding house , where we lived so much cheaper , and had no trouble . It was there , with my small family , that I appreciated the freedom from care that you old selfish , unsympathizing bachelors enjoy ; and no wonder you laugh at us . The fact is , you do n't know anything about it ; you  - -   - -   ' ' My dear Mary , ' I repeated , ' you have said enough -- I only ask for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in time , you yourself will be convinced . ' ' That 's all very well , William , but what 's the use of talking to you men . I never convinced one in my life . No sir ! man is an animal that never acknowledges either that he is wrong , or that a woman is right . I tell you , servants are the bane of my existence . You can not make them happy , do what you may . Why , only the other day I gave Jane a nice pair of gaiters that I had but partially worn out . She thanked me , and I felt pleased that I had done one kind action , though it was a self-denial . The very next morning , in coming out of the kitchen , I passed the ash barrel , and looked in it to see if the cinders would ever be sifted . What do you suppose I saw there , mixed up with lemon peel , tea leaves and ashes ? My boots , William -- the very pair I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you do ? ' ' Do ? Why as soon as I could recover I called her to me , and asked why she had thrown them there . ' She said without any excitement , that was the worst of it , ' I could n't wear them Madam . ' ' Why not ? ' I said . ' They were too large for me . ' ' Too large for her , the jade -- think of that '  --  ' Do n't say any more , Mary , I understand the case perfectly -- and since we can not argue upon the matter just listen to my views ( without any interruption ) , in the form of a philosophical lecture . It will be very brief but to the point . ' Though I have never kept house , as I am an old man I must have lived somewhere all my life . Being possessed of a healthy and observing intellect -- I have seen and digested much ; and it is all easy to my mind . I have heard you through as I have heard others through ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen many , very many suffer and endure trials , and I have solved the problem and told it all to my segar ! ' ' Well now that is selfish , William ! ' ' Not at all my dear sister , what lady would tolerate the slightest interference with her housekeeping ? How long would you permit me to stay here , in financial partnership , if I even offered one word of advice . ' ' Oh , how unjust , speak out now and let me hear what you have confided to your segar . ' ' Well , in the first place , there are two kinds of ways to keep house . No. one is to keep your servants ; No. two is to be kept by them . Herein is the key note of much trouble . Another difficulty is fear . I have been perfectly amazed to listen to ladies when asking a waiter to do something for them . Just think of it . I heard Mrs.  - -   - -   , at table the other day , turn round and look towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and say , ' Betty , would you mind giving me a glass of water ? ' ' Zounds madam , I wanted to scream !  - -  and only last night , while paying a visit I heard a lady who rules her elegant husband to within an inch of his life , say to the waiter , ' John , please put on your things and muffle up well , for it is very cold and do take this note to Mrs. Henry 's ' and , almost with the same breath , she turned on her husband and said , ' Albert , go down and get that medicine at once for you know I can not retire till I take it -- you can see your friend any time , ' looking at me in a hard manner and then at the clock . ' Now what do you call that ? That woman has courage to meet her equals and put all things straight ; but a menial crushes her . ' ' Well , of course you do n't understand those things , William , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to . It is all wrong -- all humbug , all TRASH ! ' I exclaimed as my excitement knocked the ashes of my segar over my clean shirt . ' What would you have us do ? ' exclaimed Mary , a little nettled at my last remark . ' Do ? ' I replied , with emphasis ; ' let the men keep house . Watch them , and learn the true method , which has for its motto , " Maximum of work , Minimum of trouble . " ' By this time I began to feel anxious.  - -  My sister had gone off into a fit of laughter that at first greatly roused my ire , but ultimately awakened anxiety , for she could not gain her breath . I rang for a servant ; of course none came , for she always had to call them . ' They were having such a good time down stairs , they could not hear the bell , ' so I poured out a glass of water , and , while she drank , seized the poker ; stirred up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; lit a large and strong Cabana to lend zest to my courage , and prepared to make one more effort for victory . Gradually subsiding into a few occasional chromatic giggles , Mary looked through her beautiful eyes , glistening with tears of fun , and said , in a smothered whisper , ' Well , and what would you do ? ' ' Do ? ' I repeated . ' Let me have the reins for one month , and I will show you . ' There ! it was out , and I felt relieved . ' But , William , ' she whispered , pointing with anxiety to the door which stood ajar , ' how long do you suppose they would stay with you ? ' ' Until they got married or died ! ' I answered with confidence , and , sitting bolt upright , I ran both thumbs under my waistcoat arm-holes and played on my chest with my fingers , while I puffed tremendously to envelope my countenance with smoke , the better to hide my ill-concealed smile . ' You single men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , looking earnestly into my face and patting my shoulder with an expression of pity . ' To convince you that woman 's mission is the care of domestic matters ; and , as I would like a little rest combined with fun , I will turn over everything to you , and --  --  ' ' Done ! ' I yelled with delight , and jumping up , I paced up and down the library like a prisoner freed from chains.  - -  'Done ! Oh ! I thank you , Mary . ' ' Stop , young man , ' she said , with assumed severity , ' hear the conditions of the bond . ' ' Write it down , ' I said , in haste , ' and so long as I am to have the reins I will sign . ' ' Well , sir , ' said she , entering with her old accustomed gaiety into the subject matter . ' I agree to let you keep house on the following conditions : ' naming a good many , which I listened to with marked interest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though no lawyer ; for fear , as I told her , she would violate the premises . As well as I can remember , for it was many years ago -- it ran as follows : ' This agreement made this 24th November , 1853 , between Mary Walters of the city , county and state of New York , being party of the first part , and William d'Aubrey of the said city , county and state of New York , party of the second part , witnesseth as follows : Said party of the first part agrees , covenants and binds herself , heirs and assinines -- I mean assigns -- to surrender , demise and make over all claim , right and title to housekeeping , and all matters pertaining to the welfare of household economy , whether trivial or special , to the party of the second part ; moreover delivering up all accounts , keys and inventory of stores now on hand , and all claim , right or title to the management of each and every person living , or about to live in premises known as ' Villa Felice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -   - -   in the State of  - -   - -   , for the period of three months . Now , in consideration of this obligation on the party of the first part , the party of the second part covenants , agrees and binds himself , his heirs and assinines -- I mean assigns -- to act conscientiously for the benefit of all the inhabitants of said ' Villa Felice , ' whether male or female ;  - -  and moreover pledges himself never by word or deed to consult , ask questions of , molest by interrogated words , or lead on by indirect remarks , the party of the first part ; to impart , give over or yield up , any information on or concerning the subject or principle of housekeeping --  ( this last clause my sister insisted on in a most impressive manner -- so I added the following , ) and it is distinctly understood , comprehended by , and agreed to between both parties , that the party of the first part interferes with , molests , makes the subject of remark , indirectly or directly , impugns or maligns , the party of the second party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor by entreaty , nor by satire , irony , libel , gossip , hinted evidence or such other expressions of mental feeling which are unseemly and tend to weaken man 's power or involve in confusion a settled purpose . Said agreement to take effect at once on the signing of this contract , ' made in duplicate . Signed , sealed and delivered the afore-written day , month and year , in the presence of Witness , MARY WALTERS , seal . WILLIAM D'AUBREY , seal . We both signed , and then remembered a witness was necessary . ' I will call Thomas , ' said Mary . ' He wo n't know what we have written . ' I bowed with a legal stiffness , and waited . She rang -- no response . She rang again . A loud laughter in the kitchen caused her to say , as usual , ' Oh ! they can not hear the bell , ' and she tripped off lightly and called ' Susan ! Susan ! Susan ! ' ' and but the booming roars replied and fast the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gently , over the bannisters . ' Susan is out , marm , ' said a granite voice from the second story . ' Do n't speak so loud , marm . Johnny has just gone to sleep , and I 've had such trouble with him all the evening ; he must have caught cold going to dancing school . You know , marm I begged you not to send him . ' Mrs. Phillips , ' whispered Mary , in a crushed voice , ' where has Susan gone ? ' ' She went to her sister 's , marm . Her child is very ill with the small pox , and she said she knew , if you knew he might die , that you would let her go and sit up with him this last night , poor , dear soul , bless his heart ! ' Oh , how I chuckled ! ' Why , Mrs. Phillips , just come down stairs , please ; I want to speak to you.  - -  Come into the library , only Mr. D'Aubrey is here . ' ( Humph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) Enter Mrs. Phillips , one of those fat , pylygastric nurses , who divide the twenty-four hours into four days , so as to have three meals to each of their diurnal revolutions ; whose digestive organs , if they could speak , would strike for wages ; whose eyes move but never look ; their atmosphere -- what Germans might call expression -- being that of massive rest . She slides into the room and immediately sits down , moving her eyes up to her mistress with a patient and slightly suffering expression , while the process of deglutition is slowly going on . I seize a book , pamphlet , anything , hold it in front of my face , and bite my segar in two . ' Did I understand you to say , Mrs. Phillips , that Susan had gone to sit up with a small pox patient ? ' ' Her nephew , yes marm . ' ' Oh , how very wrong in her -- how --  ' ' I do n't think so , marm . ' I ground my teeth . ' Why Mrs. Phillips ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is her kin and she ought to know her duty to a sister 's child . ' ' Yes , but she might bring the disease to my little children ! she '  - -  'That 's in the hands of Providence , marm . ' I ram a handkerchief down my mouth and choke --  ' Well , as it is not your fault I need not speak to you -- but please be so kind as to call Thomas , I only want him for a moment . ' The celebrated Mrs. Phillips heaved a sigh , pregnant with bread , butter , cold meat and ale ; and slid out of the room , crunching her way down stairs . I peeped at my sister -- she looked pale and very anxiously perplexed , I pinched myself and kept silent . In a few minutes a voice was heard singing up the back stairs and -- enter Sabina spread out with starch and heavily pomaded hair . ' Mrs. Phillips sent me to tell you marm that she had to make her gruel and the fire was low -- and that Thomas had gone home . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Eight o'clock , ' I enunciate distinctly . For one moment Mary 's eyes lit up with something like heroism , but before she could frame a sentence , the playful want of interest exhibited by Sabina , who leaned against the mantel-piece , straightening her cuffs , did the business , and she collapsed . ' Please tell Thomas , when he comes to-morrow , Sabina , I would rather not have him go home quite as early , because you see , ' ( oh how I mentally groaned at this humiliating nonsense , ) ' I might want him . You wo n't forget , will you , Sabina ? ' ' No , marm . Is there anything else ? ' Having now made herself prim , and taken a quiet survey of the library and viewed me carefully , she was now desirous of retiring . ' One moment , Sabina , ' said Mary , beginning to realize her false position before me , ' Who is down stairs ? ' ' Well , I could n't tell you , marm . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' How , do you mean so many ? ' ' Why , marm , it 's the cook 's birthday ; and she thought you would'nt mind her having a few friends , so she invited her cousins , ' ( looking at me as though she would ask , ' what have you got to say to that , Mr. Man ? ' ) ' Well , Sabina , ' said Mary , coloring up in confusion , ' just sign your name to this -- it is only as a witness . ' ' I can not write , marm , ' answered dandy Amazon , very short at being exposed . ' Then send Elizabeth here . ' ' She is out too , marm . ' ' What ? Elizabeth has gone out ? ' ' Yes marm , you see , ' ( becoming confidential , ) ' the cook and her has quarrelled like -- she neglected to ask her to her little party till late this evening , and so she got huffy and put on her things and dashed out of the house , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ague or was laughing so hard internally that it leaked through . ) ' Is Dinah in ? ' ' Yes marm . ' ' Ask her , please , to come here . ' Sabina tripped off with a satisfied air , and five -- ten -- fifteen minutes elapsed and no Ellen . I took out my memorandum and quickly wrote down a few valuable plans on the coming campaign . The clock struck half past eight , and my sister opened the entry door and listened -- the kitchen door soon shut and somebody came up stairs slowly , with a waiter full of something . ' Is that you , Dinah ? ' ' Yes marm . ' ' Why did n't you come before ? ' ' I do n't know , mum . ' ' Did n't Sabina tell you I wanted you ? ' ' No , mum . She told me you wanted to know how many were down stairs , and I counted seventeen . ' ' Take care Dinah , you 're spilling that milk ! ' ' I ca n't help it , this pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' ' I do n't know , mum -- I think it 's broke . ' ' Broken ! Why , I bought a new one yesterday . ' ' ' Tai n't my fault . ' Hopelessly resigned , my sister Mary politely requested her to put down the waiter , and explained the nature of a witness 's duty . We acknowledged our signatures and Dinah wrote out her name in a neat hand , then picked up the waiter and walked out of the room with the air of an injured innocent . I jumped up , kissed my sister , informed her that for the next three months she was to be a passive observer , asked her to retire , locked up the contract , and gave the bell one pull that brought half the household to the door . PART II . A MAN 'S PLAN . As the servants rushed into the library they found me quietly reading a book and puffing at the pages . I slightly raised my eyes to this back ground of faces on which might be seen , surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed my book half open across my knee , with my hand resting on the cover , and with the other taking my segar out of my mouth , knocked the ashes off into a little glass tub ; elevated my eyebrows and asked in perfect astonishment , yet measured tones : ' What-is-the-matter ? ' ' That 's what we want to know sir ; ' exclaimed the cook , a little let down by my coolness . ' Nothing that I know of , ' I replied , except that I took the liberty of ringing my bell , ' increasing in volume as I spoke . ' We thought some one was sick , sir , ' said Sabina . ' I do n't want to know what you thought , ' I rolled out in emphatic base , ' I want the WAITER ! which is it ? '  - -  That neuter cut them to the heart . But they rallied -- a revolt was imminent . I had lived in the family one year , with my sister as housekeeper , and had never made a remark to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what was not my business , or clear out . But now -- now , with Imprimatur on my forehead , a clutch in my mental fingers , and a hungry longing to rule free : ha ! ha !  - -  Let us see . This was a trying moment -- The vessel had been signalled , and my colors were to be shown -- so here they go -- the flag of the little brig ' one-man-power , ' with the motto ' Anvil or hammar answer hammar , ' is unfurled . Hemmed in by swelling indignation , whisperings and sullen looks , I jumped up and yelled in stentorian voice : ' Leave my room ! How dare you answer the waiter 's bell ? Send me the waiter and clear out , every one of you ! ' and , with a sweeping wave of my hand , I stalked towards the door . Reader , did you ever see the sun chase a big cloud right off a green field , and , with no respite , drive it headlong away over beyond the horizon ? Such was the rapid departure of my stupefied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to with a violence that echoed through the hushed and palsied house . Oh the benefit of a good slam -- not a push -- nor a quick shut -- nor even a bump , all of which show still a want of firmness and decision -- but a good old-fashioned ' bang ' as though it had got into your throat and you could'nt breathe -- that life depended on shutting out a flash of lightning and you had n't time to wait -- that the harder you impelled it against the doorway the sooner would end fast fleeting agony -- that the nearer you got to what might be called an explosive shut : the more complete would be your safety , that if all your concentrated passion could be , not flung , ( that is too weak ) but hurled at that one partition a vacuum might be made in your room towards which good impulses might be drawn inversely . Many a good natured man who has been cornered by injustice has slammed off his anger , and is ready to forgive , but not give up . There is a dignity in this rapid developement of muscular power which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chip has been knocked off the shoulder , the black flag is hoisted and skull and bones stand out in bold relief . There may be a calm , the wind may die out , but the monster waves once lashed up to a Titanic power move on of their own accord , and wash away the very vestige of resistance . Asking to be forgiven after slamming a door is like touching off a Rodman gun , and then calling out to the fort in front to ' look out ' ' take care ! ' ' do get out of the way . ' A first class slam is cumulative long after the noise has ceased -- the nerves go on slamming -- the valves of the heart flap to and from -- the tympanum roils a revelrie to all the shattered senses , the offender slammed at , at once subsides from rage to fear ; the mental barometer falls -- and apprehension -- the requiescat -- is a do n't know what is coming next . A bona fide , abandoned slam is a Domestic Earthquake . I next sat down on my Mexican chair , and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led up from the kitchen into my room , and though never used , formed one of those abominable listening tubes that might be truthfully called family tale-bearers . This time , however , I had the pleasure of overhearing the following fragmentary evidence of a reaction : ' He must be crazy . ' ' Did he drink much after dinner ? ' ' I say , you have been here longer than I have , have you ever seen him so before ? ' Then a giggle , and some one saying : ' Is he married ? ' ' Sabina , ai n't you ashamed to laugh ? '  - -  'poor thing -- wo n't stay -- gallows '  - -  then silence , and in a few minutes one after another of the visitors passed by under the window on tip-toe , and almost immediately a soft knock and a pause . I thought * * * and acted . ' Come in , ' said I , in one of those gentle and subdued voices that no one but a passionate man can possess . The door gradually opened , and there stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of engravings before my eyes , and was busily engaged in drawing some plan , on paper , as she entered . I went on for a little while in silence , when she said : ' I understood , sir --  --  ' I said ' wait a minute , ' and went on ruling one entire side , with double lines , in perfect forgetfulness of her presence . When she spoke again , ' Did you send for me , sir ? ' I would have answered at once , for I felt awfully at appearing such a tyro ; but the case was a desperate one of long standing , and required heroic treatment . I kept her waiting , at first as a lesson , that her imagination might take wings and fly to the uttermost realms of unhappiness . The second time , I thought I detected a little impatience in her voice , so I said , taking a pen and dipping it in red ink , ' wait one moment , Susan , ' and went on lining and interlining . This was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she very well knew I could do any time . So it told on her . Each moment her valor oozed out , and as soon as I felt that the cup of bitterness was pretty well drained , I proceeded to offer up this victim as a sacrifice to peace . ' Susan , how is your sister 's child ? ' I looked straight into her . There was no sternness or smartness in my expression , but the gaze was mathematical . I was measuring her candor , and analyzing her mind . She colored up and said , ' he 's no better , sir ; and they 've given him up : but the doctor says good nursing will do wonders . ' ' I think so , too . Go back to your sister and stay till he is better ; I will supply your place . ' This puzzled her , but she could say nothing . I meant ' go ' and she went.  - -  There was no delay -- I saw her walk by the window almost at once , and overheard the whisper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dinah came to the door , saying , before she knocked , the waiter is out , sir , so I answered your ring . ' Do you know where Thomas lives ? ' ' Yes sir . ' ' Then tell him I want him now --  ' ' Yes sir , ' she disappeared . Oh the benefit of that slam . In half an hour in walked Thomas . ' Never do you enter my room without knocking . It is a piece of impertinence I will not put up with . ' ' I did not mean anything by it , sir . ' ' Well , do n't do it again , and always take your hat off when you come before a gentleman or lady . Such ignorance might lose you a good place . ' His wages were high I knew . It was also winter , and he gave in . He stood still with his hat in hand and waited . ' Thomas I want you to bring the close carriage to the door with the two bays . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe yesterday and I am afraid . ' ' You need not be , the ground is covered with snow . I shall want the carriage in fifteen minutes . ' ' Yes sir , but --  ' ' But what ? ' ' I left the carriage this morning at the blacksmiths to have a new tire put on it , sir . ' ' Who told you to ? ' ' Nobody , sir . ' ' Then never do anything of that kind again without first reporting it to me . ' ' Yes sir , ' moving slightly towards the door as though it was all settled now . ' What other vehicle have you got in the stable ? ' ' The Phaeton , sir ; the open box wagon and the carryall . ' ' Very well then , bring the nigh horse round in the carryall . ' ' He never went in single harness since I drove Mrs.  - -   - -   ' ' Well , then , put the other one in . ' ' Nor him neither , sir . ' ' Humph ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the other horse , the gray , that your mistress always drives when alone ? ' ' He is at the veterinary surgeons , sir.  - -  I took him there last Monday and he is to be blistered for two weeks off and on , sir . ' ' Well , Thomas , as the coachman of the family , I ask you what can be done . ' I must go out to-night . Can you suggest anything ? ' ' Nothing but to hire a hack , sir . ' ' That 's a very good idea , how far is the livery stable from here ? ' ' Just next to where I live , sir . I can get one in a minute , sir . ' Oh ! so cheerfully . ' Very well , Thomas , just harness the two bays and ride down there and put them to one . Tell the livery stable keeper that I wish it , and will pay for the use of it . ' ' But , sir , it is --  --  ' ' Thomas , I would advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to call yourself a coachman , and have what is under your charge in such a condition . The idea of a horse two days without a shoe . ' ' It is n't my --  --  ' ' Not a word -- go and do your duty in future . I shall expect you here in half an hour . ' He backed out of the room , longing to say something ( what it was I do n't care ) but completely at sea . As he passed under my window , ( though I have not sworn for many years , ) I am pretty sure I heard several full sized oaths . At the appointed time the bell rang and I went out and got into the carriage . The horses looked very warm , and , though the night was cold , one was covered with foam . I said nothing , but told him to drive to Susan 's sister 's . On arriving at the door , I heard sounds of very lively music for a dying child , and saw the house all lighted up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Hibernian wakes . Poor thing ! ' and I began to pardon Susan , feel sorry for the coachman , and made up my mind to give $10 towards the sepulchral expenses . As I entered the house , surcharged with benevolence and overcome by a repentant feeling , I caught sight of Susan and a strapping man whirling round the floor to the tune of the Irish Washwoman . I approached her and said , ' I hope he is better . ' She uttered a scream and ran out of the room . The next morning after having gone over everything in the house , I sent for each servant and told them quietly but firmly that my sister 's health was not very good , and that I was housekeeper -- that as they had engaged to fill certain positions , I should take it for granted they understood their business ; that I had neither the time nor would I take the trouble to overlook their work , but that as soon as I saw anything wrong they would hear from me . If they wanted anything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till 10 a. m. , no more . If they could not take the trouble to ask for what they wanted at that time , they could go without till the next day . I should not tell them what to do or when to do it , but if it was n't done , they would certainly leave . That I allowed no company and gave them certain nights to go out , but if anything special and true was the matter I was ready to assist , ' and now , ' said I , ' no quarreling down stairs ; each one to their work and no complaining.  - -  The moment you are discontented come to me and you can go at once if you choose . I do not want any notice ever , except where a baby is concerned . ' This done I then advertised for a cook . The next day my cook , down stair , came up to me quite flushed , and wanted to know if I intended to turn her away . I said no , I had no idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two in the house ; that I intended making the new one a waiter , and then if anything happened , such as the sudden departure , ' of my cook , ' I said , looking right at her , ' for you know they are quick tempered , why then I have one on hand . ' She colored up and retired . After going through a great deal of nonsense about the words ' help ' and ' servants , ' I at length got what I wanted and all went on smoothly for a time . My plan for detecting neglect in the cleaning of a room , was to stick half a dozen pins in different places about it -- some on the walls , in the window and other places that ought to be wiped . If I found them there after the cleaning , I became suddenly very disagreeable . During my sister 's administration , I had been obliged to wait sometimes three weeks before she could find time , for her servants , to put a button on my waistcoat . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that passed my library door was stopped , no matter what her work might be at the time , sent for a clothes brush , needle or hammar , and the thing was done at once . It acted like a charm , and all went on well . At first they objected , ( only silently ) , but I told them plainly that I hired them for my benefit , not theirs , which generally followed ; and that though their work was specified to a certain degree , they must on all occasions answer any calls and pay always for breakage . This last saved twenty dollars a month , for hardly anything under those expensive circumstances , fell of their hands ; and I noticed the plea of ' sudden change of weather , ' or ' some one must have disturbed it , ' or ' that horrid cat has been among those dishes and upset them , ' or ' t was cracked before , ' became as worn out as aphorisms of the past . I was always very attentive to them when sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , for they are very susceptible to a kind act out of place -- indulgence , however , is soon forgotten . I always made it a habit , too , to pay each servant something more a month than any one else . That , also , acted wonderfully like a retainer . But I distinctly told them I wanted my work done , because it was paid for . I asked no favors . Two other rules saved me much trouble . When a girl said she could n't do any set job , on account of no time , no matter what it was , I always said , ' why , that 's all nonsense ; it only takes five minutes ; ' and not infrequently have I irritated them into doing almost impossibilities . I never valued any cheap article under five dollars . Another great mistake , is to find fault with a servant before any one . Have they done wrong , go to your library and ring loudly -- that is half the battle ; then tell the waiter to call the chambermaid , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to reflect ; to weigh the pros and cons , and have half thought themselves into submission . Never argue . If you have the right exert it , but never be unjust ; and , above all , believe me when I tell you that their feelings are exquisite on the subject of neglect . Let them once feel a respect for you , yet know you are determined to have anything done , and a simple remark will lie like lead on their stomach , and you will hear them talking of it down stairs and using the bow anchor of firmness , ' he said so , ' until it is done . Never change your mind . I remember once , during that memorable interregnum of three months , and , in fact , the only time in my life did it happen.  - -  I had invited some very pleasant , agreeable and talented friends to spend the evening . I ordered my supper in the morning , and it commenced to snow . I continued giving orders , and it continued snowing , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything , the snow was a little ahead , but I went on in the same way . At the proposed time the gas was lit , a lantern was placed on the piazza ; snow swept off ; the side gate unhung by the waiter man , and a path made . The snow piled high , and the domestics began to give in , or out , I do n't know which . They doubted the probability of any one venturing out that ' dreadful night . ' A little later , they began to talk among themselves of the improbability of any one coming . I immediately ordered the gas turned up in full ; the candles lit , and the supper table laid -- every dish put in its place empty , to be filled at the proper time -- all for discipline . ( I had said it was to be done in the morning . ) I then went up stairs and dressed . My sister , who had gained five pounds every week since her abdication , met me in the drawing room , dressed elegantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not dare to make a remark , or the contract would have been violated ; but I thought I could detect in her eye an acknowledgment of my success . As I sauntered through the brilliantly lighted rooms , rather depressed at the non-arrival of my guests , the waiter said Thomas would like to speak to me . I immediately went to the star chamber and took an easy position . A knock this time . ' Come in . ' In walked Thomas with his hat in his hand and bowing respectively , he said -- 'I have just come from the stable Mr. D'Aubrey , and thought you would like to know about the storm , sir . ' ' What storm ? ' I exclaimed , ' oh , you mean the snow storm , yes -- is it still snowing ? ' At that moment the window was crackling with the hail . ' Yes sir , and I thought I 'd tell you that no one could come out to-night , for a horse without a wagon could not walk one hundred yards . ' ' Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call Henry . '  - -  Henry , the waiter , came in expecting orders to put away the clean things and lock up for it was ten , and not a soul had arrived . ' Order supper Henry at eleven . ' ' For whom , sir ? ' ' For me -- what are you waiting for ? ' ' How much , sir , ' said he , in a bewildered air . ' All of it . ' He looked anxious . He could not classify me , but discipline must be carried out , so Mary and I sat down to enough for twenty-five persons , who had never known the pangs of dyspepsia . As soon as we had finished I ordered a large portion of it down stairs , for the benefit of the servants and retired . They all looked pleased and I was satisfied . Mrs. Phillips had the nightmare at about two o'clock . Before I took charge , the allies of my household were accustomed to come in at all hours and sit up till they were too sleepy to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was soon stopped . For the morning of my address to them I stated that the house was shut up at ten p. m. , and now and then it was amusing to hear the door open as the clock struck . One night at about twelve as I was sitting at my desk in the library , I heard someone trying to get in . I knew it was the waiter who had slipped out without leave , so I turned out the gas , put my head out of the window and said ' I know it must be a robber , for they are all in , ' and seeing his form I fired off my revolver overhead.  - -  No servant ever tried again to enter by stealing in after hours . When my sister kept house I suffered much for want of dishes during many days in the week.  - -  There was very little variety . Sundays we had only potatoes and cold meat . ' Why , ' I asked . ' They must go to church , my dear brother . ' Mondays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing day , all the heat must be turned off from the oven for the boiler.  - -  The cook would n't have it roasted in front , the only true way . So no dessert could be baked . Tuesdays I could have no company for it was ironing day , and the irons filled up the range and nothing extra could be made . I submitted to my sister . But now I had soup every day , and whenever I saw anything very good in market I ordered it home and had it cooked . Strange is n't it , with the same range and the same cook ? Before my reign we could not breakfast till nine , the cook said that the milkman came so late . During my reign we breakfasted at eight punctually , for I suggested to her the propriety of rising at six instead of seven and letting him in on his first trip instead of taking the milk from him on his return . My sister was obliged to tell her two or three days before hand that she was going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for dinner . I frequently brought home two or three guests with fish and game in the same carriage and ordered it as the fourth course while partaking of soup . On one occasion I brought in partridges twenty minutes before dinner . I went down stairs knowing she would be roused this time , and flanked her by saying , ' Hannah , you wo n't have time to pick those birds , so just draw them and skin them . I want them roasted . ' Before she recovered from her astonishment I had departed . Whenever a quarrel down stairs took place I never interfered as long as they did not talk loud , but the next day if I noticed any one in the sulks or a tendency to let things go by , I had the furniture of one room changed to another . This required ' all hands ' to work together , and I made them fly round so , that when it was done they were only too happy to go to lunch and rest , and I could hear many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One rainy evening , as my sister and myself were sitting in front of the wood fire , exactly two months since the famous contract , and very much in the same position , and talking over everything but it , a timid knock was heard . I said ' come in , ' and Sabina entered , looking very healthy and neat -- I can not say pretty , though she had a good figure . I never asked questions on these occasions . I always made it difficult for them to talk in this , to them , gloomy room.  - -  They had to stumble through themselves . ' Can I speak to you , sir . ' ' Certainly , Sabina -- go on . ' ' I have come to say , sir , that -- that -- I have came to say , sir , that '  - -  a pause ; she looked very guilty . ' That 's right , Sabina ; you have come to say that -- I understand -- but what have you come to say ? ' ' I have come to say , sir , that -- I have come to go , sir ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood my ways thoroughly ; and did her work well ; had always been respectful to me , and was very steady . It would be a great loss , but DISCIPLINE must be preserved , and my mind was at once made up . My sister looked surprised and sorry right out . ' Well , Sabina , when do you wish to go . ' ' On Saturday , sir . ' Oh how my sister wanted to speak , but I looked at the tin box that held the contract and she bit her lip . ' Very well , Sabina , you have a perfect right to go when and where you please , and I will take great pleasure in writing out an excellent character for you . Let me see , ( looking at my account book ) that is two weeks wages making $8 . I never make presents , but as you are going here is a ten dollar bill . Where would you like your trunk carried , tell me and I will send it by Thomas Saturday morning ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she , ' but -- but , sir , ' with the tears flowing rapidly . ' Why , what is the matter , Sabina ? ' ( the first question apart from business I had ever asked . ) ' I do n't want to leave you , sir . ' ' Well , that is strange , then why do you ? ' ( business question . ) ' I 'm going , sir -- I 'm going , sir , to -- be -- married ! ' and she burst into tears . ( I congratulated myself on being a bachelor , if conjugal affection produced such an effect . ) ' Oh ! that 's it , ' said I , dryly . ' Well I hope you will be happy . ' ' But you 've been so kind , sir , you --  ' ' There now stop , I have only tried to be just , ' said I , looking exultingly at my smiling sister , who took off a little gold stud and gave it to her with many wishes of a happy life . Everything went on regularly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in its place . When the bell rang during dear Mary 's sway , it continued to ring , and on one occasion , a friend met me in the street and said : ' Why William , have you moved ? ' I replied no , that we were very comfortable where we were , ' why do you ask ? ' ' That 's very strange , ' said he , ' we called yesterday at one o'clock and rang for twenty minutes . No one coming we concluded you had left for Europe . ' ' No , ' I said , feeling rather confused , ' the waiter I believe is subject to sciatica . At times he is taken suddenly and can not move , and the reason we did not hear the bell , ( I looked away as I said so , ) his cries of pain are such that you can not hear yourself speak . ' Now the door is answered before the first ring stops sounding . For I arranged it so as to vibrate long enough to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exactly two minutes ; and no man of the world rings oftener than once every three minutes . I would not have written all this but my blessed sister soon entirely followed out my reformation and is fairly convinced , as she says , that when a man sets about any matter , he is very thorough : clear headed ; and , above all , not easily put down . Oh ! if all women thought so ! eh , Mr. Caudle ? I knew one learned gentleman who only desired peace and good food . His wife never allowed him to offer a suggestion . She called him a genius , and made him mind . Formerly Mary rose thoughtful , with the pressure of business on her brain . At meals she was abstracted , often worried , and at all times the repository of domestic troubles . Her healthy organization was altogether too mesmerized by the petty warfare below stairs . She was never idle , and yet rarely accomplished anything for herself . Her position in the household might have been called that of GRAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . Finally she would bring it into the library and stitch -- stitch -- all through the pleasant evenings . I knew this , for I laid a plan . One April I asked her to work me a pair of slippers on cloth . I presume a clever woman , undisturbed , could have delivered them over to me at the end of the week . Now , no one is more clever than my sister ; yet I did not get those slippers till December ; and then she handed them to me in sadness , and said , with an attempt at cheerfulness , ' dear William , I worked one myself , but my duties are such that I gave out the other to that poor woman whose husband is at sea . Has'nt she done it well ? ' Now , I find her reading , paying visits , and often of an evening she comes to me and says , ' William , would'nt you like some new handkerchiefs embroidered ? ' or ' ca n't I mend anything for you ? I have just finished my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , while she was mending -- not making reader -- but mending , her children 's clothes , I offered to read one of Ik Marvel 's reveries of a bachelor , a special favorite of mine . She thanked me , and I proceeded . On finishing one of his admirable paragraphs , I put the book down and exclaimed , ' is n't that capital ? ' She said at once , ' no , I think it is very discouraging . ' ' Discouraging ! Why , what in the world do you mean , Mary ? ' ' Excuse me , William , but I was'nt listening . The fact of it is , there has been another row down stairs , and I do think that girl ought to be ashamed of herself to treat Susan so ; ' and then for one hour a topographical and analytical history of the entire household was gone into , with a con amore spirit , which lasted through two segars and a glass of water . I never spoke . On these occasions they do n't want you to talk ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiding manner , ' you know I have no one to sympathize with me ; ' and off they go , like the recitation of Pope 's Homer , made by some school girl who has been sentenced to run through so many lines . I slipped the reveries into their place , so that she would not be hurt , and I do assure you that when she had got through I believe if you had asked her suddenly ' who discovered America ? ' she would have replied ' An Irishman -- I forget his name . ' Formerly there was ever a business gravity about her : now she always appeared with a sweet smile that lit up her countenance , as though it had been sprinkled all over with sun-powder . Difficult indeed was it for Mary to order anything without an advance notice , for otherwise she was forced to start her little bark through the Scylla and Charybdis of ' fire island , ' namely , ' The fire 's too low , marm ; ' or ' I 've just put on coal , marm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prettiest passages in Tennyson , which no woman could find out if her understanding had been mortgaged by servants . Before , no matter what dish of meat was set before me , it was always dry , or the gravy made of butter and water . I have often seen mutton chops come on table looking like little islands of meat surrounded by water , on which might be detected a tickley benders of grease . Five minutes conversation on my part supplied the deficiency , and caused one can of lard to outlast six of those in olden times . When I first took charge of the kitchen , the cook made one struggle -- but only one . The reply to her question indicated such ignorance or indifference on my part , that everything suggested in future was served as directed , and well done . Having ordered many dishes one day -- I do n't know whether it was washing or ironing day , I never used to ask : I also gave the ingredients of a very nice pudding , and said ' can you make that ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . ' ' Why not ? ' ' There is no room in the oven , you have filled it with your orders , and it is impossible to bake it this afternoon . ' ' You can not bake it , then ? ' ' No , sir . ' ' Then broil it ! '
