txt The foreign secession papers cling to the idea . that Lee and Jounron are only " drawing " Gaunt and SIIIIRUAN into the interior , so as to demolish thenel at their ease . For all those who wish it thus , anti ' those who look at things superficially , the telegram , sent to the European press by the secession gently at New-York certainly warrant such a belief ; ands the happy man among those agents who invented that idea of " drawing ' into the interior " may congratulate himself en the colossal success of the word . We hope , before this reaches you , that you will have sent us news that will dispel that illusion .. Nevertheless , the occasion is a good one for againi raising the cry of mediation ; for you must have observed that it is only when the Union army is at work that this cry is heard there is no need of it so ion* as the rebellion is let alone . The cry was started here by that clam of Government people who stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all against us ; it was eagerly caught up by the Secessionists and their friends in the press , and ? carried over to London by Mr. Mesa to operate with on the English Government . It was declared by the journals that the French Government was prepared to act , if seconded by the English Government , and the expectations of the friends of rebeldom were thereupon boisterous , if not sincere . But the great work , they all acknowledge , is to be done in England . France is ready , they say , whenever England is ; they claim even that the English Cabinet is in their favor , but the Cabinet will not move till the country moves , and so the work of secession propagandism is to be resumed and carried on with more vigor than ever . -4 should say , also , that the refusatiof the American Government . to allow the English Government to communicate with Richmond , is esteemed by our secession friends a great insult to the English Government , and an event of which good use can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They I draw great encouragement , also , from the sort or menace of Lord Joao Roseau , on the subject of Federal enrollments of British subjects ! But it is not probable that the French Government again thinks of , oftering its mediation ; and it is certain that , whateveg may be the secret desires of the English Government , it will not engage in any measure in conjunction with France against the United States . At any rate , if Gen. Gaaer 's campaign is successful , it will be too late for the kind of mediation which is contemplated , that is to say , for a hostile mediation , and if it is not successful , the let-alone policy wilt be considered sufficient by our enemies . The French Government has received an assurance from the constructors of the Confederate ships in French ports , that the ' two rams , ( which , however , could not be got ready for sea sooner than August , ) have been sold to an European Government ; but to what Government it was not stated , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet sold , and as two of them are ready to go to sea , and have their armaments waiting for them on another vessel , employed for that purpose , there is an apprehension at Bordeaux and at Nantes that , somehow or other , they are going to pass into the hands of those for whom they were built . But the French Government is bound to see that they do not go into Confederate hands , and they will probably be treated like the Rappakannock  --  that is to say , guarded in their places by men  --  of-war . The ministerial papers , which are all secession , effect not to understand the Irish exodus to the United States , and throw di sorts of " cold water " on the emigration idea . The Constitutionnel devites a long article to the subject , and attributes the emigration to the poverty of the country , to starvation , and to . the state of servitude in which England holds the Irish people . Beyond that the writer is not able to see . He can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country deluged ' in blood and in civil war , or why they should go to fight in a cause in which they have no interest , and can not even understand . The writer even ventures to say that they flee from oppression , and then engage in a crusade to oppress a people who also are struggling to free themselves from bondage . But the cloven foot of secession sticks out of all this writer sem and the fact is , this immense European emigration to the United States is a standing enigma to Europeans , and a source of vexatiOn to our enemies . It would not be surprising to see some Arbitrary measure ? adopted to prevent it , as well from &eat; Britain aa from this continent . The Moniteur has allowed itself to get fates scrape It publishes a letter from its New-York correspondent which condemns as a gross infringement of the right , of the press the suppression for a day of the World and Journal of Commerce . And yet the Monitsur is the organ by which the French Government frequently suppresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Moreover , these suppressions take place in a time of peace and in a country in which there is a standing army , in time of peace , of nearly half a million of men I The joke is a good one , and the liberal journals , anxious to make the most of it , can only say that they hope the article in question forebodes a speedy removal of the restrictions on the press . The Moniteur 's New-York correspondent , in the article in question , while giving due credit to the valor of the Army of the Potomac , and to the great military qualities of Gen. GRANT , yet attempts to show that the chances of arriving at Richmond are against him , and prepares his readers for a great defeat of the Union army . A Young American , 23 years of age , was killed last week on the railway between Paris and Lyons , under circumstances which are not yet well established . He was was found dead on the track after the passage of the train , but whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , does not yet appear . It le evident that he was traveling in a compartment of the oar in which there were no other travelers , or not more than one . The truth will soon be known . The execution of the homo3pathto physician Dr. COUTY DE LA FOlUaltAlli , yesterday morning , rather took the city by surprise , as It was supposed that the Emperor would certainly commute the penalty .
