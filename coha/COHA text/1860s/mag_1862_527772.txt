txt MAN UNDER SEALED ORDERS . A VESSEL of war leaves its port , but no one on board knows for what object , nor whither it is bound . It is a secret Government expedition . As it sets out , a number of documents , carefully sealed , are put in charge of the commander , in which all his instructions are contained . When far away from his sovereign , these are to be the authority which he must obey ; as he sails on in the dark , these are to be the lights on the deep by which he must steer . They provide for every stage of the way . They dii*ect what ports to approach and what ports to avoid , what to do in different seas , what variation to make in certain contingencies , and what acts to perform at certain opportunities . Each paper of the series forbids the opening of the next until its own directions have been fulfilled ; so that no one can see beyond the immediate point for which he is making . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery . But in the passage of time , as the strange cruise proceeds , its course begins to tell upon the chart . The zigzag line , like obscure chirography , has an intelligible look , and seems to spell out intimations . As order after order is opened , those sibyl leaves of the cabin commence to prophesy , glimpses multiply , surmises come quick , and shortly the whole ship 's company more than suspect , from the accumulating data behind them ; what must be their destination , and the mission they have been sent to accomplish . People are beginning to imagine that the career of the human race is something like this . There is a fast-growing conviction that man has been sent out , from the first , to fulfil some inexplicable purpose , and that he holds a Divine commission to perform a wQnderful work on the earth . It would seem as if his marvellous brain were the bundle of mystic scrolls on which it is written , and within which its terms are hid ,  --  and as if his imperishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and superscription , which attests its Almighty original . This commission is yet obscure . It has ' so far only gradually opened to him , for he is sailing under sealed orders . He is still led on from point to point . But the farther he goes , and the more his past gath Entered according to Act of con*ess , in the year 1862 , by TICKNOR AND TIELDS , in the Clerk 's Office of the District court of the District of Massachusetts . // ers behind him , the better is he able to imagine what must be before him . His chart is every day getting more full of amazing indications , He is beginning to feel about him the increasing press of some Providential design that has been permeating and moulding age after age , and to discover that he has been all along unconsciously prosecuting a secret mission . And so it comes at last that everything new takes that look ; every evolution of mind , every addition to knowledge , every discovery of truth , every novel achievement appearing like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of an inexhaustible and mysterious trust that has been committed to his hands . It is the purpose of this paper to collect together some of these facts and incidents of progress , in order to show that this is not a mere dream , but a stupendous reality . History shall be the inspiration of our prophecy . There is a past to be recounted , a present to be described , ahd a future to be foretold . An immense review for a magazine article , and it will require some ingenuity to be brief and graphic at the same time . In the attempt to get as much as possible into the smallest space , many things will have to be omitted , and some most profound particulars merely glanced at ; but enough will be furnished , perhaps , to make the point we have in view . We may compare human progress to a tall tree which has reared itself , slowly and imperceptibly , through century after century , hardly more than a bare trunk , with here and there only the slight outshoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this age gives the signs of that immense foliage and fruitage which shall in time embower the whole earth . We see but its spring-time of leaf , - for it is only within fifty years that this rich outburst of wonders began . We live in an era when progress is so new as to be a matter of amazement . A hundred years hence , perhaps it will have become so much a matter of course to develop , to expand , and to discover , that it will excite no comment . But it is yet novel , and we are yet fresh . Therefore we may gaze back at what has been , and gaze forward at what is promised to be , with more likelihood of being impressed than if we were a few centuries older . If we look down at the roots out of which this tree has risen , and then up at its spreading branches , - omitting its intermediate trunk of ages , through which its processes have been secretly working , - perhaps we may realize in a briefer space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to received authority , there was but a little tract of the earth occupied , and that by one family , speaking but one tongue , and worshipping but one God , - all the rest of the world being an uninhabited wild . At this stage of history the whole globe is explored , covered with races of every color , a host of nations and languages , with every diversity of custom , development of character , and form of religion . The physical bound from that to this is equalled only by the leap which the world of mind has made . Once upon a time a man hollowed a tree , and , launching it upon the water , found that it would bear him up . After this a few little floats , creeping cautiously near the land , were all on which men were wont to venture . Now there are sails fluttering on every sea , prodigious steamers throbbing like leviathans against wind and wave ; harbors are built , and rocks and shoals removed ; lighthouses gleam nightly from ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded by plummet and divingbell ; the submarine world is disclosed ; and man is gathering into his hands the laws of the very winds that toss its surface . Once the earth had a single rude , mudbuilt hamlet , in which human dwellings were first clustered together . Now it is studded with splendid cities , strewn thick with towns and villages , diversified by infinite varieties of architecture : sumptuous buildings , unlike in every clime , each as if sprung from its own soil and made out of its air . // 631 Once there were only the elementary discoveries of the lever , the wedge , the bended how , the wheel ; Tubal worked in iron and copper , and Naamah twisted threads . Since then what a jump the mechanical arts have made ! These primitive elements are now so intricately combined that we can hardly recognize them ; new forces have been added , new principles evolved ; ponderous engines , like moving mountains of iron , shake the very earth ; many- windowed factories , filled with complex machinery driven by water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain garments of the poor man and the rich robes of the prince , the curtains of the cottage and the upholstery of the palace . Once there were but the spear and bow and shield , and hand-to-hand conflicts of brute strength . See now the whole enginery of war , the art of fortification , the terrific perfection of artillery , the mathematical transfer of all from the body to the mind , till the battlefield is but a chess-board , and the battle is really waged in the brains of the generals . How astonishing was that last European field of Solferino , ten miles in sweep , - with the balloon floating above it for its spy and scout ,  --  with the threadlike wire trailing in the grass , and the lightning coursing back and forth , Napoleon 's ubiquitous aide-de-camp , - with railway - trains , bringing reinforcements into the midst of the melie , and their steam- whistle shrieking amid the thunders of battle ! And what a picture of even greater magnificence , in some respects , is bef6re us to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles in sweep ! McClellan , standing on the eminence of present scientific achievement , is able to overlook half the breadth of a continent , and the widely scattered detachments of a host of six hundred thousand men . The rail connects city with city ; the wire hangs between camp and camp , and reaches from army to army . Steam is hurling his legions from one point to another ; electricity brings him intelligence , and carries his orders ; the aifronaut in the sky is his field-glass searching the horizon . It is practically but one great battle that is raging beneath him , on the Potomac , in the mountains of Virginia , down the valley of the Mississippi , in the interiors of Kentucky and Tennessee , along the seaboard , and on the Gulf coast . The combatants are hidden from each other , but under the chieftain 's eye the dozen are only the squadrons of a single host , their battles only the separate conflicts of a single field , the movements of the whole campai*n only the evolutions of a prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Under the magic of progress , war in its essence and vitality is really diminishing , even while increasing in materiel and grandeur . Neither time nor space will permit the old and tedious contests of history to be repeated . Military science has entered upon a new era , nearer than ever to the period when wars shall cease . But to go on with a few more contrasts of the past with the present . Once men wrote only in symbols , like wedges and arrow-heads , on tiles and bricks , or in hieroglyphic pictures on obelisks and sepulchres ,  --  afterward in crude , but current characters on stone , metal , wax , and papyrus . In a much later age appeared the farthest perfection of the invention : books engrossed on illuminated rolls of vellum , and wound on cylinders of boxwood , ivory , or gold , - and then put away like richest treasures of art . What a difference between perfection then and progress now ! To-day the steam printingpress throws out its sheets in clouds , and fills the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern times , in which the dead past is laid away , and the living present takes refuge . The glory of costly scrolls is ( limmed by the illustrated and typographical wonders which make the bookstore a gorgeous dream . Knowledge , no longer rare , no longer lies in precarious accumulations within the cells of some poor monk 's crumbling brain , but swells up like the ocean , universal and imperishable , pouring into the vacant recesses of // all minds as the ocean pours into the hollows under its shore . To-day , newspapers multiplied by millions whiten the whole country every morning , like the hoar-frost ; and books , numerous and brilliant as the stars , seem by a sort of astral influence to unseal the latent destinies of many an intellect , as by their illumination they stimulate thought and activity everywhere . Once art seemed to have reached perfection in the pictures and sculptures of Greece and Rome . Yet now those master-pieces are not only equalled on canvas . and in fresco , but reproduced liy tens of thousands from graven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , - or , if modelled in marble or bronze , are remodelled by hundreds , and set up in countless households as the household gods . It is the glory of to-day that the sun himself has come down to be the rival and teacher of artists , to work wonders and perform miracles in art . He is the celestial limner who shall preserve the authentic faces of every generation from now until the world is no more . He holds the mirror up to Nature , paralyzes the fleeting phantom , by chemical subtilty , on the burnished plate , - and there it is fixed forever . He prepares the optical illusion of the stereoscope , so that through tiny windows we may look as into fairy-land and find sections of this magnificent world modelled in miniature . Once men imagined the earth to be a flat and limited tract . Now they realize that it is a ponderous ball floating in infinite ether . Once they thought the sky was a solid blue concave , studded with blazing points , an empire of fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now all that is dissolved away ; the wandering planets become at will broad disks , like sisters of the moon ; and countless millions of stars are now mirrored in the same retina with which the Magi saw the few thousands of the firmament that were visible from the plains of Chaldea . Once men were aware of nothing in the earth beneath its hills and valleys and teeming soil . Now they walk consciously over the ruins of old worlds ; they can decipher the strange characters and read the strange history graven on these gigantic tablets . The stony veil is rent , and they can look illimitable periods back , and see the curious animals which then moved up and down in the earth . Once a glass bubble was a wonder for magnifying power . Now the lenses of the microscope bring an inverted universe to light . Men can look into a drop and discover an ocean crowded with millions of living creatures , monsters untypifled in the visible world , playing about as in a great deep . Once a Roman emperor prized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arena closer to the imperial canopy . Now observatories , with their revolving domes , crown the heights at every centre of civilization , and the mighty telescope , poised on exquisite mechanism , turns infinite space into a Coliseum , brings its invisible luminaries close to the astronomer 's seat , and reveals the hafmonies and splendors of those distant works of God . Once the supposed elements were fire , and water , and earth , and air ; once the amber was unique in its peculiar property , and the loadstone in its singular power . Now chemistry holds in solution the elements and secrets of creation ; now electricity would seem to be the veil which hangs before the soul ; now the magnetic needle , true to the loadstar , trembles on the sea , to make the mariner brave and the haven sure . We have by no means exhausted the wonders that have accumulated upon man , in being accumulated by man . Their enumeration would be almost endless . But we leave all to mention one , with which there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , - not even a germ . It is the peculiar leap and development of the age in which we live . Many things have combined to bring it to pass . A spirit that had been hid , since the world began , in a coffer of metal and acid , - the genie of the lightning ,  --  shut // down , as by the seal of Solomon in the Arabian tale , was let loose but the other day , and commenced to do the bidding of man . Every one found that he could transport his thought to the ends of the earth in the twinkling of an eye . That spirit , with its electric wings , soon flew from city to city , and whithersoever the magnetic wire could be traced through the air , till the nations of all Europe stood as face to face , and the States of this great Union gazed one upon another . It made a continent like a household , - a cluster of peoples like members of a family , - each within hearing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed before the whole world could become one . The ocean had hitherto hopelessly severed the globe into two hemispheres . Could man make it a single sphere ? Could man , like Moses , smite the waves with his electric rod , and lead the legions of human thought across dryshod ? He could , - and he did . We all remember it well . A range of submarine mountains was discovered , stretching from America to Europe . Their top formed a plateau , which , lying within two hiiles of the surface , offered an undulating shoal within human reach . A fleet of steamers , wary of storms , one day cautiously assembled midway over it . They caught the monster asleep , safely uncoiled the wire , and laid it from shore to shore . The treacherous , dreadful , omnipotent ocean was conquered and bound ! How the heart of the two worlds leaped when the news came ! Then , more than at any time before , were most of us startled into a conviction of how real progress was , how tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put into man . Not that this , in itself was greater than that which had preceded it , but it was the climax of all . The mechanical feat awoke more enthusiasm than even the scientific achievement which was its living soul , - not because it was more wonderful , but because it . dispe*led our last doubt . We all began to form a more definite idea of something great to come , that was yet lying stored away in the brain , - laid there from the beginning . Like the Magian on the heights of Moab , as he saw the tents of Israel and the tabernacle of God in the distance , we grew big with an involuntary vision , and were surprised into prophecies . It was wonderful to see the Queen of England , on one side of that chasm of three thousand miles , wave a greeting to the President , and the President wave back a greeting to the Queen . But it was glorious to see that chord quiver - with the music and the truth of the angelic song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on earth peace , Good-will toward men ! Soon , however , came a check to the excitement . For above a score of days was that mysterious highway kept open from Yalentia to Trinity Bay . But then the spell was lost , the waves flowed back , old ocean rolled on as before , and the crossing inc ssages perished , like the hosts of Pharaoh in the sea . That the miracle is ended is no indication that it can not be repeated . For the very reason that the now dead , inarticulate wire , like an infant , lisped and stammered once , it is certain that another will soon be born , which will live to trumpet forth like the angel of civilization , its minister of flaming fire ! No one should abate a jot from the high hope excited then . No imagination should suffer a cloud on the picture it then painted . Governmentsand capitalists have not been idle , and will not be discouraged . Already Europe and Africa are connected by an electric tunnel under the sea , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other through a tube lying under thirteen hundred miles of Mediterranean waters already Britain is bound to Holland and Hanover and Denmark by a triple cord of sympathy which all the tempests of the German Ocean can not sever . And if we come nearer home , we shall find a project matured which will carry n fiery cordon around the entire coast of our country , #. // linking forfress to fortress , and providing that last , desperate resource of unity , an outer girdle and jointed chain of force , to bind together and save a nation whose inner bonds of peace and love are broken . Such energy and such success are enough to revive the expectation and to guaranty the coming of the day when we shall behold the electric light playing round the world unquenched by the seas , illuminating the land , revealing nation to nation , and mingling language with language , as if the " cloven tongues like as of fire " had appeared again , and " sat upon each of them . " It will be a strange period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken here under the sun of mid-day , when it speaks at the antipodes , will be heard under the stars of midnight . Of the world of commerce it may be written , " There shall be no night there ! " and of the ancient clock of the sun and stars , " There shall be time no longer ! " When the electric wire shall stretch from Pekin , by successive India stations , to London , and from India , by leaps from island to island , to Australia , and from New York westward to San Francisco , ( as has been already accomplished , ) and southward to Cape Horn , and across the Atlantic , or over the Strait to St. Petersburg , - when the endless circle is formed , and the magic net-work binds continent , and city , and village , and the isles of the sea , in one , - then who will know the world we live in , for the change that shall come upon it ? Time no more ! Space no more ! Mankind brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hearts in this interblending of all minds . Prophesy the boundless spread of civilization , when all barriers are swept away . Prophesy the catholicity of that religion in which as many phases of a common faith shall be endured as there are climes for the common human constitution and countries in a common world ! In those days men will carry a watch , not with a single face , as now , telling only the time of their own region , but a dialplate subdivided into the disks of a dozen timepieces , announcing at a glance the hour of as many meridian stations on the globe . It will be the fair type of the man who wears it . When human skill shall find itself under this necessity , and mechanism shall reach this perfection , then the soul of that man will become also many-disked . He will be alive with the perpetual consciousness of many zeniths and horizons beside his own , of many nations far different from his own , of many customs , manners , and ideas , which he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can peer as far as this into the future ; for what we predict is only a reasonable deduction from certain given circumstances that are nearly around us now . We do not lay all the stress upon the telegraph , as if to attribute everything to it , but because that invention , and its recent crowning event , are the last great leap which the mind has made , and because in itself , and in its carrying out , it summoned all the previous discoveries and achievements of man to its aid . It is their last-born child , - the greater for its many parents . There is hardly a science , or an art , or an invention , which has not contributed to it , or which is not deriving sustenance or inspiration from it . This latter fact makes it particularly suggestive . As it was begotten itself , and is in its turn begetting , so has it been with everything else in the world of progress . Every scientific or inechanical idea , every species of discovery , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kind as men are born of men . There is a kith and kin among all these extraordinary creatures of the brain . They have their ancestors and descendants ; not one is a Melchizedek , without father , without mother . Every one is a link in a regular order of generations . Some became extinct with their age , being superseded or no longer wanted while others had the power of immense propagation , and produced // an innumerable offspring , which have a family likeness to this day . The law of cause and effect has no better illustration than the history of inventions and discoveries . If there were among us an intellect sufficiently encyclopedic in knowledge and versatile in genius , it cotild take every one of these facts and trace its intricate lineage of principles and mechanisms , step by step , up to the original Adam of the first invention and the original Eve of the first necessity . There is a period between us and these first parents of our present progress that is strangely obscure . It is a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of some kind , and an extensive acquaintance with some things . The ruins of Egypt alone would prove this . But a deluge of oblivion has washed over them , ar#.l left these colossal bones to tell what story they can . The only way to account for such an extinction is , that they were monstrous contrivances out of all proportion to their age , spasmodic successes in science , wonders horn out of due time , - deriving no sustenance or support from a wide and various kindred , and therefore , like the giants which were of old , dying out with their day . It is different with what has taken place since . Every work has come in its right time , just when best prepared for , and most required . There is not or*e but is sustained on every side , and fits into its place , as each new piece of colored stone in a mosaic is sustained by the progressive picture . Every one is conserved by its connections . Whatever has been done is sure , - and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible that the present knowledge in the world should be extinguished . Nothing but a stroke of imbecility upon the race , nothing but the destruction of its libraries , nothing but the paralysis of the printing-press , and the annihilation of these means of intercommunication , - nothing but some such arbitrary intervention could accomplish it . The facts already in human possession , and the constitution of the mind , together insure what we have as imperishable , and what we are to obtain as illimitable . We come now to another suggestive characteristic of the time , - another of its promises . So far we find Progress gathering fulness and strength , - making sure of itself . It has also been gathering impetus . It has been , all along , accumulating momentum , and now it sweeps on with breathless rapidity . The reason is , that , the farther it has gone , the more it has multiplied its agents . The present generation is not only carried forward , hut is excited in every quarter . The activity and versatility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overstrained , or becoming lethargic , it never was so powerful , never had so many resources , never was so wide-awake . Men are busy turning over every stone in their way , in the hope of finding somethiiig new . Nothing would seem too small for human attention , nothing too great for human undertaking . The government Patent-Office , with its countless chambers , is not so large a museum of inventions as the capacious brain of to-day . One man is engrossed over an appleparer ; another snatches the needle from the weary fingers of the seamstress , and offers her in return the sewing-machine . That man yonder has turned himself into an armory , anmi he brings out the deadliest instrument he can produce , something perhaps that can shoot you at sight , even though you be a speck in the horizon . His next-door neighbor is an iron workshop , and is forging an armor of proof for a vessel of war , from which the mightiest balls shall bound as lightly as the arrows from an old-time breastplate . There is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the telegraph , and hurl the bodies of men throu* , h space as fast as their thoughts are hurled ; there is another seeking that electro-inagnetic battery which shall speak instantly and distinctly to the ends of the earth . The mind of that astronomer is a telescope , // through whose increasing field new worlds float daily by ; the mind of that geologist is a divining-rod , forever bending toward the waters of chaos , and pointing out new places where a shaft can be sunk into periods of almost infinite antiquity ; the mind of that chemist is a subtile crucible , in which aboriginal secrets lie disclosed , and within whose depths the true philosopher 's stone will be found ; the mind of that mathematician is a maze of ethereal stair-ways , rising higher and higher toward the heaven of truth . The ambition is everywhere ,  --  in every breast ; the power is everywhere ,  --  in every brain . The giant and the pigmy are alike active in seeking out and finding out many intentions . And in this very universality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great future . The river of Progress multiplies its tributaries the farther it flows , and even now , unknown ages from its mouth , we already see that magnificent widening of its channel , in which , like the Amazon , it long anticipates the sea . Man , the great achiever ! the marvellous magician ! Look at him ! A head hardly six feet above the ground out of which he was taken . His " dome of thought and palace of the soul " scarce twenty-two inches in circumference ; and within it , a little , gray , oval mass of " convoluted albumen and fibre , of some four pounds ' weight , " and there sits the intelligence which has worked all these wonders ! An intelligence , say , six thousand years old next century . How many thousand years more will it think , and think , and wave the wand , and raise new spirits out of Nature , open her sealed-up mysteries , scale the stars , and uncover a universe at home ? How long will it be before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inningby the Almighty , shall be exhausted , and reach its limit ? Yes , how long ? We can not begin to know . We can not imagine where the stopping-place could be . Perhaps there is none . To take up the nautical figure which has furnished our title , - we are in the midst of an infinite sea , sailing on to a destination we know not of , but of which the vague and splendid fancies we have formed hang before our prow like illu- ' sions in the sky . We are meeting on every hand great opportunities which must not be lost , new achievements which must be wrought , and strange adventures which must be undertaken : every day wondering more to what our commission shall bring us at last , full of magnificent hopes and a growing faith , - the inscrutable bundle of orders not nearly exhausted : whole continents of knowledge yet to be discovered and explored ; the gates of yet distant sciences to be sought and unlocked ; the fortresses of yet undreamed necessities to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gar*red by the imagination ; an intricate course to be followed amid all future nations and governments , and their winding histories , as if threading the devious channels of endless avehipelagoes ; the spoils of all ages to be gathered , and treaties of commerce with all generations to be made , before the mysterious voyage is done . And now , before we leave this fascinating theme , or suffer another dream , let us stop where we are , in order to see where we are . Let us take our bearings . What says our chart ? . What do we find in the horizon of the present , which may give us the wherewithal to hope , to doubt , or to fear ? The era in which we live presents some renrarkable characteristics , which have been brought into it by this immense material success . It is pre*mninently an age of reality : an age in which a host of unrealities - queer and strange old notions - have been destroyed forever . Never were the vaulted spaces in this grand old temple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind has not gone forth working outside wonders , without effecting equal inside changes . In achieving abroad , it has been cnno* bling at home . At no time was it so free from superstition as now , and from the // absurdities which have for centuries beset and filled it . What numberless delusions , what ghosts , what mysteries , what fables , what curious ideas , have disappeared before the besom of the day l The old author long a , , o foretasted this , who wrote , - " The divine arts of printing and gunpowder have frightened away Robin Goodfellow , and all the fairies . " It is told of Kepler , that he believed the planets were borne through the skies in the arms of angels ; but science shortly took a wider sweep , killed off the angels , and showed that the wandering luminaries had been accustomed from infancy to take care of themselves . And so has the firmament of all knowledge been cleared of its vapors and fictions , and been revealed in its solid and shining facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time : the accumulation of Truth , and the growing appetite for the true and the real . The year whirls round like the toothed cylinder in a threshing-machine , blowing out the chaff in clouds , but quietly dropping the rich kernels within our reach . And it will always be so . Men will sow their notions and reap harvests , but the inexorable age will winnow out the truth , and scatter to the winds whatsoever is error . Now we see how that impalpable something has been produced which we call the " Spirit of the Age , " - that peculiar atmosphere in which we live , which fills the lungs of the human spirit , and gives vitality and character to all that men at present think and say and feel and do . It is this identical spirit of courageous inquiry , honest reality , and intense activity , wrought up into a kind of universal inspiration , moving with the same disposition , the same taste , the same thought , persons whole regions apart and unknown to each other . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet common afflatus . Two astronomers , with the ocean between them , calculate at the same moment , in the %ame direction , and simultaneously light upon the same new orb . Two inventors , falling in with the same neces sity , think of the same contrivance , and meet for the first time in a newspaper war , or a duel of pamphlets , for the credit of its authorship . A dozen widely scattered philosophers as quickly hit upon the self-same idea as if they were in council together . A more rational development of some old doctrine in divinity springs up in a hundred places at once , as if a theological epidemic were abroad , or a synod of all the churches were in session .. It has also another peculiarity . The thought which may occur at first to but one mind seems to have an affinity to all minds ; and if it be a free and gen*rous thought , it is instantly caught , intuitively comprehended , and received with acelamations all over the world . Such a spirit as this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another , and producing a supreme caste in human nature , which , as it increases in numbers , will mould the character and control the destinies of the race . So far we speak of the upper air of the day . But there is no denying the prevalence of a lower and baser spirit . We are uncomfortably aware that there is another extreme to the freaks of the imagination . There are superstitions of the reason and of realism , - the grotesque fancies , mysticisms , and vagaries which prevail , and the diseased gusto for something ultra and outlandish which affects so many raw and undisciplined minds . Yet even these are , in their way , indications of the pervading disposition ,  --  the unhealthy exhalations to be expected from hitherto stagnant regions , stirred up by the active and regenerating thought of the time . There is promise even in them , and they serve to distinguish the more that purer and higher spirit of honesty and reality , which clarifies the intellect , and invigorates the faculties that apprehend and grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph of the reason over the imagination , and in this predominance of the real over the ideal . We prefer that common sense should // lead the van , and that mere fancy , like the tinselled conjurer behind his hollow table and hollow apparatus , should be taken for what it is , and that its tricks and surprises should cease to bamboozle , however much they may amuse mankind . Nothing , in the course of Providence , conveys so much encouragement as this recent and growing development of reality in thought and pursuit . In its presence the future of the world looks substantial and sure . We dream of an immense change in the tone of the human spirit , and in the character of the civilization which shall in time embower the earth . But , as it has always been , the greater the good , the nearer the evil ; Satan is next-door neighbor to the saint ; Eden had a lurking-hole for the serpent . Just here the voyaging is most dangerous just here we drop the plummet and strike upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lee-shore . The mind that is not profound enough to perceive and believe even what it can not comprehend , - that is the shoal . Unless the reason will permit the sounding-lead to fall illimitably down into a submarine world of mystery , too deep for the diver , and yet a true and living world , - unless there is admitted to be a fathomless gulf , called faith , underlying the surface-sea of demonstration , the race will surely ground in time , and go to pieces . There is the peril of this allprevailing love of the real . It may become such an infatuation that nothing will appear actual which is not visible or demonstrable , which the hand can not handle or the intellect weigh and measure . Even to this extreme may the reason run . Its vulnerable point is pride . It is easily encoura*ed by success , easily incited to conceit , readily inclined to overestimate its power . It has a Chinese weakness for throwing up a wall on its involuntary boundary-line , and for despising and ( lefying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest or the meanest faculty in the soul . It may be the most wise or the most foolish of active things . It may be so profound as to acknowledge a whole infinitude of truth which it can not comprehend , or it may be so superficial as to suspect everything it is asked to believe , and refuse to trust a fact out of its sight . There is the danger of the ( lay . There is the lee-shore upon which the tendencies of the age are blowing our bark : a gross and destructive materialism , which is the horrid and treacherous de*'elopmeat of a shallow realism . In the midst of this splendid era there is a fast-increasing class who are disposed to make the earth the absolute All , - to deny any outlet from it , - to deny any capacity in man for another sphere , - to deny any attribute in God which iaterests Him in man , - to shut out , therefore , all faith , all that is mysterious , all that is spiritual , all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alas ! of heaven-directed mien , Of cultured soul , and sapient eye serene , Who hail thee Man ! - the pilgrim of a day , Spouse of the worm and brother of the clay , Frail as the leaf in autumn 's yellow bower , Dust in the wind , or dew upon the dower , A friendless slave , a child without a sire . Are these the pompous tidings ye proclaim , Lights of the world , and demigods of Fame ? Is this your triumph , this your proud am plause , Children of Truth , and champions of her cause ? For this hath Science searched on weary wing , By shore and sea , each niute and living thing ? Launched with Iberia 's pilot from the steep , To worlds unknown , and isles beyond the deep ? Or round the cope her living chariot driven , And wheeled in triumph through the signs of heaven ? O star- eyed Science , bait thou wandered there , To waft us home the message of despair ? " Is shipwreck , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , unless there is something else beside materialism in the world . Unless there is another spirit blowing off that dreadful shos'e , unless the chart opens a farther sea , unless the needle points to the same distant // star , unless there are other orders , yet sealed and secret , there is no further destiny for the race , no further development for the soul . The intellect , however grand , is not the whole of man . Material progress , however magnificent , is not the guaranty , not even the cardinal element , of civilization . And civilization , in the highest possible meaning of that most expressive word , is that great and final and all-embosoming harbor toward which all these achievements and changes dimly , but directly , point . Upon that we have fixed our eyes , hut we can not imagine how it can be attained by intellectual and material force alone . In order to indicate this more vividly , let us suppose that there is no other condition necessary to the glory of human nature and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made , and that the age is to go on developing only in this one direction , - what a dreary grandeur would soon surround us ! As icebergs floating in an Arctic sea are splendid , so would be these ponderous and glistering works . As the gilded and crimsoned clifTh of snow beautify the Polar day , so would these achievements beautify the present day . But expect no life , no joy , no soul , amid such ice-bound circumstances as these . The tropical heart must congeal and ( lie ; its luxuriant fruits can never spring up . The earth must lie sepulebred under its own magnificence ; and the divinest feelings of the spirit , floating upward in the instinct of a higher life , but benumbed by the frigid air , and rebuked by the leaden sky , must fall back like clouds of frozen vapor upon the soul : and " so shall its thoughts perish . " It would be a gloomy picture to paint , if one could for a moment imagine that intellectual power and material success were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is no other capacity , and no other field in which at least an equal commission to achieve is given , and for which equal arrangements have been made by the Providence that orders all , then the soul must soon be smothered , society dismembered , and human nature ruined . But this very fact , which we purposely put in these strong colors , proves that there must be another and greater *lement , another and higher faculty , another and wider department , likewise under express and secret conditions of success . It shall come to pass , as the development goes on , that this other will become the foremost and all-important , - the relation between them will be reversed , - this must increase , that decrease , - the Material , although the first in time , the first in the world 's interest , and the first in the world 's effort , will be found to be only an ordained forerunner , preparing the way for Something Else , the latchet of whose shoes it is not worthy to unloose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sealed within his inscrutable brain - which provides for his inner as well as outer life ; which insures his highest development ; which shall protect , cherish , warm , and fertilize his nature now , and perpetuate and exalt his soul forever . It is a commission which begins , but does not end , in time . It is a commission which makes him the agent and builder of an immense moral work on the earth . Under its instructions he , shall add improvement to improvement in that social fabric which is already his shelter and habitation . He has found it of brick , - he shall leave it of marble . He shall seek out every contrivance , and perfect every plan , and exhaust every scheme , which will bring a greater prosperity and a nobler happiness to mankind . He shall quarry out each human spirit , and carve it into the beauty and symmetry of a living stone that shall be worthy to take its place in the rising structure . This is the work which is given him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , and faith , and truth , and love , by which the race shall be lifted nearer its Creator , and the individual ascend into a more conscious neighborhood and stronger affinity to the world which shall receive him at // last . All this must that other department be , and this other capacity achieve , or there is a fatal disproportion in the progress of man . The beauty of this as a dream perhaps all men will admit ; but they question its possibility . " It is the old Utopia , " they say , " the impracticable enterprise that has always baffled the world . " Some will doubt whether the Spiritual has an existence at all . Others will doubt , if it does exist , whether man can accomplish anything in it . It is invisible , impalpable , unknown . It can not he substantial , it can not be real , - at least to man as at present constituted . Its elements and conditions can not be controlled by his spirit . That spirit can- : not control itseW-how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantom realm ! There can be no success in this that will be coequal with the other ; nor a coequal grandeur . There is no such thing as keeping pace with it . The heart can not grow better , society can not be built higher , mankind can not become happier , God will not draw nearer , the hidden truth of all that universe will never he more ascertained than it is , - can never be accumulated and stored away among other human acquisitions . It is utterly , gloomily impracticable . In this respect we shall forever remain as we are , and where we are . *o they think . And now we venture to contradict it all , and to assert that there is , there must be , just such a corresponding field , and just such a corresponding progress , or else ( we say it reverently ) God 's ways are not equal . So great is our faith . Like Columbus , therefore , we dream of the golden Indies , and of that " unknown residue " which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . We look far out to where the horizon dips its vapory veil into the sea , and beyond which lies that other hemisphere , and ask , - Is there no world there to be a counterpoise to the world that is here ? Has the Creator made no provision for the equilibrium of the soul ? Is all that infinite area a shoreless waste , over which the fleets of speculation may sail forever , and discover nothing ? Or is there not , rather , a broad and solid continent of spiritual truth , eternally rooted in that ocean ,  --  prepared , from the beginning , for the occupation of man , when the fulness of time shall have come ,  --  ordained to take its place in the historic evolution of the race , and to give the last and definite shape to its wondrous destinies ? Is there , or is there not , another region of truth , of enterprise , of progress , - to finish , to balance , to consummate the world ? Such is the Problem .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
