At this place firing between the pickets has been almost continuous , and scarcely a day passes without two or three being wounded on our side , at least . This part of the line has been occupied by the Third Brigade of the First Division of the Ninth Corps , Gen. MCLAUGHLIN commanding . He has often expressed his ability to break through the enemy 's tines here , and only yesterday he showed how it could be done to some visitors who were inspecting the works .

The latter party were met by the Seventeenth Michigan and driven back , after some hard . fighting . The force that attacked the fort were repulsed by the garrison several times , but their numbers being so superior to ours they finally overpoWered and took prisoners nearly all who were in it . They at once sent the captured over the works to their line , and many succeeded in getting away and running back , the guard being very small that bad Charge of them . Gen.
