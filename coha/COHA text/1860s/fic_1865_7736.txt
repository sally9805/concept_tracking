Saxe , John Godfrey , 1816-1887 : THE TARTAR WHO CAUGHT A TARTAR . A HUNGARIAN LEGEND . from Clever stories of many nations ( 1865 ) I. There 's trouble in Hungary , now , alas ! There 's trouble on every hand ; For that terrible man , The Tartar Khan , Is ravaging over the land ! II . He is riding forth with his ugly men , To rob and ravish and slay : For deeds like those , You may well suppose , Are quite in the Tartar-way . III . And now he comes , that terrible chief , To a mansion grand and old : And he peers about Within and without , And what do his eyes behold ? IV . A thousand cattle in fold and field , And sheep all over the plain , And noble steeds , Or rarest breeds , And beautiful crops of grain . V. But finer still is the hoarded wealth That his ravished eyes behold , In silver plate Of wondrous weight , And jewels of pearl and gold ! VI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robber he sees , ' T is not very queer He quakes with fear , And trembles a bit in the knees ! VII . He quakes in fear of his precious life , And scarce suppressing a groan , " Good Tartar , " says he , " Whatever you see Be pleased to reckon your own ! " VIII . The Khan looked round in a leisurely way As one who is puzzled to choose ; When , cocking his ear , He chanced to hear The creak of feminine shoes ! IX . The Tartar smiled a villanous smile , When , like a lily in bloom , A lady fair With golden hair Came gliding into the room ! X. The robber stared with amorous eyes ; Was ever so winning a face ? And long he gazed As one amazed To see such beauty and grace ! XI . A moment more , and the lawless man Had seized his struggling prey , Without remorse , And  --  taking horse  --  He bore the lady away ! XII . " Now Heaven be praised ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! I bow me still Unto His will . God pity the Tartar ! " said he . Saxe , John Godfrey , 1816-1887 : HO-HO OF THE GOLDEN BELT . ONE OF THE " NINE STORIES OF CHINA . " from Clever stories of many nations ( 1865 ) A beautiful maiden was little Min-Ne , Eldest daughter of wise Wang-Ke ; Her skin had the color of saffron tea , And her nose was flat as flat could be ; And never were seen such beautiful eyes , Two almond-kernels in shape and size , Set in a couple of slanting gashes , And not in the least disfigured by lashes ; And then such feet ! You 'd scarcely meet In the longest walk through the grandest street ( And you might go seeking From Nanking to Peeking ) A pair so remarkably small and neat Two little stumps , Mere pedal lumps , That toddle along with the funniest thumps , In China , you know , are reckoned trumps . It seems a trifle , to make such a boast of it ; But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , By making the least , to make the most of it ! As you may suppose , She had plenty of beaux Bowing around her beautiful toes , Praising her feet , and eyes , and nose In rapturous verse and elegant prose ! She had lots of lovers , old and young ; There was lofty Long , and babbling Lung , Opulent Tin , and eloquent Tung , Musical Sing , and , the rest among , Great Hang-Yu and Yu-be-Hung . But though they smiled and smirked and bowed , None could please her of all the crowd ; Lung and Tung she thought too loud ; Opulent Tin was much too proud ; Lofty Long was quite too tall ; Musical Sing sung very small ; And , most remarkable freak of all , Of great Hang-Yu the lady made game , And Yu-be-Hung she mocked the same , By echoing back his ugly name ! But the hardest heart is doomed to melt ; Love is a passion that will be felt ; And just when scandal was making free To hint " what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Min-Ne , Who but she ? Married Ho  --  Ho of the Golden Belt ! A man , I must own , of bad reputation , And low in purse , though high in station ,  --  A sort of Imperial poor  --  relation , Who ranked as the Emperor 's second cousin Multiplied by a hundred dozen ; And , to mark the love the Emperor felt , Had a pension clear Of three pounds a year , And the honor of wearing a Golden Belt ! And gallant Ho-Ho Could really show A handsome face , as faces go In this Flowery Land , where , you must know , The finest flowers of beauty grow . He 'd the very widest kind of jaws , And his nails were like an eagle 's claws , And  --  though it may seem a wondrous tail  --  ( Truth is mighty and will prevail ! ) He 'd a queue as long as the deepest cause Under the Emperor 's chancery-laws ! Yet how he managed to win Min  --  Ne The men declared they could n't see ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point were known to agree :  --  Four gifts were sent to aid his plea : A smoking-pipe with a golden clog , A box of tea , and a poodle dog , And a painted heart that was all a-flame , And bore , in blood , the lover 's name . Ah ! how could presents pretty as these A delicate lady fail to please ? She smoked the pipe with the golden clog , And drank the tea , and ate the dog , And kept the heart ,  --  and that ' s the way The match was made , the gossips say . I ca n't describe the wedding day , Which fell in the lovely month of May ; Nor stop to tell of the Honey-Moon , And how it vanished all too soon ; Alas ! that I the truth must speak , And say that in the fourteenth week , Soon as the wedding-guests were gone , And their wedding-suits began to doff , Min-Ne was weeping and " taking on , " For he had been trying to " take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven , And being partial to number " Seven , " He wished to add his latest pet , Just , perhaps , to make up the set ! Mayhap the rascal found a cause Of discontent in a certain clause In the Emperor 's very liberal laws , Which gives , when a Golden Belt is wed , Six hundred pounds to furnish the bed ; And if in turn he marry a score , With every wife six hundred more . First he tried to murder Min-Ne With a special cup of poisoned tea ; But the lady , smelling a mortal foe , Cried , " Ho-Ho ! I 'm very fond of mild Souchong , But you  --  my love  --  you make it too strong ! " At last Ho-Ho , the treacherous man , Contrived the most infernal plan Invented since the world began : He went and got him a savage dog , Who ' d eat a woman as soon as a frog , Kept him a day without any prog , Then shut him up in an iron bin , Slipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key To poor Min-Ne , Said , " Love , there ' s something you must n't see In the chest beneath the orange-tree . " ..... Poor , mangled Min-Ne ! with her latest breath , She told her father the cause of her death ; And so it reached the Emperor 's ear , And his Highness said , " It is very clear , Ho-Ho has committed a murder here ! " And he doomed Ho-Ho to end his life By the terrible dog that killed his wife ; But in mercy ( let his praise be sung ! ) His thirteen brothers were merely hung , And his slaves bambooed , in the mildest way , For a calendar month , three times a day , And that ' s the way that Justice dealt With wicked Ho-Ho of the Golden Belt !
