DEDICATION . TO THE HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD . Dear Sir : The following pages are the result of some hours of relaxation during a professional sojourn in the mountains of California , and profess to be no more than a reflex of some of the phases of society in the early history of that noble State  --  at a time shortly after the discovery of gold there ; when the tide of emigration flowed like a torrent from all parts of our beloved Union , and found no resting place until the distant Pacific coast had been reached . The Comedy , ( if I may dignify it with that title , ) was written without any intention of having it either represented or published , but chance subjected it to the criticism of an artist of some celebrity , whose persuasions were potent enough to overcome the natural diffidence of untried authorship . It was played , and successfully , and having , to that extent , become public property , I have concluded to put it in a form in which it may either serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my enemies , be a vehicle of punishment for the presumption of having written it . Of all the Statesmen of the present generation , California has most reason to be grateful to you , for you have been her firm , undeviating friend from the period of her first introduction into the glorious sisterhood of States , and nothing that your great talents or influence could achieve has been withheld from her , or from the development of her permanent prosperity . Under these circumstances , duty would prompt , even if inclination did not suggest , that the tribute of this " Dedication " should be tendered to you . I trust you will accept of it in the spirit in which it is offered , without criticising too severely the pages on which it is inscribed ; for if these could be worthy of your acceptance , they would surely possess merits which would entitle them to more than an ephomeral existence . Sincerely your friend , And obedient servant , Joseph A. Nunes . PERSONS REPRESENTED . Howson.  --  In love with Julia .

Westward the Star of Empire takes its flight , And sleeping lands awake beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And , though aroused , at first , by tales of gold , ( Uncounted gold , in never failing streams , Such as exist in fables , or in dreams . ) Expand beyond the simple , sordid thought Which comes at length to be considered nought ; Or , only as the source from which we trace A nobler era for the human race ! Here  --  from the kindly becam of the soil  --  Spring health and wealth for all the some of toil : Here  --  commerce finds a home ; and an its wings Glad tidings bears , and from earth 's confines brings ; Here , the same stream that fills the miner 's flume , In time will speed the spindle and the loom ! Here , science finds new fields on which to pore , And largely adds to its exhaustless store ; And here  --  where late was but a howling waste  --  There glow the graceful forms of Art and Taste ! Wonder not , then , if , with becoming dread , The Thespian muse lifts up her modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may boast A home established on this happy coast ; For she , as erst , advances and departs In the bright train of all her sister arts , And claims  --  whilst noting human smiles or strife  --  The right to hold the mirror up to life ! To-night our author shows , in strong contrast , The placid present , by the whirling past , And seeks , with ardent hope , to win your praise For truthful sketches of our early days ! You are the court to which he brings his cause ; He asks a verdict of  --  your kind applause ! Main text ACT I. Scene I.  --  A street in front of a hotel . Enter Gen. Cazador . Bluster , and Wilkins , R. U. E. Blus . Colonel Bluster ( Aside to Wilkins . ) I 'll think it over in the morning , Tom ; in the meantime treat the boys on my account , and call on me for change . Wilk . Tom Wilkins Colonel , you know the way to take the boys ! We 'll drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good office to you ! I 'll see the nomination is all right . ( Shakes hands with Bluster , bous familiarly to Cazador , and exit L. ) Blus . Colonel Bluster There 's not a man in town , sir , more useful than Tom Wilkins ! His home is in a row , and managing elections forms his chief delight , and brings out all his greatness ! Which side he favors , wins ; though some are base enough to say he favors those who pay the best ! Mere jealousy , sir , and seandal ! Gen. C. General Cazador ( Ironically . ) He is abused by envious tongues , no doubt ; but only shares the fate which always follows greatness ! You are happy in possessing such a friend , and may securely build upon him in your future plans ! Blus . Colonel Bluster There 's where my trouble is ! The future 's bright enough ; but it is a plague upon a gentleman 's invention to be driven to make shifts for present purposes ! Work , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is cursed plebeian ! " A laboring man 's no better than a horse ; excepting that he has the gift of thought ; and that 's an aggravation to his state , because he can observe the difference ' twixt conditions , and vainly strives for what he can not reach . " Gen. C. General Cazador Some , whom the world calls wise , have thought that man was formed for labor : " That labor dignifies him , as it gives him life : is health to the frame , employment to the thoughts , peace to the mind , and virtue to the soul : the source of all the comforts he enjoys ; the cause which builds him up creation 's lord ! " But your philosophy is more profound , and proves the argument mere sophistry . Still I am perplexed to know how it is  --  without control of vulgar gold , and with high-bred disdain for toil  --  you manage to exist . I hear you say you never have been rich , yet do you live as few who 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and dress , and game , as though possessed of means unbounded ! Blus . Colonel Bluster Nature sir , designed me for a gentleman ; but in her haste , with other work just then on hand , the jade forgot to furnish means to keep the station up . But then she gave me shape and talents ! which , until now , have stood in place of an estate inherited  --  have furnished meat and drink to me . When I can pay , I pay ; and when I ca n't , I owe ; and others suffer ' stead of me : and thus I humor nature in her kind intent , and take myself what she , in haste , forgot ! Gen. C. General Cazador Without a blush , he boasts his shame , and seems to think it glory ! ( Aside . ) Blus . Colonel Bluster Of course , ' t is often inconvenient  --  for creditors are selfish dogs , and never think of any man 's necessities , except their own . Still  --  when I grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have an office soon , and sooner have a wife shall bring a fortune with her . Gen. C. General Cazador If you succeed in winning Melville 's daughter , you 'll have a fortune , sure enough . Her father is a mine , a perfect mint . Blus . Colonel Bluster If I succeed ! How can I fail , and bear the form I do ! ' T is true , she 's rather mother shy as yet  --  to draw me on ! Gen. C. General Cazador To draw you on ? Blus . Colonel Bluster For that alone  --  because her looks express her thoughts , and those speak libraries of ardent love ! Have you observed her looks when I am near ? Gen. C. General Cazador If aught for him they have expressed , it is aversion , and not love ; but who could make the fool believe this fact ? ( Aside . ) I have ; and feel assured  --  if ever looks have been interpreters to thoughts  --  Miss Melville is in love . You have a rival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aims to claim a nearer title . Blus . Colonel Bluster A bandbox man , he is . A counter-jumping merchant , fit only to sell goods , and whisper chamber-maids . Miss Melville endures the sentimental swain , to please her father ; but she has eyes to see the difference ' twixt a thing like he , and  --  hem ! you understand ! Gen. C. General Cazador A gentleman of chivalric bearing , like yourself ! Else were she blind , indeed . Blus . Colonel Bluster Were he in fact a rival . I 'd find a way to make him fly the track . Gen. C. General Cazador Indeed ! Blus . Colonel Bluster The plainest thing in life ! rip out his heart , or send his head a-kiting to the clouds . Gen. C. General Cazador The most effectual means that could be named ! and simple , too , excepting for the risk . A halter 's not a pleasant subject for reflection . Blus . Colonel Bluster Cowards and children start at shadows , sir . A brave man runs all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a hundred ways to force a quarrel on , and take a life with safety . Gen. C. General Cazador I had not thought of that . So far I am behind the age . But see  --  your threat has conjured up the man himself , and with him comes his friend . Blus . Colonel Bluster Then , General , we 'll go in ; not that I fear to meet them both ! Gen. C. General Cazador Certainly not ! Blus . Colonel Bluster Certainly not ! but yet I fancy neither , well enough to stay ; and have no quarrel yet with Fair field . ( Going . ) Gen. C. General Cazador I 'll but exchange a word with them and follow you . ( Exit Bluster C. ) Now , is he more a fool than knave , or knave than fool , or coward , than them both ? He 's certain all the three ! The only question is , in which he most excels ! ( Enter Howson and Fairfield , R. 1 E. ) you 've started off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare your life ! ( Shakes hands with Howson , and crosses to R. ) How . Howson In what have we offended so great a man as Colonel Bluster ? Gen. C. General Cazador You are without the pale of his consuming rage ! Fairfield , he thinks , aspires to love where his own hopes are fixed . His doubts alone allow a respite to your fate . ( To Fairfield . ) Fair . Harry Fairfield The vain , presumptuous fool ! His head 's as empty as a drum , and , like a drum , it utters naught but loud , unmeaning sounds . Such fellows but deceive themselves in thinking men of sense put faith in their self-praise . How . Howson Dare you indulge in strictures so severe , and quite forget that Bluster bears the august title of a Colonel ? Fair . Harry Fairfield Even his title I contemn ; for , like the thousand other Colonels who parade the streets , his rank , most like , is of his own creation ! ( They laugh . ) At best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Colonel of militia regiment , parading once a year , on training days , or led some emigrants across the plains , or headed rows upon election day ! Any thing confers a title here . But , General , I am surprised to see a man like you in close companionship with such a jackdaw ! Gen. C. General Cazador You would not wonder if you knew us both , for he 's a walking joke ! while I  --  amidst a crowd who 're seeking wealth  --  seek only for amusement , " and find it in exhaustless streams while studying Colonel Bluster . " He 's now to me , and gives such little pains to draw him out . How . Howson He 's one of many that you 'll see ere long , and weary of , the more you see . Gen. C. General Cazador An overdose of sweets will make the palate sick , and even Bluster may , in time c'ercloy the taste . I must rejoin him , though , lest he concludes I am intrigucing with his foes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Howson Not till we hear an invitation from the gong . We 'll nurse our appetite in the open air . Gen. C. General Cazador We 'll meet at table , then . ( Exit C. Howson and Fairfield pass to L ) Fair . Harry Fairfield O what a power there dwells in idleness !  --  " a spell that 's felt , yet not acknowledged ; unnoted , though pervading ! " How . Howson What spell is that your wisdom finds in lack of occupation ? Fair . Harry Fairfield The power that makes us neighbors to the stars  --  the power to magnify , " and see the things , which , but for that , had been unseen  --  the power " to swell an ant-hill to a mountain  --  to make an ape appear a man ! How . Howson The telescopic power to magnify a Bluster , and in his own conceit to make him seem the General 's friend , and Harry Fairfield 's rival . ( Laughs . ) That is the sum of your philosophy . Fair . Harry Fairfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oracle . That Bluster 's my aversion . How . Howson Poor wretch ! and wherefore so ? Fair . Harry Fairfield I hate a fool ! How . Howson You do him too much honor by the thought . Were he indeed a man of fair pretensions , he might excite a jealous pang or two , in this conjuncture of your love affairs . A mistress angered , is no theme for jest , where ladies are so scarce . Fair . Harry Fairfield I fear no rivalry in Lucy 's love ; nor is she angered , as you say . A coolness from a trivial cause exists between us , but no quarrel . " A summer 's cloud , no more ; which , when it is passed , will leave the skies more bright . " Some blunt advice I gave aroused her pride , and she expects I 'll humbly sue for pardon ! How . Howson While you would play the tyrant , ere you 're wed , and stand upon prerogative ? Fair . Harry Fairfield O , no ; I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her judgement be convinced that I was right . A good example you may profit by , in wooing your fair Julia . How . Howson My Julia ! I wish she was . I 'm over head and ears in love , and she should be the same ; but if she is , I 'm none the wiser for the fact . She 's cold or warm , by turns ; or strange or kind ; as suits her fancy . In fact , she is the most capricious  --  Fair . Harry Fairfield What ! How . Howson Saint or sinner , man was ever plagued or pleased with . ( Gong sounds . ) Fair . Harry Fairfield There is a sound , angelie as her voice . Let 's in and dine , and after , seek the heaven our saints inhabit . ( Going . ) How . Howson Have with you . We 'll fortify the flesh , the better to endure what our divinities decree , should they incline to mortify the spirit . ( They exit C. ) Enter Baker , R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bak . Billy Baker My luck again ! After a hunt through all the town , I 'm just in time to hear the dinner-bell , and see him vanish at the sound ! Straight from the mines , and hungry as a wolf ! and nary red to buy a meal of victuals with ! I must see Mr. Fairfield ! As a sort of old acquaintance , he 'll surely help me to do something . ( Gong sounds . ) Why do n't that thing dry up ! ' T is bad enough to feel an appetite like mine , without having it tantalized by dinner-bells . What would they say at home , to see me in this plight ! I who started off with such grand notions of a fortune ! Long before this , I thought to make all Broadway stare , and take Fifth Avenue by storm ! ( Examines his clothing . ) And so I would  --  if they could only see me now ! I 'd hardly pass though for a New York blood , or circulate among the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sin is on your soul . You put the motion in my head ; and quite as much it was to find you out , that brought me here , as even hope to find a fortune . But neither you nor gold have blessed my sight as yet . " I 'm back again in San Francisco , though , and one step nearer home . If I can only speak with Mr. Fairfield , he 'll help me on another step , and may be all the way . " ( Gong sounds , he rushes towards the hotel , then suddenly checks himself . ) I 'll have to come some other time . Human nature ca n't put up with sounds like that ! ( Exit L. ) Scene II .  --  Private parlor in the hotel . Enter Julia and Lucy , 2 E. Lucy . Lucy Melville You little thought , a year ago , that you could be in this far land , and happy , being here ! Julia . Julia Everst A year ago ! Six months ago I dreamed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like your own , a widower , with only me to plague him , and my aunt , who long has sighed to doff a widow 's weeds . She had outgrown her hopes at home ; but in this new-found world , what might she not expect ! Mad as the rest she grew  --  not for the gold  --  Lucy . Lucy Melville No ! Julia . Julia Everst No : but for a husband , whom her spirits ( for she believes in spirits , Lucy , and has implicit faith in table rappings , ) told her she would meet with here . By the aid of spells from out the papers , and stories from some friends returned enriched , she so impressed my father with her frenzy , that he gave up his modest gains at home , and started for this promised land ! Lucy . Lucy Melville Which , but a month ago , you reached :  --  in time to ' scape the winter rains , and see our hills put on their brightest dress . You soon grew reconciled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia Everst I did  --  and owe it to our unexpected meeting ! A fountain in a desert , Lucy , could not have been more welcome then was the sight of one dear face , where all around were strangers ! Lucy . Lucy Melville " I know not , Julia , whether I was most surprised or pleased to see you . " Of all my friends , you were the last I thought would venture on the trip ! ' T was but a year since we had parted , and then , you deemed me wild , because I 'd not remain at home ; and thought it living death to dwell so far from all delights of city life ! Julia . Julia Everst I did !  --  and thought with all your friends , and half the world , or more ! for California was a dream-like place , and seemed but one remove from savage lands , where infants are devoured for lunch , and missionaries served up  --  a dinner-dish ! A visit to the moon was nearer to my hopes than such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love alone , that tempted you from home ? Lucy . Lucy Melville What else could tempt me , if not that ? Julia . Julia Everst A lover is no slight inducement ! Fairfield was here , you know ! Lucy . Lucy Melville And if he was  --  what then ? Julia . Julia Everst A trifle , merely ! You were his promised bride , and might indulge a wish to note if his affections wandered from their polar star ! You 'd scarce confess the soft impeachment now ,  --  since love has turned to rage ! Lucy . Lucy Melville You 're doubly wrong !  --  but err the most in saying " love has turned to rage ! " It has not so !  --  ' t is love as much as ever ! Julia . Julia Everst Indeed ! ( Smiles . ) Lucy . Lucy Melville You know it is ! I am offended , and with reason , because the gentleman presumes to lecture me  --  while I 've a father does not half so much ! I 'd scarcely bear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempt  --  and so I let his lordship understand ! But , Julia , I 'll retort your question upon yourself ; and ask , which love it was that brought you here ? Julia . Julia Everst No love at all brought me : but mere obedience ! I knew not how to raise rebellion ; or surely had rebelled , when the command to march was given ! Lucy . Lucy Melville Was there no charm in the description given of Californians ? their spirit of adventure , and their chivalrie bearing towards our sex ? To think of it revives the genius of romance , and makes them seem like knights of other days !  --  while they deem us  --  Julia . Julia Everst A race of angels  --  only lacking wings !  --  ( Laughs . ) And so we are  --  to them : and well we may be , while so few are here ! But for our knights !  --  imagine them beside the knights of other days ! Conceive their costumes at tournament ! Some few might promenade in modern towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest !  --  their garments multiply the hues of light , and rack invention to conceive their shape ! Lucy . Lucy Melville Laugh , if you will ; but still they shall be knights , despite your mockery , " They but adopt the fashion of the times , as did the lion-hearted Richard or the great Saladin ! These were costumed no more like Csar , than Csar like Napoleon , yet all were knights , and heroes too . " Julia . Julia Everst Call our Californians heroes , if you will ; but do not take them to the days of troubadours , and let your fancy sketch them errant knights ! How , in poetic vein , should you describe them , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy Melville Pshaw ! Julia . Julia Everst Nay , but it may be done . Suppose them passing ' neath our turret now . Observe the first array  --  red-shirted knights , divested both of coat and vest , with Hessian boots that tower above the knee , and pantaloons tucked in ! They wear their beavers down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so perverse they wo n't be fastened up . Next come the knights in shirts of grey , and blue , and brown ; for lance in rest or battle axe , they bear the sword-cane and the bowie knife ; while Colt 's revolver takes the place of petronel ! ( Crosses to L. ) Enter Jenny , R. 1 E. Lucy . Lucy Melville A rescue , Julia , from your cavalcade ! Jenny announces other knights than those in shirts red , or brown , or blue . Jen . Jenny La , Miss , I did'nt look at their shirts ! but there 's plenty in the parlor , though only two have asked for you , and for Miss Julia . Julia . Julia Everst My new mantilla , Lucy , ' gainst a pair of gloves , I name them both . Lucy . Lucy Melville A wager I could win myself ! Fairfield , of course , is one , and Mr. Howson , as his friend , comes wooing you . Julia . Julia Everst As is friend ! I disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the friend of his friend 's friend . Lucy . Lucy Melville You are jealous of his likings , then ! I thought as much before . Julia . Julia Everst Jealous of a man I 've scarcely known a month ! A proper man enough , I own , to please the eye , or spend an hour in light flirtation with ; but still a stranger . Lucy . Lucy Melville That tell-tale blush gives contradiction to your words . You love him , Julia ! Julia . Julia Everst How perfectly absurd ! Lucy . Lucy Melville Even so ; but still you love him ! " Love is of a rapid growth in this prolific clime . The passions here are like the teeming soil  --  let but the germ be quickened , and straight the flowers are seen above the surface . You love him , Julia ! " Julia . Julia Everst Yes , as I love a dozen others ! I love to tease him . Lucy . Lucy Melville You 've read the fable of the man who sold the lion 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself devoured by the beast . I hunt no lions , Lucy . The men , you know , are lambs  --  till they are married . ( Crosses to R. followed by Lucy . ) Jen . Jenny I expect , Miss , that 's the reason why they sometimes look so sheepish  --  those that ai nt ! Julia . Julia Everst There , Jenny , that will do . Come , Lucy , even lambs may lose their patience . ( Going . ) Lucy . Lucy Melville It would be serving Harry right if I refused to go . They exit R. Jen . Jenny There they go , as loving as two sisters ; but not a bit more like sisters than me and Barney ! What 's the reason I said Barney ? Why did'nt I say Achille , or Tom , or even cousin Will ? Poor cousin Will ! how mad he used to get , when I would burst out laughing at him for his simple ways ! He was as different now from Barney  --  there I go  --  with Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never go to think of any nice young man , but Barney pops up right into my mind .

Barney Jenny , you jewel ! it 's in luck I am to find you here , an ' me a hunting only Mr. Harry ! Jen . Jenny If it is'nt Barney , I 'm a sinner ! Bar . Barney In course it is ; an ' is that all you 've got to say ? Jen . Jenny All ! No , sir , not all ! I want to know how you 've dared to come up to Miss Lucy 's room , and never sent for by a single soul ? Bar . Barney Sure , is'nt it the very place to look for Mr. Harry in ? Jen . Jenny If Mr. Harry 's all you want , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barney Then let him wait there , Jenny , till I come !

Jenny Keep your distance , Mr. Impudence ; I do n't allow such liberties to strangers ! ( He approaches her . ) If you come nearer , you 'll make me scream  --  you will . Bar . Barney Och , bother to your screamin ' ! Would you have the house go into fits ? ( He takes her round the waist  --  she struggles at first , but gradually submits . ) Jen . Jenny Yes , that I would ,  --  if you ai nt got no manners ! Bar . Barney O murder ! just to hear how she can spake  --  an ' to the man she loves ! Jen . Jenny The man I love ! Bar . Barney That 's myself ! Jen . Jenny Do n't flatter yourself with such a notion , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I prefer to you ! Bar . Barney The bla'guards ! Jen . Jenny No , sir , not blackguards ; but nice young men ! There 's cousin Will , was like to die for me , at home ! Bar . Barney Why the divil did'nt he do it , then ! Sure , you could'nt marry him  --  he 's your own flesh an ' blood ! Jen . Jenny Well , then , there 's Achille  --  he ai nt my own flesh and blood ! Bar . Barney An ' would you demane yourself to think of him  --  dirty washerwoman that he is  --  when you can have a lad like me ? Jen . Jenny You 'll please , sir , not abuse Achille ; even if you are jealous of him ! Bar . Barney Me , jealous of a washerwoman ! O holy Jonah ! an ' you a lovin ' me all the while !

I 've noticed Mr. Melville looks , at times , unutterable things ; but , if I am to marry , my fancy 's rather for that handsome foreigner  --  the General !  --  There 's something in his features which reminds me of poor Hunter ! ' T is fifteen years since he was lost  --  the ship , and all on board ; and still I am a widow  --  but am not always to remain one , if there is truth in what the spirits say ! Hunter is my guardian , and always joins the circle when I 'm there . He says I 'll be a wife again in California ! Well , fate is fate , there 's no resisting that !

Julia Everst Mr. Howson , I declare !  --  and all alone ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson ( Not seeing Julia . ) I shall forswear the sex , and live a hermit all my days ! Julia . Julia Everst You will forswear yourself , sweet sir , unless your days are of the shortest ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson The fickle , heartless jilt ! She is unworthy of the love she gained ! ( Sees Julia . ) Miss Everst ! Pray heaven , she did not hear that last ! ( Aside . ) Julia . Julia Everst He shall repeat that slander on his knees ! Aside . You were speaking as I entered , sir ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be repeated ! How . Howson I was unconscious of your presence , quite ; and merely thought aloud :  --  an awkward habit I have acquired of late ! Julia . Julia Everst Of very late !  --  no earlier than since morning ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson You have honored me with your commands , and , in obedience to them , I am here to learn your will ! She shall not think the visit 's of my own accord ! ( Aside . ) Julia . Julia Everst How formal is the gentleman ! He 'll live to wish he had been less precise ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson Is it your pleasure to express the reason for your order ? Julia . Julia Everst I claim no right to " order , " sir ; and scarce had ventured a request , save in a case of life and death ! The duel which the town discusses  --  How . Howson Is like to end  --  as other topics which amuse the town  --  in nothing ! Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! To her , the explanation has been made already ! Julia . Julia Everst Of course he 'll make it now to me :  --  he ca n't in courtesy do less ! ( Pauses . ) Why does he not go on : or is he waiting for a hint to speak ? ( Aside . ) The interest , sir , I feel in what concerns my friend , may warrant curiosity to learn the facts myself ! How . Howson Doubtless , it may : and as Miss Melville is possessed of all I have a right to state , she 'll give the knowledge which you seek , but which I may not mention further ! Julia . Julia Everst Can he be laughing at me now ? I half suspect he is  --  the polar bear ! ( Aside . ) I thank you for the reference , sir ; although it is not needed ! There are some persons in the world who can endure suspense , and I am classed with those ! How . Howson Yes , and you 're classed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Julia . Julia Everst And there are others , sir  --  at least we hear there are  --  and you perhaps have noticed such  --  who , free from pain themselves , can take no thought of grief around ! They are but intidels to tears which others shed , while there exists within themselves a single motive for a smile ! How . Howson I 'm glad you 've heard of such , and ask me to confirm the fact ! Julia . Julia Everst Indeed ! How . Howson Indeed I am ! For I have noticed many of that kind , and even worse than those you name ! Julia . Julia Everst Worse ! How . Howson Much worse ! Some I have observed , who not only gaze with unconcern upon surrounding grief , but whose delight consists in causing pain !  --  who play upon the human heart , as though it were an instrument for mere amusement ! who , when fatigued  --  as soon they grow  --  with harmony and silv'ry sounds , will draw forth sighs , and shrieks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be you have heard , or read of such ? Julia . Julia Everst I have indeed !  --  but not in history , or authentic works : they 're only mentioned in romances , those I 've met ! ( laughs . ) Still there are hearts , which , like the sad olian , will answer sighs to every breeze that blows , and then imagine they are swayed by human skill ! I ca n't be sure that this is true ; but if it is , those shrieks and groans respond more oft to fancied than to real wrongs !  --  yet do we pity , more than blame , the misery deplored in such discordant strains ! He 'll never be in fitter mood to profit by a lesson to a jealous fit ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson Is it a fancied wrong to know the one beloved is false ?  --  to be convinced that while she only smiles on you , she can give more than smiles to strangers ! Julia . Julia Everst It may be that is fancied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , when there is no such meaning in her thoughts ! If that is so , you have no right to call her false :  --  your vanity , not her falsehood is in fault ! It may be , too , that the smiles which others get , they are entitled to :  --  all are not strangers who are strange to you ! or , if they are , it still may be , that those imagined smiles are the mere coinings of a jealous mind , and have existence only there ! How . Howson To make her boldness quite complete , she 's only now to take one other step ! I 'll try if she will go so far ! ( Aside . ) Jealousy will fancy much , no doubt , on slender proof ; and even on no proof at all : but what the eyes behold must be believed ! There can be no deception when the sight attests a fact ! Julia . Julia Everst The senses all may be deceived : but most of all , the sight ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Aside . ) Should you behold the one beloved reclining in a stranger 's arms , you could not deem the picture less than real , or credit argument to prove it mere delusion ! Julia . Julia Everst I 'd first be sure he was a stranger , ere I 'd venture to condemn ! The allusion , sir , is understood : and , if the right to question might be recognised , it would be easy to explain that , which , unexplained , seems strange at present ! At proper time the world may know , and will approve , what meets your censure now : till then  --  if you desire further light  --  ( Sees Cazador entering , C. ) Enter Cazador , C. How .

General Cazador That knowledge shall be furnished by to-morrow night : and then we 'll end the wonder , and make e'en Mr. Howson smile ! How . Howson You 'll deal in magic , then : or ' twill be with rage , too long suppressed ! ( Aside . ) Julia . Julia Everst Make Mr. Howson smile !  --  impossible ! The balance of his days are given to sighs , and shrieks , and groans ! He 'd banish smiles to caverns wild , and murder mirth , if it should dare approach ! How . Howson I shall not wait , to let her break her jests on me : but will return again for Lucy 's note ! ( Aside . ) Miss Everst  --  I take my leave ! General Cazador  --  your most obedient servant , sir ! Going ,  --  bows ceremoniously . Julia . Julia Everst I 'm sorry you 're in haste ! You 'll not forget to-morrow night !  --  the ball you know comes off , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss ! A pretty dance she 'll lead me at the ball ! Aside , and exit R. Gen. C. General Cazador Poor Howson ! He thinks he owes me little thanks , and takes no pains to hide his thoughts : while you can smile , like martyred patience , at your fate , and pass , unmurmuring , through the dread ordeal ! Julia . Julia Everst My murmurs are withheld because I see beyond the hour : besides , I am amused in watching Howson 's hopes and doubts :  --  to see him struggle ' gainst his rage ! ' T is fit he learns to master that , before he takes a wife ; or some weak woman 's got to bear it all ! But , uncle , tell me of the duel  --  is it a fable or a fact ? I 've heard so much I do n't know what to think ! Gen. C. General Cazador Think it a fable , then ; for so ' twill prove :  --  but do not ask the meaning of it now ! Julia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I hate to be in doubt ! Gen. C. General Cazador Yet have no sympathy for Howson 's doubts : that 's human nature , though . We must be made to feel ourselves , before we know that others feel ! To-morrow all shall be explained  --  to you and Howson , both ! Julia . Julia Everst Your moral reaches farther than you think ! I wonder who it is that keeps his wife in doubt ! Gen. C. General Cazador Not me , I 'm sure ! My wife is not in doubt  --  or has no doubts of me ! She thinks that Hunter 's in his grave ! Her doubts are only of the General ; and he , with your assistance , will soon dispose of those ! Where is your aunt ? Julia . Julia Everst I 'll take you to her , if you 'll go ! Gen. C. General Cazador Be sure I will !  --  for I must husband time , or I 'll not husband her  --  not by to-morrow night ! Julia . Julia Everst Then come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : while I steal off to Lucy 's room , to learn the secret Howson told ! ( Going . ) Gen. C. General Cazador And then to plot against poor Howson 's peace ! Well , go along :  --  he 'll turn the tables on you yet ! Julia .

( Takes hold of Bluster and Wilkins , and going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make a hole through him who tries to run , a horse and cart would turn in , and come out ! ( Bluster turns , as if to escape , but encounters Baker 's leveled pistol . He then exits with Policeman and Wilkins . ) This comes of salting claims ! ' T is but a step from that , to burning cities down ! ( Exit L. ) Scene III .  --  A Drawing-room communicating with a ball-room . Music heard , and waltzers seen crossing the room . Enter Julia and Howson , C.  --  She takes a seat . How . Howson You 're not fatigued , I trust ? ( Coldly . ) Julia . Julia Everst Who would not be fatigued  --  with walking up and down ? You are the dullest man was ever at a ball ; and might be dumb , for aught you have to say ! How . Howson ( Sullenly . ) Is silence then a sin ? If so , I own myself at fault ! ' T is clear she seldom sins that way ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it is a sin  --  against both time and place ! Why do n't you dance , or tell me something new ? You 're not gallant to-night ! How . Howson Nor are you complimentary ! Julia . Julia Everst How can I be  --  with such a sullen man ? He shall not learn the secret until uncle comes ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson It would be something new , and strange , if I should say a constant woman had been found ! But such a tale would be romance , and no more true , than if I said the dead had come to life ! She 's not attempted to explain !  --  ' t was all a shallow trick ! ( Aside . ) Julia . Julia Everst Such things have happened , sir , in olden time , and may occur again ! The sea has given back its dead ! How . Howson Yes , once  --  in Jonah 's case :  --  and through the medium of a philanthropic whale ! That chanced two thousand years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangle , trying Jonah 's leg ! There 's no report , of recent date , that names a woman of unchanging love , or dead men brought to life ! Julia . Julia Everst ' T would be some credit to your sex , to find as many civil men , as there are constant hearts in ours ! There was a time such charge had been unjust :  --  a time when gallant knights would gladly die , defending woman 's fame !  --  and when such knights wore courtesy , the proudest of their plumes ! Alas , alas ! that race has dwindled down ! How . Howson It should have been extinct ere this ! ' T is too quixotic for degenerate days ! Yet still I stand rebuked , e'en though I had no wish to speak  --  until you urged me on ! Julia . Julia Everst A lame excuse for most discourteous words ! ( Rises . ) You must be dumb , or wound a lady 's ear ! You 've been to school , and might have mentioned what you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' T were better so than using spiteful thoughts ! Or , failing even that , you might have spoken of the ball  --  told me the ladies which you like the best ; and criticized their forms , their features , and their dress  --  that , would be apropos ! But you must travel very far to find a subject best forgot ! You have not named the dance tonight , or claimed me for a waltz ! He 's pinioned to the stake , and must be tortured , to be cured ! ( Aside . ) How . Howson I shall not dance to-night ! The music 's out of tune and time , and seems a compound made from Chinese gongs and creaking doors ; jewsharps and penny flutes ! Julia . Julia Everst Your ear , and not the music 's out of tune ! You 've danced to worse , a hundred times , and thought it quite divine ! How . Howson Perhaps I have ; and yet ca n't think so now ! Our feelings give the form to facts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream has passed ! I used to love to dance ; yet now its grace has fled ; and , looking on , I see but men and women bobbing up and down , like crazy Turks in mosques , or shaking quakers at their prayers ! I hate the dance ! That 's strong enough to let her know she does not dance with me ! ( Aside . ) Julia . Julia Everst You do ! How . Howson I do ! Julia . Julia Everst And so do I !  --  the country dance , or plain quadrille ! But for the waltz  --  the sylph-like waltz  --  where you must float in air , and feel like whirling stars revolving round the sun , amidst the music of the spheres ! You surely do n't hate that ? How . Howson I hate that worst of all ! There 's nothing sylphlike in a hop , or jump ; and as to floating through the air :  --  ' t is more like Pilgrim 's progress up the hill ! The Pilgrim gets the worst of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is through ! ( Aside . ) Julia . Julia Everst ( With mock seriousness . ) Then you are changed indeed ! Why what a life of gloom you 'll have ! Your thoughts do n't run on suicide , I hope ? You do not linger round apothecary shops , looking with wistful gaze for arsenic , strichnine , or for prussic acid ! How . Howson ( Petulantly . ) Pshaw ! Julia . Julia Everst I 'm glad you do n't ; I 'm very glad :  --  and so may let you go ! You 're quite too dull for company ; yet have I staid here all this while to save your precious life ! How . Howson ( Ironically . ) Words ca n't repay such wond'rous care ! Your sacrifice has been too grandly great ! Julia . Julia Everst It has indeed ! but it is ended now . I see my uncle yonder , with my aunt , so may relinquish yours , for his protecting arm ! ( Curtsies formally , and going , C. ) How . Howson ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear aright ? You said you saw  --  Julia . Julia Everst My uncle , sir !  --  who was not drowned  --  as was so long supposed ! Now let him change the object of his wrath , and pour it on himself ! Aside and exit , C. How . Howson ( Walks up and down . ) Am I awake ?  --  or is this but a dream  --  a tantalizing dream ? I feel like falling down a flight of stairs ;  --  that 's an unfailing sign of sleep ! Ca n't some one bite my little finger off , to satisfy the doubt ? Julia the General 's niece !  --  it ca n't be real , this ! ( Turns to where Julia stood . ) Miss Everst ! She 's gone :  --  and I have let her go , and stand here , like a fool , in conversation with myself ! Exit C.  --  Music resumes playing . Enter Lucy , followed by Fairfield , L. " Fair .

Harry Fairfield Well , be it so  --  since such is your decree ! ' T is best I suffer pain , than you should offer violence to your heart ! " " Lucy . Lucy Melville I do not understand your meaning , quite ! " " Fair . Harry Fairfield And yet ' t is plain as words can speak ! I thought you loved me once ! " " Lucy . Lucy Melville Well ! " " Fair . Harry Fairfield But , if you did , that time is past ! This pretext frees you from an irksome tie ! Lucy , you do not love me now ! " " Lucy . Lucy Melville In spite of all you 've done , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ! and what is more , you know I do !  --  but build no hope on that  --  I 'd die before I 'd wed without return of love !

Harry Fairfield What actions so profane my words ? Do let me know with what I 'm charged ! Lucy . Lucy Melville How can you ask , yet know so well ! Why was I left for weary days , to pine in the belief of your endangered life ; when all the while you knew there was no risk , yet kept that knowledge to yourself ! Fair . Harry Fairfield If that were so , I should deserve your hate , nor would I hope for more ! I knew it not , until we left the field ! Lucy . Lucy Melville Can this indeed be so ? Fair .

( Aside . ) Mrs. H. Mrs. Hunter Calm as content , sir ! calm as content : and yet I will not hear you speak ; not now , nor ever more ! Go back , sir , to Peru , and get a Spanish Wife ! Perhaps you 've practised on that kind before ! Gen. C. General Cazador You are angry now , my dear ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Hunter ( Stops suddenly . ) General Cazador ! Gen. C.

( Aside . ) Very well , madam ! very well !  --  be mistress of your wish ! I thought to meet a constant wife , but planned a harmless scheme to test her faith , which melted , fast as polar snow , in that same equatorial heat ! Mrs. H. Mrs. Hunter Oh , dear !
