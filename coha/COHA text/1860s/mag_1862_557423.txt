ART . VI . - North America . By ANTHONY TROLLOPE , Author of " The West Indies and the Spanish Main , " " The Three Clerks , " " The Struggles of Brown , Jones , and Robinson , " " Doctor Thorne , " " Framley Parsonage , " " Orley Farm , " &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c . New York : Harper and Brothers . 1862. l2mo. pp. 623 . JOHN BULL has a great passion for writing travels . He does not appear to have travelled more or farther than his neighbors ; but he has more to say about his " wanderings " than all of them together . Nor does he appear to be impelled by any laudable desire of instructing his countrymen about the geography and customs of the countries he visits . Certainly he has not succeeded , and his Transatlantic brethren are still asked , by the most refined and best-educated Englishmen , whether pine-apples do not grow in Boston , and whether the Anglo-Saxon race has not dwindled in America . Read any one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London press , with such titles as " Six Weeks in Canada , " " Vacation Tourists , " " A Run to Malta , " " Rainbles in the East , " ( the short time spent in the country seems always to be put forward as a special recommendation , ) and you will find that three fourths of the book are filled with complaints of hotels , ridicule of manners , and criticisms of institutions . John is so continually growling , that his national oath has become as his patronymic on the other side of the Channel , and his chief purpose in travelling seems to be to give his opinion about his neighbors ' affairs . He has one standard , to which he brings everything , and whatever does not square with that must be bad . Fortunately for John , most of his neighbors can not read , or do not take the trouble to read , his effusions , or he would be more unpopular than he is . His American cousins , on the contrary , using the same language , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially about them ; and no matter how insignificant the author , or how contemptible his opinions , they are wounded to the quick . This sensitiveness is very silly , John abuses everybody else , himself included , just as much as he does us . Indeed , // living three thousand miles off , we hardly get our share . It is his way , and , however unpleasant it may be , there is generally underneath it a vast deal of good-nature and kind feeling . Moreover , our very touchiness is the mark of a national foible quite as unpleasant to our neighbors as John 's testiness . We have been a most superlatively self-conceited people , and our egregious vanity has appeared in no respect more markedly than in our impertinent demands on the admiration and applause of the world . Unlike the Englishman , we do not keep our opinions to ourselves . John Bull looks glum , and scolds and frets over the Continent ; but , unless his equanimity is especially ruffled , he keeps his thoughts to himself , and his opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound . The true Yankee has no such retentiveness . He intrudes himself everywhere , and no hints will drive him off . He vents his opinions on all occasions , and in the loudest nasal tones . " The Rhine is a brook compared to the Hudson " ; " The Alps can not hold a candle to Niagara and " There is nothing in London or Paris which will compare with Stewart 's the Fifth Avenue , or Central Park . " This is no exao ' *eration . Every educated American who has travelled in Europe has been made to blush by this gasconade of his countrymen , if lie has not been driven to avoid them as he would a pestilence . As for ourselves , after a good deal of experience of both types of national manners , we must say , that , if we are to be afflicted with either , we greatly prefer the English ; and if foreign criticism can give us a juster opinion of our country , and a more real independence of character , we do not care how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That half of it will be false , and the other half exaggerated , is to be expected ; but that is of no importance , if it only leads us to examiiie ourselves , not by any European canon , but by that standard which our wisest and best men have held up to us . We can have no really great or independent national chaiacter until we distinguish our faults from our merits , and diligeiitly seek to avoid the former , while we cling with manly self-respect to the latter . Mr. Trollope 's work is decidedly above the average of ordinary " Vacation Rambles . " He devoted six months to the 36* // United States and Canada , which is five months more than most of his countrymen think sufficient " to do " the country ; and he has the candor to confess , at the end of his book , " that a man might well engage himself for six years , or perhaps for sixty , in obtaining materials for it . " Moreover , he has not been a mere superficial observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our domestic institutions and our politics , always with candor , and generally with success . He is almost the only English popular writer , so far as we are aware , who has carried away a clear understanding of the intimate relation of our States to one another and to the national government , or who has taken the trouble to investigate our school system and its important bearing on the character of the people . He has also appended to his book , in full , the Declaration of Jndependence , the Articles of Confederation , and the Constitution of the United States ; and , if he has succeeded in enlightening any considerable portion of the educated among his countrymen on these points alone , we owe him a debt of gratitude . Of course , he meets with many absurdities , and makes the most of his stories ; but that is his trade , and he tells them in such a good-natured way , and with such a fascinating style , as to render his work one of the most readable books of travel we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that his stories should not offend his American readers , for he volunteers the information at the outset that he could tell equally good stories against Englishmen , and gives some specimens in illustration ; but , after all , his illustrations only set off more strikingly his Yankee stories . Any traveller who has been much in England can tell stories enough against Englishmen ; but , as a rule , they are merely specimens of the profound ignorance , even of the besteducated scholars , about American affairs , and have but little fun or raciness in them . Not so , however , with your true Yankee conceit . There is a sublimity about it which defies all comparison . " Sir , " said Mr. Plaistead , " I have everything here that a man ought to want ; - air , sir , that ai n't to be got better nowhere ; trout , chickens , beef , mutton , milk , - and all for a dollar a day . A-top of that hill , sir , there s a view that ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , // the other . And an echo , sir ! We ye an echo that comes back to us six times , sir , - floating on the light wind , and wafted about from rock to rock , till you would think the angels were talking to you . If I could raise that echo , sir , every day at command , I d give a thousand dollars for it . It would be worth all the money to a house like this . " We have read with much interest Mr. Trollope 's criticisms of our educational establishments , and we think them generally just . He praises in the highest terms the excellences of our common schools , and returns again and again to express his wonder at the almost universal diffusion of an elementary education among the common people . Like all of his countrymen , he is somewhat inclined to find fault with the assurance and independence of manners among the working classes , which this universal education has produced ; but , unlike most Englishmen , he is very ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good for them . " For myself , I do not like the Americans of the lower orders . I am not comfortable among them . They tread on my corns , and offend me . They make my daily life unpleasant . But I do respect them . I acknowledge their intelligence and personal dignity . I know that they are men and women worthy to be so called ; I see that they are living as human beings in possession of reasoning faculties ; and I perceive that they owe this to the progress that education has made among them . " And again : " I am not saying that the man who is driven in the coach is better off because his coachman reads the paper , but that the coachman himself who reads the paper is better off than the coachman who does not and can not The political coachman is perhaps less valuable to his master as a coachman than he would be without his politics , but he with his politics is more valuable to himself . " This is certainly an appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York schools , he writes : - " It is almost impossible to mention them with too high a praise I do not know any contrast that would be more surprising to an Englishman , up to that moment ignorant of the mntter , than that which he would find by visiting first of all a free school in London , and then a free school in New York . If he would also learn the number of // children that are educated gratuitously in each of the two cities , and also the number in each which altogether lack education , he would , if susccptible of statistics , be surprised also at that . But seeing and hearing are always more effective than mere figures . The female pupil at a free school in London is , as a rule , either a ragged pauper , or a charity girl , if not degraded at least stigmatized by the badges and dress of the Charity . We Englishmen know well the type of each , and have a fairly correct idea of the amount of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards when the same girls become our servants , and the wives of our grooms and porters . The female pupil at a free school in iNew York is neither a pauper nor a charity girl . She is dressed with the utmost decency . She is perfectly cleanly . In speaking to her , you can not in any degree guess whether her father has a dollar a day , or three thousand dollars a year . Nor will you be enabled to guess by the manner in which her associates treat her . As regards her own manner to you , it is always the same as though her father were in all respects your equal . As to the amount of her knowledge , I fairly confess that it is terrific . When , in the first room which I visited , a slight slim creature was had up before me to explain to me the properties of the hypothenuse , I fairly confess that , as regards education , I backed down , and that I resolved to confine my criticisms to manner , dress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in regard to the schools of Boston - " Here , as at New York , I was almost startled by the amount of knowledge around me , and listened as I might have done to an examination in theology among young Brahmins . When a young lad explained in my hearing all the properties of the different levers as exemplified by the bones of the human body , I bowed my head before him in unaffected humility . We , at our English schools , never got beyond the use of those bones which he described with such accurate scientific knowledge . In one of the girls ' schools they were reading Milton , and when we entered were discussing the nature of the pool in which the Devil is described as wallowing . The question had been raised by one of the girls . A pool , so called , was supposed to contain but a small amount of water , and how could the Devil , being so large , get into it ? Then came the origin of the word pool , - from " palus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dictionary attesti% to the fact , - and such a marsh might cover a large expanse . The Palus Mmotis ' was then quoted . And so we went on till Satan 's theory of political liberty , Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven , ' // seventeen got up one after another and gave their opinions on the subject , - how far the Devil was right and how far he was manifestly wrong . I was attended by one of the directors or guardians of the schools , and the teacher , I thought , was a little embarrassed by her position . But the girls themselves were as easy in their demeanor as though they were stitching handkerchiefs at home . " It is impossible to refrain from telling all this , and from making a little innocent fun out of the superexcellences of these schools ; but the total result on my mind was very greatly in their favor . And indeed the testimony came in both ways . Not only was I called on to form an opinion of what the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boys and girls , but also to say what must have been the education of the boys and girls from what I saw of the men and women . Of course it will be understood that I am not here speaking of those I met in society , or of their children , but of the working people , - of that class who find that a gratuitous education for their children is needful , if any considerable amount of education is to be given . The result is to be seen daily in the whole intercourse of life . The coachman who drives you , the man who mends your window , the boy who brings home your purchases , the girl who stitches your wife 's dress , they all carry with them sure signs of education , and show it in every word they utter . " - pp. 265 , 266 . At Cambridge , also , the only one of our collegiate towns which Mr. Trollope appears to have visited , he finds much to praise . " There is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which lends so much grace and beauty " to the English colleges of Cambridge and Oxford . Moreover , the College buildings , with a few exceptions , are " very ugly red-brick houses , " and the lawn is not kept well mown ; but he adds , arid one would hardly ask higher praise : " Taking the University of Harvard College as a whole , I should say that it is most remarkable in this , - that it does really give to its pupils that education which it professes to give . Of our own Universities other good things may be said , but that one special good thing can not always be said . ' ? In most respects Mr. Trollope 's criticism on the American collegiate system as seen at Harvard is just ; but he is entirely mistaken in saying that " the greatest incentives to high excellence are wanting . " It is true there are no " prizes of fellowships and livings to be obtained " ; but al // though Harvard can not offer to her successful students " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward of honor , " and her first places are striven for with as much zeal as the " double-firsts " at Oxford , or the " wranglers ' " at the English Cambridge . Moreover , to a poor student , ambitious of literary or scientific distinction , successful scholarship is an opening to lucrative employment at Harvard quite as surely as it is to a fellowship or tutorship at the English Universities . Mr. Trollope also gives a somewhat false impression in regard to the requirements for a degree at Cainbridge . A young man can not spend his four years of residence at Harvard in entire idleness , and receive his degree as a matter of course if his conduct has been satisfactory , as Mr. Trollope would seem to imply . lie must keep up to a certain standard in his work , as shown by daily recitations and frequent written examinations , or he can not remain in College at all . Moreover , at the end of each year he must pass an examination on the whole work of the year , and failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower class . This is true of the Senior year , and the last examination of the course , although confined to the studies of this year , still covers quite as much ground ( different ground it is true ) as the final pass examination at the English Universities . If the student keeps up to the required standard , and passes the examinations satisfactorily to his instructors , he receives his degree as a matter of course ; and in practice very few who remain in Colle*e during the full period fail to get their degree , simply because the incompetents have been dropped off before the end of the first two years . At the English Universities , on the contrary , everything is made to turn on the final examination , and a student may pass his terms of residence in almost entire idleness , and still secure his degree by a little exertion at the end ; or his parents may get their first intimation of his incompetency when he is " plucked . " We can not but think that , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best for the students , and the most just to the parents . It secures constant attendance during four years o mm literary exercises covering all the im // tI* ) portant branches of human knowledge , with a modicum , at least , of regular study ; and we are certain that the result for the large majority of students is as good as could be reasonably expected , and much better than it is either at Oxford or Cambridge . The average scholarship is higher , and the poorest is not so low , - our lowest pass men know much more , and know what they do know much better , than the same class in England . But when we have said this , we have said all we can in our favor , and Mr. Trollope gives us our full meed of praise . " I conceive that the general level of the University education is higher there than with us ; that a young man is more sure of getting his education , and that a smaller percentage of men leaves Harvard College utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge . The education at Harvard College is more diversified in its nature , and study is more absohitely the business of the place , than it is at our Universities . " While , however , we compare favorably with our elder sisters in the general average , we fall lamentably short of them in high sc1*oiarship . This Mr. Trollope discovers ; but he mistakes the cause . The difficulty is to be found in the very system of our American colleges , and not in the want of large prizes , as Mr. Trollope seems to think . Our best scholars study as long and as faithfully as the Oxford doublefirsts , but their study is not so well directed . Their whole time is taken up with the constantly recurring task of the college , and they have no inducements to push their study beyond the prescribed course . They learn the appointed lesson well , and master tI1e book they study ; but the ideas thus gained are too apt to be bounded by the covers of the text-book , and that large knowledge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and careful thought is lost . The best scholar has the same lesson as the poorest , and can excel him only in the degree to which he masters it . He is not expected to learn , and does not learn , more than the book teaches ; and every one knows how meagre most text-books are , and how soon a lesson got up for recitation is forgotten . By thus keeping the whole class at the same // tread-mill , we grind out a very good average form of scholarship ; but we bruise the choicest seeds . Many a man , who , under a more special culture , would have become eminent in the classics , the mathematics , or the physical sciences , " finishes his education " at one of our American colleges without a profound knowledge of anything , and entirely contented with his superficial attainments , provided only that he has led his class in the same mediocrity . We know it will be said that colleges are not the place for special study , and that the college curriculum is intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind to enter successfully on the special professional studies of after life . Of course , no one desires to convert our colleges into professional schools ; but all special study is not professional study , and it certainly does not require argument to show that in this age of the world no study can be thorough , and no scholarship profound , which is not special . So , also , every one will admit that the great object of a college should be to train the mind for the work of after life ; but we believe the best experience has proved that , after a certain amount of general culture , there is no training so efficient as the exhaustive study of some great subject . Let it be understood that we are speaking only of our scholars , not of the great mass of the students . For the last , we believe our American system as , good as under the circumstances could well be devised . At all events , it has grown up with the country , and been adapted to its wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American college would not become great scholars under any system , and the college does the best thing for them , in striving to give a broad and liberal , although elementary , education . We are therefore far from wishing any radical change in our system , and least of all would we substitute the English system . At the English Universities there exists an opposite evil , and , as we believe , a more pernicious one . We , true to the democratic idea , sacrifice high scholarship to the good of the greatest number ; they , on the contrary , apply the whole energy of their immense establishments , with the stimulus of their magnificent prizes , to training the few choice spirits among their students , leaving the rest to take care of // themselves . As we dislike that element in the English government which sacrifices the good of the many to the elevation of a privileged class , so we dislike the same spirit in the English Universities . But , in our admiration for the principles of our social system , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to apply them where they have no place ; and while we zealously guard our doctrine of equality , so far as political rights are concerned , let us above all be careful not to apply this levelling principle to our scholarship . America can not afford it . So long as America has the battles of freedom to fight , and aspires to occupy the post of honor in the march of civilization , she can not afford to have her scholars , her statesmen , or her generals inferior in talents and culture to the rest of the world . But she will fall into this disgrace , if , instead of fostering , she practically discourages high scholarship in her institutions of learning , and surrenders the conduct of her public affairs to political hucksters instead of statesmen , and her armies to politicians instead of generals . As we have said , the want of the highest scholarship in our colleges is in great measure the fault of the system ; but then our college system , as we have seen , is the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges are not to blame for it . They are a part of the same social system , and naturally enough find it difficult to resist the influences which surround them . Moreover , the same system which depresses the scholarship of the student tends to depress their own . The complaint is often made , that the professors of American colleges do so little to advance science , and the reason is obvious . Men who are employed four or five hours every day in teaching the merest rudiments of knowledge will not be likely to rise much above their work . He who expects to do much to extend the boundaries of knowledge must be on the crest of the advancing wave , and there are not many men who can keep this position without the support either of sympathy or of some active stimulus ; and a teacher can have no sympathy so hearty and no stimulus so great as that of active young minds , which he has raised up nearly to a level with his own . So true is this , that it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception , that the great masters of science in Europe are working either under the stimulus of some learned society , or else are teaching on a level with their study . Our American professors , on the contrary , not only have no such stimulus and no such sympathy , but their whole work tends to depress them . We know it will be said that men of genius will be superior to their surroundings , and this in a measure is true ; but the men who do most to advance knowledge are not as a rule men of genius , and moreover it is also as true of mental work as it is of physical labor , - Raise a man 's work , and you will raise the man . However difficult , therefore , it may be to resist surrounding influences , we maintam that it is the duty of our American colleges to do the utmost in their power to foster the highest scholarship . While it is the duty of all , it is more especially the duty of those which , like Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater facilities , lead the van and set the example to the rest . How the college course is to be altered so as to produce the best result , must necessarily be left for each Faculty to determine , and the special details will be very much determined by the circumstances of the place ; but , as we have said , we do not believe that any radical changes in the general course are required , and we think that everything desirable could be gained by allowing more latitude in study to the candidates for honors during the last two years , by establishing three or four different " triposes , " and by awarding the honors in each tripos to the successful students after examination . What has been said of collegiate education applies still more strongly to professional training ; for , as a rule , the professional schools are on a much lower level than the colleges . This is especially true of the medical schools , where a competition for students has led the Medical Faculties of different cities so to reduce the requirements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proficiency , but merely permits to practise . The evil here is also greater , because , while at the bar or in the pulpit the judgment of a man 's peers soon puts him on his proper level , your medical practitioner in an obscure country town may sacrifice the lives of his patients , through his ignorance , without fear of exposure . // We hear it constantly said that the learned professions are no longer respected as formerly ; and why ? Simply because they are no longer learned professions . " Learned " is a relative term . In the early history of the country , the professional men were far better educated than the common people , and were therefore looked up to and respected ; but of late the standard of common education has been greatly advanced , while that of professional men , if it has not been stationary , has not kept pace with it , and consequently the reason for the respect has disappeared . As mortifying as it may be to our pride , it is none the less true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is vastly lower than in any other civilized nation with which we should be willing to be compared , when , for the reasons just stated , it ought to be higher . Raise professional men above laymen in America to the same relative height at which they stand in Europe , and they will not fail to receive the same respect , the same emoluments , and the same political power . Let us see to it , then , at this time of our country 's danger , when the cry is for educated statesmen and experienced generals to direct our public affairs , that we provide for the want , in the only possible way , by advancing our highest education . Having dwelt so long on the subject of American education , the one which has most interested us in Mr. Trollope 's book , we shall be able to glance only at a few other points of his interesting volume . Mr. Trollope has his hobby , which he rides through the book most amusingly . He refers all the physical ills of American life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes , there can , I think , be no doubt that to them is to be charged the murder of all rosy cheeks throughout the States . If the effect was to be noticed simply in the dry faces of the men about Wall Street , I should be very indifferent to the matter . But the young ladies of Fifth Avenue are in the same category . The very pith and marrow of life is baked out of their young bones by the hot-air chambers to which they are accustomed . Hot air is the great destroyer of American beauty . " With all due deference to Mr. Trollope 's opinion , we are inclined to believe that fashionable dissipation has as much to do as hot air in wilting the freshness of the // New York belles . Again , on board a Mississippi steamer : " The Americans , as a rule , live in an atmosphere which is almost unbearable by an Englishman . To this cause , I am convinced , is to be attributed their thin faces , their pale skins , their unenergetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their early old age . " So also at West Point : " American lads and lasses are all pale . Men at thirty , and women at twenty-five , have had all semblance of youth baked out of them . Infants even are not rosy , and the only shades known on the cheeks of children are those composed of brown , yellow , and white . All this comes of those damnable hot-air pipes with which every tenement in America is infested . " All this is simply absurd , and of a piece with a favorite theory of Enblishmen , that the Anglo-Saxon race has degenerated in America . It is their way of disowning a froward child , who has offended the tastes and run counter to the prejudices of the mother country . It is an amusing conceit , and constantly reappears in their writers on this country , in all sorts of extravagances . Mr. Trollope speculates on the peculiarities of the American type in the following way : - " What circumstances of blood or food , of early habit or subsequent education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is as completely marked , as much his own , as is that of any race under the sun that has bred in and in for centuries The chief stock is English , which is itself so mixed that no man can trace its ramifications . With this are mingled the bloods of Ireland , Holland , France , Sweden , and Germany . All this has been done within but a few years , so that the American may be said to have no claim to any national type of face . Nevertheless , no man has a type of face so clearly national as the American . He is acknowledged by it all over the continent of Europe , and on his own side of the water is gratified by knowing that he is never mistaken for his English visitor . " - p. 187 . Of course , facts have but little weight in opposition to prejudice , and it will not probably change Mr. Trollopo 's opinion to be told , that , except in a few very restricted localities , no such amalgamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the extent which he implies . In New England , certainly , the people are of as pure English blood , and have as direct an English descent , as the inhabitants of Lon // don ; but it is in this very New England that the so-called Yankee type has been developed , and thence spread over the United States . We have no desire to disguise or laud Yankee peculiarities . They are prominent enough and disagreeable enough , we know to our pain ; but , as distasteful as they are , there is no disguising the fact that they are bred of pure English blood , and are the natural result of true English character transplanted to a virgin soil . We do not , of course , overlook the singular mixture of nationalities at the West and in many of the Atlantic cities ; but this has been for the most part the result of recent immigration , and an Englishman , if he has read his own history , ought to know that it will require many generations before anything like a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , thus far the obstacles of language , customs , and tastes to amalgamation have been , as might be expected , almost insuperable , and the foreign population has generally herded together , both in the cities and in the country , and retained its respective nationalities as distinctly as in Europe . New York is said to be the third German city in the world , and its large German population is as distinct from the English , as the population of Berlin is from that of London . Moreover , it is not true that Americans ( understanding by this term , of course , the English population of the United States ) are known by their physiognomy all over the continent of Europe . Many of our countrymen , it is true , make their nationality only too evident by absurd boasting , obtrusive manners , and conspicuous dress ; but an American gentleman or lady , of proper modesty in dress and manners , who has learned the art of bridling the tongue , is constantly mistaken for English even by the English themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We remember an amusing anecdote , which illustrates not only this point , but also the absurd English theory we have been discussing . A late American scholar , whose distinguished reputation is known wherever good letters are respected , and whose genial countenance and large physique will long be remembered in this community , was dining a few years since at Munich in company with an English scholar , a Fellow of one of the Uni-37* // versities , who , although not of inferior size for an English student , was a pygmy at the side of our friend . The conversation chanced to turn on the United States , when the Englishman , who had mistaken our friend 's nationality , remarked , " How singular it is that our race has so degenerated in America . " " But , " says the American , " are you quite sure of the fact ? " " Certainly . There can be no doubt whatever . Lord has given the subject his careful attention , and you will find an article on the subject in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the reply , " I have had excellent opportunities for personal observation , and had arrived at an entirely different conclusion . " The Englishman still pressing his point , the conversation went on in this vein for some time , until our friend , who could no longer contain himself , rejoined , in his good-natured way , " Why , my dear sir , I am an American , and am not regarded by my friends as over-size , and you will pardon me if I should think that you were an - equally fair example of Englishmen . " The conversation was of course soon turned , for this argumentum ad hominem was not to be resisted . Whatever we may say of the argument , it was as conclusive as such arguments generally are . The Englishman was as fair an example of his countrymen as our champion was of Americans ; but if all Americans were like him , we should soon " whip the world , " and if all Englishmen were like the Cambridge Fellow , they would probably bluster less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AngloSaxon race is very much the same in both countries . The yeomanry of England will compare very well with the farmers and backwoodsmen of America , and the American professional men and scholars with the same class in England . There is this advantage , however , in favor of England , that she has a privileged class , who , not obliged to work either with body or mind , are able to spend most of their time in hunting , fishing , boating , and other athletic exercises in the open air , and it is with this class that the unfavorable comparison to ourselves is most generally made . At the other end of the scale , however , we have the advantage , in that our artisans are better clothed and fed , and less worked , than those of England . What is true of the men is also true , in general , of the // women . Yet here again England has the advantage , in so far as her women of the higher classes are more accustomed to out-of-door exercise than ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education of girls are becoming prevalent , it may be hoped that even this difference will disappear . Rosy cheeks can be produced only by temperate habits and out-of-door exercise , while fashionable dissipation or a sedentary life will blanch the face as well on one side of the Atlantic as on the other . A large part of Mr. Trollope 's volume is devoted to the details of our government , both State and national , and many of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States are discussed at length , and in some cases are severely criticised . So far as we can see , the discussion , although of course conducted from an English point of view , appears to be fair and candid , and the tree is judged by its fruits . Unfortunately , the most serious allegations can not be denied . It is too true that our present form of government differs in most important particulars from that which the fathers of the republic intended to frame , and that the innovations have been almost invariably for the worse . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general government had become corrupt throughout all its functions ; that lobbying , which means simply bribery , had become a part of the recognized machinery of legislation ; that the whole patronage of the government had been used for political intrigues ; and that the grossest frauds had become common in high places . It is further true , that important offices of state were so generally filled by men of mean capacity and questionable honesty , that the very name of politician had become a term of opprobrium and reproach . We can not deny these facts . Alas ! we are paying the penalty of our national sins . But if the precious blood which has been and will be shed can purchase our political redemption , the price can not be too dear . We have no heart to follow Mr. Trollope in his discussion of these subjects . Our ship of state is now stranded , and all hands are at work trying to get her off . This is no time to discuss how we could have avoided the shoals . But if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to us with most solemn earnestness ; and , // if we do not then profit by our experience , our prospects will be dark indeed . This article has already reached an undue length ; but we can not close without noticing in a few words Mr. Trollope 's views of the cause of the present war , and its probable issue . Mr. Trollope has discovered that slavery is the sole cause of the struggle , and that the North could not have avoided the war without national dishonQr , - a fact on which almost the whole English nation have wilfully and resolutely shut their eyes . " I must acknowled* , e it to be my opinion , that slavery in its various bearings has been the single and necessary cause of the war ; that , slavery being there in the South , this war was only to be avoided b*r a voluntary division , - secession voluntary both on the part of North and South ; that , in the event of such voluntary secession being not asked for , or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became necessary , - were not to be avoided by any wisdom or care on the part of the North . " - p. 338 . Having discussed the now almost forgotten question of the right of secession , and shown how monstrous such an assumption was , and having also shown that " the reasons put forward by the South for secession have been trifling almost beyond conception , " Mr. Trollope continues - " I have said that the reasons given for secession have been trifling , and among theta have so estimated this matter of the Fugitive Slave Law . I mean to assert that the ground actually put forward is trifling ; - the loss , namely , of slaves to which the South has been subjected . But the true reason pointed at in this - the conviction , namely , that the North would not leave slavery alone , and would not allow it to remain as a settled institution - was by no means trifling . It has been this conviction on the part of the South , that the North would not live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under this banner or under that , would still condemn it as disgraceful to man , and rebuke it as impious before God , which has produced rebellion and civil war , and will ultimately produce that division for which the South is fighting , and against which the North is fighting , and which , when accomplished , will give the North new wings , and will leave the South without political greatness or commercial success . " - p. 345. // although secondary , was nevertheless the immediate cause of the war , and he traces out very briefly , but , as we believe , with general accuracy , our political history for the last fifty years , dwelling on the means which have been used by the South to retain their ascendency in the government , and showing that , although partially successful , they in the long run had been overborne by the increasing numerical preponderance of the North , and with it , of course , of Northern sentiments also . " In that way , " he continues , " the South has lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but at last that will became too strong , and when Mr. Lincoln was elected , the South knew that its day was over . " " Such , according to my ideas , have been the causes of the war . But I can not defend the South . As long as they could be successful in their schemes for holding the political power of the nation , they were prepared to hold by the nation . Immediately those schemes failed , they were prepared to throw the nation overboard . In this there has undoubtedly been treachery as well as rebellion . Had these politicians heen honest , - though the political growth of Washington has hardly admitted of political honesty , - but had these politicians been even ordinarily respectable in their dishonesty , they would have claimed secession openly before Congress , while yet their own President was at the White House . Congress would not have acceded . Congress itself could not have acceded under the Constitution ; but a way would have been found , had the Southern States been persistent in their demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has lain through fire and water , through blood and ruin , through treason and theft , and the downfall of national greatness . Secession will , I think , be accomplished , and the Southern Confederation of States will stand something higher in the world than Mexico and the republics of Central America . Her cotton monopoly will have vanished , and her wealth will have been wasted . " I think that history will agree with me in saying that the Northern States had no alternative but war . What concession could they make ? Could they promise to hold their peace about slavery ? And had they so promised , would the South have believed them ? They might have conceded secession ; that is , they might have given all that would have been demanded . But what individual chooses to yield to such demands ; and if not an individual , - then what people will do so ? But in truth they could not have yielded all that was demanded . Had secession been granted to South Carolina and Georgia , Virginia would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of her property , and with Vir* , inia Maryland would have gone , and Washington , the capital . What may be the future line of division between the North and the South I will not pretend to say ; but that line will probably be dictated by the North . It may still be hoped that Missouri , Kentucky , Virginia , and Maryland will go with the North , and be rescued from slavery . But had secession been yielded , had the prestige of success fallen to the lot of the South , those States must have become south ern. " - pp. 352 , 353 . We have made these copious extracts in order to show how very fairly Mr. Trollope has treated the subject which now , of all others , most concerns us . Had the English press generally been one half as just , we could have borne the neutrality and want of sympathy of her governing classes . While , however , we thank Mr. Trollope for his evident sympathy with the Northern cause , ( and such sympathy from an Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion for gratitude , ) we are sorry to find that he fails to see , certainly fails to state , the true moral significance of the present struggle . Slavery is not merely a bad political system , tyrannical and oppressive to the enslaved , and one which , therefore , Northern freemen can not abide . It has a moral aspect which is vastly worse . It has degraded the masters even more than the slaves , and has produced in Southern society moral corruption which can be compared only with the worst days of Greece and Rome . Decency forbids us to dwell on the subject ; but unfortunately the facts are too well known in this community to require recital , even if this were the proper place . Mrs. Stowe 's novel , as eloquent and graphic as it is , does not tell half the truth . It exposes the cruelty and moral wrongs to which the system subjects the blacks ; but , as bad as these are , they are not its worst evils . Cruelty in this world may be compensated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons which the gifted author has so touchingly drawn in the character of Uncle Tom ; but the moral degradation of the master , what hope can we have of that ? Would that the corrupting influences of slavery could have remained with him . But , unfortunately , they had insinuated themselves everywhere . They had poisoned all the springs of // political action , and through these the government itself had become corrupt to its core , - North as well as South ; for we have no desire to shield the North . The original sin was with the South ; but the Northern political leaders who have been consenting to it and abetting it are as guilty as they , and we are now learning , to our bitter cost , that slavery is so vile that no one can touch it without being defiled . Like a cancer , it had been slowly doing its deadly w rk for years before the nation was aroused to its danger . But even then the North never thought of acting in an unconstitutional way . Before the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it failed , and for the next four years the disease increased with fearful rapidity . Then came the election of Mr. Lincoln . The North asserted its rights , and the South revolted . This is the simple story . We are now fighting to put down rebellion . The integrity of the government requires it , and it would lose all respect both at home and abroad if it allowed such treason to go unpunished . Our duty and our safety alike require us to sustain the government in the present crisis ; but who does not see that what gives the bitterness and persistency to the war is not the question whether one or the other State may secede , but whether slavery , with all its attending vices , is to rule on this coiitinent , or not ? Let us of the North not forget the true issues of this contest , or fail to keep them before the world . Our danger is that political intriguers will endeavor to blind our eyes by side issues , and divide us among ourselves . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future unless we are on our guard . We can not hope to prevail , unless we keep our great end in view . Let us then remember that we are fighting the decisive battle of civilization in the West , and that the one question is , whether freedom or slavery shall rule this continent ; for one or the other must rule the whole ; and as surely as the Mississippi flows into the Gulf , slavery will rule us if we do not rule it . We must not expect the sympathy of England in this contest , or waste our energy in idle words because we do not get it . England hates negro slavery ; but she hates our // republican institutions more ; and we can not expect that she will do more for us than she did for Poland , ll*ungary , or Italy . We must wage the conflict alone ; but then we shall have the more glory if we conquer . In conclusion , we must again express the gratification which Mr. Trollope 's book has afforded us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England as it undoubtedly will be here , for if it is , it will certainly do good by correcting in some quarters prejudices which only an Englishman could reach . In his introduction he says , " It has been the ambition of my literary life to write a book about the United States , " and he seems evidently anxious to do away with the impression produced in America by his mother 's scurrility , although , with a son 's delicacy , he does his best to guard her reputation . He writes - " Thirty years ago my mother wrote a book about the Americans , to which I believe I may allude as a well-known and successful work without being *uilty of any undue family conceit . That was essentially a woman 's book . She saw with a woman 's keen eye , and described with a woman 's light but graphic pen the social defects and absurdities which our near relatives had adopted into their domestic life . All that she told was worth the tellin * , and the telling , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am satisfied that it did so . But she did not regard it as a part of her work to dilate on the nature and operation of those political arrangements which had produced the social absurdities which she saw , or to explain that , though such absurdities were the natural result of those arrangements in their newness , the defects would certainly pass away , while the political arrangements , if good , would remain . Such a work is fitter for a man than for a woman . " - pp. 1 , 2 . We can only add , that , if we are to have a series of Trollope commentators , we hope that the next may be as great an improvement on our friend as he is on his mother .
