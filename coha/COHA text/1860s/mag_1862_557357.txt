1862 . ORNAMENT IN NATURE AND ART . ART . II . - The Art Journal . New Series . Vol . VIII . Nos. 85-88 . January-April , 1862 . London : James S. Virtue . ART is , after all , the business of our century , and war but a passing incident . Christian civilization has reached too great proportions and momentum to be staggered by any shock of arms . In our Northern United States , hardly a sight or sound indicates that the pursuits of peace have been interrupted by our national convulsion . Art and arms are not antithetical . War has its industries and *sthetics , its pomp and circumstance . If murder be a fine art , as De Quincey argues , much more so is war , with its elaborate tools and trappings . Indeed , the artistic in military affairs , from the monstrous crests and rude arms of olden time , down to the forage-cap and rifle of to-day , would form a voluminous history . With the January number of the time-honored London Art Journal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new series of engravings on steel , and with the April number commences an illustrated catalogue of the British International Exhibition of 1862 . The illustrations , like those of the catalogue of 1851 , will no doubt be drawn largely from ornamental art , in the limited sense of the term , and will be regarded by most persons with idle curiosity , or with only a commercial eye , perhaps with but the trifling attention that may be given to the needlework patterns in a lady 's magazine . To others , the catalogue and the event it chronicles will have a deep and manifold interest . The International Exhibition now open emphatically recalls the world 's attention to art , and , by striking associations , to some dark events of the last ten years . Our minds are carried back to the original Crystal Palace , then a new architectural wonder , hailed as a splendid symbol of the reign of Victoria and universal peace . Should man , now that he had built the glass house of the proverb , throw stones any more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , henceforth bear a quiet sway supreme ? // " Her court was pure ; her life serene ; God gave her peace ; her land reposed ; A thousand claims to reverence closed In her as mother , wife , and queen . " She brought a great design to pass , When Europe and our scattered ends Of our fierce world were mixt as friends And brethren in her halls of glass ; " And statesmen at her council met Who knew the seasons , when to take Occasion by the hand , and make The bounds of freedom broader yet . " By the recent death of the Prince Consort , - one of the most active promoters of the World 's Fair of 1831 , and the originator of its international breadth of plaii , - the queen is no longer wife ; nor has her empire kept its repose , Europe its friendly peace , and the fierce world its brotherhood . After Tennyson 's Ode to Victoria , just quoted , the next poem of his that we remember to have seen was the war-song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was doing battle in India and China . And her statesmen , - have they , during three years past , met in council to seize occasion for enlarging the bounds of freedom in Italy , in Mexico , in the United States ? No sharp questions need be asked , only the sad contrasts noted between the peaceful visions of poetry and the turbulent course of time . And so it will continue to be , in spite of commerce and art , iu spite of World 's Fairs and pacific queens , until Christianity has worked out the elevation and enfranchisement of every class , the extinction of every oligarchy , in this sense " putting down all rule and all authority and power . " Oppression is chronic war , and alone leads to outbreaking war ; and class privilege is chronic oppression . Not " the Empire , " but a universal and eiihighitened democracy alone " is peace . " When they intelligently rule everywhere whose pursuits and interests are those of peace , then , in Tennyson 's words , " the common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the kindly earth shall slumber , lapt in universal law . " // The Southern rebellion , and the attitude of Europe toward the United States , have much to do with manufactures and commerce , and these have everything to do with that aspect of art which is indicated in the title of this article , " Ornament in Nature and Art . " Not the lighter graces only of Nature , not merely some frivolous appendages to man 's work , are embraced in this topic . By ornament , as will hereafter be explained , we mean all in the properties and construction of any object which goes beyond its bare necessity , and is fitted to produce an agreeable effect , especially as related to other objects . The economical relations of the subject render it one of great importance . Less than two years ago , nearly two millions of dollars were shipped in one day from New York for Europe , mostly to pay for beauty which might have been created at home , and which the Europeans have the wisdom to study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped must be added all exports not of manufactured articles , and not counterbalanced by imports of food and raw material . The old proverb of the Continent has held true of us , after losing much of its force in respect to England , - " The stranger buys of the Englishman the skin of the fox for a groat , and sells him the tail for a shilling . " The South and the West have borne to the Northeastern States very much the same relation which the whole country has sustained to other lands . Even an axe-helve , it is said , must go North to be manufactured , to receive its perfect curves and smooth finish from Yankee machinery . Proverbially , rocky New England is prosperous for the immediate reason that it is the work-shop of this continent ; and it is such , not in view of its large manufacturing towns only , but because many a house , many a home , is a factory , - many a woman o* child is a skilful artisan on her or his own account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , are noble testimonies to the value of a multiplicity of arts , - in the latter city carried on to a great extent by capitalists of foreign birth , as well as by foreign workmen . What may not be hoped from these sources of wealth , when cities have been built on pins , fortunes accumulated on dolls ' eyes , and states enriched by wooden toys ? // The ornamental arts are still more significant in reference to the diffusion and increase of human happiness . The beauty of a work is more than half the joy of its production . Moreover , few persons can give much time to music , painting , and the like , while all are continually surrounded with that universal art which is civilization itself , in its materiality . Rising up and sitting down , at home or abroad , in the street or in the cultivated country , we can hardly see or touch anything that is not a piece of human art , and as such either truly or falsely designed , and well or ill finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to human work as their constant visible object of contemplation , entering largely into the formative influences that mould their character and the daily elements that make up their happiness , be they producers , as the most are , or only observers . Everything that pertains to a household , for example , is a work of art , not wonderful only because familiar . The princes of the Japanese embassy , while in New York , examined a large stock of hardware , and purchased nothing but a quantity of tin plates ; had they been savages , they would even have decorated themselves with these plates . A tin cup is one of the humblest things that concern us ; yet it is as truly an instance of ornamental design as a golden goblet ; it has the fundamental elements of beauty ; it exhibits the straight line , the circle , angles , the cylinder or cone , proportion , graduated light and shade , surface finish , and perhaps in its handle the infinite curves and infinite shadings which are the secret of most perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer well remarks : " We are beginning to understand that art is not painting , is not sculpture , merely , but a much larger matter , embracing , with architecture as the mistress , every department of technic production , on the results of which aesthetic meaning may be impressed . " For the sake of daily human enjoyment , therefore , we should educate ourselves rightly to produce , select , and enjoy that workmanship which is common . Not many can so much as see , still fewer can possess , the great works of man 's hand , pictorial or sculptural ; all may be environed with the beautiful . The highest argument for the arts of design is more dis // tinctly Christian . One of the grandest features of Christian civilization is an expansion of the former luxuries of the few into the comfort and blessing of the many . In nothing more strikingly than in this is the elevating and equalizing power of the Gospel shown . Imprudence and extravagance , into which the comparatively poor sometimes run , is but an incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious thankfulness at seeing a mechanic 's home better carpeted and as well furnished in every way as were once the rooms of princes , and little less luxuriously than are now the houses of the rich . The silks and velvets of an industrious Irish girl , exchanged for the squalor of a Galway hut , or the rags of an immigrant 's American shanty , and as costly as the dress of her mistress , are among the most manifest tokens of the kingdom come and coming . He who can see their bright hues fluttering along the street on a Sunday , and not feel like singing a metre of the seventy-second Psalm , is blind to the signs of " the latter-day glory . " Furthermore , it is peculiarly Christian to find nobility and dignity in that which is common , such as the most ordinary appliances of civilized life , even as it is in the same spirit to love and exalt the poor and the outcast . One of the Prophets does not consider it beneath his theme to close his long , sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he crowns his Messianic vision by saying , " In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses Holiness to the Lord , and the pots of the Lord 's house shall be like the bowls before the altar , " - in other words , the least things shall not only be consecrated by the spirit of piety , but also ( may we not add ? ) by the spirit of Divine beauty , investing the very pots of the kitchen with something of the grace that shapes the golden bowls of the altar , and harmonizing all external life with the moral glory of a reformed world , - symbolizing , too , the spirit of the Gospel , which magnifies the humble , and lifts up the degraded . As already hinted , we have to rid ourselves of the thought that ornament is some gewgaw , some frippery , pinned on or nailed on something else , and which might as well be put off as put on . Many individuals , thus poorly apprehending it , . despise the whole matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ornament , and its intense derivative word adorn , originally mean to beautify , and embrace not only adjuncts , but all which exceeds the primary purpose and necessity of a thing , and is adapted to produce a pleasurable effect , especially of a relative sort . Throw together a mass of discolored materials , without order ; if they be made to enclose a habitable space , protected from wind and rain , you have a house . But if the materials be put together with but the slightest reference to form , hue , or to appearance as involved in situation , the structure at once begins to partake of the ornamental . This quality attaches itself to whatever may be properly said to have shape , color , or place . Color and curve adorn a carved leaf ; the leaf , a moulding ; the moulding , a cornice ; the cornice , a house ; the house , a landscape ; the landscape , a world ; the world , a universe ; yea , the whole universe is but a jewel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made when form is thought of simply in respect to mechanical and scientific exigencies ; but this distinction may be dropped , since there is such a thing as " functional beauty , " and since all beauty springs from the root of use . All that rightly adorns , as will yet be shown , is a blossoming forth of essential nature , an outfiash of essential being . In popular language , the distinction may also be dropped which limits the term decoration to adjuncts , and embellishment to finish . It is evident , then , that ornament , in its worthiest sense , includes all beauty , namely , as regarded in certain relations ; that it enters into the very idea of civilization , and of any cosmos , as opposed to chaos ; that it is not this or that piece of superfluous finery stuck upon something and as well slipped off , but is a light and character in which all things may be considered . Manifestly the idea embraces all the art of nature and of man . We speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gold-leaf , or a marble tassel ; but the greatest art-critic has wisely said , ( we condeuse his language , ) that " the only essential distinction between decorative and other art is the being fitted for a place , and in that place related to the effect of other pieces of art . The best sculpture yet produced has been the decoration of a temple-front , the best painting the decoration of a room . Raphael 's best doing // is merely the wall-coloring of a suite of apartments , and his cartoons were made for tapestries . Titian and Veronese threw out their noblest thoughts , not even on the inside , but on the outside of the common brick and plaster walls of Venice . " We are partly prepared now to reply to certain objections and fallacies , - partly , inasmuch as the whole subject , as it often happens , is the full answer . The most respectable prejudice against the ornamental arts is the would-be Biblical , - a strange one , for it runs counter to the economy of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New . The most common temptation to excess of ornament is offered in dress , no doubt ; and it is in this connection that the Bible utters an express caution . Yet we are encouraged to believe that God will much more clothe us than the martagon lily , the royally scarlet petals of which are so reflexed into an Oriental turban , or the arches of a modern crown , that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as splendidly . It may be urged that all decoration is none the less enfiladed by the apostolic warning , to wit , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with sobriety ; not with broidered hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array . We reply , that it is a precept to adorn , not the contrary , and that it regulates only the spirit of adornment . Taken , as all Scripture should be taken , not narrowly in the letter , but broadly in the spirit , it is aimed , not at nature 's own gold and pearls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious substances named being rather the glowing imagery than the object of the Apostle's* thought , and perhaps the Asiatic imagination creating both the peculiar need and the language of the caution . If here , as elsewhere , the Apostle 's diction was richly broidered , even when he was discoursing of temperance in dress , much more would the " weaker vessels " be tempted to magnificence of attire . The most abject literalist must at last confess that long hair is as obviously fit to be plaited as silk is to be woven , and that pearls and gold were meant to be ornamental ; and that these are no more to be wholly cut off and discarded , than the right hand is literally to be cut off , or the coat formally surrendered when the cloak is taken away . // It is very significant that the New Testament simply restrains one class of persons , and that in respect only to personal use of the arts of decoration . Another victim of the same prejudice is the religious temple . But if the truths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that man is the true temple , forbid the costly and beautiful in Christian architecture , with equal force these truths prohibit the plainest house of prayer . The spirituality of Christianity is the antithesis simply of evil passions , and heartless religion , and a low morality ; its simplicity is not opposed to complexity of art and of thought , but to guile and false philosophy . The high qualities mentioned are , in fact , antagonistic to this mole-eyed interpretation , which would belittle and materialize the Scriptures into teaching a gospel , not of Christian life , but of architecture poor in spirit , of humble steeples , of meek carpets , of mournful coats , of penitent bonnets , and , if possible , of faded roses , and songless birds . The final reign of Christianity is rather pictured in all the magnificence of a city walled with jewels ; and " they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it , " not exclude that glory and honor . In the name of religion or morality , still other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too brief and solemn for the arts of beauty , and that works of duty and charity demand all our time and resources . But is life too short and serious , are duty and charity too exacting , for the great multitude of laborers to earn their bread by work that is and must be decorative in no small degree ? - to earn it , too , in the spirit of a dull , mechanical task , producing false and lifeless art , whereas , if they and others were to give thought and heart to the subject , their toil might be education and joy to them , to all ? True seriousness , true benevolence , should not overlook considerations so palpable and weighty . To a like plausible fallacy , that the arts of embellishment lead to corruption of manners and of faith , we reserve a reply , only remarking that Christianity inspires to high civilization , and its ecclesiastical annals point to enough clear causes of its debasement without numbering the arts among them , - only repeating , also , the sentiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have all the good music . // ORNAMENT IN NATURE AND ART . The exception taken in the name of beauty itself is more subtile , namely , that beauty unadorned is adorned the most , an adage which every artist , every woman , knows to be false , except as it goes against ill-jndged ornament . There is no line nor tint the loveliness of which is not dependent on accessories , and may not be enhanced by a studied disposition of the same . But , granting the literal truth of the proverb , to what does beauty owe its beauty if not to its own ornate qualities ? We hardly need pause to notice other fallacies , such as those which assume the name of simplicity , economy , utility . The human body , the most glorious of all visible objects , is a living answer ; nothing is more truly simple , economical , useful ; nothing more exquisitely beautified by the hand of God , - every detail of beauty growing out of utility , indeed . A scarecrow is not the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economy , and utility is not mere bread and butter . All possible prejudice in this matter of ornament is a setting up of the false against the true , or a lower good against a higher , and is to be excused only so far as it is excited by meretricious display . To treat with disdain the idea of ornament , to depreciate it , is a curling of the lip at the universe itself . It is , in fact , the distorting of a feature of the face , which , like every other feature , is not squared nor rounded by gross simplicity , not left colorless or neutral in tint , not projected on the mechanical principles of low economy and utility , but is a wonderful complication of every flowing line and graduated shade of beauty , and tinged with all depths of red , from the carnation of the high light to the dark crimson of the shadow , as if Nature had spent all her art in its ornamentation , - that is to say , if , in the presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapen , it is not to be supposed that a deformity would be thrust into notice even to express contempt , so that the very act , if ventured on , is a virtual surrender of the question . The universe , every inch of it , is enriched with the most finished and prodigal adorning , - every atom , if we descend into the microscopic world . If we accept the received opin-6* // July , ion that external nature was degraded and disordered by the first shock of human sin , or that it was from the beginning conformed to a prospective history of sin and death , still whatever significance nature has in this direction must be regarded as an expressiveness finely worked out in every detail by Divine art ; so that each seeming instance of earth 's imperfection and woe , pointing to man 's , is at the worst but as the beautiful inverted torch sculptured on tombs , or the broken column or broken flower , carefully designed as such by the sculptor , for sepulchral monument and tablet . There are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why there seems to be some lack or discord in the garniture of nature ; and every reason implies an exceeding appreciation of beauty in the mind of the Creator , not an undervaluation of it at all ; so that , in this world of thorns and thistles , out of the very nettle - supposed neglect - we pluck the flower of beauty . Is there , in nature , that which we call desolation ? It will be found a finished picture , so intricate that no artist can copy it all . The most barren rock , the bleakest coast , is an infinite mystery of charming form and color . Nature so loves ornament that she drapes and embroiders ruin itself and stains it with her mellowest hues , often her richest ; she makes haste , indeed , to throw over the crumbling works of man a pall of mossy velvet and gold . Are there great blanks , as we deem them , of bark and body , of cliff , plain , and sea ? Here and there power is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distantly seen is not to be broken up ; yet those masses are full of charming detail , every part of them is costly mosaic . Further , there is a unity in creation , which , like all unity , is of things similar , - in a sense monotonous , - as in the waves and colors of the sea , the leaves and colors of a landscape ; and that unity is a heightening , not a lowering , of beauty ; there is no true variety even but in such unity . Is there , nevertheless , much quietness in the general effects of nature , and in many individual effects ? Chasteness and sobriety are not the absence of embellishment , rather a manner of it ; the absence is poverty and dead vacancy , abhorrent to nature . This character , also , disappears on close // examination ; the homeliest sparrow , no less than a bird of paradise , is a wonder of color in every feather and of grace in every filament ; the quiet sky , in every point of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole is arched and graduated in tint , in every part ; a dull November or March landscape , to those who have learned to see , is a marvel of exquisite grays , purples , and browns , as well as a wonderful net-work of naked stems . But , is it said , thus are actual , shapeless blotches on almost everything ? They are often necessary , as IRuskin observes , to show the loveliness of color , which is best seen when separated from form ; as , for example , when dashed across the plumage of birds , without regard to the shape or direction of the feathers . Is it affirmed that there is positive inferiority in many created things ? It is an inferiority in degrees of beauty , rather than absence of the quality ; and the reasons for it exalt the quality , instead of cheapening it . In those animals , and other objects , which symbolize to us the appetites and passions , or the unpleasant realities of life , there should be fewer elements of the agreeable , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well argues , all things that are inferior in office , likewise , would degrade beauty if largely endowed with it . Of this class , for example , are nature 's scavengers . But the glorious reason is , that , by degrees of the beautiful , God would teach us the very idea , unrecognized if all things were equally lovely : by degrees , as by a stairway , he would invite , incite , and lead us upward in the knowledge and reproduction of the beautiful . For the rest , admitting that the Creator always illustrates in his own work the great law of moderation , it may be affirmed that the world is the very perfection of beauty , viewed as consistent with the moral and other ends proposed in its constitution . His work can not but be perfect , for its pdrpose . When any man has exhausted Nature , has done more than to recombine her glories in his imaginings , has conceived something different and better , then may there be reason to talk of a physical perfection not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if the visible creation had been formed for beauty alone , it would not have been made other // than it is , certainly not as the first stage of our existence . We have no reason to believe that the physical elements of heaven itself are not all present in this scene of being , differently combined . And for all that seems exceptional in this scene , our argument has still one reserved thought ; it is that Nature may designedly indulge in what are called her " rests and monotones , " may even interpose discords to emphasize the very harmonies of her loveliness and grandeur . Let it be repeated , therefore , that every inch of the universe is enriched with the most finished and prodigal adorning possible , under any given circumstances . Flowers and sunsets are not exceptions ; lavish beauty and delicate detail are the rule . If we look at plain granite , it is as if its variant mixtures of white , black , and rose crystals were the one thing worth attending to ; and yet the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at leaves , - the sober accompaniments of blossoming snow and ripened sunshine , - it is as if the mere notching of leaves were the one matter of great importance in Nature 's estimation ; yet there are twelve hundred varieties of the lily tribe to be looked after , to say nothing of a hundred thousand species of plants . If we turn to the animal world , it is as if all things were to be neglected rather than the polishing and gilding of a poor beetle 's wings ; yet there are eighty thousand known species of insects , not to mention two hundred and fifty thousand kinds of animals . Moreover , not one individual rock , plant , animal , not one foot of land , wave of sea , film of cloud , is to be slighted . So it is , from the gorgeous tropics to the sable and eider , the bergs and auroras of the arctic , misnamed desolate ; and from the sparry depths of caves , and coral abysses of the ocean , to the moss on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses to be wholly untouched with beauty ; not a tooth but must be of carved ivory . Nor is anything too perishable to be worthy of precious ornature ; the bloom that endures but for a night , is painted as if to last forever . Nothing is too evanescent to receive the finest touches of grace ; surf and vapor are as perfect as if they were not to change instantly and glide away . Nothing is too far out of man 's sight to be elaborately finished ; every berry of the wilderness or // prism of the sealed rock is carefully manipulated as if for a world 's fair . Nor is it enough that Nature 's decorations are beautiful ; they overflow the brim of beauty often , and run into the quaint , the grotesque , the grand , as if through mere excess of decorative fancy and energy ; the ornamental smile of creation broadens into humor , and even into what may be termed the playful-terrible . And all these original phenomena of things are not enough ; every transformation by man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or coloring ; the very tints and lustres of our daily food might well so ravish the sight as to stay the appetite . Nay , exuberant Nature is not satisfied when man changes her from glory to glory ; she is ever attiring herself anew in every growth and process . The seasons bring each its wonders , and together they continually turn that mighty prism of the year which successively tinges a zone with the delicate azure of snow , the tender green of spring , the gold of harvest , the fiery reds of autumn , thus throwing upon the earth in regular order the most observable hues of the solar spectrum . To crown all , night and day , reflection and shadow and breeze , are forever playing with shape and tint , so that the tuft of cherry-leaves nodding at your window is a little universe of ever-varying and numberless curves and colors and lights , not content with its own opaque green , but momently borrowing shade from the earth , mellow brown from the adjacent building , warm glow from transparency , sheen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue from the sky . In truth , so changeful are the aspects of sea and sky , that , every instant , we have everywhere a new universe , revealing itself suddenly , and then vanishing , never precisely to reappear . If there be any place where they would find a fit home , who disparage the beautiful and ornate , it is a desert of sand ; yet even there every grain of sand is a jewel , the mirage glimmers like a dream of Eden , the sky at morning and evening makes itself royal ; even there the Artesian well they must sink would overflow the sands with emerald , the corn they must plant would wave its purple plumes , and trees would spring into arches and crowns . Nature further pleads for the arts of embellishment in the // voice of human instinct . It can not be said that , while it is well for Omnipotence to adorn , it is not for man to do his best , or to do much , in this line of effort . God himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful . It is a well-proven fact , that the first thought of the untutored savage is to decorate himself , his instruments , and his rude shelter . In the order of nature the ornamental comes before the useful . Every step of civilization is an advance in the same order ; the high-backed , stately carved chair , comes before the luxurious fautenil . Instinct is on the side of embellishment ; and so , too , is that great natural law in vindication of which the gravest and most reverend authorities might be cited , showing how closely the elegances of life are connected with manners and morals . Passing by this tempting branch of the subject , let it only be observed that the earth is receiving modifications on a stupendous scale , by the sciences and machineries of this century ; and the question left to us is , shall man replace and reproduce natural beauty in his works , or displace and destroy ? Shall he make or mar ? By way of giving a more practical turn to the subject , and further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamentation may be added . In the absence of any work , within our reach or knowledge , that is both systematic and exhaustive in respect to such principles , we can only gather a few of them here and there , mostly from the voluminous writings of liuskin . First , as to form and color . In the words of the author just named , " the first necessity of beauty in color is gradation , as the first necessity of beauty of line is curvature ; the second necessity in color is mystery and subtilty , as the second necessity of line is softness . " He adds , " The finer the eye for color , the less it will require to gratify it intensely . " These remarks are founded in deep philosophy . The flowing line , the shaded delicate or indescribable tint , or combination of tints , involve that grand law of beauty , proportion , and that grander law , infinity , the attribute of the God of whose being beauty is the reflex . In nature , it has been noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves , still fewer raw or unrefined // colors ; and many things that seem to have these qualities will be found to have them only in a comparative degree . Owen Jones lays down the principle , that the straight line , the inclined , and the circle , are to be combined always to balance one another , - that is , we suppose , when any one of these elements is so present as to give character to a composition ; and he further decides that all junctions of curves with curves or with straight lines should be tangential . But there is no space here to give in detail the principles of ornamental composition , nor so much as to enter upon the complicated and interesting subject of color , one of the most neglected or else most misunderstood of all arts . The next and most commanding principle is that decoration should grow out of the mass , and be expressive of function , whenever this is possible . Use should be the root , ornament the branch and bloom . Thus the original projections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinguishing features of the Grecian cornice ; the feet of Egyptian chairs , in fanciful reference to their use , were carved as lion 's paws . It is the manner of Nature . Every undulation of the body is founded on some hidden muscle or bone . The human ear , because the beautiful shape is allied to the function of the ear , is wrought into a sea-shell ; the eyelashes , necessary to protect the eye , are a fringed curtain , admirable for beauty as well as in office . In art , the happiest lines are often positively necessitated by use , not merely suggested thereby , as in the form of a scythe-handle , a ploughshare , a ship . The associations of use , likewise , may govern the embellishment , as in the marine figures of a fountain . Above all , the entire shape of a thing should spring from its central idea , its heart . The farm-house , according to the doctrine of architectural books , has its centre and heart in the great farm laboratory , the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouped all parts of the house . This heart of a thing , as well as the living spirit and inner necessity that breathe in all true form and decoration , justifies an accommodated use which has been made of the words , " Whose adorning , let it not be that outward adorning , but let it be the hidden man of the heart . " Thus would unity of design be secured , no less than expressiveness. // A third principle is , that ornament may be conventional , or must be so under certain circumstances and conditions . This conventionality , at which a semi-educated taste sometimes revolts , is not altogether unnatural and sophisticated . It is affirmed that ornament in the early and purest ages of art is always conventional . A child 's first attempts at drawing are in the conventional or abstract style , however rude . An irregular circle , with a smaller circle superimposed , two lateral straight lines and two descending ones projecting from the lower circle , and two dots placed in the upper , that is a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom in it than we think . Nature can not , or should not , always be followed closely in art . Material forbids it , as in the sculpturing of waves or delicate flowers ; the general effect may be given , but anything more is either a failure or a piece of trickery that denies the material . Wall-paper may give suggestions of foliage , not close imitations , which the materials and process preclude ; blue leaves of unexampled form , connected by impossible branches , are a wise confession of inability , and of a purpose , limited by conditions , only to hang pleasing color on a tracery of hinted vegetation . Position often forbids ; for instance , where a high or an obscure place renders everything invisible but a rough outline ; or where a flat surface demands flat patterns : the flowers and other figures of a carpet should not be so perfectly wrought that we are led to believe ourselves crushing down flowers at every step , or walking on a prostrate trellis . Office , again , prohibits a too naturalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail in the embellishment of a barn or a gross utensil . So also color may call for conventionality . In drapery , the prominence of the idea of color , as well as the flowing and folding of the material , protest against a close imitation of nature in the forms and colors of the figure . In general , the more perfect the form , where the form is advantageously seen , the less perfect should be the color . Geometric patterns may be very vivid ; a vine in outline less so ; a vine in sculptured relief should be left as simple marble or wood ; it would belie nature and itself if stained , whether or not in natural hues . Conventionality is further recommended by the subordination of // parts to a whole ; by the nature of some ornamentation as mere signs and symbols ; by the perishableness of certain substances as material for human work ; by the personal use of the decoration ; and by the repetitious character of the figure , the repetition demanding a less amount of organic form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of realization . Such are some of the eternal laws of fitness that regulate even the patterns of calico . A fourth principle is honesty . All falsehoods and shams ought to be avoided . The innocent lie is the worst , in effect if not in intention , because the most common , the most insinuating , the least observed , and the least excused by temptation , whereas the black and malicious lie is at once detected and abhorred . The world is continually in danger of being frozen and buried under a snow-fall of soft white lies , sifting in at every crevice , blinding every eye , covering up all truth , and smothering all life . Painted imitations of wood and stone are enough to mention as illustrations . There are exceptions to the general rule , doubtless , that could be justified by worthy reasons ; gilding is thought to be an instance , since it is gold , and does not pretend to be solid . Another law of ornament is , that it should not be largely associated with scenes of care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor with anything disagreeable . We have seen a drugstore more expensively and elegantly fitted up with cabinets of carved wood , than possibly any private library in the world . The more beautiful the work and material , the more objectionable it is in such use , because associated with that which is not only prosaic , but unpleasant . Just indignation has been expressed at the use of the choicest Greek mouldings in drygoods shops , where they are common , cheap , and out of place . The rule applies to dress , furniture , and implement , as well as to building . Decoration , the more so if it be precious , is for scenes of rest , - home , the house of prayer , the place of pleasure , - wherever we have leisure to enjoy it , and delightful or lofty thoughts to link with it , unmingled with trouble and weariness . Moreover , sights have the effect of sounds we want the beautiful to talk to us when we can listen ; we do not want the noise of much form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business and the clatter of work , particularly if the style of decoration be what is well called stunning . But we can not agree with Ruskin that the appurtenances of railroads should be divested of all pleasant art ; there is enough of waiting and rest , recreation and poetry , in railway travelling to justify the ornamentation of stations and cars . A sixth rule is temperance and repose . Children , whenever they begin to play , proverbially never know when to stop . So with that lively child , Fancy . God and Nature have set us a wise example , even in the richest natural effects . Freedom is glorious , but is glorious chiefly because it enters into the idea of self-restraint . There are occasions , however , when man can hardly run to an extreme in a true , not false , ornature . Home should be made as visibly pleasant as possible . Public buildings , representing the collective wealth and wisdom of a community , can hardly be too excellent . The church edifice calls especially for the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more admirable , for example , than the broad , high-reaching , highly sculptured front entrance of the old Gothic churches , throwing wide a passage to all mankind , inviting all with profuse beckonings of beauty , and lifting up the arch for the King of Glory himself to come in ! To him were brought the gold and frankincense , to him the precious box of alabaster . If his simple spirit and polity are sometimes buried under a needless pride and ostentation , it is better that riches be so expended than directly on self . " He made his grave with the rich . " To this enumeration of a few general principles , a fitting rear-guard may be found in the rule that all ornament should be inspired by the study of Nature , and regulated by her immutable laws , though not always a literal copying of her forms . It should convey as much natural truth as possible , consistently with its principles . To this end , each nation should draw from the storehouse of its own familiar scenery . " 0 thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy heart : That is best which lieth nearest ; Shape from that thy work of art . " // bulrush , the papyrus , and the palm . The Greeks adopted their own acanthus and honeysuckle . The Gothic workers selected the oak , ivy , fern , and even the common dock and parsley . It has been well argued that all debasement of art , and all enervation of character in connection with the fine arts , have been through want of sympathy with and adherence to Nature . Certainly both man and his work must be invigorated and ennobled by communion with Nature , and by reproduction of her truths , her freshness , and her loveliness . In this way - this one of the " Two Paths " - ornament would never become " but the gilded shore To a most dangerous sea ; the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty ; in a word , The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest . " Every child , every youth , should learn to draw directly from nature , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying pictures , never copying them if they are not by the great masters of pictorial truth . The visible results of right practice might be little , and worth little ; fond parents might not be able to point visitors to monstrosities framed in gold , and very admirable in the obsolete sense of the word ; but the invisible results of earnest pursuit of the right method would be sublime , - new eyes received , a vast , new world of nature and art revealed , and pure healthfulness of taste and soul inspired . Ruskin 's " Elements of Drawing " goes far to supply the needed guide , but unfortunately refers the student to many things beyond his reach , if not beyond his pecuniary ability also ; and the study of the human figure , recommended by this author as indispensable to excellence and purity in all art , ornamental or more technically fine , requires other manuals . In every institution of learning , the arts of design , especially of decoration , should be taught , both theoretically and practically . Many persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined to be artisans ; many more would have some direct influence on mechanics and manufacturers ; all would be disciplined , would be educated in that most fundamental of all respects , the knowledge of things in distinction from other men 's thoughts about things ; // and all would help to create a right supply in the market , by becoming discreet purchasers , and would aid in many ways the development of that feeling for art which is half the prosperity of any nation . We have mostly adhered to the common and narrow acceptation of the word ornament in stating the above principles . Of course it would be impossible within the limits of this article to attempt a statement of the more frequently discussed principles of those high arts which , as we have seen , are ornamental in their original idea and application . There is ample need of a wider and profounder attention to this whole subject than has ever yet been given ; great need of a systematic , popular , and exhaustive treatise . Other errors may often be impenetrable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to it the mirror of nature . If we were to sum up the greatest and most common violations of the principles of beauty in this land , we should mention cheap extravagance , cheap falsehood , baldness , squareness , and imitative monotony , relieved only by occasional foolish novelty . We are cheap ; we build , make , buy , for the hour , not for permanence . We are , nevertheless , often extravagant and barbarous in taste ; gilding everything to excess , and thus depreciating the preciousness of golden effect ; making small carpets with figures designed for the great halls of the Tuileries , - glaring colors , and roses as large as cabbages ; dresses with spread-eagle patterns ; marble stores like palaces , even furnished with ebony inlaid with mock-gold . We are false ; - every door , wall , pail , grained or marbled , to the obliteration of the truer and more beautiful graining of nature ; every ceiling stuccoed ; the interior of churches covered with trickeries of form and color ; and , until recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied and rich . We are most unnaturally bare and square ; - the men cut and patterned into angles and straight lines , from the top of the hat to the toe of the boot ; the women striped and plaided ; crockery inclining to be angular ; every house an exact cube or parallelopiped ; windows alike and square , and set at regular intervals , not combined , or varied , or projected ; the outer walls blank , with no hint of inner // construction ; the building and blinds raw in color ; the village street forbidden to wind gracefully up and down , hither and thither , but ambitious to be city-like , and graded into eternal levels , and crossing at everlasting right-angles . We are fashionably monotonous and fickle ; - all buildings copies of one another , without regard to owner and use , so that aman hardly knows whether he is entering his neighbor 's house or his own , - if not copied full size , then in miniature , like a martin-cage ; all furniture and dress aspiringly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitative . When the style of anything changes , the entire nation hastens to follow , pellmell . The unsettled problems of the subject , such as the claims of styles , their application to newly-used material , and the merits of hand-work as opposed to that of machinery , must be left untouched , with the single remark , that it seems unwise and useless to bemoan the present confusion of styles , instead of accepting it as either a step-stone or cap-stone to the cosmopolitan character the human race is rapidly assuming . Nor is it in our way now to follow the topic up into the impalpable region of language and music . The marrow and soul of ornament would be lost to us , however , if we were to overlook its sentiment and significance . By this is intended something more than the analogy between the finished graces of art and those of character ; - the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , the cherished parental instruction worn as an ornament of grace unto the head and chains about the neck , the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - these are the realities of which material adornment is the shadow and figure . Nor do we refer to the truth that all ornament is language , and that many ideas and feelings may be conveyed by it , general and specific . The sentiment and meaning of it all , we think , may be summed up in one bright word , - joy , - the joy of life , of superahounding vitality , faculty , power , resource , divine and human , which not only work , but work with will and pleasure , rejoicing and playing over the work , not driven by stern necessity to a labor that looks only to bare necessity and barren utility . To all who have eyes to see , ornament in nature and art is a gospel , - glad tidings of mighty life and inexhaustible resource , in a 7* // word , of infinity , speaking forth in all the work of God and of man , and saying , " I can not only make , I can adorn , and all shall be to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straightway leaping and sparkling into ornament as the fulness of the sea breaks into crests of foam . In this there is perhaps an affirmation and revelation of the immortal superiority of the spiritual to the material , so that even a bit of embroidery or the streak of an apple may be an evangel of all that which Christianity teaches in common with natural religion , not omitting the priceless worth and equal rights of the individual man . Such would be a popular statement of the truth . But the ornamental enters into the very idea of life and of a universe , not alone into the idea of abounding life . Shall we look more deeply into the matter , at the risk of being misty or mystical ? Life , in its simplest aspect , is defined by Guyot as " a mutual exchange of relations , " and he finds it in " the lively actions and reactions , the perpetual play of the forces of matter , " - " its incessant and prodigious activity , " - no less than within the narrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to us so fruitful , none has led to so clear a perception of the essential unity of all great ideas , as well as the correspondence between all departments of being . Indeed , the thought seems to be wrapped up in the derivation of the very word universe . The definition applies to and explains all manner of life , intellectual , social , commercial , moral , Christian , no less than cosmical . But the point is , that life consists in exchange , in action and reaction . And it is evident to all observers that life and beauty most abound together . Where chemical life acts with greatest intensity in mineral elements , there the crystal is born and multiplied in its highest perfection . Where light and heat are most powerfully present , in connection with all vegetable constituents , there are luxuriance and bloom and wealth of color . Where all modes of life , spiritual and other , meet in man , there is the crown of natural forms ; and most lovely when the overflowing vitality of childhood is yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line or color depends on its purity , and purity is synonymous with energy , as Ruskin has shown . It is the presence of weakness , decay , death , that deform and discolor , or simply neutralize all glow and shapeli // ness . The vigorous tree is perfect ; the flowing stream - well called " living " - is pure and sparkling . This energy that purifies , perfects , beautifies , is life , for life is an interplay of energies . Life , then , of necessity evolves beauty ; and its free , right interactions , without disorder or obstruction , are joy itself , - " the oil of joy " as it were , so smooth and pleasurable is the normal movement of all spiritual and physical machinery . Hence the great import of the words " eternal life , " as expressive of blessedness , and the phrase " beauty of holiness , " that is to say , the beauty of wholeness and health , for the three words have a common root . It is the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moral colors and lines and lights , and even physical , by the force of its living and unswerving energies , the parts acting well together , and the whole in harmonious working with other beings and external objects . Moreover , since fancy and imagination are the powers most prominent in ornamentation , it is in ornament especially that we feel the presence of a free , spontaneous , and thus happy , activity or life ; for imagination and fancy are the very faculties which , in our experience , work most easily , untiringly , involuntarily ; these are the faculties that are awake in sleep , needing not the repose that other powers of the mind demand ; the working of these we most often designate as play . Because the involuntary right action of all its powers , even of the " will " itself , expresses the soul 's perfect state , therefore it is in the production of the beautiful - largely due to self-acting and tireless fancy - that we may best behold the ideas of joy , purity , energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when human ; it is such in its divine happiness and pure vital power , as well as in reference to the results it originates . And here we might add , that there is indeed an evil energy , a false joy and beauty , in the realm of art as in that of morals ; but it is disordered power , often more intense in its brief abnormal activity than is regulated power ; and it is a wondrous confirmation of the foregoing remarks , that even then , as vital energy , it must produce at least a semblance of joy and beauty , - the joy of delirium and the beauty of death . Ornamental art smiles to us in every playful line and cheerful color ; we have attempted to explain why . With the // happy life inherent in art are mingled other joys ; - gladness in the infinite gradations and boundless variations of curve , color , and shading ; gladness that sympathizes with the workman 's pleasant work and success ; gladness that throbs in unison with the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's rejoicing creatures ; the happiness also of living over the past as recorded in man 's work , and being thrilled with the struggles , hopes , and pleasures of ages gone by ; the happiness , above all , of co-working with the Spirit who , as the all-indwelling life , garnished the heavens and the earth , and conspiring with and emulating the Lord of the old and the new creation ; the happiness , finally , of that reconciled conscience and purified heart without which we are insensible to the beauty of beauty , without which the loveliest forms are discords and accusing witnesses , and the gold of heaven would be dim . But as all things have their sweetest beginning and ending in love , so has this subject . The life that breathes in works of beauty , like all vitality , is love ; for life , according to the definition above given , is a mutual exchange , a giving and taking , and that is love . " And all that life is love , " sings the hymii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chemical - works by affinities ; much more each higher . All this aside , however , it is the beautiful that is chosen for the gifts of friendship ; and there is in all beautiful production an affection that learns all its wisdom and skill through loving regard to nature , that toils for the sake of some who are dear , that beautifies only when it fondly lingers and plays over its work like sunshine on the mountains , and that does all , or should do all , as an adoring service and sacrifice to the God of beauty , the infinite love . A gospel of love , no less than of life , may be found in all that is ornamental in human effort , while in the delicate beauty of nature there is superadded the truth of Divine grace , the more signal because mingled with judgment . In every dainty flower the gentleness of God would arrest the feet of indifference and recklessness , in every wavy outline of a landscape his tenderness writes itself , in every touch of light and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graceful creature lie plays with his children of filial heart .
