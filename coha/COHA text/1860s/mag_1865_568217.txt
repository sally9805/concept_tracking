ARTICLE V1. - UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE . IT may be remembered by the readers of the New Englander , that in the year 1860 , when the administration of Mr. Buchanan was becoming daily more contemptible , and just as the country was marshaling its forces for that political campaign , which resulted in the election of Mr. Lincoln , a letter of Thomas Babington Macaulay appeared in our papers , in which he declared himself strongly against popular government , and foretold the ultimate overthrow of our institutions , by reason of our principle of general suffrage . The letter was read by multitudes in this country with surprise and sadness-with surprise , because Mr. Macaulay had shown himself such a bold and stalwart defender of the Puritans , that it would seem natural for him to adopt the institutions , which had grown out of their principles-with sadness , not only becanse we had lost the good opinion of a man whom we bad respected and loved , but also , because the weak and imbecile government of Mr. Buchanan had brought the nation to such a pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and soberness , such as they hardly could have had , at any other point in our whole national history . We seemed , through the utter lack of energy in our executive head , to be drifting helples*ly upon the rocks . If any one will recall th' impressions with which he read the letter , when it first met his eye , we doubt not he will recollect , that it carried with it a certain weight which it would not have had in almost any other circumstances . Though the letter is somewhat long to be quoted in full , yet as we desire to make it the basis of some reflections , and as the reader may like to see it again , and to have it within easy reach for reference , we propose to give it entire . The letter is addressed to Hon. Henry S. Randall , of New York , author of the " Life of 4 effersom " The letter was not published until after Mr. Macaulay 's death , which occurred in 1859. // " TO HENRY S. RANDALL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May 23 , 1857 . DEAR Sin : - . . . You are surprised to learn that I have not a high opinion of Mr. Jefferson  --  and I am a little surprised at your surprise . I am certain that I never wrote a line and that I never in parliament , in conversation , or even on the hustings  --  a place where it is the fashion to court the populace-uttered a word indicating an opinion that the supreme authority in a state ought to be entrusted to the majority of citizens , told by the head ; in other words , to the poorest and most ignorant part of society . I have long been convinced that institutions purely democratic must , sooner or later , destroy liberty , or civilization , or both . In Europe , where the population is dense , the effect of such institutions would be almost instantaneous . What happened lately in France is an example . In 1848 , a pure democracy was established there . During a short time , there was reason to expect a general spoliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , a maximum of prices , a ruinous load of taxation laid on the rich for the purpose of supporting the poor in idleness . Such a system would , in twenty years , have made France as poor and barbarous as the France of the Carlovinginns . Happily , the danger was averted ; and now there is a despotism , a silent tribune , an enslaved press . Liberty is gone ; but civilization has been saved . I have not the smallest doubt that , if we had a purely democratic government here , the effect would be the same . Either the poor would plunder the rich , and civilization would perish ; or order and property would be saved by a strong military government , and liberty would perish . You may think that your country enjoys an exemption from these evils . I will frankly own to you that I am of a different opinion . Your fate I believe to be certain , though it is deferred byn physical cause . As long as you have a boundless extent of fertile and unoccupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease than the laboring population of the Old World ; and ; while that is the case , the Jeffersonian polity may continue to exist without causing any fatal calamity . But the time will come when New England will be as thickly peopled as Old England . Wages will be as low ; and will fluctuate as much with you as with us . You will have your Manchesters and Birmiaghams , and , in these Manchesters and Birmingh ams , hundreds of thousands of artisana will assuredly be sometimes out of work . Then your institutions will be fairly brought to the test . Distress everywhere makes the laborer mutinous and discontented , and inclines him to listen with eagerness to agitators , who tell him that it is a monstrous iniquity that one man should have a million while another can not get a full meal . In bad years , there is plenty of grumbling here and sometimes a little rioting ; but it matters little ; for here the sufferers are not the rulers . The supreme power is in the hands of a class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class which is , and knows itself to be , deeply interested in the security of property and the maintenance of order . Accordingly , the malcontents are firmly yet gently restrained . The bad time is got over without robbing the wealthy to relieve the indigent . The springs of national prosperity soon begin to flow again ; work is plentiful ; wages rise ; and all is tranquillity and cheerfulness . I have seen England pass three or four times through such critical seasons as I have described . Through such seasons the United States will have to pass , in the course of the // next century , if not of this . How will you pass through them ? I heartily wish you a good deliverance . But my reason and my wishes are at war ; and I can not help foreboding the worst . It is quite plain that your government will never be able to restrain a distressed and discontented majority . For with you the majority is the government , and has the rich , who are always a minority , absolutely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State of New York , a multitude of people , none of whom has had more than half a breakfast , or expects to have more than half a dinner , will choose a Legislature . Is it possible to doubt what sort of a Legislature will be chosen ? On one side is a statesman preaching patience , respect for vested rights , strict observance of public faith . On the other is a dema. gogue ranting about the tyranny of capitalists and usurers , and asking why anybody should be permitted to drink champagne and to ride in a carriage , while thousands of honest folks are in want of necessaries . Which of the two candidates is likely to be preferred by a working man who hears his children cry for more bread ? I seriously apprehend that you xviii , in some such season of adversity as I have described , do things which will prevent prosperity from returning ; that you will act like people who should , in a year of scarcity , devour all the seed corn , and thus make the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute famine . There will be , I fear , spoliation . The spoliation will increase the distress . The distress will produce fresh spoliation . There is nothing to stop you . Your constitution is all sail and no anchor . As I said before , when a society has entered on this downward progress , either civilization or liberty must perish . Either some C*sar or Napoleon will seize the reins of government with a strong hand ; or your republic will be as fearfully plundered and laid waste by barbarians in the twentieth century as the Roman empire was in the fifth-with this difference , that the Runs and Vandals , who ravaged the Roman empire , came from without , and that your Runs and Vandals will have been engendered within your own country by your own institutions Thinking thus , of course I can not reckon Jefferson among the benefactors of mankind . I readily admit that his intentions were good , and his abilities considerable . Odious stories have been circulated about his private life ; but I do not know on what evidence these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are false , or monstrously exaggerated . I have no doubt I shall derive both pleasure and information from your account of him . I have the honor to he , dear sir , Your faithful servant , T. B. MACAULAY . " Since Mr. IMlacanlay wrote these words , events have transpired on this contin*nt which neither he nor we could , at the time , have anticipated . Great changes have come over us , and the whole aspect of our public affairs is new and surprising . We have just passed through a presidential election , which , for many reasons , must stand as one of the most remarkable in our annals . These Quadrennial campaigns , which may be regarded as the great crises of our national life , are never expected // to come and go without a large amount of stir and excitement . Nor would it be well that they should . This wide-spread political awakening , by which the nation is thoroughly moved from center to circumference , though attended with many incidental evils , is , on the whole , healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people like a grand system of public instruction and education . Even the dullest minded foreigner has some ideas forced through his head , at such tjrues , which never could be got there by any other process-not even the surgical operation , suggested by Sydney Smith . But at no time since our history as a nation began , have the currents of popular thought and emotion run in such deep and broad channels , as during this late campaign . Something like a religions solemnity gathered about many of the preliminary meetings , and especially about the 8th of November  --  the great day of decision . The appendages customary in such a canvass-torch-light processions and the like-seemed trivial and vain , and were for the most part dispensed with . With a gigantic civil war shaking the continent , the people were too much in earnest to be pleased with trappings and gewgaws . In the great meeting held in Fanneil Hall , on the night after the election , three hours had not elapsed from the time that the last ballots were falling like snow-flakes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , gathered from near and far , how the contest had been decided . And when one of the speakers said in substance : " The result of this day 's work is not to be ascribed to the operation of mere political machinery , or to any human contrivance ; - this is the Lord 's doings and it is marvelous in our eyes ; "  --  the deep and quiet " good , good , " which ran through the vast assembly , evinced the temper of the people , and revealed the emotion , well nigh religions , by which the souls of men were stirred . Nor is the view thus taken to be regarded as partial and onesided , and as coming from a people disposed to magnify their own affairs and think too much of their own importance . In all this political contest we have been " compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses . " The civilized world has been looking on with conflicting emotions , but with the most intense // interest . Intelligent observers , standing afar off , amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed than we ourselves with the strange peculiarity of the scene . We have been too much mixed up with what was passing to be fully aware of the spectacle presented . We have been standing too near the picture to see it to the best advantage . Richard Cobden , looking on from England , uses in this connection , which , in the mouth of an American , might seem fulsome . In a recent speech he is reported as saying , that " he regarded the late peaceable presidential election as one of the most sublime spectacles in the whole history of the world , and said a people who could do that had given to the world a spectacle such as never was presented before by any other people . They had re solved , notwithstanding their great sacrifices , that slavery should be abolished . He reiterated his belief , and with far greater emphasis than ever before , that he should not live to see two independent States on the continent of North America . " It may not , therefore , be unsuitable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects , to look again somewhat closely at this principle of general popular suffrage , to see whether it has in it those dangers-those foreshadowings of evil , which Mr. Macaulay ascribes to it . Many of us , in years past , would have been well pleased , had some of the early restrictions upon the right of suffrage remained  --  or if these had been found unjust had others been substituted for them . Various attempts have , now and then , been made to introduce these checks and limitations . In some of the States these restrictions still exist , but how far they are really operative we are not able to say . ( We are speaking now , of course , of the free States , and not the little oligarchies of the South . ) Whatever the facts may be , in those States that yet impose some form ot check upon the right of suffrage , it is obvious that the general drift and tendency of the times have been to break down and remove these barriers ; and to give an open path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male citizens of the country over twenty-one years of age . We have accepted this state of things as a kind of necessary evil , and we are not yet prepared , fully , to say that some restrictions would not be // wholesome . But we frankly confess , that we have less fear of what is to come from this principle of universal suffrage than formerly . The practical operation of it , looked at upon the broad scale , tends to remove apprehension . In the first place , there are certain open and obvious effects arising from it , which are in themselves good , without question ; and unless they are overborne by others which are evil , should not be lightly valued , or easily given up . One of these effects , and the one perhaps most universally noticed and spoken of among the people , is , that it furnishes a safe and quick outlet for all stormy passions , and brings the agitated public mind again to rest and peace . It takes off the fiery elements , with which the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surinto the earth , instead of having them come down in a crashing bolt upon the political fabric . And herein we conceive Mr. Macaulay was laboring under one of his grave mistakes . He was arguing from the great crowd of European population , to whom this privilege of voting is denied . His conclusion was , that what the European masses would be disposed to do , without this gift , the same thing the masses of this country would do with the gift . It is a noii sequitur , as all our experience goes to show . In our recent election , by reason of the fact that we have civil war in the land , the temptations to open force and violence were very great . The wilder passions of wicked men were roused by the very scent of blood in the air . Threats many and terrible were whispered abroad . But in this case we have lived to see what we have always seen before , that when the great masses of our population have gone up and deposited their votes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go , " one to his farm and another to his merchandise , " and there is quiet in the land . Now , suppose for a moment , that that great plot which was r9cently unearthed in Indiana , by which some hundreds of thousands of men were banded together in secret associations to work the overthrow of liberty , ( not a natural outgrowth , by the way , of onr free society , but only an outlying organization of that accursed institution , which has all the while been an // anomaly among us , and whose days we may now hope are numbered , ) - suppose this plot had been formed among the outcast population of Great Britain-among men having no share or participation in the government , would a general election have done aught to disarm their fury , or would it not , especially had the result been adverse to their wishes , have rather increased their rage , and deepened their emnity ? Mr. IMiacaulay can not reason safely from masses of men , so circumstanced , to the free population of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed , but now we know that the threatening cloud has been disarmed , and the storm is hushed . It is a little thing one may say-this right to vote . " T is a little thing To give a cup of water- " ( but there are great consequences hanging upon little things . The man who has his honest share in the government is in a very different mood of mind from one who stands apart like a pariah and outcast . Another obviously good effeef of this principle is , that it has a quickening and elevating influence upon the lower classes of society . The simple possession of this privilege , without reference to the connected influences , has of itself this tendency . The man is more of a man , simply because he has been recognized and treated as a man . But it is more especially through the attending circumstances of this gift that his elevation and enlargement proceed . He comes to discuss , in one mode or another , great pirestions of public policy . He is appealed to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points at issue before the people . And though his head may be very thick , and ideas may have a difficult and dangerous passage to reach his mind , still he is all the while in a state of education . Not only , therefore , are the humbler masses in this country in a very diff*rent state of feeling toward the government from that outlying population which Mr. Macaulay had in his eye , and which is the shame and disgrace of England , but under the influences thus acting upon them they soon come to be a dikerent order of beings . Their thoughts run in other channels . Their hopes are derived from other sources . There is T10 natural // Jan. , war between them and the government that is over them . They are a part of the government , and their interests lie in the direction of its stability and snccess . There is no honor which their children may not reach . They themselves see men rising up from the humblest places in society , and coming to fill offices of great dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement Mr. iMiacaulay loses sight of , when he draws his conclusions from the old world and applies them to the new . There is another very important thought in this connection . There is much less chance for political bribery to work and prevail where the principle of universal suffrage is allowed , than when the right of voting is confined to few . This species of corruption will be likely to exist to a greater or less extent wherever the privilege of suffrage is enjoyed . But contrary to what one may at first think , the motives which prompt to it , and the chances of success in it , are immensely lessened , according as you widen the base , and include the greatest number possible in your voting list . There are , in the latter case , too many who must be bought up to make the scheme practicable ; and what is better still , the number that can not be bought , at any price , may overbalance and defeat these schemes of iniquity , even though the largest expenditures may be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and'trade , when it has to act on a land ruled by universal suffrage , as in a country like England , where the voters are comparatively few . From the very circumstances of the case the . whole system sits lightly even on men wh o are willing , in a certain way , to yield themselves to it . In our late election there was many a politician who had stirred around benevolently to pay poor men 's taxes , or who had quietly slipped a little retaining-fee into the hands of laborers , and who had for his pains the satisfaction of seeing these men come to the polls and vote on the other side . England and Wales , with a population of somewhat more than 20,000,000 , seyid to the House of Commons 498 members . The constituency that elects these men is about 950,000  --  or less than one voter to twenty people . In a population where the principle of general suffrage prevails , there will be not far from // one voter for every five inhabitants . The State of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of universal suffrage , in any given population , will secure.a little more than four times the number of voters that the English system gives . The voters , therefore , who are to determine whether this or that mau shall be a member of the House of Commons , are comparatively few , and if only a small number can be bought over , even though the price per head may be large , the balance can , perhaps , be turned . But when the constituency that sends a man to Congress is composed of fifteen or twenty thousand voters , the hope of effecting an election by purchase is far more vain , and the motives to make the attempt are wanting . A man can reasonably undertake to stop a few crevices through which the wind is blowing , but to go out into the open world , and stop the free air of heaven in its onward sweep , is another thing altogether ! Hence , we have often read , in English history , of the prevalence of bribery and political corruption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . We do not wish to boast of any immaculate purity in this respect . We have enough to be ashamed of in the fraudulent arts and contrivances of demagogues among us . But that wholesale buying of votes , which has often been seen in England , is not in harmony with the principle of general suffrage . There is also another form of political corruption , which has almost always prevailed in this country to a greater or less extent , in connection with every form of restricted suffrage , but which can find no place under a system of general suffrage . We refer to those measures of evasion , by which the whole spirit and intent of the restriction are nullified , while the mere letter of the law is artfully retained . Such practices are in a high degree demoralizing in their influence upon society , and any system which saves us from such exposures , is , so far at least , good . We might speak , also , in this connection , of the endless flexibility of the system , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they arise , and , especially , to great national // exigencies . Just in proportion as you can take the system out from that forced and artificial domain , where bribery and cunning find full play , in the same degree do you secure that easy bending by which new , moral , and political questions are adequately met . The friends of Mr. Lincoln thonght they secured a great triumph in his first election in 1860 . But it was only a plurality triumph even in the States that voted the present yeai*. lie was in an actual popular minority of some one hundred and fifty thousand , if we mistake not , in these very States . But mark the change which has since taken place . This year , he carries these States by an actual majority of between three and four hundred thousand , showing a change since 1860 of some four hundred and fifty or five hundred thousand . So decided is the triumph , that had all the seceded States voted , and had they cast their entire vote against Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral College . We wish now to bring forward some considerations which may serve to show that we have already passed the point of highest danger , in the application of this principle of general suffrage ,  --  at least for a long time to come . What may happen in the far distant future , we will not undertake to prophesy . We have had now , for many years , to maintain this principle amid circumstances the most trying , and under influences the most malign and corrupting , and as we look out upon the future , there is a sense of relief . In the first place , the dominating influence of slavery upon this continent has been wholly adverse to any fair trial of this experiment of popular government . Slavery is a thing of might and violence . iDisregarding the natural rights of the black man , it soon learns to disregard , just so far as it can , the natural rights of the white man also . It is essentially oligarchic . It scoffs at the idea of being ruled by popular majorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Richmond papers a long Article based upon a speech made by Mr. Raymond of New york , in which the editor thanked the Lord that they ( the Southern people ) were happily through with this whole business of popular majorities and minorities . The Article was a virtual confession that the leaders of this re // bellion have had no idea of giving any political power to the great masses of the Southern people , white or black , but that it should be kept entirely in the hands of a few . Tn every general election , now for a long course of years , this base and corrupt institution has been acting out , by influences direct and indirect , over the whole land-suggesting every species of violence and fraud-teaching the base minded voter to stick at nothing , whereby he might ensure success-counseling open force and villainy , where milder means would not prevail , and , in general , bringing within the sacred precincts of the ballotbox all those low ideas which prevail in the boxing-ring and on the plantation . The system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . In the case of Kansas , we had an illustrious and utimistakable exhibition of the spirit of the South , touching popular government and the rights of majorities . We shall take it for granted that this corrupt and corrupting power is soon to be utterly overthrown , and that its foul suggestions will not come in to disturb popular elections in the future , as they have done in the past . Another evil influence under which this principle has had to labor , and which must also be regarded as abnormal , is the immense foreign immigration , which has been for many years pouring in upon us . It serves to show the strength of our political system , that we have been able to appropriate such a mass of crude and unshaped material , with so little of positive disturbance . Nevertheless it is an evil , and it is to be recognized as such . In our recent election , if all this foreign element could have been left o4t-if , in short , no one could have voted who was not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land would have been perfectly sure from the first of the result . This tide coming in from the Old World , must by and by grow less . We have already draIned off pretty effectually the refuse population of Ireland , which , being a part of the 3ritish Empire , furnishes us with the lowest order of material , taken in the mass , with which we have to contend . Taking all the countries of Europe into view , and for a time , this stream of immigration ma*y continue to flow as freely as it has in the past . But there must // come , by and by , a limit to it , and even now , relatively to the whole population of the country , it must be less than formerly . Again , with the destruction of slavery , we anticipate that something like the free public education of the North will ere long prevail over the whole land . Herein is one of our greatest safeguards . With a people educated like the native-born population of the North , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of education with all our habits of thought , that , fast as our free institutions spread , they must now , by a kind of necessity , carry along with them this principle . The signs are even now auspicious . Wherever there is an opening into this dark realm of slavery , there goes the spelling-book , there goes the school . These primary institutions of free society leap forward , by a kind of instinct , to fill the aching void . With education also must go religion , not that form which rests upon a few texts only , like " servants be obedient unto your masters , " but the full , free , loving gospel of Jesus Christ , with compassion and redemption for sinners . And , now in reference to those possible contingencies which Mr. Macaulay has so graphically sketched out , we have to say , that he does not seem to be sufficiently aware that it is the nature of equal and just law , in its normal working , to secure a nation against just these contingencies . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave them in that grinding and oppressive shape , in which the laws of England are found to-day . And what the poor millions of England now want , is not a chance to seize and confiscate to their own private use the enormous wealth of the nobles and merchant princes of the land . No temporary supply of this kind would satisfy their need . They want the laws , the habits , the enstoms of society so modified and adjusted , that they may have something like a decent reward for their labor , and may not be burdened with an unreasonable share of the public taxes . If they have succeeded by industry and carefulness in laying by a little sum , they want the privilege of going into the market and purchasing a small estate which they may call their own . The laws of England are not made to subserve their welfare , // but to put the chief reward of their labors into the hands of those who make and administer the government . An investigation set on foot by Parliament , a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing population of England has long been kept-poor and miseraRe as is their life  --  the agricultural portion of the people is in a much worse condition . There was a far ore ater prevalence of poverty , vice , and crime among the lower order of farm laborers , than among the half-clad and half starved operatives in the large manufacturing centers . And their condition was made what it was by the laws that were over them . No doubt if such a people could get hold of the reins of power , they might at first do some things wild and unseemly . But their general aim would be , to do wit at ought to le done-vi2 : to reform the laws , so that the man of toil should have his just rewards , and not have them mercilessly filched from him by the grasping avarice of the rich and great . Onr free laws , made by the o'eneral voice of the poople , are designed to secure this result and we see no occasion whatever for those fearful forebodings in which Mr. Macaulay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despoiled of their rights , has seen fit to indulge . Nothing which we have said or can say about the inequality of English law , the heavy and unjust burdens imposed upon the laboring classes , equals in severity what some of the most able English writers of to-day are themselves saying on these came topics . Some of the deepest thinkers and most accomplished scholars of England are thorougly engaged upon this very subject . They are arraigning the govermnent of England before the civilized world , for neglecting one of its most obvious and pressing duties . Men like Cobden , Mill , Spencer , and Goldwin Smith , see clearly in what direction the whole system is tending , and they raise their voices in timely warning . But their words seem to fail , for the most part , unheeded upon the ears of the British aristocracy . The lamented Hawthorne , in closing an Article for the " Atlantic Monthly , " written some two years ago , and entitled " Outside Glimpses of English Poverty , " uses the following beautiful , impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of those lordly mansions , in which , from generation to generation , the noblemen of England find their homes , he says " And is it possible , after all , that there may be a flaw in the title-deeds ? Is , or is not , the system wrong that gives one married pair so immense a superfluity of luxurious home , and shuts out a million others from any home whatever ? One day or another , safe as they deem themselves , and safe as the hereditary temper of the people really tends to make them , the gentlemen of England will be compelled to face this question . " We confess then , that so far from losing confidence in a popular government , the events of the last four years have tended to confirm , and more than confirm , all our previous hopes . We know of no other government on the face of the globe , that could better withstand the mighty strain that has thus been brought to bear upon it , than has our own . The experlinent has revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not ourselves before aware . We are satisfied that no monarchy in Europe , absolute or limited , could have borne this burden so well , could have mustered and ' kept in the field such enormous forces , with so little friction and disturbance . If we ever supposed a kingly or imperial system mightier for purposes like these , let this be our thought no longer . There is a universality of strength in the free movement of a free and intelligent people , which no monarchy can match . There is a totality of forces , physical , intellectual , financial , and moral , such as kingly systems do not generate . All the fountains are full to overflowing , by reason of the rain and dew , which long ago descended . The little rills in every direction come trickling down from the mountains . The lonely and scattered schoolhouses of twenty years ago among the hills , send in their influences . Invention and skill have the whole mind of the nation as their base of development , and there is an endless fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That habit of dull and endless routine , so natural to the oppressed and uneducated mass of mankind , is thoroughly broken up . Every man is seeking out some way to remove a hindrance or difficulty , so that he may the better realize in his own // life , what the Psalmist sublimely gives forth , as the design of God in creating man ,  --  " He made him to have dominion over the works of his hands . He hath put all things under his feet . " All these are resources which no monarch , however loudly and earnestly he may call , can summon to his aid from a poor , half-educated , half-starving populace . They must come as the spontaneous up-bursting from deep and multitudinous fountains that press to deliver their supplies . It used to be conceded that kingly governments were superior to republican in respect to the patronage afforded to literature , and more generally in the bestowment of money for purposes of public ornament or utility . But we are disposed no longer to make any such concession . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years , and especially the free out-pouring of treasure since the war began , not only for objects connected with the war , but for everything ministering to the general good , in distinction from private and individual good , convinces us that republican institutions , when fully developed , will surpass all others in this largehearted and open-handed liberality . IMlen will rise up in larger numbers than under any other system , who will take delight* in works of public utility-in plans for general culture-who will be ready , living or dying , to bestow their money to found colleges , asylums , hospitals , and schools of art . If this be called boa3ting , let it pass for such . But popular government never looked fairer and more promising to us , than it does to-day . In closing this Article there is one point , vitally connected with our subject , and forced upon our attention by all the circumstances of the times , through which we are passing , and which we must not fail to touch . What shall be done with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our view , there is but one safe answer to be given . They are , in this regard , to stand like other men . They are to be put upon the same foundation , and to be treated in the same way . Of course , there is to be no unseemly haste in this matter . There is an order of nature  --  a law of propriety which-should be followed . But when our institutions come again into working order , and to their normal condition , then to make any distine // tion , in this right of voting , on the ground of mere color , is only to invite the Lord again to chastise us , and vex us with his sore judgment . What some one has well said ought to be a maxim in a true political economy , that " nothing is settled in this world until it is settled right . " And we are poor scholars , if we have not yet learned that it is not right to place a man apart and treat him as a political outlaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that man is here innocently , so far as he is concerned , and not as an intruder into our affairs . We have already intimated that we are not averse to some forms of restriction upon the right of suffrage , if only some way can be found , which shall be safe , and in a good degree free from political corruptions . We do not regard an ignorant man as a desirable voter . But all that we now contend for is , that the restriction which excludes the black man shall exclude the white man also , in like circumstances . And to this result we must come , if we would have settled and abiding peace in the land . Then our political fabric touches bottom , and rests down upon its strong and enduring foundations . " The work of righteousness shall be peace , and the effect of righteousness , cluiteness and assurance forever . " Is there anything to be said against this proposition ? The poorest material we have in the land for voting purposes , is , in onr*view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ignorance which we can not easily get at to enlighten-ready to go submissively the way that the Roman Catholic church points-filled with low and narrow prej udices and superstitions which time alone , and that not in one generation , can remove , when we admit them to the ballot-box , we have something strangely at variance with all our ideas of what a voter ought to be . It h*is been perfectly manifest to every fair and intelligent observer , for many years past , that the free colored people of the North , which in many , yea , in most of the States , have been excluded from the polls , are in every respect far better fitted to enjoy this privilege , than these masses coming to us from the old world . And yet we would not exclude the Irishman . We hope little by little to // train him to a better habit of thought and to a better condition . But if we would not exclude him , much less would we exclude the black man , in like circumstances of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the black population of this country , we shall find in them a sentiment altogether friendly to our free institutions . We shall find them a Protestant people , kindred in religion to the rest of the native born population of the country . The Irishman , by all his habits of thought and methods of treatment , will not be likely very soon to find the negro on his side in politics , and the time may come , when we shall be glad to have this makeweight against Catholic impertinence and foreign interference . It is not however in reference to such contingencies , or to any principle of mere policy , that we urge the claim of the black man . It is a matter of right before God and the law . It is to carry out the first principles of our government . It is to put everything upon a clear and solid basis for the future . If we resist and hold back , God will yet lead us about forty years in the wilderness , till the old generation and the old political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared by discipline and suffering to enter the promised land .
