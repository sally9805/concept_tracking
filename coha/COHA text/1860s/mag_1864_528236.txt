EXTERNAL APPEARANCE OF GLACIERS . THUS far we have examined chiefly the internal structure of the glacier ; let us look now at its external appearance , and at the variety of curious phenomena connected with the deposit of foreign materials upon its surface , some of which seem quite inexplicable at first sight . Among the most striking of these are the large boulders elevated on columns of ice , standing sometimes ten feet or more above the level of the glacier , and the sand-pyramids , those conical hills of sand which occur not infrequently on all the large Alpine glaciers . One is at first quite at a loss to explain the presence of these pyramids in the midst of ' a frozen ice-field , and yet it has a very simple cause . I have spoken of the many little rills arising on the surface of the ice in consequence of its melting . Indeed , the voice of the waters is rarely still on the glacier during the warm season , except at night . On a summer 's day , a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset ; it is no uncommon thing to see a full cascade come rushing out from the lower end of a glacier during the heat of the day , and vanish again at its decline . Suppose one of these rivulets should fall into a deep , circular hole , such as often occur on the glacier , and the nature of which I shall presently explain , and that this cylindrical opening narrows to a mere crack at a greater or less depth within the ice , the water will find its way through the crack and filter down into the deeper mass ; but the dust and sand carried along with it will be caught there , and form a deposit at the bottom of the hole . As day after day , throughout the summer , the rivulet is renewed , it carries with it an additional supply of these light materials , until the opening is gradually filled and the sand is brought to a level with the surface of the ice . We have already seen , that , in consequence of evaporation , mdting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacier sinks annually at the rate of from five to ten feet , according to stations . The natural consequence , of course , must be , that the sand is left standing above the surface of the ice , forming a mound which would constantly increase in height in proportion to the sinking of the surrounding ice , had it sufficient solidity to retain its original position . But a heap of Sand , if unsupported , must very soon subside and be dispersed ; and , indeed , these pyramids , which are often quite lofty , and yet look as if they would crumble at a touch , prove , on nearer examination , to be perfectly solid , and are , in fact , pyramids of ice with a thin sheet of sand spread over them . A word will explain how this transformation is l*rought about . As soon as the level of the glacier falls below the sand , thus depriving it of support , it sinks down and spreads slightly over the surrounding surface . In this condition it protects the ice immediately beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the glacier wastes , this protected area rises above the general mass and becomes detached from it . The sand , of course , slides down over it , spreading toward its base , so as to cover a wider space below , and an ever-narrowing one above , until it gradually assumes the pyramidal form in which we find it , covered with a thin coating of sand . Every stage of this process may occasionally be seen upon the same glacier , in a number of sand-piles raised to various heights above the surface of the ice , approaching the perfect pyramidal form , or falling to pieces after standing for a short time erect . The phenomenon of the large boulders , supported on tall pillars of ice , is of a similar character . A mass of rock , having fallen on the surface of the glacier , protects the ice immediately beneath it from the action of the sun ; and as the level of the glacier sinks all around it , in January , // consequence of the unceasing waste of the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar of considerable height . In proportion as the column rises , however , the rays of the sun reach its sides , striking obliquely upon them under the boulder , and wearing them away , until the column becomes at last too slight to sustain its burden , and the rock falls again upon the glacier ; *r , owing to the unequal action of the sun , striking of course with most power on the southern side , the top of the pillar becomes slanting , and the boulder slides off . These ice-pillars , crowned with masses of rock , form a very picturesque feature in the scenery of the glacier , and are represented in many of the landscapes in which Swiss artists have endeavored to reproduce the grandeur and variety of Alpine views , especially in the masterly Aquarelles of Lory . The English reader will 1*nd them admirably well described and illustrated in Dr. Tyndall 's work upon the glaciers . They are known throughout the Alps as " glacier-tables " ; and many a time my fellow-travellers and I have spread our frugal meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for our convenience . Another curious effect is that produced by small stones or pebbles , small enough to become heated through by the sun in summer . Such a heated pebble will of course melt the ice below it , and so wear a hole for itself into which it sinks . This process will continue as long as the sun reaches the pebble with force enough to heat it . Numbers of such deep , round boles , like organ - pipes , varying in size from the diameter of a minute pebble or a grain of coarse sand to that of an ordinary stone , are found on the glacier , and at the bottom of each is the pebble by which it was bored . The ice formed by the freezing of water collecting in such holes and in the fissures of the surface is a pure crystallized ice , very different in color from the ice of the great mass of the glacier produced by snow ; and sometimes , after a rain and frost , the surface of a glacier looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots of clear ice with which it is inlaid . Indeed , the aspect of the glacier changes constantly with the different conditions of the temperature . We may see it , when , during a long dry season , it has collected upon its surface all sorts of light floating materials , as dust , hand , and the like , so that it looks dull and soiled ,  --  or when a heavy rain has washed the surface clean from all impurities and left it bright and fresh . We may see it when the heat and other disintegrating influences have acted upon the ice to a certain superficial depth , so that its surface is covered with a decomposed crust of broken , snowy ice , so permeated with air that it has a dead-white color , like pounded ice or glass .. Those who see the glacier in this state miss the blue tint so often described as characteristic of its appearance in its lower portion , and as giving such a peculiar beauty to its caverns and vaults . But let them come again after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snowy ice above , and before the same process has had time to renew it , and they will find the compact , solid surface of the glacier of as pure a blue as if it reflected the sky abore . We may see it in the early dawn , before the new ice of the preceding night begins to yield to the action of the sun , and the surface of the glacier is veined and inlaid with the water poured into its holes and fissures during the day and transformed into pure , fresh ice during the night ,  --  or when the noonday heat has wakened all its streams , and rivulets sometimes as large as rivers rush along its surface , find their way to the lower extremity of the glacier , or , dashing down some gaping crevasse or open well , are lost beneath the ice . It would seem from the quantity of water that is sometimes ingulfed within these open breaks in the ice , that the glacier must occasionally be fissured to a very great depth . I remember once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let down a self-regulating thermometer 1864.1 // into its interior , seeing an immense fissurc suddenly rent open , in consequence , no doubt , of the shocks given to the ice by the blows of the instruments . The effect was like that of an earthquake ; the mass seemed to rock beneath us , and it was difficult to keep our feet . One of these glacial rivers was flowing past the spot at the time , and it was instantly lost in the newly formed chasm . However deep and wide the fissure might be , such a stream of water , constantly poured into it , and daily renewed throughout the summer , must eventually fill it and overflow , unless it finds its way through the whole mass of the glacier to the bottom on which it rests ; it must have an outlet above or below . The fact that considerable rivulets ( too broad to leap across , and too deep to wade through safely even with high boots ) may entirely vanish in the glacier unquestionably shows one of two things ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wet sponge , or the cavities reach the bottom of the glacier . Probably the two conditions are generally combined . In direct connection with the narrower fissures are the so - called moulins , - the circular wells on the glacier . We will suppose that a transverse , narrow fissure has been formed across the glacier , and that one of the many rii*ulets flowing longitudinally along its surface empties into it . As the surface-water of the glacier , producing these rivulets , arises not only from the melting of the ice , but also from the condensation of vapor , or even from rain - falls , and flows over the scattered dust - particles and fragments of rock , it has always a temperature slightly above 820 , 50 that such a rivulet is necessarily warmer than the icy edge of the fissure over which it precipitates itself . In consequence of its higher temperature it melts the edge , gradually wearing it backward , till the straight margin of the fissure at the spot over which the water falls is changed to a semicircle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ( l foam against the other side , the same effect takes place there , by which a corresponding semicircle is formed exactly opposite the first . This goes on not only at the upper margin , but through the whole depth of the opening as far down as the water carries its higher temperature . In short , a semicircular groove is excavated on either side of the fissure for its whole depth along the line on which the rivulet holds its downward course . After a time , in consequence of the motion of the glacier , such a fissure may close again , and then the two semicircles thus brought together form at once one continuous circle , and we have one of the round deep openings on the glacier known as moulins , or wells , which may of course become perfectly dry , if any accident turns the rivulet aside or dries up its source . The most common cause of the intermittence of such a waterfall is the formation of a crevasse higher up , across the watercourse which supplied it , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound . I have lowered a line for more than seven hundred feet in one of them before striking bottom ; and one is by no means sure even then of having sounded the whole depth , for it may often happen that the water meets with some obstacle which prevents its direct descent , and , turning aside , continues its deeper course at a different angle . Such a well may be like a crookcd shaft in a mine , changing its direction from time to time . I found this to be the case in one into which I caused myself to be lowered in order to examine the internal structure of the glacier . For some time my descent was straight and direct , but at a depth of about fifty feet there was a landing - place , as it were , from which the opening continued its farther course at quite a different angle . It is within these cylindrical openings in the ice that those accumulations of sand collect which form the pyramids described above . One may often trace the gradual formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , they are very apt to be found in various stages of com // pletion along the same track where these conditions occur . Fissures , for instance , will often be produced along the same line , because , as the mass of the glacier moves on , its upper portions , as they advance , come successively in contact with inequalities of the bottom , in consequence of which the ice is strained beyond its power of resistance and cracks across . Rivulets are also likely to be renewed summer after summer over the same track , because certain conditions of the surface of the glacier , to which I have not yet alluded , and which favor the more rapid melting of the ice , remain unchanged year after year . Of course , the wells do not remain stationary any more than any other feature of the glacier . They move on with the advancing mass of ice , and we consequently find the older ones considerably lower down than the more recent ones . In ascending such a track as I have described , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may meet first with a sand-pyramid ; at a certain distance above that there may he a circular opening filled to its brim with the sand which has just reached the surface of the ice ; a little above may be an open well with the rivulet still pouring into it ; or higher up , we may meet an open fissure with the two semicircles opposite each other on the margins , but not yet united , as they will be presently by the closing of the fissure ; or we may find near by another fissure , the edges of which are just beginning to wear in consequence of the action of the water . Thus , though we can not trace the formation of such a cylindrical shaft in the glacier from the beginning to the end , we may by combining the separate facts observed in a number decipher their Whole history . In describing the surface of the glacier , I should not omit the shallow troughs which I have called " meridian holes , " from the accuracy with which they register the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are patches of loose materials , dust , sand , pebbles , or gravel , accumulated by diminutive waterrills , and small enough to become heated during the day . They will , of course , be warmed first on their eastern side , then , still more powerfully , on their southern side , and in the afternoon with less force again on their western side , while the northern side will remain comparatively cool . Thus around more than half of their circumference they melt the ice in a semicircle , and the glacier is covered with little crescent-shaped troughs of this description , with a steep wall on one side and a shallow one on the other , and a little heap of loose materials in the bottom . They are the sundials of the glacier , recording the hour by the advance of the sun 's rays upon them . In recapitulating the results of my glacial experience , even in so condensed a form as that in which I intend to present them here , I shall be obliged to enter somewhat into personal narration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by the companions of my excursions , some of whom wrote out in a more popular form the incidents of our daily life which could not be fitly introduced into my own record of scientific research . When I first began my investigations upon the glaciers , now more than twenty-five years ago , scarcely any measurements of their size or their motion had been made . One of my principal objects , therefore , was to ascertain the thickness of the mass of ice , generally supposed to be from eighty to a hundred feet , and even less . The first year I took with me a hundred feet of ' iron rods , ( no easy matter , where it had to be transported to the upper part of a glacier on men 's backs , ) thinking to bore the glacier through and through . As well might I have tried to sound the ocean with a ten-fathom line . The following year I took two hundred feet of rods with me , and again I was foiled . Eventually I succeeded in carrying up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many attempts , that this was about // the average thickness of the glacier of the Aar , on which I was working . I mention these failures , because they give some idea of the discouragements and difficulties which meet the investigator in any new field of research ; and the student must remember , for his consolation under such disappointments , that his failures are almost as important to the cause of science and to those who follow him in the same road as his successes . It is much to know what we can not do in any given direction , - the first step , indeed , toward the accomplishment of what we can do . A like disappointment awaited me in my first attempt to ascertain by direct measurement the rate of motion in the glacier . Early observers had asserted that the glacier moved , but there had been no accurate demonstration of the fact , and so uniform is its general appearance from year to year that even the fact of its motion was denied by man'y . It is true that the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had stood at a certain point on the glacier was found man" feet below that point the following year ; but the opponents of the theory insisted that it did not follow , because the mass of rock had moved , that therefore the mass of ice had moved with it . They believed that the boulder might have slid down for that distance . Neither did the occasional encroachment of the glaciers upon the valleys prove anything ; it might be solely the effect of an unusual accumulation of snow in cold seasons . Here , then , was another question to be tested ; and one of my first experiments was to plant stakes in the ice to ascertain whether they would change their position with reference to the sides of the valley ' or not . If the glacier moved , my stakes must of course move with it ; if it was stationary , my stakes would remain standing where I had placed them , and any advance of other objects upon the surface of the glacier would be proved to be due to their sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to that of the mass of ice on which they rested . I found neither the one nor the other ofmy anticipated results ; after a short time , all the stakes lay flat on the ice , and I learned nothing from my first series of experiments , except that the surface of the glacier is wasted annually for a depth of at least five feet , in consequence of which my rods had lost their support , and fallen down . Similar disappointment was experienced by my friend Eseher upon the great glacier of Aletsch . My failure , however , taught me to sink the next set of stakes ten or fifteen feet below the surface of the ice , instead of five ; and the experiment was attended with happier results . A stake planted eighteen feet deep in the ice , and cut on a level with the surface of the glacier , in the summer of 1840 , was found , on my return in the summer of 1841 , to project seven feet , and in the beginning of September it showed ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September , 1841 , I planted six stakes at a certain distance from each other in a straight line across the upper part of the glacier , taking care to have the position of all the stakes determined with reference to certain fixed points on the rocky walls of the valley . When I returned , the following year , all the stakes had advanced considerably , and the straight line had changed to a crescent , the central rods having moved forward much faster than those nearer the sides , so that not only was the advance of the glacier clearly demonstrated , but also the fact that its middle portion moved faster than its margins . This furnished the first accurate data on record concerning the average movement of the glacier during the greater part of one year . In 1842 I caused a trigonometric survey of the whole glacier of the Aar to be made , and several lines across its whole width were staked and determined with reference to the sides of the valley ; * for a number of suc * All the trigonometrical measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild , now Professor at the Federal Polytechnic School in Ziirich ; they // cessive years the survey was repeated , and furnished the numerous data concerning the motion of ' the glacier which I have published . I shall probably never have an opportunity of repeating these experiments , and examining anew the condition of the glacier of the Aar ; but as all the measurements were taken with reference to certain fixed points recorded upon the map mentioned in the note , it would be easy to renew them over the same locality , and to make a direct comparison with my first results after an interval of a quarter of a century . Such a comparison would be very valuable to science , as showing any change in the condition of the glacier , its rate of motion , etc. , since the time my survey was made . These observations not only determined the fact of the motion of the glacier itself , as well as the inequality of its motion in different parts , but explained also a variety of phenomena indirectly connected with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those gaping fissures of unknown depths , sometimes a mile or more in length , and often measuring several hundred feet in width , the terror , not only of the ordinary traveller , but of the most experienced mountaineers . There is a variety of such crevasses upon the glacier , but the most numerou* and dangerous are the transverse and lateral ones . The transverse ones were readily accounted for after the motion of the glacier was admitted ; they must take place , whenever , the glacier advancing over inequalities or steeper parts of its bed , the tension of the mass was so great that the cohesion of the particles was overcome , and the ice consequently rent apart . This would be especially the case wherever some steep angle in the bottom over which it moved presented an obstacle to the even advance of the mass . But the position of the lateral ones was not so easily understood . They are especially apt to occur wherever a : promontory of rock juts out are recorded in the topographical survey and map of the glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the glacier ; and when fresh , they usually slant obliquely upward , trending from the prominent wall toward the head of the glacier , while , when old , on the contrary , they turn downward , so that the crevasses around such a promontory are often arranged in the shape of a spread fan , diverging from it in different directions . When the movement of the glacier was fully understood , however , it became evident , that , in its effort to force itself around the promontory , the ice was violently torn apart , and that the rent must tak* place in a direction at right angles with that in which the mass was moving . If the mass be moving inward and downward , the direction of the rent must be obliquely upward . As now the mass continues to advance , the crevasses must advance with it ; and as it moves more rapidly toward the middle than on the margins , that end of the crevasse which is farthest removed from the proj*cting rock must move more rapidly also ; the consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain time , point downward , while the fresh ones point upward . Not only does tbe glacier collect a variety of foreign materials on its upper surface , but its sides as well as its lower surface are studded with boulders , stones , pebbles , sand , coarse and fine gravel , so that it forms in reality a gigantic rasp , with sides hundreds of feet deep , and a surface thousands of feet wide and many miles in length , grinding over the bottom and along the walls between which it moves , polishing , grooving , and scratching them as it passes onward . One who is familiar with the track of this mighty engine will recognize at once where the large boulders have hollowed out their deeper furrows , where small pebbles have drawn their fiuier marks , where the stones with angular edges have left their sharp scratches , where sand and gravel have rubbed and smoothed the rocky surface , and left it bright and polished as if it came from the hand of the marble-worker . These marks are not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observed them ; the scratches , furrows , grooves , are always rectilinear , trending in the direction in which the glacier is moving , and most distinct on that side of the surface - inequalities facing the direction of the moving mass , while the lee-side remains mostly untouched . It may be asked , how it is known that the glacier carries this powerful apparatus on its sides and bottom , when they are hidden from sight . I answer , that we might determine the fact theoretically from certain known conditions respecting the conformation of the glacier ; to which I shall allude presently ; but we need not resort to this kind of evidence , since we have ocular demonstration of the truth . Here and there on the sides of the glacier it is possible to penetrate between the walls and the ice to a great depth , and even to follow such a gap to the very bottom of the valley , and everywhere do we find the surface of tj*e ice fretted as I have described it , with stones of every size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sand and gra*-* el of all sorts , from the coarsest grain to the finest , and these materials , more or less firmly set in the ice , form the grating surface with which , in its onward movement down the Alpine valleys , it leaves everywhere unmistakable , traces of its passage . We come now to the moraines , those walls of loose materials built by the glaciers themselves along their road . They have been divided into three classes , namely , lateral , medial , and terminal moraines . Let us look first at the lateral ones ; and to understand them we must examine the conformation of the glacier below the ne 've ' , where it assumes the character of ' pure compact ice . We have seen that the fields of snow , where the glaciers have their origin , are level , and that lower down , where these masses of snow begin to descend toward the narrower valley , they follow its trough-like shape , sinking toward the centre and sloping upward against the sides , so that the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ' , is slightly concave . But lower down in the glacier proper , where it is ' completely transformed into ice , its surface becomes convex , for the following reason : The rocky walls of the valley , as they approach the plain , partake of its higher temperature . They become heated by the sun during the day in summer , so that the margins of the glacier melt rapidly in contact with them . In consequence of this , there is always in the lower part of the glacier a broad depression between the ice and the rocky walls , while , as this effect is not felt in the centre of the glacier , it there retains a higher level . The natural result of this is a convex surface , arching upward toward the middle , sinking toward the sides . It is in these broad , marginal depressions that the lateral moraines accumulate ; masses of rock , stones , pebbles , dust , all the fragments , in short , which become loosened from the rocky walls above , fall into them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated which gradually work their way downward between the ice and the walls , till the whole side of the glacier becomes studded with them . It is evident , that , when the glacier runs in a northerly or southerly direction , both the walls will be affected by the sun , one in the morning , the other in the afternoon , and in such a case the sides will be uniform , or nearly so . But when the trend of the valley is from east to west , or from west to east , the northern side only will feel the full force of the sun ; and in such a case , only one side of the glacier will be convex in outline , while the other will remain nearly on a level with the middle . The large masses of loose materials which accumulate between the glacier and its rocky walls and upon its margins form the lateral moraines . These move most slowly , as the marginal portions of the glacier advance at a much slower rate than its centre . The medial moraines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the lateral moraines . It often happens that two smaller glaciers unite , running into each other to form a larger // qwq surfaces may in turn undergo this process , and in the end all the loose materials under a glacier become more or less polished , scratched , and grooved . These marks exhibit also the peculiarity so characteristic of the grooves and scratches on the bed and walls of the valley : they are rectilinear , trending in the direction in which the superincumbent mass advances , though , of course , owing to the changes in the position of the pebbles or boulders , they may cross each other in every direction on their surface . As the larger materials are pressed onward with the finer ones , that is , with the sand , gravel , and mud accumulated at the bottom of the glacier , the component parts of this underlying bed of debris will be mixed together without any reference to their size or weight . The softest mud and finest sand may be in immediate contact with the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ice above ; or their position may be reversed , and the coarser materials may rest below , while the finer ones are pressed between them or overlying them . In short , the whole accumulation of loose de'bris under the glacier , resulting from the trituration of all kinds of angular fragments reaching the lower surface of the ice , presents a sort of paste in which coarser and lighter materials are impacted without reference to bulk or weight . Those fragments which are most polished , rounded , grooved , or scratched , have travelled longest under the glacier , and are derived from the hardest rocks , which have resisted the general crushing and pounding for a longer time . The masses of rock on the upper surface of the glacier , on the contrary , are carried along on its back without undergoing any such friction . Lying side by side or one above another , without being subject to pressure from the ice , they retain , both in the lateral and medial moraines , and even in the terminal moraines , their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whenever , therefore , a glacier melts , it is evident that the lower materials will be found covered by the angular surfacematerials now brought into immediate contact with the former in consequence of the disappearance of the intervening ice . The'most careful observations and surveys have shown this everywhere to be the case ; wherever a large tract of glacier has disappeared , the moraines , with their large angular boulders , are found resting upon this bottom layer of rounded materials scattered through a paste of mud and sand . We shall see hereafter how far we can follow these traces , and what they tell us of the past history of glaciers , and of the changes the climates of our globe have undergone .
