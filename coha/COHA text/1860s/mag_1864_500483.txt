txt TEMPTATION . A LITERAL translation of this remarkable prose-poem was kindly placed in our hands by Prof. Podbielski . It is allegorical throughout , every phase of its marvellous symbolism resting upon dire and tragic truth . The many times murdered Mother is of course Poland . We hope that the publication of this prophetic vision of her great son , patriot , poet , statesman , and sage , as he undoubtedly was , may excite a vivid interest at the present hour , when that heroic but unhappy country is again struggling for life and freedom . In its present English form , Temptation* is reverently dedicated to the patriot sons of the Mother of heroes , by MARTHA W. CooK . Alas , crimeoned with blood and swollen with tears run our troubled life-waves I From the depths and whirlpools of the stormful currents sounds the moan of eternal sorrow I Behind roars the bottomless abyss , black with the gloomy mists rising ever from the woes of the Past : Before lies the far-off Heaven , burning and blazing with flames red as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cold , hopeless , and murky , That from each as he floats onward is forced the cry : WOE I THE cuasa 15 UPOR ME I ' MOTHER , many times murdered I Unhappy mother ! with the long and countless blades of thy ever-green grasses , with the waving stems of thy grain fields , thou wilt bind our undying memories closely to thee , but henceforth must thy sons wander and suffer , as they love thee . Behind them , from sea to sea , is the Grave ; before them , wheresoever they may roam , the Sun set ; while monarchs and merchants curse the endless progression I The Living can not understand those reared on the bosom of the Deadhuman faces grow pale at the approach of the spectres-at the echo of their footsteps the home-fires glimmer and fficker low on the hearthstone-the mother hides her child  --  the wife leads away the husband that he may not clasp hands with the wandering exile ,  --  the evening star alone , the star of graves , smiles from Heaven on them ! Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind swept over the Pines , did not the mystic murmurs , sacred as the prayers of the Priest , say to you : Nowhere there will you find // your God ! ' The spaces are filled with the giant skeletons torn from the dim woods ; they are chained and clamped with iron and fed with steam ; the eagles soar not in the air above them , nor do the glad birds twitter in the swaying branches ; none among you may mount the strong horse of the desert and fly afar over the boundless steppes , rejoicing in his arrowy swiftness ; - you are alone in the midst of the world ! As you wander on , poor exiles , your very gratitude is half disdain ! When they lead you into cities without castles or temples , where trade and commerce rule ; among whitewashed houses where the spirit of Beauty is not , and the green window-shutters are the sole adornment-murmur ye : THE DEAD ! On the shores of the seas when you dwell with Jews , Armenians , and Greeks , quarrelling forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor hearing the thunder as it booms over the waves-murmur ye : THE DEAD ! When women in rich attire move around you , and you feel that the faint fluttering of the silken robe is far more spiritual than the life-breath of their souls-murmur ye : Tim DEAD ! Float on , then , like the sacred whispers from the unhewn forests ! The world will not know you , because you are of the race sprung from coffins ; born and cradled in coffins ; but as you rise from the grave , strew upon the ground beneath your feet the mouldering rags of your shrouds - and he , seated on the verge of the abyss , on the steep and slippery declivity ; he , robed in the royal purple of power , will not survive your Resurrectionbut must himself descend into the coffin ! I saw imaged before me , as in a wondrous vision , the varied scenes and changes as it were of a long life-rising , progressing , and vanishing , as if bound in a single day , beginning with the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in my vision that the morning was strangely transparent . No clouds dulled the ether above . Far over the wide green space rose the sun , and in front of the House on the Hill stood a horse already saddled , impatiently wounding the velvety grass with his iron hoofs , and snuffing with wide nostrils the fresh breeze from the valley . Near him stood his young master . The light in his blue eye was bright as the young beam of the day . He had one foot in the stirrup , and the other on the soft home-turf ; with one hand caressing the long waving mane of the steed , and the other clasped in the grasp of the man from whom he was taking leave-they knew not for how long , but yet felt it was not forever . Words were pouring from the heart of the one into the heart of the other . The elder , he who stood on the ground and was to move on on foot , kept his gaze steadily fixed on the rocks and forests lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised eyes , gazed into the sky , as if absorbing its light in the blue lustrous pupils ; and when he spoke , his voice was like the fresh breath of spring . The elder spoke more slowly , almost sternly , as though advising , warning , beseechingas if he loved deeply , yet doubted , feared ; but the younger had no fear , no doubts-he pledged himself and vowed-threw himself first into the arms of his friend , then leaped into his saddle . He pushed his horse rapidly on , swift as the arrow skims the plain , or the mountain stream plunges below . A cloud of servants poured forth from the halls of the ancient House , and followed their young Lord . He who remained behind , knelt ; and fragments of his prayer were brought me by the wind . 0 Heavenly // Father ! let not this blooming soul wither away upon this arid earth ! Lead it not into the temptation of human servitude ; remove from it all sinful stain ! Let it serve Thee alone ! Thee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although sunk in silence , as if wrapped in deep meditation , scarcely knowing whether to indulge in the dim prophecies then surging his soul , or to prolong his prayers . Then I saw him start , clasp his hands forcibly together  --  and again his words were borne to me by the wind . 0 Heavenly Father ! I ask Thee not to sweeten the bitter cup of life for my friend ; I know that all who live must suffer ; but , 0 merciful God , spare him the blush of shame , the infamy of weak-ness ! ' Then I saw the Wanderer rise from his knees , descend the hill , and make his way on foot through the forest to the distant rocks . About high noon of the same day they met again before the gate of a great city . The young man was still on his horse , his fair brow already darkened by the heat of the sun ; the dew from the fresh home-turf was quite dry upon his stirrups , and the glitter of the steel dimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearied with his rapid flight through the distant space , but the blue eye of the youth still sparkled with its early fire . The elder , gray from head to foot with the dust of the road , seated himself on a stone by the wayside . The youth jumped lightly to the earth , and threw himself into the arms of his friend . I saw him give his horse in charge to his servants , take the arm of his companion , enter the gate of the great city , and lead him to the imperial Palace . In one of the inner chambers they sat down together to rest . They conversed however in whispers , as if they feared the ear of the enemy even through the massive stone walls . Stretching himself on the soft Persian carpet , the younger raised the cup of wrought silver to his thirsty lip . But when he handed it to the elder , he refused to taste the wine from the rich goblet . Nor would he look upon the tapestried walls , or the objects of luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to him by his young companion . At last he rose , and taking the hand of the youth , led him to a window , from which the entire city was seen lying below , with the moving crowds of the populous nation . The immense city , wonderfully monotonous in its whitewashed walls ! the immense nation , wonderfully monotonous in its black garments ! The young man looked on curiously ; the wanderer sighed , and said : When they shall lead you into cities without castles or temples , where the spirit of freedom is chained , murmur ye : THE DEAD ! ' But the younger continued to gaze with ever-growing interest . Carriages filled with women dressed in brilliant hues were rapidly driving by , drawn by strong , fleet horses . He saw one drive aside from the throng , the snowy veil and white draperies of the fair one within fluttering and floating far on the breeze , as if the flying chariot were borne onward by the outspread sails . The Wanderer sighed , and said : When women in rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint fluttering of the snowy robe is more spiritual than the life-breath of their soulsmurmur ye : THE DEAD ! ' The young man seemed not to hear the words of his friend . Heavy masses of lurid clouds gathered from every direction , and obscured the face of the sky . How different the hour of the gloomy noon from that of the fresh , transparent morning ! The men before whom the People of the Black Nation kneel and prostrate themselves now began to move through the streets . Their short garments // glittered with gold , and were richly embroidered in gorgeous colors . They wore long thin swords at their sides , and thick tufts of plumes on their heads . Shouting with harsh voices , they passed on in power , striking the children who were lingering in the road as they moved forward . The children cried and wept ; the crowd drew back and fled ; and they remained alone upon the Great Square . More and more of them were ever thronging there ; more and more courteously they ever bowed to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until at last One rode forward on a steed richly eaparisoned - and then they all fell down with their faces upon the ground - as if he were the Lord of Life and Death . Then said the Wanderer : He is already on the verge of the abyss , on the slope of the steep and slippery declivity ; he , robed in the purple of Power , must himself descend into the coffin ! ' But the young man riveted his gaze on the magnificence of the rider , as if absorbing the diamond glitter into the lustrous pupils of his eyes , as in the morning they had absorbed and reflected the clear blue of the skies . He seemed not to hear the words of his friend . When they were earnestly repeated to him , he covered his face with his hands , and tenderly uttered the holy name of the murdered Mother , as if the love of childhood were upon his heart . The W*nderer pressed him to his breast , and said : Look not upon them ! Look not upon them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he again threw himself down to rest upon the Persian carpet . As the Wanderer rose to depart , I heard the prayer again rising to God from his divining soul : 0 Heavenly Father ! even at the burning noon of this bitter trial , I implore Thee for him whom I love ! 0 God ! I now entreat Thee to work a miracle in his behalf  --  to sweeten the bitter cup of life for this young , eager , thirsting soul ! Deliver it from the temptations with which Thou hast seen good to surround the strong on this earth , led like him into these snares ! Let him not fall , I beseech Thee , as did even the mighty and beautiful angels round Thy Throne , when the thirst for power was upon them . Save him , 0 God ! ' The young man remained alone , utterly alone , in the midst of the great city , and was soon forced to seek companionship with his fellow beings . It was strange , meanwhile , how black the heavens grew , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead . I saw him now constantly in the streets , the rooms , and in the midst of the people : he fascinated my gaze as if I saw only him . Under the calm of a tranquil face , he concealed bitter torment , intense suffering . Evil thoughts are winding through him , like swarms of black and poisonous worms , while the good are also thronging near him , like clouds of bright blue fireflies . The worms crawl over his heart , boring and bleeding it as they writhe ; the fireflies would burn out the black congested gore , and cure the festering wounds , but new swarms of reptiles are forever sliming into life , and ever deeper and more gangrened are the wounds they make . Everywhere danger , everywhere torment ; there is no human being whom he may trust ! He too must learn to deceive in turn , to betray even women and children ; must learn to lie as the masterpiece of art . He attains skill in the profession , and can command looks , smiles , tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear eye , once rivalling the young beam of day , no longer flashes from his pupils . Pity him , 0 God ! his very garments become a lie ; he throws aside the costume of his nation , in which he once rode so freely over the boundless steppe . He mounts on his head the tall tufts of plumes ; he girds the thin sword to his side ; and I saw in my dream that the // people began to fall back before him , and bow as he drew near . But I saw that the steed of the desert refused to recognize his master when he entered the courtyard of the Palace . In vain he pats , with his own hand , the wavy silken mane : no neigh of joy now answers his caress ; he strives to leap upon him as in the morning of this eventful day , but the haughty charger rears , stands erect upon his hind legs , and refuses to be mounted . Enraged beyond control , he thrusts his long sword into the glossy flanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and flies thundering afar , rattling and clashing his iron hoofs on the pavement , marking his track with a long line of glittering sparks , flashing but to die in the dying light of evening ! The hour of twilight is already on the earth ! Again , for the third time in that day of life , met the Wanderer and his friend . They stood together in a Church , which was without the gates , and the cross on its towers was different from those on the Basilicas within the walls of the city . The altar was without adornment , and , as well as the walls and ceilings , was shrouded in the deepest mourning . Three tapers only were upon it , and 1 ; hey struggled vainly with the surrounding gloom . I saw the Wanderer take one of these lights , and gaze , with a look of woe , upon the face of his friend . The young man was silent , he found no utterance , he had lost the secret of revealing , by honest words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in the long wild cry which burst spasmodically from his lips . In it might be read the seduction and destruction of a young spirit , not consenting to its own shame and ruin ! He laid his head on the strong shoulder of his friend , and closed his heavy eyelids , as if he dreamed , in this trying moment , it would be possible for him thus to close them forever . But the Wanderer , suddenly calling him back to consciousness , said : Follow me I follow me , that thou mayst remember forever the Form of the murdered Mother ! ' So saying , he led the young man to a low door which opened behind the Great Altar . A whirlwind , as if from plains of ice , blew upon them from the subterranean passages below , and the flame of the taper streamed upon the blast , swaying and torn into a line of dying sparks . And thus they commenced the plunge into the very bosom of night , descending ever lower and lower , exploring depth after depth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow and winding passages , and stood in the sublime silence of the immensity of space . Their taper had long ago gone out , but they needed not its flickering light . The swamp-fires of the night , the corpselights , the will-o ' - the- wisps , sometimes fell like falling stars ; sometimes rose like rising moons . Countless cemeteries seemed moving on in this weird light , one solemnly following the other , and on the dark gate of each glittered , as if graved in frosted silver , the name of the Murdered Nation , and on the white crosses gleaming within , the names of her martyred children . Vast piles of skeletons , of bones and skulls , lay in the path of the young man , and as he advanced he read the glorious inscriptions . It now seemed to him that the ghosts of the buried were also moving on before him , increasing constantly in number , and all moaning as they sped on , until at last they seemed to condense into a murky vapor like a trailing stormcloud , growing ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of sad , but spiritstirring national songs . The air gleamed with the flashing of sabres and wild waving of standards ; conflagrations and flames filled the intervening spaces , like vivid flashes of restless // lightning , now gleaming , now sinking into the bosom of the cloud . Faster and faster , farther and farther whirls the cloud of spirits . Then in my dream I saw them suddenly descend , drivea over the earth like the withered leaves of autumn-beaten low upon the ground and drifting on like the summer 's dust - while a strong cry burst from the driven shadows : 0 God , have mercy upon us ! ' The Wanderer stopped before the gate of an open sepulchre , on which was graven the name of the many times Murdered . The letters blazed with a soft lambent flame , and he fell reverently upon his knees . Penetrated with mystic awe , he quivered from head to foot when he arose , and wept tenderly as he crossed the threshold . A soft light , like that of an evening late in autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy Coffin as it lay on the gentle slope of a hill ; a giant Pine stood at its head , and in its topmost branches perched the Eagle , pierced to the heart and sleeping in its own blood . Within the coffin lay the sacred Form , with the cross on her breast , the veil on her face , the fetters on her hands , and the crown upon her forehead . I saw six such hills rising one after the other , separated from one another by the long grass , through which , in place of sunny brooks , flowed crimson streams of human gore . Hilts and shivered fragments of broken swords , overgrown with weeds and covered with rust , were lying scattered in every direction through the rank grass . On each of the six hills lay the same Coffin ; the same Form . But always more and more strongly surged the streams of human blood ; heavier and heavier grew the chains on the hands of the Dead ; and paler and paler the dim autumnal light . At the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold ; the currents of blood were frozen ; the icicles hung from the branches of the Pine ; the Eagle lay in his congealed gore ; and in place of the veil , the face of the six times murdered Mother was closely covered with a sheet of snow . When the young man reached this spot of gloom , he fell with his face upon the frozen earth , and cursed his life ! In the distance sounded the moans of the shadows left at the gate of the sepulchre ; he bowed his head and wept . He heard them ask : Is the six times Murdered really dead ? will she rise no more to deliver her faithful children from mortal anguish ? ' The Wanderer replied not , but looked with eyes of melancholy love upon his friend who had thrown himself upon the frozen earth , and gently raised him in his strong arms . Then rose the wail of all the armies of the grave ; they broke the silence of death with loud and fearful cries : 0 Heavenly Father , Thou hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for our Saint is really dead ! ' The Wanderer answered the cry , and his voice pealed like distant thunder . Blaspheme not ! Our Saint yet breathes ? I see her lying in her last coffin on the hill of ice-there is no seventh beyond it-from it comes the Resurrection ! ' The wails and sobs of the spirits suddenly ceased , and a murmuring chant of the Mother 's was entoned , low and sweet as the first sigh of a germing hope . The young man now perceived , for hitherto he had not seen it , the illimitable space beyond the coffin . Afar over the infinite blue broke the growing splendor of the early dawn  --  the clash and clamor of battles yet unborn broke through the veil of Time  --  and above it all he heard the Mother 's ancient hymn of victory ! The young dawn shone but for a moment , the clash of battle ceased , the song of triumph died upon the earthe gloomy silence of the twilight was again upon them , and frost and cold upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the still feet of the fettered Form ; together // listened to the faint breathing from the icy lips , catching it even through the veil of snow shrouding the sacred face ; together they ascended the frozen hill , bowing their heads in their hands to hide their tears . I saw them again as they were returning by the same road , and overheard them binding themselves with fearful oaths . The Wanderer took leave of the young maa at the entrance of the church , saying with wonderfully tender and conjuring tones : Be not deceived by those who would fain ruin thy soul , and blot out thy name from the number of honorable sounds on earth ! Remember , whatsoever the splendor of the things thou shalt this night see , they are but deceptions from the lowest Hell ! Then placing his hand on the heart of the young man , he prayed : 0 Heavenly Father ! have mercy upon him and upon me , for if he withstands not this terrible Temptation , Thou knowest we shall both have lived in vain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this they parted , and went their way on different routes . It was already night in the great city . Innumerable throngs were crowding the streets , all moving in the same direction , to the palace lighted with a thousand lamps , sounding with music , and gay with the dance . Old and young , men and women thronged the brazen stairs leading to the upper saloons ; hurrying on as eagerly , as unceasingly as if ascending into Hea-ven ! The hours of the night passed slowly by , seeming longer to me than the whole of the preceding day . It was almost one o'clock before I again saw the young man , and the traces of the oaths he had taken were cunningly hidden under smiles . Groups of servants stood around him ; he carelessly threw them his cloak , and climbed with the rest the brazen stairs . He was richly dressed ; the magnificent guest was worthy of the splendor of the wedding feast . He entered gracefully , and gazed curiously on the thousands who were dancing around him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall ; broken swords were wrought into the walls like mosaics ; the flags of the conquered nations were draped in their varied hues across the vaulted ceiling ; but as he looked on all these trophies of power , I saw him suddenly turn pale with rage , and bite his lips until the blood followed the pressure of his teeth ; but then the whirling crowds caught him in their midst-violins , harps , flutes and horns poured the reeling air into his dizzied brain-clouds of incense intoxicated his senses-piled and mossy carpets luxuriously yielded to the pressure of his feet-rainbow hues shifted gayly before his dazzThd eyes-until giddy , fascinated , stimulated , he sank upon a pile of cushions , resting his hot temples in his burning palms , dreaming of snowy hands and taper fingers , of azure eyes and cheeks like rose leaves . As he thus rested , I heard the bell heavily toll one ; I felt that this long night was in its darkest hour ! When he raised his eyes , he saw , through the long vista of the illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stood above the moving sea of dancers ; upon it sat the Autocrat of Life and Death ; and above him waved the canopy of flags torn from the dying nations . The young man started , for he saw one among them dyed in gore , and tattered into rags , and from its torn streamers , drop by drop , the blood was ever falling ; but no one saw or heeded it save himself . When this sight fell upon his reeling gaze , he determined to repel with all his force the allurements of temptation , and again his eye gleamed blue and pure as it had done in the early morning . A movement now began in the crowd . It dispersed , divided , and formed into long lines upon the right and the left , leaving a wide , open pathway through // the whole length of the long vista of the apartments . The Lord of the Palace descended from his Throne , and moved through the living walls as if he were a God , while all prostrated themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went directly to the spot where the young man was seated . Nearer and nearer he approached , wondrously beautiful and strong . The young man rose and looked boldly into his eyes . The Master of Life and Death did not frown upon him , but said gently : Come , let us take a stroll together ; I will show you the wonders of my Palace ! ' The youth stood as if transfixed to the spot , but the Lord of Life and Death drew closer to him , stooped and pressed a kiss on his brow , and led him away with easy grace . Although he seemed to see the coffin of the murdered Mother ever winding on before him , the young man accompanied the Monarch . His arm trembled with the quick beating of his boiling blood as it lay on the hard one of the Autocrat , who , thunder as he might to the bowing throng prostrating themselves before him , continued to speak in soft tones and with a noble , courteous air to his present companion . He spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the murdered Mother , as if her assassination did not weigh upon his conscience . He did not seem to have the least doubt that she was really dead , vanished forever from the face of the earth . He artfully pointed out to the young man another immense future , * graven , as he said , in the Book of Fate . He painted it in the most alluring colors , awakening his young desires for its attainment ; he spared no promises , and as if he held himself to be one of God 's prophets , he parodied inspiration . The unhappy young man turned his eyes toward the ground , away from the handsome face , as though it had been that * Paneclayism ? of Antichrist . Each word of the Tempter fell like a drop of poison on his heart , engendering and hatching the worms within . They walked together through the long ranges of apartments , the close ranks of men prostrating themselves as they passed , until they struck with their foreheads the malachites wrought into the tessellated floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gates of bronze upon the order of the Master were suddenly thrown open , while the mass behind , lifting their heads from the ground , looked enviously after them . Behold , this is my Treasury , ' said theMonarch . ' Look , andhavefaithin the extent of my power ! * The young man looked before him . He was standing at the portals of deep mines of wealth , endlessly extended . Alas ! the glowing splendor from the hills and valleys burned into the blue eyes of the young man ; his pupils rapidly absorbed the molten torrents of gold and silver ; circles of light from amethyst , opal , and emerald , bent like rainbows round the azure orbs . The subterranean flames roared and crackled ; the hills were shaken to their centre the caves were heaving in their depths , and fresh , glittering , golden , diamantine lumps came ever gushing from the fused and seething mass . But strange sounds were ever and anon heard amidst the hissing and sputtering of the boiling metals . Long cries came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clatter as of chains sounded from the abyss ; muttered curses ; and bent and wretched human figures were seen moving over swards of diamonds and precious stones , like the dark stains passing athwart the bright face of the moon . The eye of the Monarch then flamed with wrath . Sometimes clanging their chains as they moved their fettered limbs , these melancholy figures raised to him their suppliant hands , begging with anguished cries for one drop of water , for one // moment of respite to breathe the free air of heaven . He vouchsafed to them no answer , and with every moment the wretched and emaciated shadows fell from utter exhaustion into the molten metals seething in the depths of the mine . But what mattered that , since with every instant , new bands of living shadows , equally fettered , doomed , and wretched , arrived to fill the vacant places I The young man thought he had seen some of these melancholy faces before in the high places of the earth , that the noble traits once had been dear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the features were rapidly lost in the depths of the succeeding gloom . The roar of the seething , fusing metals deafened the sound of the groans from the chained and brokenhearted miners . And as I gazed , an all-pervading splendor , like the golden calm of the Desert , settled over all , covering with glittering veil the anguish which had been revealed . As this light overflowed the scene with its brilliant haze , the gates of bronze clapped to with heavy clang . The Master of Life and Death took leave of the young man , and as he departed , said : When the great bell again strikes , be in the Hall of the Throne ; thy seat at my Banquet is next my own . As the young man turned to move away , the throng greeted him with shouts and cheers . Many knelt to kiss his hand , because it had touched the hand of the Master . They asked him what music he would hear , and when his choice was made , the grand orchestra rolled it forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jewelled vases , kneeling as he took che cup . He marvelled , and at first scorned the homage , but again I saw him look proudly round him , and assume an air of command . In a recess of the most exquisite beauty , veiled by groves of perfumed flowers , he meets resplendent groups of married women , blooming clusters of budding maidens . They surround him as he enters , greeting him with lovely smiles ; and scattering rose leaves o'er him . His cheeks flame as with fever ; his blood boils in his veins ; he grows giddy , faint : - alas , he feels at last that he might find happiness in the Palace of the mortal enemy of his Mother ! This feeling falls upon him like a thunderbolt , and scathes his heart . He turns to fly , but they pursue , the perfumed wind bearing onward and wafting around him the full drapery of their floating trains of luxury . Their long ringlets kiss his cheeks , and weave their nets around him . Through two long hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw him struggle , confused , bewildered , reeling , giddy , dazzled , sometimes almost yielding to temptation , sometimes earnestly imploring the Heavenly Father for strength to resist delusion . As if in despair , I saw him hurrying through the long suite of apartments in search of a sword to pierce his weak , vacillating heart , but no arms were here to be found . Sometimes I saw him rush to meet the alluring Circes of the Palace , as if seeking their fascinations ; then , suddenly turning upon them , he would curse and insult the seductive Sirens . I saw him tear from them their veils of suow , rend them asunder , and trample the costly fragments under his feet . They knelt , wept , and humiliated themselves before him . They prayed for love , saying : Once , only once , we implore thee , confess that thou lovest ! ' Utter madness came upon him ; electric flashes fired his veins ; rapture tingled through every fibre of his young frame ; and in the voluptuous delirium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' As he spake , he caught in his arms the Houri of the foreign race ; he fastened his burning lips upon her rosebud mouth ; and by the magic of her breath she drew him on to the Hall of the Throne ! // There sat the Master of Life and Death , with the flags and standards of the conquered nations floating around and above him . As the youth and maiden entered , I again heard the great bell toll the hour . Throngs of courtiers stood around the Throne . Slowly the curtain of inwrought tapestry rose from the platina door . Those who had been waiting beyond its threshold for admittance , were summoned by the Heralds to appear . Ambassadors from the Kings of the East and the Kings of the West entered the Presence Chamber . On they filed in long and solemn procession . They all bowed as they passed the Throne , each one depositing an urn of pure gold at the feet of the Monarch . The urns were filled with the ashes of those who had fallen in battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from different parts of the world . The Grand Duke entered last in the train , , *ie was clad in the ermine only worn by Princes , and as he bowed his head , he placed the last urn on the floor . The young man started  --  the name of the murdered Mother was deeply graven on the sculptured swells . Then all grew dark before him , he saw neither the Throne of the Monarch , nor the fair girl still clinging to his arm . But his ear quickened as his eye grew dim , and the question of the Monarch rang loudly through his brain : Are they all really dead , and will they rise from the grave no more ? ' And as if with one voice answered the Ambassadors : They are all surely dead , and will rise no more forever . " At a sign from the Monarch , the courtiers approached , took up the urns , and solemnly deposited them upon the columns of black marble ranged on either side of the Hall . Flaming torches were then handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the court , and held over the open crypt of the urn . The ashes within kindled , and burned with a dim , bluish flame . The pale smoke rose from the shrine , spread through the air , and wafted the smell of Death to the nostrils of the Lord ! It now seemed to the young man as if all he had seen at the hour of twilight was but a dream ; he looked upon these throngs as the sole masters of the world , and on their Monarch as omnipotent and eternal . At this moment the table of festival rose in the Hall , everywhere surrounded by the blazing funereal urns . The maiden begged the bridegroom to take his seat at the banquet ; the Master , descending from his Throne , placed his arm in his , and led him to the place of honor , at his side . The great bell again tolled the hour . The guests also took their places at the feast . Directly in front of the young man stood the column of black marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And whenever he saw her holy name , his long lashes veiled his sinking eyes ; but his bride constantly recalled his attention to the blue flames of the crypt . More and more madly , fiercely , fearfully , his reeling and wretched soul struggled to regain its ancient faith , to return to its early hopes ; but temptation was around him ; his brain was bewildered ; his understanding darkened ; and madness within . Healths poisonous to his heart went round , and he was forced to drain them in honor of the Master . An inward shivering disjointed his members , unstrung his nerves , heart and frame fainted into weakness , a dew cold as death covered his temples , and his head fell wearily upon his breast  --  the walls , the floors , the ceilings , the men , the burning urns , danced , reeled , and tottered in wild confusion before him . The murmuring voices , the buzz of sound , the swell of the triumphant music , the strange words of the foreign bride , mingled and boomed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swooning man  --  and so the last hours passed away ! // Temptation . He still lived , if life be measured by the wild throbs of the heart . Like the clap of doom the last hour struck upon his ear . He opened his heavy eyelids , the blue Itames from the urns were dying out . The Master of Life and Death , graciously smiling and courteously inclining toward him , said : Guest of my Banquet , the hour has struck in which thou art to swear to serve me ; in which thou must abjure thine ancient faith and name . ' As he spake , he threw to him across the table jewelled orders and diamond crosses , saying : Wear these in memory of me ! , The Herald then drew near , and read to him from the Black Book the form of abjuration . The agonizing and swooning man mechanically repeated the words one by one after him , not even hearing the sound of his own voice . His head had fallen on the bosom of his bride , his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiteness of death  --  and so he uttered all the prescribed words until the very last was said ! Scarcely had he finished , when the Master of Life and Death arose and said : Servant of my servants art thou now-beware ! shouldst thou prove false to thy oath , the rope of the hangman surely awaits thee . ' Then he broke into a loud , coarse laugh of triumph I The unfortunate man raised his wretched head , and his first look fell upon the urn of his murdered Mother . Th place of her name of glory another word was standing now : Infamy , ' - he looked again ; he shrieked aloud , Infamy ; ' and started from his seat with the last effort of his failing strength . Infamy ! ' shouted the thousands from before , behind , from either side . Infamy ' sounded from the ceilings of the Palace , the Hall of the Throne , the deep mines and limitless Treasury ! Some among the crowd hastened to greet him by his new name , while others fastened to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded him to bow before them , while others ordered him to trample under foot the still smouldering ashes of his Mother ! That thought sent the blood back in hot torrents to his heart . He broke through the surrounding throng , rushed on , fled from the Presence Chamber , eagerly looking for his bride . He saw her leaning on the arm of another , mocking and jeering with the rest . He glides on behind the statues , steals along the recesses , is discovered , and again flies before the enemy . The Palace winds before him into countless labyrinths-nowhere is shelter to be found-sneers , menaces , insults , are everywhere around him  --  but worse than all , the curse is now within his soul ! Then he suddenly tums to meet his enemies ; he baffles them at first , but countless numbers are upon bim . They hurl him to the ground , trample him under foot , and pass on singing a song from the land of his Mother . As he rises , fresh numbers assail him , he bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming , bleeding , sinking , he is again driven back , again forced to seek an outlet from the Palace . Thus fighting , running , falling , fainting , he makes his way until the first dim dawn of day , and as it breaks , he falls heavily down the brazen staircase , and rolls below into the court of the Palace . Here strong arms seize him , and bear him rapidly away to the steps of the church  --  the same church which he had left in the evening twilight . It is the hour of the young dawn , but the sun of this earth will never rise for him again ! Light will awake the world , but it will shine into his blue eyes no more ! He awakes to consciousness on the steps of the church , and finds himself face to face alone with the Wanderer . He is mute in his despair . The Wanderer , regarding him sternly , says : In other times and scenes thou mightat perchance have been a hero , but the // Fates doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to preserve thy virtue ! The visible reality prevailed with thee above the invisible , holy , and eternal truth ! Alas , thou art lost ! ' Give me back my horse ! ' cried the young man , as life again began to flow through his veins . Give me the free dress of the steppes , give me my arms , and thou shalt see that I know how to revenge the wrongs inflicted on my brethren , to redress my own infamy ! ' He grasped the hand of his friend , and threw himself into his arms , quivering with rage . Far more sadly than before , the Wanderer replied : The hour for bold and open defiance is not yet near . It is the time for silent sacrifice . But even shouldst thou live until the Day of Judgment , the hour of Resurrection , thy brethren will always number thee among those who have renounced the Mother . Hark ! thy enemies are in pursuit of thee , already near . Should they capture thee , thou must be the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport and butt of all their bitter jests throughout the remnant of thy wretched life . One only refuge remains for thee ! ' And as he spoke , he drew his glittering sword . The young man understood his meaning . With dauntless couruge he tore aside the covering from his breast . Strike ! ' he exclaimed . I die as a true son of the many times murdered Mother-honor to her holy name forever and ever ! ' The Wanderer groaned from the depths of his soul . He plunged the sharp cold steel into the young naked heart . The unfortunate victim fell without a moan . He fell in the first rays of the rising sun , and in the same hour in which but yesterday , full of strength and hope , he had mounted his swift horse from the green hometurf ; urging him down the hill to push eagerly over the broad steppe of life . He fell in silence , but his dying eye again flashed forth a light rivalling the young beam of Day . The Wanderer knelt beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 0 Heavenly Father ! Thou knowest that I loved him better than aught else on earth ! As long as it was possible , I shielded him from the Temp-. tation of Hell , and in the first moment of his fall , I tore his soul out from the grasp of the enemy , and sent it back to Thee ! Save it in eternity , merciful Father ! Let the crimson tide poured out by me , be joined to that sea of innocent blood which is ever wailing and moaning *rt the foot of Thy Throne ! Let it with that sea fall upon the head of the Tempters ! ' After these words I saw him , with the point of the same sword , draw blood from under his own heart , and write with the-sharp red blade on the stone above the head of the dead : SENT HOME BY THE HAND OF A FRIEND ! The echoing steps and voices of the pursuers fell loudly on the ear ; they were close at hand . The Wanderer arose , and rapidly disappeared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus paesed and ended that one day of my vision ! O Mother , many times murdered ! When thou shalt waken from thy long sleep , and again rest on the long grass of the home turg again hear the holy whispers of thy unhewn forests green from sea to sea , again feel thy youth returning upon thee , thou wilt remember thy long night of death , the terrible phantoms of thy protracted agonies . Weep not then , 0 Mother ! weep not for those who fell in glorious battle , nor for those who perished on alien soil - although their flesh was torn by the vulture and devoured by the wolf ; they were still happy ! Neither weep for those who died in the dark and silent dungeon underground by the hand of the executioner , though the dismal // prison-lamp was their only star , and the harsh words of the oppressor the last farewell they heard on earth-they too were happy ! But drop a tear , 0 Mother ! One tear of tender pity for those who were deceived by thy Murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by misty veils woven of specious deceptions , when the command of the tyrant had no power to tear their true hearts from thee ! Alas , Mother , these victims have suffered the most of all thy martyred children ! Deceitful hopes , born but to die , like blades of naked steel , forever pierced their breasts ! Thousands of fierce combats , unknown to fame , were waging in their souls , combats fuller of bitter suffering than the bloody battles thundering on in the broad light of the sun , clashing with the gleam of steel , and booming with the roar of artillery . No glory shone on the dim paths of thy deceived sons ; thy reproachful phantom walked ever beside them , as part of their own shadow ! The glittering eye of the enemy lured them to the steep slopes of ice , down into the abyss of eternal snow , and at every step into the frozen depths , their tears fell fast for thee ! They waited until their hearts withered in the misery of hope long deferred ; until their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer move their emaciated limbs in the fetters of their invisible chain ; still conscious of life , they moved as living corpses with frozen hearts-alone amidst a hating People-alone even in the sanctuary of their own homes-alone forever on the face of the earth ! My Mother ! When thou shalt again live in thy olden glory , shed a tear over their wretched fate , over the agony of agonies , and whisper upon their dark and silent graves , the sublime word : PARDON !
