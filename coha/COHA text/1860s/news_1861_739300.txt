txt It is well known that hundreds , and sometimes thousands , of pounds of projectiles are thrown away before one ball hits the mark , on account of the rapid , nervous and careless manner in which all men , except professional riflemen , fire . It is probable that the great majority of the rank and file could not hit a man at the modern rifle-musket range , under the most favorable auspices ; add to this want of skill the hurry and excitement of battle , and the harmlessness of the musket may be accounted for . In fact , it is really formidable only because it has a bayonet at its end , except at close quarters , if it happens to have a charge in it . Therefore , the military authorities condemn a breech-loading arm , since its increased rapidity of action will only throw away a still greater quantity of innocuous lead . Now we do not see the force of this reasoning . The rapid loading of the musket does not cause the shot to go amiss , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be aimed and discharged  --  the especial and only test of marksmanship  --  any the more carelessly because it is breech-loading . The soldier has all the more time to aim properly , while firing a given number of rounds in a given time , if that occupied in loading is reduced one-half or more . Outsiders look at the subject in this way :  --  the value of a firearm consists in its being loaded , because it is then ready for use at the right instant , and the time at which a shot may be made effective , in charges , resisting cavalry , etc , is measured by instants , and not by minutes . ' ire are told that the Zouaves and others at the Bull Run battle were often compelled to fly , or at least to allow the enemy to do sb , because they had not tinge to load . Any one can understand that when a man has discharged his piece , and then rushed into . a bayonet or pistol fight , he has had no opportunity to reload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reload on the run or in the midst of a skirmish ; while the very thing he wants , of all others , in that skirmish or at the end of that charge , or when in any manner he gets close enough to the enemy , especially artillerists or cavalry , to make a sure shot , is a charge in his musket . It has happened and will happen often enough , that the very time when a soldier 's fire has been drawn , and before he has had even an expert 's time to reload , will be the precise instant when he could make the best use of a cartridge , if he only had it in the chamber of his piece . If a soldier 's musket were always reloaded upon the instant of firing . he would indeed be for- ? midable in close quarters ; he could throw up a breastwork of such bodies as were armed with the bayonet alone . Now , the more rapidly a gun can be loaded , the more nearly it approaches this perfection . Firing carelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitated by rapid loading . All this would appear to be peculiarly true of carbines for cavalry service . A thoroughly practicable breech ' loading arm , then , is a great desideratum . We have referred on another occasion to the difficulty of producing it  --  the difficulty of making a perfectly fitting and yet easily adjusted joint between the barrel and the breechpiece , out of materials which arc constantly changing their shape as they change their temperature . Among various American contrivances , however , that of Mr. STOnM , before described , seems to meet the demands of the case in England , where the American inventions disregarded at home arc often put into good service , however little all things American amount to , in English eyes , at the present writing . The London Times , of the 13th ult. , calls it the " most perfect of all breech-loaders , " ? a reputation which it has fully won in recent trials by the National Rifle Association . We hope the proper department of our own Government will at least look into an invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taken up by other nations .
