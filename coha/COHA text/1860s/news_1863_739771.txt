txt A SPECK or WAR IN WASHINGTON. - The Associated Press of this City was favored , yesterday morning , with an owlish dispatch from Washington . the gist of which was , that ? ? the United States might become . involved in a war with England , " and that war , however undesirable , " is not the greatest of evils . " But as England is not the only country just now amenable to American criticism . it is added in the dispatch , that as to France 's peccadilloes , they may be postponed to a more convenient season , and that the Emperor of the French may make use of the grace of our delay , to withdraw from Mexico and get out of the range of our displeasure ! We have done full justice to the sage observations contained in this Washington dispatch , in the free rendering we have given them . Perhaps our readers are not unfamiliar with such sentiments . Perhaps they have read similar expressions of opinion and of feeling , in scores of newspapers , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . But these out-givings never obtained that profound attention . which it is now implied they are entitled to , in the fact that they are gravely forwarded to the New-York papers by telegraph , at an established commercial valuation of so much for each expressive word ! Let us look at the matter , then , in its more serious aspect . Is it possible we may become involved in a war with England ? ' Who would have believed it ! Is it possible that France may , by discretiori , escape our anger ? Is it not incredible ! But the Washington dispatch affirms these two important truths . And the telegraphic reporter does not rely on his own unaided resources of diplomatic shrewdness to predicate as in the premises . He assures the country that an evening paper published in Washington , ( which shall be - - ? - - - - - nameless in this connection as the dispatch has the smack of an advertising dodge , ) has uttered the vaticinations , which the reporter has repeated in his dispatch at our cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an editorial " to which much semiofficial importance is attached . " This admonishing remark of the telegraphic reporter quite " does the business " for us outs:de , barbarians . We are stunned and confounded . The Stock Market , and all other markets , must certainly sucdumb to this oracular editorial of a Washington newspaper . Of little significance it may he by itself . But to have " semi-official importance attached to it " ? and " much " of such " importance , " at that , is enough to appal the stoutest hearted , and old England sternly prepare for the worst ! It is not in our Constitution nor in the practice of our Government for any Executive officer or officers , of even the highest rank , to proclaim war against foreign Powers . Congress has been supposed to have the decision of the grave questions of peace and war ; and as Congress is not in session at present in Washington , it might seem strange that an evening paper there should " semiofficially " promulge what Congress is likely to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governments of England and France . But it is precisely because we do not " see " the vast amount of " semi-official importance " attached to this newspaper editorial in Washington that we ought , perhaps , to tremble for the peace of the world .
