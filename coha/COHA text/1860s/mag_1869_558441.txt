Two Letters , on Causation , and Freedom in Willing , addressed to John Stuart Mill . With an Appendix on the Existence of Jilatter , and our Notions of Infinite Space . By ROWLAND G. HAZARD . Boston : Lee and Shepard . 1869 . THE foregoing list comprises the most important productions of an American author who , without the advantage of a college // training , and engaged from early life in an extensive manufacturing and mercantile business , which has allowed but limited opportunities for reading , has nevertheless written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economical and metaphysical science . Of the earliest of his published writings , the " Essay on Language , " Channing thus speaks in his lecture on Self-Cultnre : " I have known a man of vigorous intellect , who had enjoyed few advantages of early education , and whose mind was almost engrossed by the details of an extensive business , who composed a book , of much original thought , in steamboats and on horseback , while visiting distant customers . " His later writings , on topics of finance and philosophy , have elicited strong expressions of appreciation and respect from one of the most distinguished of living authors in the same departments of inquiry ,  --  John Stuart Mill . That Mr. Hazard , under such disadvantages , should be able to take hold of the questions which he has handled , with so clear an understanding of their nature and their present aspects , shows how much may be caught up from the atmosphere of thought that surrounds us . Yet these discussions would have been impossible , had not the author , besides this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents of a very high order . A singular delicacy of analysis is combined with a strong grasp of the main points at issue , and a striking originality both in argument and illustration . A predilection for mathematics and mathematical reasoning is frequently manifest ; but this does not exclude an equal sympathy with the higher forms of literature . We propose in the following pages to give some account of the various writings of Mr. Hazard , and to couple with it occasional criticisms upon their contents . What Mr. Hazard has written upon the subject of Political Economy has been in the form of newspaper essays or tracts for the times , having reference to special topics of immediate practical importance . But these essays discover a profound comprehension of the principles of the science , and uncommon skill in the elucidation of them . It is a significant fact that , though engaged , as we have said , from early life in business as a manufacturer , Mr. Hazard , without reading Adam Smith or // any of the other writers in this province of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-protectionist . We advert to this circumstance , not as affording evidence of the truth or falsehood of either position in this controversy , but merely with reference to the observation , which is frequently heard , that the advocates of free-trade are inexperienced , unpractical theorists . They are stigmatized in the leading journals , which defend the protectionist policy , as professors , schoolmasters , and speculatists . This argument more a sneer than an argument - appeals to a vulgar , unfounded prejudice , which holds in low esteem abstract reasoning and philosophical thought respecting matters of practical concern . It comes with ill grace from those who have been contending for years , on grounds of abstract morality and political justice , against the institution of slavery , the champions of which were always ready with their imposing array of facts and figures . Whether a practical familiarity with business gives special value to a man 's opinions on financial qu*stions , depends wholly on the powers of analysis and generalization which he garries with him into practical affairs , and which alone enable him to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . " Our Resources ' * is a collection of articles published by Mr. liazard during our late war . Early in the struggle there was great apprehension that , with the destruction of our foreign credit , our resources would prove inadequate to the emergency . These essays were designed to establish the faith of the public , here and abroad , in the sufficiency of our means . They originally appeared in the newspapers , but were collected into a pamphlet , which passed through repeated editions in this country and England . Abbreviated translations of them were also circulated on the Continent . They showed that the spare income of th' nation prior to the war was $ 1,000,000,000 ( gold value ) , and that from the stimulus imparted to labor by the war itself , and from the improvement in agricultural machinery , there was no reason to fear a diminution of this surplus ; further , that from the standard of living prevalent among all classes in this country , $ 500,000,000 might be saved without stretching economy to a point involving any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the great expenditures in the war , the prostration of the credit of individuals and of banks , and the withdrawing of coin , required a considerable emission of paper-currency , yet any expansion beyond the limit of this requirement would increase the cost of the war , and enhance the debt to be subsequently paid in gold , with no counterbalancing advantages , since the increase in the volume of paper-money would add nothing to its aggregate value or purchasing power . The warning which was given in these able papers it would have been well to heed . One of the essays , entitled " Compensation to Slaveholders , " undertakes to demonstrate that the value of land alone in a free State is equal to the combined value of land and of the slaves required to cultivate it in a slave State . This argument yields a picture full of encouragement to the South , since facts already indicate that it will be verified by the practical test . The last article of this series appeared at a very critical epoch in the financial affairs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 280 ; money was scarce , and the bonds of the government unsalable . The incoming Secretary of the Treasury was advised in advance by bankers and financiers that his only resource was to issue more currency , that there might be a plentiful supply of money wherewith to buy the bonds . Mr. Hazard in this paper asserted - what in the light of subsequent experience is now obvious - that the course recommended to the Secretary would lead directly and speedily to national bankruptcy , and that it would , if adopted , produce a depreciation of the currency which it would be impossible to arrest , and that our financial fate would be the same as that which befell the Southern Confederacy . This article of Mr. Hazard was entitled " Expansion and Contraction . " It explained how the effect of expansion must be to make money scarce and prevent the sale of the bonds ; while the policy of contraction , if avowed , and adhered to , would restore confidence , and release money from the uses of trade and the appliances of speculation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally regarded as preposterous , but the arguments by which it was supported were found , on examination , convincing , and the doctrines of this brief essay are among the recognized truths of political economy . The Secretary of the Treasury was fortu // nately convinced that these positions were well taken ; and if the policy of contraction , which the author advised , was not pursued , no further expansionwas attempted . The public are not generally aware how near we were , at that time , to measures which would have inevitably brought upon us financial ruin . The second series of Mr. Hazard 's financial papers bears the title , " Finance and Hours of Labor . " The special topics are , " Finance , " " Hours of Labor , " " Payment of the Five-Twenty Bonds , " " Inflated Currency , " " How to resume Specie Payments , " " Reconstruction - Freedmen 's Bureau . " The impolitic as well as iniquitous character of all schemes of repudiating the national debt is impressively proved . One of the capital merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the peculiar evils , both of repudiation and of an inflated currency , to farmers and laborers , the classes whom demagogues especially endeavor to mislead on this point . Another excellence is in the unanswerable reasoning by which the fallacious nature of all devices for resuming specie payments without diminishing the volume of the currency is demonstrated . In the course of a reply to an advocate of one of these plausible , but mistaken plans , Mr. Hazard observes : " His whole argument still ignores the fact that the purchasing power of the whole volume of currency can not be increased by increasing its quantity ; that if you double or tenfold it , double or tenfold the amount will be required to pay for the same quantity of labor or property . With the recognition of this , his whole fabric crumbles " - and , Mr. Hazard might have added , many like fabrics of modern alchemists , who by some legerdemain would transmute paper into gold . The earliest of Mr. Hazard 's published writings is the " Essay on Language , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosophical discussions . In that essay he attempts to define the essential characteristics of the language of poetry . It is not easy to give a definition , at once accurate and comprehensive , of poetry ; as the fate of many past experiments evinces . Even the definition given , in Moliere , to Mons. Jourdain by his master , which borrows its humor from its supposed axiomatic character , is a failure , since the antithesis of poetry , according to Coleridge 's well-known dictum , is not // prose , but science . Aristotle and the ancients , in styling poetry an imitative art , were not so far astray as some modern critics have charged , since under . imitation they included the reproduction of experiences not actual , but made real by the living power of the imagination . Milton 's epithets ,  --  " simple , sensuous , passionate , " - are a striking description of the qualities of poetry ; and Lord Bacon 's fine expression as to the office of poetry in " submitting the shows of things to the desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we add the suggestions of Coleridge and Wordsworth , as , that poetry always springs from an excited state of the faculties , that a poem uniformly has pleasure for its immediate end , and that to this pleasure not the whole alone , but each of its constituent parts also , must minister , we advance still farther towards a solution of the problem . Mr. Hazard begins by calling attention to the fact that thought and language are not inseparable . There is an incipient stage of our thoughts when they are not connected with words . Thoughts , as long as they are in this stage , he designates primitive perceptions . Words are the signs of thought , and the instruments of communicating it . We may , as far as practicable , dismiss the ideals or primitive perceptions , and , directing our attention exclusively to terms , by means of them carry forward intellectual processes . Mathematical analysis affords the purest example of this use of the language of abstraction . This is the characteristic language of unpoetic composition ; it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention may be fastened directly on the ideals or primitive perceptions , and their relations to one another ; and this is a poetic mode of mind . These relations are not examined through substituted terms , but immediately . Moreover , " poetry , depending on this prominence of the primitive perceptions , must present , or at least use for illustration , such as we perceive clearly or feel strongly ; and hence its intimate and essential connection with imagery and with passion . " Language does not stand as the conventional equivalent for thought , and substitute for it . The thoughts and emotions which the language of poetry excites are its effect . The poet uses language " to induce an ideal , " and avails himself of the association between the ideals themselves . " With a cabalistic // word he summons the half-recognized ghosts of departed feelings , and with the incantation of terms invokes * host of spirits from the world of fancy . And though we do not recollect the words , and can not repeat the terms in that order which alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , the impressions , the emotions , in short , the ideals they created , may be as distinctly retained as the remembrance of any external object which we have seen without learning its name . " Thus poetry can reach beyond the limits of precise terms , and by its wondrous art reach to remote ideals , beyond such as are within the immediate grasp of words . The modes of abstraction and of ideality are thus directly opposed to one another . Between them lies the intermediate language of narration ; but with narration ideality may blend , when the language of prose becomes interfused with the spirit and diction of poetry . Ideality mingles with abstraction in all effective oratory . Ideality is the life of eloquence . Abstraction may persuade , but it is ideality that inspires conviction . " It warms the heart and gives an impulse like that which arises from the realities which it depicts , for it makes them present to our mind 's sight , and corresponding effects are produced upon us . " Ideality im.presses the mind of the auditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the labor requisite to follow a process of reasoning . Having set forth the distinction between ideality and abstraction , the essay deduces an interesting train of reflections . One of the topics is the language of futurity . It is suggested that the future life may introduce a method of communion between mind and mind , which dispenses with words and signs , - a consummation of which the magic influence of poetry , as a revealer of thought , seems prophetic . In that case , thought will be communicated without any medium " to distort its meaning or sully its brightness . " The power of music in awakening emotion is even more subtle and inexplicable than that of poetry , with which it is intimately allied . The effect of music is a series of excitements , " an induced activity to which the soul is wrought without any conscious effort of its own . " But we may suppose music divested of sounds . The composer of music must have the emotions independently of the sounds , // as the poet creates his ideals independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these emotions should be immediately imparted to the mind , without the necessity of the sounds by which they are evoked ; and this may be the fact in another state of being . By a very delicate and penetrating analysis , the author discovers the secret bond that unites poetry , love , music , and devotion . In a fine and elevated strain , he explains the influence of ideality on character . The brief passages which follow will afford an idea of the style in which the discussion is carried forward : - " In the formation of character , ideality exerts an influence of the highest importance . It is the channel by which the conceivable objects of desire or aversion are brought nearest to the springs of voluntary action . From those supposable events which are continually flowing through the mind , we form rules of ' conduct , or receive impressions , which imperceptibly govern us in the concerns of real life . It is in meditation that we nurture those innate feelings which give impulse to action , and determine its mode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bustle of the world , and in tranquillity contemplates imaginary cases , and determines how he ought to act under them , frames for himself a system of government with less liability to error than he can do in the tumultuous scenes of ' active life . " " That we can modify our dispositions , is perhaps sufficiently obvious , though too often overlooked in its ; practical application . The great means by which these modifications are effected , we believe to be processes of ideality , and the principal causes of the wrong formation of character are , the perversion of these processes to foster ignoble passions , and the want of their influence in counteracting the effects of external causes . Fortunately , the occasions of life which have a tendency to warp the disposition , though frequent , have their intervals , are transient , and in some degree neutralize each other . The forms of ideality may always be brought to mind , and , if we encourage the presence of those only which are pure and elevated , we shall , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without this countervailing principle , our moral nature would ' be the sport of chance , liable to be irretrievably driven from its course by every current of feeling and every storm of passion . Character would then depend on accidental and physical causes . " " We have already spoken of the power of ideality in enabling us to fall into the same channels of thought which our acquaintances would pursue . If we mistake not , this is particularly obvious in the application // of it which we are now considering . How often , when we have determined on a course of conduct , particularly when that determination is formed under the influence of exciting circum stances , are we led to suspect the propriety of ' it , by thinking how some friend would view it ! We put ourselves in his position , look at it calmly as he would do , endeavor to get the same aspect as would be presented to him , and then perhaps discover that our own vision had been distorted , and led us into error . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the virtue and discretion of our friends available to us . We use their modes . of thought to mould our own . " Psychological observations on the subject of inspiration and prophecy , which throw light on religions phenomena generally considered inexplicable , form one of the most interesting features of the essay . The two leading functions of the mind , the intuitive and the abstractive , the poetic and the scientific , are considered in their fundamental character , their separate agencies , and mutual relations . We subjoin a few paragraphs as additional illustrations of the character of the discussion : - " We need not urge that this power of ideality , by which we revive the past , brighten the present , and anticipate the future , is the highest endowment of humanity . It is also that attribut.e of the finite spirit which most nearly corresponds to that of omnipresence in the infinite . By the exercise of this faculty , every place and every object of its knowledge is made present to the mind ; and , if it be not equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this power furnishes an equivalent , which in effect makes mind - not omnipresent because , and only because , it is not omniscient and omnipotent . For , if we knew all things , we could make them all present to us in the form of ideals ; and , if there were no limit to this power , we could embrace them all at once ; and this would be equivalent to being everywhere present at the same time ; or , if we may so express it , mind , as manifested in man , ha ? s a finite presence , which has the same relation to omnipresence vhich its finite knowledge and power have to the other two great attributes of the universal " To elicit the emotions in a happy manner requires a knowledge , not only of the niceties of language , but of the intricate and delicate relations of the feelings , united to a discriminating taste , which neither perplexes by obscurity , nor wearies attention by prolixity , nor offends the vanity by being too minute . rrhe poet must frequently give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply the rest . The reader will thus have his faculties more excited , and fill up the blanks in a // manner most agreeable to himself ; and , revelling in what thus seem the creations of his own fancy , he will cheerfully awami the meed of praise to that which has provoked him to thought , and imparted to him the elevation of conscious power . We may here remark that a little obscurity in expression , or ambiguity in terms , when so employed as to concentrate rather than distract attention , may greatly assist this effect , and , at the same time , repel the attention from the terms to the ideals , to which they allow a greater latitude , but may still , in some measure , control . " " Although the poetic and prosaic modes of mind are seldom found united in their highest perfection in the same individual , yet every aspect of the subject indicates that it is by a combination of them that the greatest intellectual power is produced . It is then the union of activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and softness with the sterner and stronger attributes of reason . So necessary does this combination appear , in order to give efficiency to talent , that we think we should hazard little in asserting that every great enterprise in philosophy had beenaccomplished by a powerful imagination , controlled and directed by yet more powerful reasoning faculties ; and that every grand achievement in poetry had been effected by strong reasoning powers , sustaining and impelling a yet more vigorous imagination . In great minds it is not the absence of either endowment , but only the predominance of the reasoning or ideal faculty , which forms the distinction , and determines the character to the one or the other class . " The maturest and most elaborate of the writings of Mr. Hazard is his work on the Will . It was undertaken partly in deference to a request of Channing , who , like many others , appears to have been of Dr. Johnson 's mind , that " all theory is against the freedom of the will , all experience in favor of it . " Remarks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwar*ls 's argument , so impressed Channing , that he urged the preparation of a book in answer to that famous treatise . The work which Channing desired to be written did not see the light until long after the suggestion was made . It was published in 1864 . After a brief Preface , which vindicates the dignity and importance of metaphysical studies , the author enters upon an exposition and defence of his system . We proceed to give a summary view of its leading features . To mind , Mr. Hazard affirms , causal agency pre-eminently , if not exclusively , belongs . Of the existence . of matter as a dis // 1869 .

The two leading functions of the mind , the intuitive and the abstractive , the poetic and the scientific , are considered in their fundamental character , their separate agencies , and mutual relations . We subjoin a few paragraphs as additional illustrations of the character of the discussion : - " We need not urge that this power of ideality , hy which we revive the past , brighten the present , and anticipate the future , is the highest endowment of humanity . It is also that attribute of the finite spirit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The poet must frequently give only the prominent ideals , and leave the imagination to supply the rest . The reader will thus have his faculties more excited , and fill up the blanks in a // Oct. occasional causes . It is true that volition does not always follow immediately on the consciousness of a want and the knowledge of the means of supplying it . The mind may deliberate as to whether it will gratify its want , or which of various conflicting wants it will gratify , or what course , out of several which may be open , it will adopt for the purpose of attaining the end . But deliberation is voluntary , and is initiated by an act of will . Whether the mind will seek for more knowledge , prior to putting forth the act of volition , and how much time it will spend in this process of consideration , it is for the will , or the mind willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is termed choice , is not an act of will , but purely a perception , - an act of the knowing capacity . This is a prominent feature of Mr. Hazard 's system . Having thus attained to the requisite knowledge as to what its want is , and what is the best method of ministering to it , the mind freely ' puts forth its activity in the form of volition . The will is strictly a creative power , and the mind of man has just the same power in kind as belongs to God . Aside from the act of giving existence to matter , of which we can form no conception , and of which there exists no proof , the creative power of Deity is possessed , though in vastly less measure , by his rational creatures . The knowledge of man is limited , and thus tffie sphere in which his will can be exercised is proportionately restricted . But the human mind , like the divine , is influenced by its preconceptions of its own effects ; it is drawn forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus is truly a first cause . Matter , being unintelligent and without will , must be controlled in its changes by a power without itself . At least , it has no power to vary the effects of its own motion , on the supposition that motion originally belongs to it . In order to the existence of will , there must be at least one want , with a knowledge of at least one way of supplying it . In the case of instinctive action this knowledge is intuitive . It is furnished to the being without his own action . Hence the element of deliberation is absent . Rational actions are according to a plan which the being who performs them has contrived . Habitual action is the action of a finite , intelligent being , in conformity to a plan of its own , with which practice has made it // so familiar that each successive step is taken without the need of examination . Hence habit is called second nature . The voluntary action of human beings is first instinctive . The basis of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modifying his wants by increasing his knowledge . Hence his sentiments are largely , though indirectly , under his control . The knowledge of each individual as to what is morally right is for him infallible . He is responsible only for failing to put forth the efforts which are conformed to his knowledge or sense of right . The persevering effort to be noble and good is , itself , being noble and good . The effort , if it be real , is here the consummation . Mr. Hazard 's system is brought out more fully in the second part of his treatise , which comprises his Review of Edwards . The phraseology of Edwards in defining the will is subjected to a searching criticism . Especially is the propriety of his identification of choice and volition disputed . That Edwards involves himself in ambiguity and inconsistency by making choice , which with him is a synonyme of volition , equivalent to " being pleased , or displeased " with a thing , while in other places the latter state of mind is made the antecedent and ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of liberty which is given by Edwards is simply a definition of external liberty . He assumes a necessity of connection between the acts of the will and " such moral causes as the strength of inclination , or motive . " This inclination may be so strong in one direction , says Edwards , that it is impossible to surmount it . But " inclination " and " bias " are , by his definition , previous choices . His argument for moral necessity generally goes no farther than to prove the incompatibility of two opposite choices at the same time . But if his idea be that the mind can not overcome its own strong inclination , then , according to Mr. Hazard , this fact , being due to the absence of want or the presence of a conflicting want , is not inconsistent with freedom . The inability to will when or what a man does not want to will , is not opposed to liberty . Edwards 's favorite method of confuting his opponents , the advocates of self-determination , is the reductio ad absurdum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he actually chooses , if he will , " it is replied , that , as " will " // Oct. and " choose " are equivalent terms , their proposition implies that a choice is itself chosen , which leads to an infinite series . But it is one thing to say that " the will determines its own acts by choosing its own acts , " and quite another thing to say that " the will determines its own acts in the exercise of a power of willing and choosing . " Edwards confounds the two statements ; whereas the latter does not of necessity imply the absurdity of choosing choices , but merely identifies the act ofself-determination with the act of choosing . They are one and the same . The main arguments of Edwards for the doctrine of necessity are found in the application of the maxim , no event without a cause , to the phenomena of the will . Why , in any given case , did the mind choose as it did , and not otherwise ? It is not sufficient , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , or to the general activity of the mind . What we have to account for is , the specification of the choice , - the choice of one thing rather than another . But Edwards solves the problem himself ; by one of the modes in which he stat6s it . " Active nature , " he says , " is a general thing ; it is an ability , or tendency , of nature , to action gen erally taken , which m*y be a cause why the soul acts as occasion or reason is given . " In regard to this sentence , Mr. Hazard observes : " He virtually admits all that is essential to my system ; i. e. that the soul has an ability to action , which it may use when it sees a reason , and that its effort , or act of will , is but an exercise of this general ability or power of action , which it directs or determines to some particular act by means of its knowledge . " The activity of the soul in willing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical with it . The mind determines and controls itself in the act of will , and is not determined by any power extrinsic to itself : this is its freedom . " If , to the question proposed by Edwards , why the soul of man uses its activity as it does , ' it should be replied , that intelligence , from its very nature , has a faculty to determine , or to direct its activity , it would be in conformity to his own previous statements , that the mind has a faculty by which it wills , and that an act of volition is a determination of the mind . " The whole question really is whether an absolute // cause , - a cause not necessitated to act as it does , but selfmoving and self-directed , - is conceivable . Mr. Hazard presents a very ingenious refutation of the argument for necessity derived from the alleged uniformity in the action of the will under like circumstances . Supposing that such a uniformity exists , - that is to say , that the will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - there is no warrant for the inference that its action is necessary . The mind may freely direct its voluntary action with uniformity , and this uniformity is just as explicable by referring it to liberty as to necessity . For example , if I go from my dwelling to the postoffice every day in the year , and each time take a direct and easy way , instead of a circuitous and difficult one , this last circumstance affords no proof that I do not elect the path with perfect freedom . There is no more evidence of necessity , from the uniformity of my action , than if I were occasionally to break up this uniformity by taking the other way . Mr. Hazard denies the truth of the proposition that the same causes in the same circumstances necessarily produce the same effects . If we understand him , he even questions the fact of such a uniformity in voluntary actions as forms the basis of this doctrine . He holds that where there is a reason for selecting one of several objects , but no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mind still can put forth its voluntary effort and take one arbitrarily , or frame to itself a perfectly arbitrary rule for the regulation of its action . One of Edwards 's proofs of necessity is drawn from the fact of the foreknowledge of God . Actions which are not determined by antecedent causes , he argues , can not be foreknown or predicted . The divine government over the world , he contends , would be overthrown on the theory which he opposes . Mr. Hazard meets this argument by admitting that foreknowledge is inseparable from predetermination ; but he rejects the inference , holding that foreknowledge is not necessary to the divine administration . The Deity , in the very fact of giving existence to free agents , foregoes the prescience of their voluntary actions ; but such are his resources of knowledge and power , that he knows all the possible exertions of free agency on the // Oct. part of his creatures , and , as these exertions occur , he can adapt his action accordingly . In short , Mr. Hazard denies that foreknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needful to the conduct of the divine administration and to the realization of the benevolent purposes of God . It is the same ground that was taken by some of the older Socinian* theologians . We differ from Mr. Hazard on this point . It can not be proved that the infallible foreknowledge of free actions is a contradiction . To say that an event infallibly foreknown " must happen , " is ambiguous . There is a logical necessity , indeed , that it should be , but no real necessity , for the plain reason that foreknowledge is not a cause . If we remember an event , it must have occurred ; but this is not to say that it was a necessitated event . Moreover , nothing is gained to the argument for freedom by the denial of foreknowledge , since every actual event , and thus every free act , was antecedently certain to occur . There is an antecedent certainty , and nothing is lost by allowing that this was known to an intelligent being . If to-day I freely will to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain poor man , it was a true proposition yesterday , and from all eternity , that I should to-day thus will . It was a true proposition , whether any being was cognizant of the truth or not . There is nothing to militate against freedom , in foreknowledge , that does not inhere equally in this antecedent certainty which we intuitively see to exist . In truth , there is nothing in either , in themselves considered , that at all affects the question of liberty or necessity . Mr. Hazard 's correspondence with Mr. Mill . relates principally to the subject of causation . With Mr. Mill , cause signifies only the assemblage of antecedents which some event invariably follows . Causal agency , or the exertion of power , in the usual sense of the term , is eliminated , as being something of the existence of which we have no proof . It follows that the distinction of efficient and occasional causes disappea ? . s , since efficiency itself has no real existence . Mr. Mill disowns the doctrine of necessity , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not admit . But he contends for the same invariable sequence in the phenomena of the will as prevails in the operations of material nature . That is to say , // the same mind in the same circumstances always wills in the same way . Respecting the origin of the notion of causation , which Mr. Hazard , with many other philosophers , attributes to our conscious voluntary efforts , producing muscular exertion , Mr. Mill brings forward the argument of Sir William Hamilton , that this can not be the case , since between the volition , and the motion of the arm , or any other member , there intervene links of cause and effect of which the mind , in the act of will , can have no cognizance . In reply , Mr. Hazard denies that such a cognizance of the intervening process is requisite , inasmuch as the knowledge that the given effect will be produced as a consequence of volition is at first instinctive , and without this innate knowledge the putting forth of such volition would be inconceivable . Mr. Hazard also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mill , that causation is identical with invariable sequence , efficiency being excluded . It is asserted that Mr. Mill 's definitions seem only to indicate a mode of experimentally finding what are causes , and do not explain or define either our idea or the nature of cause . They do not *discriminate between efficient causes and causes which , though necessary to the effect , have no agency in producing it ; as life , for example , is the necessary condition of death . The passive agencies which resist a given change are not to be confounded with the active agency which changes them . The fact that men differ from one another in their distinction of the cause , from the mere conditions , of a phenomenon , does not prove that there is no cause , in the sense commonly assigned to the term . " If twenty men attribute a phenomenon to twenty different agencies , it is no indication that it may be properly attributed to the whole twenty agencies combined . " This diversity of judgment as to what is the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deeming them , collectively taken , the cause . We have room for only a brief extract : - " There must be some power producing the uniformity , the existence of which , in the flow of events , all admit . To meet this necessity of the observed facts , the last hypothesis of our category seems to have been devised . It appears to fully cover the ground intended , for it asserts that the cause inheres , not in the events themselves , but in the invariability or uniformity of their succession . But the very things to be // accounted for by the theory , are , first , the advent , addition , or succession of an event , and second , the observed uniformity in this succession . Under this hypothesis , if it be asked why one certain event succeeds another certain event , it must be replied , because it always does so ; i. e. it does so on the particular occasion , because it does so on all other like occasions . And if in any case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , why the consequent B always succeeds the antecedent A , the answer must still be because it always does so ; i. e. it always does so because it always does so , or , shorter , it does because it does . Nor will it help the matter to say it not only always has been , but we believe it always will be so . The generic names of the phenomena are now superseded by the phrase always does , both traceable to the same observed fact of uniformity , and both really making the phenomena in a collective form the causes of themselves individually . " The idea of causative power is distinct from , and must precede , that of the uniformity of its action or its effect . The power which produces the effect may be wholly independent of any uniformity in its manifestation . It is no less cause the first time it acts , when no uniformity can have obtained ; and would be no less cause if it varied its action every time it acted . The two ideas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . " From the conclusion which I reached , that the effect is simultaneous with the action of its cause , I have already suggested the corollary , that our idea of cause is independent of , and separable from , that of succession ; and if I was correct in saying that the knowledge that we can ( through motion of matter or otherwise ) extend the effects of any action beyond the moment of exertion is not essential to our idea of power or of cause , we may from this also infer that succession is not a necessary element in our idea of power or of cause ; and this position , if tenable , takes away the whole foundation of the . definitions of cause which rest upon the mere succession of consequents to antecedents invariable , inevitable , or otherwise . " Other points w'hich are brought into this controversy on the nature of cause and the origin of our notion of pause , - as , for example , the simultaneousness of effect and cause , - we can not here notice . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if it be recognized in this treatise , has less than its due share of attention . There are permanent states of the will , - immanent preferences , - which are properly called principles of // action , inasmuch as they dictate a great variety of overt voluntary actions subordinate to them . In other words , the mind voluntarily sets before itself ends , and the determination of the will towards an end , when once made , may abide as a permanent state of the will , and as the spring of numberless volitions which are put forth as means for the attainment of the end thus previously chosen . Mr. Hazard has a chapter on the " Effort for Internal Change . " In the course of it , he observes : " If the object of the effort , instead of external good and noble action , is the direct improvement of his own moral nature , then the persevering effort to be good and noble is , itself , being good and noble . " Here the effort - that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is also said : " While in the external there must be something beyond the effort , - i. e. there must be that subsequent change which is the object of the effort , before the creation is consummated , - in the sphere of the moral nature the effort is itself the consummation . " These sentences open a path of inquiry which this able writer has not very fully pursued . We may briefly indicate what we conceive to be the truth in the matter . That such a continuous purpose or determination of the will may exist , is a truth familiarly acknowledged . I resolve to go to London . This resolve is a determination of the will , after a consideration , we will suppose , of the reasons for and against the journey . This resolution , once formed , is not , or need not be , renewed . It remains as an abiding condition of the will ; and in pursuance of it I arrange my affairs at home , engage my passage , and put forth numberless other volitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this original and continuous purpose . We believe that we are not wrong in describing the state of mind to which we advert as a voluntary state , a state of the will . Now the mind is capable of setting before itself ends , or cherishing purposes , of a vastly more comprehensive character . This explains the possibility of habits , as well as acts , of the will . The will is not merely a faculty of volitions ; it is a faculty of preferences , comprehensive , abiding , and governing in their influence , from which volitions spring . These leading purposes or principles constitute character . To follow out the suggestions of this truth // would lead us tod far into the domain of theology . But it may be observed that philosophical theologians , like Augustine and Aquinas and Calvin , have considered themselves to assert in their doctrine of sin the very truth respecting the simplicity of character , which Jesus taught in the declaration , " No man can serve two masters . " To live for an end is necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either good or evil . The treatise of Mr. Hazard , in our judgment , assigns to knowledge an undue influence on voluntary action . We are not satisfied that what the author calls choice , - the decision how , to act , - belongs to the understanding . This criticism touches one of the prominent features of the system advocated in the work . Suppose a case in which a man is engaged in a struggle with temptation . Reason and moral feeling prompt in one direction ; appetite and selfish passion in another . And suppose that the will acts in conformity with the baser impulse . Can it be said that the man beforehand knows that this action is best ? We are familiar with the distinction which writers make between the rational and the passionate judgment , - the conviction , on the one hand , that the virtuous action and the satisfaction attending it are best , and the vivid sense , on the other , of the attractiveness of forbidden pleasure . But the question is , does not the mind , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is best , and , all things considered , will suit it best ? And does it not act in direct opposition to the decision of the understanding ? In other words , does the man not know that he is acting foolishly , as well as culpably ? He is , in fact , choosing an immediate gratification for one more remote and enduring , a gratification of a Low species for a refined and elevated enjoyment . The motive to this unworthy act is not to be found within the sphere of the intellect or reason . If there is a more intense excitement of certain lower propensities , and if this vivid conception of the pleasure to be derived from indulging them occasions the wrong act of the will , still this condition of feeling is not to be confounded with an act of judgment . There is simply a choice - a choice by the will - of an inferior good , which the mind knows to be inferior ; and for this choice no sufficient reason is to be given . If there were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can point out the occasions , or antecedent states of feeling , which are likely to lead to , or be followed by , such an act ; but here our explication must end , unless we would call evil good . The Greek philosophers , without exception , exaggerated the influence exercised by knowledge over character . One pervading error of their systems was this one-sided intellectualism , which even identified knowledge and virtue . This is th' verdict of scholars generally , and has been stated by none more explicitly , even in reference to the Socratic system , than by Mr. Grote , the historian . An increase of knowledge may tend to an increase of virtue ; but it is a part of the mystery of our free and responsible nature that we can , arid often do , act in direct contravention of our clearest perceptions . Ignorance may mitigate , and in some cases obliterate , guilt . " They know not what they do , " is an argument for forgiveness . But it is not true that knowledge invariably produces rectitude . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in unrighteous action do , reject the control of intelligence . In perusing Mr. Hazard 's treatise , we have carefully looked for his opinion in regard to the power of contrary choice . Has the mind the tower to choose otherwise than it actually does choose , without any change of circumstances ? That this power is essential to the freedom of the will has been a prevalent opinion of philosophers . It is true that philosophical theologians in great number , - Augustinians , Thomists , Calvinists , Jansenists , - deny the existence of such a power within the sphere of strictly religious action , in the present moral condition of mankind ; that is , they deny to " the fallen will " the power to reverse its own fundamental action . The will remains , - such is the doctrine , - and men sin spontaneously , and in this sense freely ; but the will is not free to that which is good ; on the contrary , it is a will in bondage . But the most orthodox of these theologians maintain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's first probation , and they hold to the present existence of such a power ' in respect to that vast category of human actions which do not fall within the distinctively religious sphere . Such a " power ' to the contrary " appears to be essential to moral liberty . " I // could have willed otherwise , " is a bitter ingredient of remorse . In several passages Mr. Hazard seems to concede the reality of the power to the contrary . Speaking of a wrong-doer , he says ( p. 166 ) : " He must have been able to will rightly , for his knowledge , which is the only limit to this ability , embraced all that was essential to action morally right . " We read also ( p. 806 ) : " God never permits such action without a monition throi ? gh the moral sense , warning us to refrain from the mutilation or degradation of our being , and suggesting search of that knowledge which , by a faith in the wisdom and goodness of the Supreme Intelligence , intuitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . " These passages seem to imply that there was power fully adequate , in the first case , to an opposite determination of the will , and , in the second case , to another determination in the room of the one actually taking place , - another which would have resulted in an opposite one . On the other hand , there are various passages which make the connection be1*ween volition and want , or knowledge , or both , to be of such a nature that the power to an opposite act of will seems to be precluded . We read ( p. 227 ) : " The inability to will what or when he does not want to will , is not opposed to freedom . Such ideas of freedom are absurd and contradictory . " The context may possibly render this passage indecisive as to the point in question . We find , however ( on p. 382 ) , the following statement : " The fallacy of the argument . . . . lies in supposing that after the mind has , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom still requires that some other volition or effort should be possible . " " If there is of necessity a connection between this decision and effort , this only proves that the mind is of necessity free in such effort . " Now the want and the knowledge are , in the first instance , innate ; and then , if we understand our author aright , a volition opposite to the one that actually occurred would have been impossible . At least , the possibility of such an opposite volition is not necessary to freedom . The mind , it is held , on the occasion of its want and knowledge , ; puts forth of itself its volitive energy . But is not the particular mode of voluntary action , after all , a necessary effect of the constitution of the mind ? In other words , is not the mind // constrained , not ab extra , but by its nature , to will as it does , - its want and knowledge , which by the supposition are involuntary , being what they are ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountableness can be founded ? The admission of a power of contrary choice does not of necessity involve a denial of the uniformity of action as a fact . The authors s reasonings blsewhere , where he treats of this last topic , make the truth of this statement evident . It might be supposed that room is given for the power of contrary choice , in cases where the mind deliberates for the purpose of increasing its knowledge , either as to the want which it should gratify or the best means of attaining a chosen end . But as far as acts of will enter into this process of reflection , whether in initiating it or breaking it off , they are subject to the same conditions as all other acts of will . They result from a want and from a knowledge , and take place therefore , we infer , with no more possibility of the opposite volition than exists elsewhere . Yet it might be argued that our author 's positions , respecting the uniformity of action , the fact of which he questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of a motive to a particular form of choice , better harmonize with the supposition that a " power to the contrary " inheres in the will . From the most recent publication of Mr. Hazard , we find that the impression as to his views on the " power to the contrary , " which we had derived from his treatise , is correct . That is to say , he does not admit its existence , and he argues that it is not requisite for freedom . " Our freedom in willing , " he says ( p. 133 ) , " is evinced by our willing to do what we want to do , and it can not be necessary to this freedom that we should be able even to try to do what we do not want to try to do . " Want , according to our author , is not an act of will , - it is involuntary . If now we can not will except in accordance with the want , is there freedom ? Is not the act of the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - as truly so , though in a different way , as the want itself ? Is there responsibility , when we can not avoid having the want , and can not avoid willing in conformity with it ? Mr Hazard says : - // " As against Sir William Hamilton 's inferring freedom directly from consciousness , you say , To be Conscious of free will must mean to be conscious , before I have decided , that I am able to decide either way . ' I would say , that to be conscious of free will must mean to be conscious , before I have decided , that it is I that am to decide ; that I am to determine my own act of will at my own pleasure , or as on examination I shall find will suit me best . The case you . state , whether one will prefer to murder or not to murder , does not raise the question of freedom in willing , but only of preferring , or choosing , which , though heretofore held to be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . The willing to murder is just as free as the willing not to murder , and the only question touching the freedom of the willing is the same in either case ; namely , Does the being as he is , good or bad , himself determine to make the effort to murder or not to make it ? Whether he determine to make , or not to make , may indicate what his character is , but has no bearing upon the question of his freedom . " Consciousness of free will is thus identified with the consciousness that I am to put forth an act of will conformably to an intellectual act in regard to which I am not free . This intellectual act being what it is , I can not will otherwise . Does this conception of freedom furnish an adequate ground of moral accountableness ? Does not the mind , in this whole process , conform to a law of its being from which it would be impossible for it to deviate ? If it be said that this determination or decision , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prior acts of the will , the reply is , that these also can be followed back to a primary decision of the same nature . There is no break in the chain . Is it not more reasonable to regard the determination or decision , in the case supposed , as itself a voluntary act ? And does it not imply a deeper , underlying , voluntary preference of something opposed to the highest good , - an immanent habit of will ? In this account of Mr. Hazard 's treatise we have done less than justice to its merits . The subtile and original trains of argumentation which are pursued are hardly more remarkable than the fresh and striking illustrations by which the author 's doctrines are explained and enforced . One great idea , - that the mind itself is capable of originating action , of beginning effort in the absence of all other causative power or // force , - pervades the entire discussion . This idea is set forth as the prime characteristic of freedom , and is defended against various forms of necessitarian objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability of Mr. Hazard 's writings has excited is by no means limited to those who coincide with his philosophical opinions . The " Two Letters on Causation and Freedom in Willing , " which are addressed to Mr. Mill , and which have just been given to the public in a revised form , are sufficient of themselves to entitle the author to a place in the front rank of metaphysical writers .
