txt The Richmond papers , which were suspended last week , during the panic caused by the movements of GRANT , resumed publication on Monday , and we have copies of the Examiner of that day 's and Tuesday 's issues , from which we this morning give extracts . The rebels admit their successive repulses in their attacks upon our lines on the north bank of the river on Friday last , hut claim success and nine hundred prisoners as the result of the same day 's operations on our left . In its news columns , the Examiner talks quite stoutly and falsely , but in the editorial , intended to affect the rebel authorities , it speaks with a proper amount of fear , and , we have no doubt , quite truthfully . The Examiner cries out , and reiterates : " Let troops be brought to Virginia without delay from anywhere . The safety of our lines can not fairly be left to LEE 'S present army , which has too great a load on it already . An accession to our forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the hour of final trial , which Is close at hand . That some new divisions of good troops should instantly be brought to Richmond , and that its vast population of negro women and children , who eat up everything , should be sent forthwith away , are the evident and pressing wants of the occasion . " This indicates about as high a state of mental excitement as it is possible for a sane mind to be in . It is difficult , however , to tell where LEE is to get a sufficient body of reinforcements . The Examiner says they must be brought " from anywhere , " but we do n't know what portion of the Southern Confederacy that is.
