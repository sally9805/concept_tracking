txt //d then stuck to it with indomitable tenacity . Yet , curiously enough , with none of the characteristics of the politician , he longed for political preferment . At the hands of the people this came to him in smallest measure only . Though at one time a member of the Massachusetts Legislature , he was defeated as candidate for the lower house of Congress , and in 1876 suffered the bitterest disappointment of his life , when the libellous attacks of enemies prevented the ratification of his nomination as Minister to England . Previous to this he had served his country as United States District Attorney during the Civil War , a time when the office demanded the highest type of ability and uprightness . That the government appreciated this was shown in 1867 by its choice of Dana as one of its counsel in the prosecution of Jefferson Davis for treason . The position of legal representative before the Halifax tribunal of 1877 , which met to discuss fishery questions at issue between the United States and Canada , was given him no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as balm for the wound of the preceding year . But whatever satisfaction he may have found in such honors as time and ripening years brought to him , his chief joy and relaxation lay in travel . When worry and overwork began to tell upon him , he would betake himself to shore or mountains . Upon several occasions he visited Europe , and in 1859 made a tour of the world . At length , in 1876 , he gave up active life and took residence abroad , with the idea of finding leisure for the preparation of a treatise on international law . He was still engaged in collecting his material when , on January 6 , 1882 , death overtook him . He was buried in Rome in the Protestant Cemetery , whose cypresses cast their long shadows over the graves of many distinguished foreigners who have sought a last refuge of health and peace under the skies of Italy . Such a career as his would seem far enough from being a failure . Yet , in retirement , Dana looked back upon it not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable desire to see his labors crowned by his elevation to the bench ; as an active participant in public affairs , he had felt that his services and talents rendered him deserving of a seat in Congress . Lacking these things , he might have hoped that the practice of his profession would yield him a fortune . Here again he was disappointed . In seeking the fulfillment of his ambitions , he was always on the high road to success ; he never quite arrived . It is remarkable that , having written one successful book , Dana did not seek further reward as a man of letters . Two Years before the Mast appeared in 1840 , while its author was still a law student . Though at the time it created no great stir in the United States , it was most favorably received in England , where it paved the way for many pleasant and valuable acquaintanceships . The following year , Dana produced a small volume on seamanship , entitled The Seaman 's Friend . This , and a short account of a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early venture . He was a copious letter-writer and kept full journals of his various travels ; but he never elaborated them for publication . Yet , long before his death , he had seen the narrative of his sailor days recognized as an American classic . Time has not diminished its reputation . We read it to-day not merely for its simple , unpretentious style ; but for its clear picture of sea life previous to the era of steam navigation , and for its graphic description of conditions in California before visions of gold sent the long lines of " prairie schooners " drifting across the plains to unfold the hidden destiny of the West . California and her Missions It is not easy to realize that , during the stirring days when the eastern coast-line of North America was experiencing the ferment of revolution , the Pacific seaboard was almost totally unexplored , its population largely a savage one . But Spain , long established in Mexico , was slowly pushing northward along the California coast . Her emissaries were the Franciscan friars ; her method the founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should arise towns intended to afford harbor for Spanish ships and to serve as outposts against the steady encroachments of Russia , who , from Alaska , was reaching out toward San Francisco Bay . Thus began the white settlement of California . San Diego Mission was founded in 1769 ; San Carlos , at Monterey , in 1770 ; San Francisco , in 1776 ; Santa Barbara , in 1786 . For the general guardianship of these missions a garrison , or presidio , was in each case provided . It was responsible not only for the protection of the town thus created , but for all the missions in the district . The presidio of San Diego , for example , was in charge of the missions of San Diego , San Gabriel , San Juan Capistrano , and San Luis Rey . So , likewise , there were garrisons with extensive jurisdiction at Santa Barbara , Monterey , and San Francisco . The Indians in the immediate vicinity of a mission were attached thereto by a sort of gentle enslavement . They were provided special quarters , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostered , and their innate laziness conquered by specific requirements of labor in agriculture , cattle raising , and simple handicrafts . It was an arrangement which worked well for both parties concerned . The slavery of the Indians was not unlike the obligation of children to their parents ; they were comfortable , well behaved , and for the most part contented with the rule of the friars , who , on their side , began to accumulate considerable wealth from the well-directed efforts of their charges . The supposition was that in the course of years the Indians might become so habituated to thrift and industry as to be released from supervision and safely left to their own devices . But that happy consummation had not occurred when , in 1826 , Mexico succeeded in separating herself from the mother country and began her career as an independent republic , of which California was a part . Nevertheless , the greed of politicians suddenly wrought the change which was to have come as the slow development of years . By governmental decree , the Indians were declared free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their temporal powers , their funds seized under the guise of a loan , and their establishments often subjected to what was little short of pillage . This state of affairs had scarcely begun at the time of the author 's visit to California ; still , as he points out in Chapter XXI , the decline of the missions had already set in . The final blow to their power and usefulness came , however , with the upheaval accompanying the Mexican war and the acquisition of California by the United States . Although this country returned all mission buildings to the control of the Church , their reason for being had vanished ; they were sold , or destroyed , or feebly maintained on funds insufficient to forestall dilapidation . Fortunately the Franciscan friars had built for beauty as well as for use ; the architecture which they devised in skillful adaptation of their native Spanish type displayed originality and picturesque charm . Hence , of late years , Californians have come to feel a worthy pride in the monuments of the early history of their state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No less than twenty-one are today the goal of the traveller . The reader who is interested in pursuing the subject thus outlined will find its satisfactory treatment in George Wharton James 's In and out of the old Missions of California , a book that combines agreeable reading with excellent illustrations .

Explanation of Diagram The following diagram , from which many details have been omitted , presents sufficient data for an understanding of the more important nautical terms which occur in the text . A number of other such terms have been explained in the notes . In omitting reference to many more , the editor has felt that ovarannotation would turn a straightforward and interesting narrative into a mere excuse for a nautical dictionary , and quite defeat the purpose of the book . The author 's technical vocabulary , even when most bewildering , serves to give force and the vividness of local color to his descriptions .

Since Mr. Cooper 's Pilot and Red Rover , there have been so many stories of sea-life written , that I should really think it unjustifiable in me to add one to the number without being able to give reasons in some measure warranting me in so doing . With the single exception , as I am quite confident , of Mr. Ames 's entertaining , but hasty and desultory work , called " Mariner 's Sketches , " all the books professing to give life at sea have been written by persons who have gained their experience as naval officers , or passengers , and of these , there are very few which are intended to be taken as narratives of facts . Now , in the first place , the whole course of life , and daily duties , the discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the merchant service ; and in the next place , however entertaining and well written these books may be , and however accurately they may give sea-life as it appears to their authors , it must still be plain to every one that a naval officer , who goes to sea as a gentleman , " with his gloves on , " ( as the phrase is , ) and who associated only with his fellow-officers , and hardly speaks to a sailor except through a boatswain 's mate , must take a very different view of the whole matter from that which would be taken by a common sailor . Besides the interest which every one must feel in exhibitions of life in those forms in which he himself has never experienced it ; there has been , of late years , a great deal of attention directed toward common seamen , and a strong sympathy awakened in their behalf . Yet I believe that , with the single exception which I have mentioned , there has not been a book written , professing to give their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can know what their life really is . A voice from the forecastle has hardly yet been heard . In the following pages I design to give an accurate and authentic narrative of a little more than two years spent as a common sailor , before the mast , in the American merchant service . It is written out from a journal which I kept at the time , and from notes which I made of most of the events as they happened ; and in it I have adhered closely to fact in every particular , and endeavored to give each thing its true character . In so doing , I have been obliged occasionally to use strong and coarse expressions , and in some instances to give scenes which may be painful to nice feelings ; but I have very carefully avoided doing so , whenever I have not felt them essential to giving the true character of a scene . My design is , and it is this which has induced me to publish the book , to present the life of a common sailor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark together . There may be in some parts a good deal that is unintelligible to the general reader ; but I have found from my own experience , and from what I have heard from others , that plain matters of fact in relation to customs and habits of life new to us , and descriptions of life under new aspects , act upon the inexperienced through the imagination , so that we are hardly aware of our want of technical knowledge . Thousands read the escape of the American frigate through the British channel , and the chase and wreck of the Bristol trader in the Red Rover , and follow the minute nautical manoeuvres with breathless interest , who do not know the name of a rope in the ship ; and perhaps with none the less admiration and enthusiasm for their want of acquaintance with the professional detail . In preparing this narrative I have carefully avoided incorporating into it any impressions but those made upon me by the events as they occurred , leaving to my concluding chapter , to which I shall respectfully call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested to me by subsequent reflection . These reasons , and the advice of a few friends , have led me to give this narrative to the press . If it shall interest the general reader , and call more attention to the welfare of seamen , or give any information as to their real condition , which may serve to raise them in the rank of beings , and to promote in any measure their religious and moral improvement , and diminish the hardships of their daily life , the end of its publication will be answered . R.H.D. , Jr . Boston , July , 1840 . CHAPTER I DEPARTURE The fourteenth of August was the day fixed upon for the sailing of the brig Pilgrim on her voyage from Boston round Cape Horn to the western coast of North America . As she was to get under weigh early in the afternoon , I made my appearance on board at twelve o'clock , in full sea-rig , and with my chest , containing an outfit for a two or three year voyage , which I had undertaken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire change of life , and by a long absence from books and study , a weakness of the eyes , which had obliged me to give up my pursuits , and which no medical aid seemed likely to cure . The change from the tight dress coat , silk cap , and kid gloves of an undergraduate at Cambridge , to the loose duck trowsers , checked shirt and tarpaulin hat of a sailor , though somewhat of a transformation , was soon made , and I supposed that I should pass very well for a jack tar . But it is impossible to deceive the practised eye in these matters ; and while I supposed myself to be looking as salt as Neptune himself , I was , no doubt , known for a landsman by every one on board as soon as I hove in sight . A sailor has a peculiar cut to his clothes , and a way of wearing them which a green hand can never get . The trowsers , tight round the hips , and thence hanging long and loose round the feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well varnished black hat , worn on the back of the head , with half a fathom of black ribbon hanging over the left eye , and a peculiar tie to the black silk neckerchief , with sundry other minutiae , are signs , the want of which betray the beginner at once . Beside the points in my dress which were out of the way , doubtless my complexion and hands were enough to distinguish me from the regular salt , who , with a sun-burnt cheek , wide step , and rolling gait , swings his bronzed and toughened hands athwart-ships , half open , as though just ready to grasp a rope . " With all my imperfections on my head , " I joined the crew , and we hauled out into the stream , and came to anchor for the night . The next day we were employed in preparations for sea , reeving studding-sail gear , crossing royal yards , putting on chafing gear , and taking on board our powder . On the following night , I stood my first watch . I remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that I might not hear when I was called ; and when I went on deck , so great were my ideas of the importance of my trust , that I walked regularly fore and aft the whole length of the vessel , looking out over the bows and taffrail at each turn , and was not a little surprised at the coolness of the old salt whom I called to take my place , in stowing himself snugly away under the long boat , for a nap . That was sufficient lookout , he thought , for a fine night , at anchor in a safe harbor . The next morning was Saturday , and a breeze having sprung up from the southward , we took a pilot on board , hove up our anchor , and began beating down the bay . I took leave of those of my friends who came to see me off , and had barely opportunity to take a last look at the city , and well-known objects , as no time is allowed on board ship for sentiment . As we drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead in the bay , and were obliged to come to anchor in the roads . We remained there through the day and a part of the night . My watch began at eleven o'clock at night , and I received orders to call the captain if the wind came out from the westward . About midnight the wind became fair , and having called the captain , I was ordered to call all hands . How I accomplished this I do not know , but I am quite sure I did not give the true hoarse , boatswain call of " A-a-ll ha-a-a-nds ! up anchor , a-ho-oy ! " In a short time every one was in motion , the sails loosed , the yards braced , and we began to heave up the anchor , which was our last hold upon Yankee land . I could take but little part in all these preparations . My little knowledge of a vessel was all at fault . Unintelligible orders were so rapidly given and so immediately executed ; there was such a hurrying about , and such an intermingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely bewildered . There is not so helpless and pitiable an object in the world as a landsman beginning a sailor 's life . At length those peculiar , long-drawn sounds , which denote that the crew are heaving the windlass , began , and in a few moments we were under weigh . The noise of the water thrown from the bows began to be heard , the vessel leaned over from the damp night breeze , and rolled with the heavy ground swell , and we had actually begun our long , long journey . This was literally bidding " good night " to my native land . CHAPTER II FIRST IMPRESSIONS  --  " SAIL HO ! " The first day we passed at sea was the Sabbath . As we were just from port , and there was a great deal to be done on board , we were kept at work all day , and at night the watches were set , and everything put into sea order . When we were called aft to be divided into watches , I had a good specimen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made , he gave a short characteristic speech , walking the quarter deck with a cigar in his mouth , and dropping the words out between the puffs . " Now , my men , we have begun a long voyage . If we get along well together , we shall have a comfortable time ; if we do n't , we shall have hell afloat .  --  All you 've got to do is to obey your orders and do your duty like men ,  --  then you 'll fare well enough ;  --  if you do n't , you 'll fare hard enough ,  --  I can tell you . If we pull together , you 'll find me a clever fellow ; if we do n't , you 'll find me a bloody rascal .  --  That 's all I 've got to say .  --  Go below , the larboard watch ! " I being in the starboard or second mate 's watch , had the opportunity of keeping the first watch at sea . S  --   --  , a young man , making , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch , and as he was the son of a professional man , and had been in a counting-room in Boston , we found that we had many friends and topics in common . We talked these matters over ,  --  Boston , what our friends were probably doing , our voyage , etc. , until he went to take his turn at the look-out , and left me to myself . I had now a fine time for reflection . I felt for the first time the perfect silence of the sea . The officer was walking the quarter deck , where I had no right to go , one or two men were talking on the forecastle , whom I had little inclination to join , so that I was left open to the full impression of everything about me . However much I was affected by the beauty of the sea , the bright stars , and the clouds driven swiftly over them , I could not but remember that I was separating myself from all the social and intellectual enjoyments of life . Yet , strange as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in these reflections , hoping by them to prevent my becoming insensible to the value of what I was leaving . But all my dreams were soon put to flight by an order from the officer to trim the yards , as the wind was getting ahead ; and I could plainly see by the looks the sailors occasionally cast to windward , and by the dark clouds that were fast coming up , that we had bad weather to prepare for , and had heard the captain say that he expected to be in the Gulf Stream by twelve o'clock . In a few minutes eight bells were struck , the watch called , and we went below . I now began to feel the first discomforts of a sailor 's life . The steerage in which I lived was filled with coils of rigging , spare sails , old junk and ship stores , which had not been stowed away . Moreover , there had been no berths built for us to sleep in , and we were not allowed to drive nails to hang our clothes upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel was rolling heavily , and everything was pitched about in grand confusion . There was a complete " hurrah 's nest , " as the sailors say , " everything on top and nothing at hand . " A large hawser had been coiled away upon my chest ; my hats , boots , mattress and blankets had all fetched away and gone over to leeward , and were jammed and broken under the boxes and coils of rigging . To crown all , we were allowed no light to find anything with , and I was just beginning to feel strong symptoms of sea-sickness , and that listlessness and inactivity which accompany it . Giving up all attempts to collect my things together , I lay down upon the sails , expecting every moment to hear the cry of " all hands , ahoy , " which the approaching storm would soon make necessary . I shortly heard the rain-drops falling on deck , thick and fast , and the watch evidently had their hands full of work , for I could hear the loud and repeated orders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blocks , and all the accompaniments of a coming storm . In a few minutes the slide of the hatch was thrown back , which let down the noise and tumult of the deck still louder , the loud cry of " All hands , ahoy ! tumble up here and take in sail , " saluted our ears , and the hatch was quickly shut again . When I got upon deck , a new scene and a new experience were before me . The little brig was close hauled upon the wind , and lying over , as it then seemed to me , nearly upon her beam ends . The heavy head sea was beating against her bows with the noise and force almost of a sledge-hammer , and flying over the deck , drenching us completely through . The topsail halyards had been let go , and the great sails filling out and backing against the masts with a noise like thunder . The wind was whistling through the rigging , loose ropes flying about ; loud and , to me , unintelligible orders constantly given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at the ropes in their hoarse and peculiar strains . In addition to all this , I had not got my " sea legs on , " was dreadfully sick , with hardly strength enough to hold on to anything , and it was " pitch dark . " This was my state when I was ordered aloft , for the first time , to reef topsails . How I got along , I can not now remember . I " laid out " on the yards and held on with all my strength . I could not have been of much service , for I remember having been sick several times before I left the topsail yard . Soon all was snug aloft , and we were again allowed to go below . This I did not consider much of a favor , for the confusion of everything below , and that inexpressible sickening smell , caused by the shaking up of the bilge-water in the hold , made the steerage but an indifferent refuge from the cold , wet decks . I had often read of the nautical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be none worse than mine ; for in addition to every other evil , I could not but remember that this was only the first night of a two years ' voyage . When we were on deck we were not much better off , for we were continually ordered about by the officer , who said that it was good for us to be in motion . Yet anything was better than the horrible state of things below . I remember very well going to the hatchway and putting my head down , when I was oppressed by nausea , and always being relieved immediately . It was as good as an emetic . This state of things continued for two days . Wednesday , Aug. 20th . We had the watch on deck from four till eight , this morning . When we came on deck at four o'clock , we found things much changed for the better . The sea and wind had gone down , and the stars were out bright . I experienced a corresponding change in my feelings ; yet continued extremely weak from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather side , watching the gradual breaking of the day , and the first streaks of the early light . Much has been said of the sun-rise at sea ; but it will not compare with the sun-rise on shore . It wants the accompaniments of the songs of birds , the awakening hum of men , and the glancing of the first beams upon trees , hills , spires , and house-tops , to give it life and spirit . But though the actual rise of the sun at sea is not so beautiful , yet nothing will compare with the early breaking of day upon the wide ocean . There is something in the first grey streaks stretching along the eastern horizon and throwing an indistinct light upon the face of the deep , which combines with the boundlessness and unknown depth of the sea around you , and gives one a feeling of loneliness , of dread , and of melancholy foreboding , which nothing else in nature can give . This gradually passes away as the light grows brighter , and when the sun comes up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these , I was aroused by the order from the officer , " Forward there ! rig the head-pump ! " I found that no time was allowed for day-dreaming , but that we must " turn-to " at the first light . Having called up the " idlers , " namely carpenter , cook , steward , etc. , and rigged the pump , we commenced washing down the decks . This operation , which is performed every morning at sea , takes nearly two hours ; and I had hardly strength enough to get through it . After we had finished , swabbed down , and coiled up the rigging , I sat down on the spars , waiting for seven bells , which was the sign for breakfast . The officer , seeing my lazy posture , ordered me to slush the main-mast , from the royal-mast-head , down . The vessel was then rolling a little , and I had taken no sustenance for three days , so that I felt tempted to tell him that I had rather wait till after breakfast ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns , " and that if I showed any sign of want of spirit or of backwardness , that I should be ruined at once . So I took my bucket of grease and climbed up to the royal-mast-head . Here the rocking of the vessel , which increases the higher you go from the foot of the mast , which is the fulcrum of the lever , and the smell of the grease , which offended my fastidious senses , upset my stomach again , and I was not a little rejoiced when I got upon the comparative terra firma of the deck . In a few minutes seven bells were struck , the log hove , the watch called , and we went to breakfast . Here I can not but remember the advice of the cook , a simple-hearted African . " Now , " says he , " my lad , you are well cleaned out ; you have n't got a drop of your ' long-shore swash aboard of you . You must begin on a new tack ,  --  pitch all your sweetmeats overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll promise you , you 'll have your ribs well sheathed , and be as hearty as any of ' em , afore you are up to the Horn . " This would be good advice to give to passengers , when they speak of the little niceties which they have laid in , in case of sea-sickness . I can not describe the change which half a pound of cold salt beef and a biscuit or two produced in me . I was a new being . We had a watch below until noon , so that I had some time to myself ; and getting a huge piece of strong , cold , salt beef from the cook , I kept gnawing upon it until twelve o'clock . When we went on deck I felt somewhat like a man , and could begin to learn my sea duty with considerable spirit . At about two o'clock we heard the loud cry of " sail ho ! " from aloft , and soon saw two sails to windward , going directly athwart our hawse . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . I thought then , and always have since , that it exceeds every other sight in interest and beauty . They passed to leeward of us , and out of hailing distance ; but the captain could read the names on their sterns with the glass . They were the ship Helen Mar , of New York , and the brig Mermaid , of Boston . They were both steering westward , and were bound in for our " dear native land . " Thursday , Aug. 21st . This day the sun rose clear , we had a fine wind , and everything was bright and cheerful . I had now got my sea legs on , and was beginning to enter upon the regular duties of a sea-life . About six bells , that is , three o'clock , P.M. , we saw a sail on our larboard bow . I was very anxious , like every new sailor , to speak her . She came down to us , backed her main-top-sail , and the two vessels stood " head on , " bowing and curvetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their riders . It was the first vessel that I had seen near , and I was surprised to find how much she rolled and pitched in so quiet a sea . She lunged her head into the sea , and then , her stern settling gradually down , her huge bows rose up , showing the bright copper , and her stern , and bresthooks dripping , like old Neptune 's locks , with the brine . Her decks were filled with passengers who had come up at the cry of " sail ho , " and who by their dress and features appeared to be Swiss and French emigrants . She hailed us at first in French , but receiving no answer , she tried us in English . She was the ship La Carolina , from Havre , for New York . We desired her to report the brig Pilgrim , from Boston , for the north-west coast of America , five days out . She then filled away and left us to plough on through our waste of waters . This day ended pleasantly ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that routine of sea-life which is only broken by a storm , a sail , or the sight of land . CHAPTER III SHIP 'S DUTIES  --  TROPICS As we had now a long " spell " of fine weather , without any incident to break the monotony of our lives , there can be no better place to describe the duties , regulations , and customs of an American merchantman , of which ours was a fair specimen . The captain , in the first place , is lord paramount . He stands no watch , comes and goes when he pleases , and is accountable to no one , and must be obeyed in everything , without a question , even from his chief officer . He has the power to turn his officers off duty , and even to break them and make them do duty as sailors in the forecastle . When there are no passengers and no supercargo , as in our vessel , he has no companion but his own dignity , and no pleasures , unless he differs from most of his kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally , the exercise of it . The prime minister , the official organ , and the active and superintending officer , is the chief mate . He is first lieutenant , boatswain , sailing-master , and quarter-master . The captain tells him what he wishes to have done , and leaves to him the care of overseeing , of allotting the work , and also the responsibility of its being well done . The mate ( as he is always called , par excellence ) also keeps the log-book , for which he is responsible to the owners and insurers , and has the charge of the stowage , safe keeping , and delivery of the cargo . He is also , ex-officio , the wit of the crew ; for the captain does not condescend to joke with the men , and the second mate no one cares for ; so that when " the mate " thinks fit to entertain " the people " with a coarse joke or a little practical wit , every one feels bound to laugh . The second mate 's is proverbially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men do not respect him as an officer , and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the topsails , and to put his hands into the tar and slush , with the rest . The crew call him the " sailor 's waiter , " as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn , marline , and all other stuffs that they need in their work , and has charge of the boatswain 's locker , which includes serving-boards , marline-spikes , etc . He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience , and still is kept at a great distance from the mate , and obliged to work with the crew . He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required . His wages are usually double those of a common sailor , and he eats and sleeps in the cabin ; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time , and eats at the second table , that is , makes a meal out of what the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's servant , and has charge of the pantry , from which every one , even the mate himself , is excluded . These distinctions usually find him an enemy in the mate , who does not like to have any one on board who is not entirely under his control ; the crew do not consider him as one of their number , so he is left to the mercy of the captain . The cook is the patron of the crew , and those who are in his favor can get their wet mittens and stockings dried , or light their pipes at the galley on the night watch . These two worthies , together with the carpenter and sailmaker , if there be one , stand no watch , but , being employed all day , are allowed to " sleep in " at night , unless all hands are called . The crew are divided into two divisions , as equally as may be , called the watches . Of these the chief mate commands the larboard , and the second mate the starboard . They divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , as it is called , on deck and below , every other four hours . If , for instance , the chief mate with the larboard watch have the first night-watch from eight to twelve ; at the end of the four hours , the starboard watch is called , and the second mate takes the deck , while the larboard watch and the first mate go below until four in the morning , when they come on deck again and remain until eight ; having what is called the morning watch . As they will have been on deck eight hours out of the twelve , while those who had the middle watch  --  from twelve to four , will only have been up four hours , they have what is called a " forenoon watch below , " that is , from eight , A.M. , till twelve , M. In a man-of-war , and in some merchantmen , this alteration of watches is kept up throughout the twenty-four hours ; but our ship , like most merchantmen , had " all hands " from twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had " watch and watch . " An explanation of the " dog watches " may , perhaps , be of use to one who has never been at sea . They are to shift the watches each night , so that the same watch need not be on deck at the same hours . In order to effect this , the watch from four to eight , P.M. , is divided into two half , or dog watches , one from four to six , and the other from six to eight . By this means they divide the twenty-four hours into seven watches instead of six , and thus shift the hours every night . As the dog watches come during twilight , after the day 's work is done , and before the night watch is set , they are the watches in which everybody is on deck . The captain is up , walking on the weather side of the quarter-deck , the chief mate is on the lee side , and the second mate about the weather gangway . The steward has finished his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipe with the cook in the galley . The crew are sitting on the windlass or lying on the forecastle , smoking , singing , or telling long yarns . At eight o'clock , eight bells are struck , the log is hove , the watch set , the wheel relieved , the galley shut up , and the other watch goes below . The morning commences with the watch on deck 's " turning-to " at day-break and washing down , scrubbing , and swabbing the decks . This , together with filling the " scuttled butt " with fresh water , and coiling up the rigging , usually occupies the time until seven bells , ( half after seven , ) when all hands get breakfast . At eight , the day 's work begins , and lasts until sun-down , with the exception of an hour for dinner . Before I end my explanations , it may be well to define a day 's work , and to correct a mistake prevalent among landsmen about a sailor 's life . Nothing is more common than to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ?  --  what can they find to do ? " This is a very natural mistake , and being very frequently made , it is one which every sailor feels interested in having corrected . In the first place , then , the discipline of the ship requires every man to be at work upon something when he is on deck , except at night and on Sundays . Except at these times , you will never see a man , on board a well-ordered vessel , standing idle on deck , sitting down , or leaning over the side . It is the officers ' duty to keep every one at work , even if there is nothing to be done but to scrape the rust from the chain cables . In no state prison are the convicts more regularly set to work , and more closely watched . No conversation is allowed among the crew at their duty , and though they frequently do talk when aloft , or when near one another , yet they always stop when an officer is nigh . With regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter which probably would not be understood by one who has not been at sea . When I first left port , and found that we were kept regularly employed for a week or two , I supposed that we were getting the vessel into sea trim , and that it would soon be over , and we should have nothing to do but sail the ship ; but I found that it continued so for two years , and at the end of the two years there was as much to be done as ever . As has often been said , a ship is like a lady 's watch , always out of repair . When first leaving port , studding-sail gear is to be rove , all the running rigging to be examined , that which is unfit for use to be got down , and new rigging rove in its place : then the standing rigging is to be overhauled , replaced , and repaired , in a thousand different ways ; and wherever any of the numberless ropes or the yards are chafing or wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is called , must be put on . This chafing gear consists of worming , parcelling , roundings , battens , and service of all kinds  --  both rope-yarns , spun-yarn , marline and seizing-stuffs . Taking off , putting on , and mending the chafing gear alone , upon a vessel , would find constant employment for two or three men , during working hours , for a whole voyage . The next point to be considered is , that all the " small stuffs " which are used on board a ship  --  such as spun-yarn , marline , seizing-stuff , etc.  --  are made on board . The owners of a vessel buy up incredible quantities of " old junk , " which the sailors unlay , after drawing out the yarns , knot them together , and roll them up in balls . These " rope-yarns " are constantly used for various purposes , but the greater part is manufactured into spun-yarn . For this purpose every vessel is furnished with a " spun-yarn winch ; " which is very simple , consisting of a wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck in pleasant weather ; and we had employment , during a great part of the time , for three hands in drawing and knotting yarns , and making them spun-yarn . Another method of employing the crew is , " setting up " rigging . Whenever any of the standing rigging becomes slack , ( which is continually happening ) , the seizings and coverings must be taken off , tackles got up , and after the rigging is bowsed well taught , the seizings and coverings replaced ; which is a very nice piece of work . There is also such a connection between different parts of a vessel , that one rope can seldom be touched without altering another . You can not stay a mast aft by the back stays , without slacking up the head stays , etc . If we add to this all the tarring , greasing , oiling , varnishing , painting , scraping , and scrubbing which is required in the course of a long voyage , and also remember this is all to be done in addition to watching at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and setting sail , and pulling , hauling , and climbing in every direction , one will hardly ask , " What can a sailor find to do at sea ? " If , after all this labor  --  after exposing their lives and limbs in storms , wet and cold , " Wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch ; The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry ;  --  " the merchants and captain think that they have not earned their twelve dollars a month , ( out of which they clothe themselves , ) and their salt beef and hard bread , they keep them picking oakum  --  ad infinitum . This is the usual resource upon a rainy day , for then it will not do to work upon rigging ; and when it is pouring down in floods , instead of letting the sailors stand about in sheltered places , and talk , and keep themselves comfortable , they are separated to different parts of the ship and kept at work picking oakum . I have seen oakum stuff placed about in different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle in the snatches between the frequent squalls upon crossing the equator . Some officers have been so driven to find work for the crew in a ship ready for sea , that they have set them to pounding the anchors ( often done ) and scraping the chain cables . The " Philadelphia Catechism " is , " Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able , And on the seventh  --  holystone the decks and scrape the cable . " This kind of work , of course , is not kept up off Cape Horn , Cape of Good Hope , and in extreme north and south latitudes ; but I have seen the decks washed down and scrubbed , when the water would have frozen if it had been fresh ; and all hands kept at work upon the rigging , when we had on our pea-jackets , and our hands so numb that we could hardly hold our marline-spikes . I have here gone out of my narrative course in order that any who read this may form as correct an idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it in this place because , for some time , our life was nothing but the unvarying repetition of these duties , which can be better described together . Before leaving this description , however , I would state , in order to show landsmen how little they know of the nature of a ship , that a ship-carpenter is kept in constant employ during good weather on board vessels which are in , what is called , perfect sea order . CHAPTER IV A ROGUE  --  TROUBLE ON BOARD  --  " LAND HO ! "  --  POMPERO  --  CAPE HORN After speaking the Carolina , on the 21st August , nothing occurred to break the monotony of our life until Friday , September 5th , when we saw a sail on our weather ( starboard ) beam . She proved to be a brig under English colors , and passing under our stern , reported herself as forty-nine days from Buenos Ayres , bound to Liverpool . Before she had passed us , " sail ho ! " was cried again , and we made another sail , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She passed out of hail , but we made her out to be an hermaphrodite brig , with Brazilian colors in her main rigging . By her course , she must have been bound from Brazil to the south of Europe , probably Portugal . Sunday , Sept. 7th . Fell in with the north-east trade winds . This morning we caught our first dolphin , which I was very eager to see . I was disappointed in the colors of this fish when dying . They were certainly very beautiful , but not equal to what has been said of them . They are too indistinct . To do the fish justice , there is nothing more beautiful than the dolphin when swimming a few feet below the surface , on a bright day . It is the most elegantly formed , and also the quickest fish , in salt water ; and the rays of the sun striking upon it , in its rapid and changing motions , reflected from the water , make it look like a stray beam from a rainbow . This day was spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed down , the rigging coiled up , and everything put in order ; and throughout the day , only one watch is kept on deck at a time . The men are all dressed in their best white duck trowsers , and red or checked shirts , and have nothing to do but to make the necessary changes in the sails . They employ themselves in reading , talking , smoking , and mending their clothes . If the weather is pleasant , they bring their work and their books upon deck , and sit down upon the forecastle and windlass . This is the only day on which these privileges are allowed them . When Monday comes , they put on their tarry trowsers again , and prepare for six days of labor . To enhance the value of the Sabbath to the crew , they are allowed on that day a pudding , or , as it is called , a " duff . " This is nothing more than flour boiled with water , and eaten with molasses . It is very heavy , dark , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and really forms an agreeable variety with salt beef and pork . Many a rascally captain has made friends of his crew by allowing them duff twice a week on the passage home . On board some vessels this is made a day of instruction and of religious exercises ; but we had a crew of swearers , from the captain to the smallest boy ; and a day of rest , and of something like quiet , social enjoyment , was all that we could expect . We continued running large before the north-east trade winds for several days , until Monday  --  September 22d ; when , upon coming on deck at seven bells in the morning , we found the other watch aloft throwing water upon the sails ; and looking astern , we saw a small clipper-built brig with a black hull heading directly after us . We went to work immediately , and put all the canvas upon the brig which we could get upon her , rigging out oars for studding-sail yards ; and continued wetting down the sails by buckets of water whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there came on a drizzling rain . The vessel continued in pursuit , changing her course as we changed ours , to keep before the wind . The captain , who watched her with his glass , said that she was armed , and full of men , and showed no colors . We continued running dead before the wind , knowing that we sailed better so , and that clippers are fastest on the wind . We had also another advantage . The wind was light , and we spread more canvas than she did , having royals and sky-sails fore and aft , and ten studding-sails ; while she , being an hermaphrodite brig , had only a gaff topsail , aft . Early in the morning she was overhauling us a little , but after the rain came on and the wind grew lighter , we began to leave her astern . All hands remained on deck throughout the day , and we got our arms in order ; but we were too few to have done anything with her , if she had proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the night which followed was exceedingly dark , so that by putting out all the lights and altering our course four points , we hoped to get out of her reach . We had no light in the binnacle , but steered by the stars , and kept perfect silence through the night . At daybreak there was no sign of anything in the horizon , and we kept the vessel off to her course . Wednesday , October 1st . Crossed the equator in long . 24 deg. 24 ' W. I now , for the first time , felt at liberty , according to the old usage , to call myself a son of Neptune , and was very glad to be able to claim the title without the disagreeable initiation which so many have to go through . After once crossing the line you can never be subjected to the process , but are considered as a son of Neptune , with full powers to play tricks upon others . This ancient custom is now seldom allowed , unless there are passengers on board , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been obvious to all hands for some time that the second mate , whose name was F  --   --  , was an idle , careless fellow , and not much of a sailor , and that the captain was exceedingly dissatisfied with him . The power of the captain in these cases was well known , and we all anticipated a difficulty . F  --   --  ( called Mr. by virtue of his office ) was but half a sailor , having always been short voyages and remained at home a long time between them . His father was a man of some property , and intended to have given his son a liberal education ; but he , being idle and worthless , was sent off to sea , and succeeded no better there ; for , unlike many scamps , he had none of the qualities of a sailor  --  he was " not of the stuff that they make sailor of . " He was one of that class of officers who are disliked by their captain and despised by the crew . He used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain , and play with the boys , and relax discipline in every way . This kind of conduct always makes the captain suspicious , and is never pleasant , in the end , to the men ; they preferring to have an officer active , vigilant , and distant as may be , with kindness . Among other bad practices , he frequently slept on his watch , and having been discovered asleep by the captain , he was told that he would be turned off duty if he did it again . To prevent it in every way possible , the hen-coops were ordered to be knocked up , for the captain never sat down on deck himself , and never permitted an officer to do so . The second night after crossing the equator , we had the watch from eight till twelve , and it was " my helm " for the last two hours . There had been light squalls through the night , and the captain told Mr. F  --   --  , who commanded our watch , to keep a bright look-out . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was quite drowsy , and at last he stretched himself on the companion and went fast asleep . Soon afterwards , the captain came very quietly on deck , and stood by me for some time looking at the compass . The officer at length became aware of the captain 's presence , but pretending not to know it , began humming and whistling to himself , to show that he was not asleep , and went forward , without looking behind him , and ordered the main royal to be loosed . On turning round to come aft , he pretended surprise at seeing the master on deck . This would not do . The captain was too " wide awake " for him , and beginning upon him at once , gave him a grand blow-up , in true nautical style  --  " You 're a lazy , good-for-nothing rascal ; you 're neither man , boy , soger , nor sailor ! you 're no more than a thing aboard a vessel ! you do n't earn your salt ! you 're worse than a Mahon soger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor 's vocabulary . After the poor fellow had taken the harangue , he was sent into his state-room , and the captain stood the rest of the watch himself . At seven bells in the morning , all hands were called aft and told that F  --   --  was no longer an officer on board , and that we might choose one of our own number for second mate . It is usual for the captain to make this offer , and it is very good policy , for the crew think themselves the choosers and are flattered by it , but have to obey , nevertheless . Our crew , as is usual , refused to take the responsibility of choosing a man of whom we would never be able to complain , and left it to the captain . He picked out an active and intelligent young sailor , born near the Kennebee , who had been several Canton voyages , and proclaimed him in the following manner : " I choose Jim Hall  --  he 's your second mate . All you 've got to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that he is Mr. Hall . " F  --   --  went forward into the forecastle as a common sailor , and lost the handle to his name , while young fore-mast Jim became Mr. Hall , and took up his quarters in the land of knives and forks and tea-cups . Sunday , October 5th . It was our morning watch ; when , soon after the day began to break , a man on the forecastle called out , " Land ho ! " I had never heard the cry before , and did not know what it meant , ( and few would suspect what the words were , when hearing the strange sound for the first time , ) but I soon found , by the direction of all eyes , that there was land stretching along our weather beam . We immediately took in studding-sails and hauled our wind , running in for the land . This was done to determine our longitude ; for by the captain 's chronometer we were in 25 ? W. , but by his observations we were much farther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his chronometer or his sextant which was out of order . This land-fall settled the matter , and the former instrument was condemned , and becoming still worse , was never afterwards used . As we ran in towards the coast , we found that we were directly off the port of Pernambuco , and could see with the telescope the roofs of the houses , and one large church , and the town of Olinda . We ran along by the mouth of the harbor , and saw a full-rigged brig going in . At two , P.M. , we again kept off before the wind , leaving the land on our quarter , and at sun-down , it was out of sight . It was here that I first saw one of those singular things called catamarans . They are composed of logs lashed together upon the water ; have one large sail , are quite fast , and , strange as it may seem , are trusted as good sea boats . We saw several , with from one to three men in each , boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . The Indians go out in them after fish , and as the weather is regular in certain seasons , they have no fear . After taking a new departure from Olinda , we kept off on our way to Cape Horn . We met with nothing remarkable until we were in the latitude of the river La Plata . Here there are violent gales from the south-west , called Pomperos , which are very destructive to the shipping in the river , and are felt for many leagues at sea . They are usually preceded by lightning . The captain told the mates to keep a bright look-out , and if they saw lightning at the south-west , to take in sail at once . We got the first touch of one during my watch on deck . I was walking in the lee gangway , and thought that I saw lightning on the lee bow . I told the second mate , who came over and looked out for some time . It was very black in the south-west , and in about ten minutes we saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had now left us , and it was dead calm . We sprang aloft immediately and furled the royals and top-gallant-sails , and took in the flying jib , hauled up the mainsail and trysail , squared the after yards , and awaited the attack . A huge mist capped with black clouds came driving towards us , extending over that quarter of the horizon , and covering the stars , which shone brightly in the other part of the heavens . It came upon us at once with a blast , and a shower of hail and rain , which almost took our breath from us . The hardiest was obliged to turn his back . We let the halyards run , and fortunately were not taken aback . The little vessel " paid off " from the wind , and ran on for some time directly before it , tearing through the water with everything flying . Having called all hands , we close-reefed the topsails and trysail , furled the courses and job , set the fore-top-mast staysail , and brought her up nearly to her course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ease her . This was the first blow , that I had seen , which could really be called a gale . We had reefed our topsails in the Gulf Stream , and I thought it something serious , but an older sailor would have thought nothing of it . As I had now become used to the vessel and to my duty , I was of some service on a yard , and could knot my reef-point as well as anybody . I obeyed the order to lay1 aloft with the rest , and found the reefing a very exciting scene ; for one watch reefed the fore-topsail , and the other the main , and every one did his utmost to get his topsail hoisted first . We had a great advantage over the larboard watch , because the chief mate never goes aloft , while our new second mate used to jump into the rigging as soon as we began to haul out the reef-tackle , and have the weather earing passed before there was a man upon the yard . In this way we were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leeward " before them , and having knotted our points , would slide down the shrouds and back-stays , and sing out at the topsail halyards to let it be known that we were ahead of them . Reefing is the most exciting part of a sailor 's duty . All hands are engaged upon it , and after the halyards are let go , there is no time to be lost  --  no " sogering , " or hanging back , then . If one is not quick enough , another runs over him . The first on the yard goes to the weather earing , the second to the lee , and the next two to the " dog 's ears ; " while the others lay along into the bunt , just giving each other elbow-room . In reefing , the yard-arms ( the extremes of the yards ) are the posts of honor ; but in furling , the strongest and most experienced stand in the slings , ( or , middle of the yard , ) to make up the bunt . If the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one take either of these posts from him ; but if he is wanting either in seamanship , strength , or activity , some better man will get the bunt and earings from him ; which immediately brings him into disrepute . We remained for the rest of the night , and throughout the next day , under the same close sail , for it continued to blow very fresh ; and though we had no more hail , yet there was a soaking rain , and it was quite cold and uncomfortable ; the more so , because we were not prepared for cold weather , but had on our thin clothes . We were glad to get a watch below , and put on our thick clothing , boots , and south-westers . Towards sun-down the gale moderated a little , and it began to clear off in the south-west . We shook our reefs out , one by one , and before midnight had top-gallant sails upon her . We had now made up our minds for Cape Horn and cold weather , and entered upon every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw land upon our larboard quarter . There were two islands , of different size but of the same shape ; rather high , beginning low at the water 's edge , and running with a curved ascent to the middle . They were so far off as to be of a deep blue color , and in a few hours we sank them in the north-east . These were the Falkland Islands . We had run between them and the main land of Patagonia . At sun-set the second mate , who was at the masthead , said that he saw land on the starboard bow . This must have been the island of Staten Land ; and we were now in the region of Cape Horn , with a fine breeze from the northward , top-mast and top-gallant studding-sails set , and every prospect of a speedy and pleasant passage round . 1 This word " lay , " which is in such general use on board ship , being used in giving orders instead of " go " ; as " Lay forward ! " " Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not understand to be the neuter verb , lie , mispronounced , but to be the active verb lay , with the objective case understood ; as " Lay yourselves forwards ! " " Lay yourselves aft ! " etc . CHAPTER V CAPE HORN  --  A VISIT Wednesday , Nov. 5th . The weather was fine during the previous night , and we had a clear view of the Magellan Clouds , and of the Southern Cross . The Magellan Clouds consist of three small nebulae in the southern part of the heavens ,  --  two bright , like the milky-way , and one dark . These are first seen , just above the horizon , soon after crossing the southern tropic . When off Cape Horn , they are nearly overhead . The cross is composed of four stars in that form , and is said to be the brightest constellation in the heavens . During the first part of this day ( Wednesday ) the wind was light , but after noon it came on fresh , and we furled the royals . We still kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go round with them , if he could . Just before eight o'clock , ( then about sun-down , in that latitude , ) the cry of " All hands ahoy ! " was sounded down the fore scuttle and the after hatchway , and hurrying upon deck , we found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the south-west , and blackening the whole heavens . " Here comes the Cape Horn ! " said the chief mate ; and we had hardly time to haul down and clew up , before it was upon us . In a few moments , a heavier sea was raised than I had ever seen before , and as it was directly ahead , the little brig , which was no better than a bathing machine , plunged into it , and all the forward part of her was under water ; the sea pouring in through the bow-ports and hawse-hole and over the knight-heads , threatening to wash everything overboard . In the lee scuppers it was up to a man 's waist . We sprang aloft and double reefed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made all snug . But this would not do ; the brig was laboring and straining against the head sea , and the gale was growing worse and worse . At the same time the sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us . We clewed down , and hauled out the reef-tackles again , and close-reefed the fore-topsail , and furled the main , and hove her to on the starboard tack . Here was an end to our fine prospects . We made up our minds to head winds and cold weather ; sent down the royal yards , and unrove the gear , but all the rest of the top hamper remained aloft , even to the sky-sail masts and studding-sail booms . Throughout the night it stormed violently  --  rain , hail , snow , and sleet beating down upon the vessel  --  the wind continuing to break ahead , and the sea running high . At daybreak ( about three , A.M. ) the deck was covered with snow . The captain sent up the steward with a glass of grog to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were off the Cape , grog was given to the morning watch , and to all hands whenever we reefed topsails . The clouds cleared away at sun-rise , and the wind becoming more fair , we again made sail and stood nearly up to our course . Thursday , Nov. 6th . It continued more pleasant through the first part of the day , but at night we had the same scene over again . This time , we did not heave to , as on the night before , but endeavored to beat to windward under close-reefed top-sails , balance-reefed trysail , and fore top-mast stay-sail . This night it was my turn to steer , or , as the sailors say , my trick at the helm , for two hours . Inexperienced as I was , I made out to steer to the satisfaction of the officer , and neither S  --   --  nor myself gave up our tricks , all the time that we were off the Cape . This was something to boast of , for it requires a good deal of skill and watchfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind , against a heavy head sea . " Ease her when she pitches , " is the word ; and a little carelessness in letting her ship a heavy sea , might sweep the decks , or knock masts out of her . Friday , Nov. 7th . Towards morning the wind went down , and during the whole forenoon we lay tossing about in a dead calm , and in the midst of a thick fog . The calms here are unlike those in most parts of the world , for there is always such a high sea running , and the periods of calm are so short , that it has no time to go down ; and vessels , being under no command of sails or rudder , lie like logs upon the water . We were obliged to steady the booms and yards by guys and braces , and to lash everything well below . We now found our top hamper of some use , for though it is liable to be carried away or sprung by the sudden " bringing up " of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great help in steadying a vessel when rolling in a long swell ; giving it more slowness , ease , and regularity to the motion . The calm of the morning reminds me of a scene which I forgot to describe at the time of its occurrence , but which I remember from its being the first time that I had heard the near breathing of whales . It was on the night that we passed between the Falkland Islands and Staten Land . We had the watch from twelve to four , and coming upon deck , found the little brig lying perfectly still , surrounded by a thick fog , and the sea as smooth as though oil had been poured upon it ; yet now and then a long , low swell rolling over its surface , slightly lifting the vessel , but without breaking the glassy smoothness of the water . We were surrounded far and near by shoals of sluggish whales and grampuses ; which the fog prevented our seeing , rising slowly to the surface , or perhaps lying out at length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathings which give such an impression of supineness and strength . Some of the watch were asleep , and the others were perfectly still , so that there was nothing to break the illusion , and I stood leaning over the bulwarks , listening to the slow breathing of the mighty creatures  --  now one breaking the water just alongside , whose black body I almost fancied that I could see through the fog ; and again another , which I could just hear in the distance  --  until the low and regular swell seemed like the heaving of the ocean 's mighty bosom to the sound of its heavy and long-drawn respirations . Towards the evening of this day , ( Friday 7th , ) the fog cleared off , and we had every appearance of a cold blow ; and soon after sun-down it came on . Again it was clew up and haul down , reef and furl , until we had got her down to close-reefed topsails , double-reefed trysail , and reefed forespenser . Snow , hail , and sleet were driving upon us most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows and covering the forward part of the little vessel ; but as she would lay her course the captain refused to heave her to . Saturday , Nov. 8th . This day commenced with calm and thick fog , and ended with hail , snow , a violent wind , and close-reefed topsails . Sunday , Nov. 9th . To-day the sun rose clear and continued so until twelve o'clock , when the captain got an observation . This was very well for Cape Horn , and we thought it a little remarkable that , as we had not had one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage , the only tolerable day here should be a Sunday . We got time to clear up the steerage and forecastle , and set things to rights , and to overhaul our wet clothes a little . But this did not last very long . Between five and six  --  the sun was then nearly three hours high  --  the cry of " All starbow lines ahoy ! " summoned our watch on deck ; and immediately all hands were called . A true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cloud of a dark slate-color was driving on us from the south-west ; and we did our best to take in sail , ( for the light sails had been set during the first part of the day , ) before we were in the midst of it . We had got the light sails furled , the courses hauled up , and the topsail reef-tackles hauled out , and were just mounting the fore-rigging , when the storm struck us . In an instant the sea , which had been comparatively quiet , was running higher and higher ; and it became almost as dark as night . The hail and sleet were harder than I had yet felt them ; seeming to almost pin us down to the rigging . We were longer taking in sail than ever before ; for the sails were stiff and wet , the ropes and rigging covered with snow and sleet , and we ourselves cold and nearly blinded with the violence of the storm . By the time we had got down upon deck again , the little brig was plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive rushed in through the bow-ports and over the bows , and buried all the forward part of the vessel . At this instant the chief mate , who was standing on the top of the windlass , at the foot of the spenser mast , called out , " Lay out there and furl the jib ! " This was no agreeable or safe duty , yet it must be done . An old Swede , ( the best sailor on board , ) who belonged on the forecastle , sprang out upon the bowsprit . Another one must go : I was near the mate , and sprang forward , threw the down-haul over the windlass , and jumped between the knight-heads out upon the bowsprit . The crew stood abaft the windlass and hauled the jib down , while we got out upon the weather side of the jib-boom , our feet on the foot ropes , holding on by the spar , the great jib flying off to leeward and slatting so as almost to throw us off of the boom . For some time we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two huge seas , one after the other , plunged us twice into the water up to our chins . We hardly knew whether we were on or off ; when coming up , dripping from the water , we were raised high into the air . John ( that was the sailor 's name ) thought the boom would go , every moment , and called out to the mate to keep the vessel off , and haul down the staysail ; but the fury of the wind and the breaking of the seas against the bows defied every attempt to make ourselves heard , and we were obliged to do the best we could in our situation . Fortunately , no other seas so heavy struck her , and we succeeded in furling the jib " after a fashion " ; and , coming in over the staysail nettings , were not a little pleased to find that all was snug , and the watch gone below ; for we were soaked through , and it was very cold . The weather continued nearly the same through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this day we were hove to , but the rest of the time were driving on , under close-reefed sails , with a heavy sea , a strong gale , and frequent squalls of hail and snow . Tuesday , Nov. 11th . The same . Wednesday , Nov. 12th . The same . Thursday , Nov. 13th . The same . We had now got hardened to Cape weather , the vessel was under reduced sail , and everything secured on deck and below , so that we had little to do but steer and to stand our watch . Our clothes were all wet through , and the only change was from wet to more wet . It was in vain to think of reading or working below , for we were too tired , the hatchways were closed down , and everything was wet and uncomfortable , black and dirty , heaving and pitching . We had only to come below when the watch was out , wring out our wet clothes , hang them up , and turn in and sleep as soundly as we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sleep anywhere  --  no sound of wind , water , wood or iron can keep him awake  --  and we were always fast asleep when three blows on the hatchway , and the unwelcome cry of " All starbow lines ahoy ! eight bells there below ! do you hear the news ? " ( the usual formula of calling the watch ) , roused us up from our berths upon the cold , wet decks . The only time when we could be said to take any pleasure was at night and morning , when we were allowed a tin pot full of hot tea , ( or , as the sailors significantly call it , " water bewitched , " ) sweetened with molasses . This , bad as it was , was still warm and comforting , and , together with our sea biscuit and cold salt beef , made quite a meal . Yet even this meal was attended with some uncertainty . We had to go ourselves to the galley and take our kid of beef and tin pots of tea , and run the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid of beef have I seen rolling in the scuppers , and the bearer lying at his length on the decks . I remember an English lad who was always the life of the crew , but whom we afterwards lost overboard , standing for nearly ten minutes at the galley , with this pot of tea in his hand , waiting for a chance to get down into the forecastle ; and seeing what he thought was a " smooth spell , " started to go forward . He had just got to the end of the windlass , when a great sea broke over the bows , and for a moment I saw nothing of him but his head and shoulders ; and at the next instant , being taken off of his legs , he was carried aft with the sea , until her stern lifting up and sending the water forward , he was left high and dry at the side of the long-boat , still holding on to his tin pot , which had now nothing in it but salt water . But nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his habitual good humor . Regaining his legs , and shaking his fist at the man at the wheel , he rolled below , saying , as he passed , " A man 's no sailor , if he ca n't take a joke . " The ducking was not the worst of such an affair , for , as there was an allowance of tea , you could get no more from the galley ; and though sailors would never suffer a man to go without , but would always turn in a little from their own pots to fill up his , yet this was at best but dividing the loss among all hands . Something of the same kind befell me a few days after . The cook had just made for us a mess of hot " scouse "  --  that is , biscuit pounded fine , salt beef cut into small pieces , and a few potatoes , boiled up together and seasoned with pepper . This was a rare treat , and I , being the last at the galley , had it put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got along very well as far as the hatchway , and was just getting down the steps , when a heavy sea , lifting the stern out of water , and passing forward , dropping it down again , threw the steps from their place , and I came down into the steerage a little faster than I meant to , with the kid on top of me , and the whole precious mess scattered over the floor . Whatever your feelings may be , you must make a joke of everything at sea ; and if you were to fall from aloft and be caught in the belly of a sail , and thus saved from instant death , it would not do to look at all disturbed , or to make a serious matter of it . Friday , Nov. 14th . We were now well to the westward of the Cape and were changing our course to the northward as much as we dared , since the strong south-west winds , which prevailed then , carried us in toward Patagonia . At two , P.M. , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four we made it out to be a large ship , steering our course , under single-reefed topsails . We at that time had shaken the reefs out of our topsails , as the wind was lighter , and set the main top-gallant sail . As soon as our captain saw what sail she was under , he set the fore top-gallant sail and flying jib ; and the old whaler  --  for such , his boats and short sail showed him to be  --  felt a little ashamed , and shook the reefs out of his topsails , but could do no more , for he had sent down his top-gallant masts off the Cape . He ran down for us , and answered our hail as the whale-ship , New England , of Poughkeepsie , one hundred and twenty days from New York . Our captain gave our name , and added , ninety-two days from Boston . They then had a little conversation about longitude , in which they found that they could not agree . The ship fell astern , and continued in sight during the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we crossed our royal and skysail yards , and at daylight we were seen under a cloud of sail , having royal and skysails fore and aft . The " spouter , " as the sailors call a whaleman , had sent up his main top-gallant mast and set the sail , and made signal for us to heave to . About half-past seven their whale-boat came alongside , and Captain Job Terry sprang on board , a man known in every port and by every vessel in the Pacific ocean . " Do n't you know Job Terry ? I thought everybody knew Job Terry , " said a green-hand , who came in the boat , to me , when I asked him about his captain . He was indeed a singular man . He was six feet high , wore thick , cowhide boots , and brown coat and trowsers , and , except a sun-burnt complexion , had not the slightest appearance of a sailor ; yet he had been forty years in the whale trade , and , as he said himself , had owned ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crew were a pretty raw set , just out of the bush , and as the sailor 's phrase is , " had n't got the hayseed out of their hair . " Captain Terry convinced our captain that our reckoning was a little out , and , having spent the day on board , put off in his boat at sunset for his ship , which was now six or eight miles astern . He began a " yarn " when he came on board , which lasted , with but little intermission , for four hours . It was all about himself , and the Peruvian government , and the Dublin frigate , and Lord James Townshend , and President Jackson , and the ship Ann M'Kim of Baltimore . It would probably never have come to an end , had not a good breeze sprung up , which sent him off to his own vessel . One of the lads who came in his boat , a thoroughly countrified-looking fellow , seemed to care very little about the vessel , rigging , or anything else , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the pig-sty , and said he wished he was back again tending his father 's pigs . At eight o'clock we altered our course to the northward , bound for Juan Fernandez . This day we saw the last of the albatrosses , which had been our companions a great part of the time off the Cape . I had been interested in the bird from descriptions which I had read of it , and was not at all disappointed . We caught one or two with a baited hook which we floated astern upon a shingle . Their long , flapping wings , long legs , and large , staring eyes , give them a very peculiar appearance . They look well on the wing ; but one of the finest sights that I have ever seen , was an albatross asleep upon the water , during a calm , off Cape Horn , when a heavy sea was running . There being no breeze , the surface of the water was unbroken , but a long , heavy swell was rolling , and we saw the fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves , with his head under his wing ; now rising on the top of a huge billow , and then falling slowly until he was lost in the hollow between . He was undisturbed for some time , until the noise of our bows , gradually approaching , roused him , when , lifting his head , he stared upon us for a moment , and then spread his wide wings and took his flight . CHAPTER VI LOSS OF A MAN  --  SUPERSTITION Monday , Nov. 19th . This was a black day in our calendar . At seven o'clock in the morning , it being our watch below , we were aroused from a sound sleep by the cry of " All hands ahoy ! a man overboard ! " This unwonted cry sent a thrill through the heart of every one , and hurrying on deck we found the vessel hove flat aback , with all her studding-sails set ; for the boy who was at the helm left it to throw something overboard , and the carpenter , who was an old sailor , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hove her aback . The watch on deck were lowering away the quarter-boat , and I got on deck just in time to heave myself into her as she was leaving the side ; but it was not until out upon the wide Pacific , in our little boat , that I knew whom we had lost . It was George Ballmer , a young English sailor , who was prized by the officers as an active lad and willing seaman , and by the crew as a lively , hearty fellow , and a good shipmate . He was going aloft to fit a strap round the main top-mast-head , for ringtail halyards , and had the strap and block , a coil of halyards and a marline-spike about his neck . He fell from the starboard futtock shrouds , and not knowing how to swim , and being heavily dressed , with all those things round his neck , he probably sank immediately . We pulled astern , in the direction in which he fell , and though we knew that there was no hope of saving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we rowed about for nearly an hour , without the hope of doing anything , but unwilling to acknowledge to ourselves that we must give him up . At length we turned the boat 's head and made towards the vessel . Death is at all times solemn , but never so much so as at sea . A man dies on shore ; his body remains with his friends , and " the mourners go about the streets ; " but when a man falls overboard at sea and is lost , there is a suddenness in the event , and a difficulty in realizing it , which give to it an air of awful mystery . A man dies on shore  --  you follow his body to the grave , and a stone marks the spot . You are often prepared for the event . There is always something which helps you to realize it when it happens , and to recall it when it has passed . A man is shot down by your side in battle , and the mangled body remains an object , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is near you  --  at your side  --  you hear his voice , and in an instant he is gone , and nothing but a vacancy shows his loss . Then , too , at sea  --  to use a homely but expressive phrase  --  you miss a man so much . A dozen men are shut up together in a little bark , upon the wide , wide sea , and for months and months see no forms and hear no voices but their own , and one is taken suddenly from among them , and they miss him at every turn . It is like losing a limb . There are no new faces or new scenes to fill up the gap . There is always an empty berth in the forecastle , and one man wanting when the small night watch is mustered . There is one less to take the wheel , and one less to lay out with you upon the yard . You miss his form , and the sound of his voice , for habit had made them almost necessary to you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things make such a death peculiarly solemn , and the effect of it remains upon the crew for some time . There is more kindness shown by the officers to the crew , and by the crew to one another . There is more quietness and seriousness . The oath and the loud laugh are gone . The officers are more watchful , and the crew go more carefully aloft . The lost man is seldom mentioned , or is dismissed with a sailor 's rude eulogy  --  " Well , poor George is gone ! His cruise is up soon ! He knew his work , and did his duty , and was a good shipmate . " Then usually follows some allusion to another world , for sailors are almost all believers ; but their notions and opinions are unfixed and at loose ends . They say ,  --  " God wo n't be hard upon the poor fellow , " and seldom get beyond the common phrase which seems to imply that their sufferings and hard treatment here will excuse them hereafter ,  --  " To work hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell after all , would be hard indeed ! " Our cook , a simple-hearted old African , who had been through a good deal in his day , and was rather seriously inclined , always going to church twice a day when on shore , and reading his Bible on a Sunday in the galley , talked to the crew about spending their Sabbaths badly , and told them that they might go as suddenly as George had , and be as little prepared . Yet a sailor 's life is at best , but a mixture of a little good with much evil , and a little pleasure with much pain . The beautiful is linked with the revolting , the sublime with the commonplace , and the solemn with the ludicrous . We had hardly returned on board with our sad report , before an auction was held of the poor man 's clothes . The captain had first , however , called all hands aft and asked them if they were satisfied that everything had been done to save the man , and if they thought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all said that it was in vain , for the man did not know how to swim , and was very heavily dressed . So we then filled away and kept her off to her course . The laws regulating navigation make the captain answerable for the effects of a sailor who dies during the voyage , and it is either a law or a universal custom , established for convenience , that the captain should immediately hold an auction of his things , in which they are bid off by the sailors , and the sums which they give are deducted from their wages at the end of the voyage . In this way the trouble and risk of keeping his things through the voyage are avoided , and the clothes are usually sold for more than they would be worth on shore . Accordingly , we had no sooner got the ship before the wind , than his chest was brought up upon the forecastle , and the sale began . The jackets and trowsers in which we had seen him dressed but a few days before , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his body , and his chest was taken aft and used as a store-chest , so that there was nothing left which could be called his . Sailors have an unwillingness to wear a dead man 's clothes during the same voyage , and they seldom do so unless they are in absolute want . As is usual after a death , many stories were told about George . Some had heard him say that he repented never having learned to swim , and that he knew that he should meet his death by drowning . Another said that he never knew any good to come of a voyage made against the will , and the deceased man shipped and spent his advance and was afterwards very unwilling to go , but not being able to refund , was obliged to sail with us . A boy , too , who had become quite attached to him , said that George talked to him during most of the watch on the night before , about his mother and family at home , and this was the first time that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this event , when I went to the galley to get a light , I found the cook inclined to be talkative , so I sat down on the spars , and gave him an opportunity to hold a yarn . I was the more inclined to do so , as I found that he was full of the superstitions once more common among seamen , and which the recent death had waked up in his mind . He talked about George 's having spoken of his friends , and said he believed few men died without having a warning of it , which he supported by a great many stories of dreams , and the unusual behavior of men before death . From this he went on to other superstitions , the Flying Dutchman , etc. , and talked rather mysteriously , having something evidently on his mind . At length he put his head out of the galley and looked carefully about to see if any one was within hearing , and being satisfied on that point , asked me in a low tone  --  " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " said I ; " he 's a German . " " What kind of a German ? " said the cook . " He belongs to Bremen , " said I. " Are you sure o ' dat ? " said he . I satisfied him on that point by saying that he could speak no language but the German and English . " I 'm plaguy glad o ' dat , " said the cook . " I was mighty ' fraid he was a Fin . I tell you what , I been plaguy civil to that man all the voyage . " I asked him the reason of this , and found that he was fully possessed with the notion that Fins are wizards , and especially have power over winds and storms . I tried to reason with him about it , but he had the best of all arguments , that from experience , at hand , and was not to be moved . He had been in a vessel at the Sandwich Islands , in which the sail-maker was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to . This sail-maker kept a junk bottle in his berth , which was always just half full of rum , though he got drunk upon it nearly every day . He had seen him sit for hours together , talking to this bottle , which he stood up before him on the table . The same man cut his throat in his berth , and everybody said he was possessed . He had heard of ships , too , beating up the gulf of Finland against a head wind , and having a ship heave in sight astern , overhaul and pass them , with as fair a wind as could blow , and all studding-sails out , and find she was from Finland . " Oh ho ! " said he ; " I 've seen too much of them men to want to see ' em ' board a ship . If they ca n't have their own way , they 'll play the d  --  -l with you . " As I still doubted , he said he would leave it to John , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody did . John , to be sure , was the oldest , and at the same time the most ignorant , man in the ship ; but I consented to have him called . The cook stated the matter to him , and John , as I anticipated , sided with the cook , and said that he himself had been in a ship where they had a head wind for a fortnight , and the captain found out at last that one of the men , whom he had had some hard words with a short time before , was a Fin , and immediately told him if he did n't stop the head wind he would shut him down in the fore peak , and would not give him anything to eat . The Fin held out for a day and a half , when he could not stand it any longer , and did something or other which brought the wind round again , and they let him up . " There , " said the cook , " what do you think o ' dat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , and that it would have been odd if the wind had not changed in fifteen days , Fin or no Fin . " Oh , " says he , " go ' way ! You think , ' cause you been to college , you know better than anybody . You know better than them as ' as seen it with their own eyes . You wait till you 've been to sea as long as I have , and you 'll know . " CHAPTER VII JUAN FERNANDEZ  --  THE PACIFIC We continued sailing along with a fair wind and fine weather until Tuesday , Nov. 25th , when at daylight we saw the island of Juan Fernandez , directly ahead , rising like a deep blue cloud out of the sea . We were then probably nearly seventy miles from it ; and so high and so blue did it appear , that I mistook it for a cloud , resting over the island , and looked for the island under it , until it gradually turned to a deader and greener color , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could distinguish trees and rocks ; and by the afternoon , this beautiful island lay fairly before us , and we directed our course to the only harbor . Arriving at the entrance soon after sun-down , we found a Chilian man-of-war brig , the only vessel , coming out . She hailed us , and an officer on board , whom we supposed to be an American , advised us to run in before night , and said that they were bound to Valparaiso . We ran immediately for the anchorage , but , owing to the winds which drew about the mountains and came to us in flaws from every point of the compass , we did not come to an anchor until nearly midnight . We had a boat ahead all the time that we were working in , and those aboard were continually bracing the yards about for every puff that struck us , until about 12 o'clock , when we came-to in 40 fathoms water , and our anchor struck bottom for the first time since we left Boston  --  one hundred and three days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood out the remainder of the night . I was called on deck to stand my watch at about three in the morning , and I shall never forget the peculiar sensation which I experienced on finding myself once more surrounded by land , feeling the night breeze coming from off shore , and hearing the frogs and crickets . The mountains seemed almost to hang over us , and apparently from the very heart there came out , at regular intervals , a loud echoing sound , which affected me as hardly human . We saw no lights , and could hardly account for the sound , until the mate , who had been there before , told us that it was the " Alerta " of the Spanish soldiers , who were stationed over some convicts confined in caves nearly halfway up the mountain . At the expiration of my watch I went below , feeling not a little anxious for the day , that I might see more nearly , and perhaps tread upon , this romantic , I may almost say , classic island . When all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time and breakfast , although quite busy on board in getting up water-casks , etc. , I had a good view of the objects about me . The harbor was nearly land-locked , and at the head of it was a landing-place , protected by a small breakwater of stones , upon which two large boats were hauled up , with a sentry standing over them . Near this was a variety of huts or cottages , nearly an hundred in number , the best of them built of mud and white washed , but the greater part only Robinson Crusoe like  --  of posts and branches of trees . The governor 's house , as it is called , was the most conspicuous , being large , with grated windows , plastered walls , and roof of red tiles ; yet , like all the rest , only of one story . Near it was a small chapel , distinguished by a cross ; and a long , low brown-looking building , surrounded by something like a palisade , from which an old and dingy-looking Chilian flag was flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of Presidio . A sentinel was stationed at the chapel , another at the governor 's house , and a few soldiers armed with bayonets , looking rather ragged , with shoes out at the toes , were strolling about among the houses , or waiting at the landing-place for our boat to come ashore . The mountains were high , but not so overhanging as they appeared to be by starlight . They seemed to bear off towards the centre of the island , and were green and well wooded , with some large , and , I am told , exceedingly fertile valleys , with mule-tracks leading to different parts of the island . I can not forget how my friend S  --   --  and myself got the laugh of the crew upon us for our eagerness to get on shore . The captain having ordered the quarter-boat to be lowered , we both sprang down into the forecastle , filled our jacket pockets with tobacco to barter with the people ashore , and when the officer called for " four hands in the boat , " nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , and had the pleasure of pulling ahead of the brig with a tow-line for a half an hour , and coming on board again to be laughed at by the crew , who had seen our manoeuvre . After breakfast the second mate was ordered ashore with five hands to fill the water-casks , and to my joy I was among the number . We pulled ashore with the empty casks ; and here again fortune favored me , for the water was too thick and muddy to be put into the casks , and the governor had sent men up to the head of the stream to clear it out for us , which gave us nearly two hours of leisure . This leisure we employed in wandering about among the houses , and eating a little fruit which was offered to us . Ground apples , melons , grapes , strawberries of an enormous size , and cherries , abounded here . The latter are said to have been planted by Lord Anson . The soldiers were miserably clad , and asked with some interest whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt very much if they had the means of buying them . They were very eager to get tobacco , for which they gave shells , fruits , etc . Knives also were in demand , but we were forbidden by the governor to let any one have them , as he told us that all the people there , except the soldiers and a few officers , were convicts sent from Valparaiso , and that it was necessary to keep all weapons from their hands . The island , it seems , belongs to Chili , and had been used by the government as a sort of Botany Bay for nearly two years ; and the governor  --  an Englishman who had entered the Chilian navy  --  with a priest , half a dozen task-masters , and a body of soldiers , were stationed there to keep them in order . This was no easy task ; and only a few months before our arrival , a few of them had stolen a boat at night , boarded a brig lying in the harbor , sent the captain and crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were informed of this , and loaded our arms and kept strict watch on board through the night , and were careful not to let the convicts get our knives from us when on shore . The worst part of the convicts , I found , were locked up under sentry in caves dug into the side of the mountain , nearly halfway up , with mule-tracks leading to them , whence they were taken by day and set to work under task-masters upon building an aqueduct , a wharf , and other public works ; while the rest lived in the houses which they put up for themselves , had their families with them , and seemed to me to be the laziest people on the face of the earth . They did nothing but take a paseo into the woods , a paseo among the houses , a paseo at the landing-place , looking at us and our vessel , and too lazy to speak fast ; while the others were driving  --  or rather , driven  --  about , at a rapid trot , in single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by their task-masters , with long rods in their hands , and broadbrimmed straw hats upon their heads . Upon what precise grounds this great distinction was made , I do not know , and I could not very well know , for the governor was the only man who spoke English upon the island , and he was out of my walk . Having filled our casks , we returned on board , and soon after , the governor , dressed in a uniform like that of an American militia officer , the Padre , in the dress of the grey friars , with hood and all complete , and the Capitan , with big whiskers and dirty regimentals , came on board to dine . While at dinner , a large ship appeared in the offing , and soon afterwards we saw a light whale-boat pulling into the harbor . The ship lay off and on , and a boat came alongside of us , and put on board the captain , a plain young Quaker , dressed all in brown . The ship was the Cortes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if there were any vessels from round the Horn , and to hear the latest news from America . They remained aboard a short time and had a little talk with the crew , when they left us and pulled off to their ship , which , having filled away , was soon out of sight . A small boat which came from the shore to take away the governor and suite  --  as they styled themselves  --  brought , as a present to the crew , a large pail of milk , a few shells , and a block of sandal wood . The milk , which was the first we had tasted since leaving Boston , we soon despatched ; a piece of the sandal wood I obtained , and learned that it grew on the hills in the centre of the island . I have always regretted that I did not bring away other specimens of the products of the island , having afterwards lost all that I had with me  --  the piece of sandal wood , and a small flower which I plucked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully pressed between the leaves of a book . About an hour before sun-down , having stowed our water casks , we commenced getting under weigh , and were not a little while about it ; for we were in thirty fathoms water , and in one of the gusts which came off shore had let go our other bow anchor ; and as the southerly wind draws round the mountains and comes off in uncertain flaws , we were continually swinging round , and had thus got a very foul hawse . We hove in upon our chain , and after stoppering and unshackling it again and again , and hoisting and hauling down sail , we at length tipped our anchor and stood out to sea . It was bright starlight when we were clear of the bay , and the lofty island lay behind us , in its still beauty , and I gave a parting look , and bid farewell , to the most romantic spot of earth that my eyes had ever seen . I did then , and have ever since , felt an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly , no doubt , from its having been the first land that I had seen since leaving home , and still more from the associations which every one has connected with it in their childhood from reading Robinson Crusoe . To this I may add the height and romantic outline of its mountains , the beauty and freshness of its verdure , and the extreme fertility of its soil , and its solitary position in the midst of the wide expanse of the South Pacific , as all concurring to give it its peculiar charm . When thoughts of this place have occurred to me at different times , I have endeavored to recall more particulars with regard to it . It is situated in about 33 ? 30 ' S. , and is distant a little more than three hundred miles from Valparaiso , on the coast of Chili , which is in the same latitude . It is about fifteen miles in length and five in breadth . The harbor in which we anchored ( called by Lord Anson , Cumberland bay ) is the only one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the main bay ( sometimes dignified by the name of bays ) being little more than landing-places for boats . The best anchorage is at the western side of the bay , where we lay at about three cables ' lengths from the shore , in a little more than thirty fathoms water . This harbor is open to the N.N.E. , and in fact nearly from N. to E. , but the only dangerous winds being the south-west , on which side are the highest mountains , it is considered very safe . The most remarkable thing perhaps about it is the fish with which it abounds . Two of our crew , who remained on board , caught in a few minutes enough to last us for several days , and one of the men , who was a Marblehead man , said that he never saw or heard of such an abundance . There were cod , breams , silver-fish , and other kinds whose names they did not know , or which I have forgotten . There is an abundance of the best of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leaping down from the sides of the hills . One stream of considerable size flows through the centre of the lawn upon which the houses are built , and furnishes an easy and abundant supply to the inhabitants . This , by means of a short wooden aqueduct , was brought quite down to our boats . The convicts had also built something in the way of a breakwater , and were to build a landing-place for boats and goods , after which the Chilian government intended to lay port charges . Of the wood I can only say , that it appeared to be abundant ; the island in the month of November , when we were there , being in all the freshness and beauty of spring , appeared covered with trees . These were chiefly aromatic , and the largest was the myrtle . The soil is very loose and rich , and wherever it is broken up , there spring up immediately radishes , turnips , ground apples , and other garden fruits . Goats , we were told , were not abundant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we had gone into the interior . We saw a few bullocks winding about in the narrow tracks upon the sides of the mountains , and the settlement was completely overrun with dogs of every nation , kindred , and degree . Hens and chickens were also abundant , and seemed to be taken good care of by the women . The men appeared to be the laziest people upon the face of the earth ; and indeed , as far as my observation goes , there are no people to whom the newly-invented Yankee word of " loafer " is more applicable than to the Spanish Americans . These men stood about doing nothing , with their cloaks , little better in texture than an Indian 's blanket , but of rich colors , thrown over their shoulders with an air which it is said that a Spanish beggar can always give to his rags ; and with great politeness and courtesy in their address , though with holes in their shoes and without a sou in their pockets . The only interruption to the monotony of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round between the mountains and blew off the boughs which they had placed for roofs to their houses , and gave them a few minutes ' occupation in running about after them . One of these gusts occurred while we were ashore , and afforded us no little amusement at seeing the men look round , and if they found that their roofs had stood , conclude that they might stand too , while those who saw theirs blown off , after uttering a few Spanish oaths , gathered their cloaks over their shoulders , and started off after them . However , they were not gone long , but soon returned to their habitual occupation of doing nothing . It is perhaps needless to say that we saw nothing of the interior ; but all who have seen it , give very glowing accounts of it . Our captain went with the governor and a few servants upon mules over the mountains , and upon their return , I heard the governor request him to stop at the island on his passage home , and offer him a handsome sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he said that there were none upon the island , and he was very desirous of having it stocked . A steady , though light south-westerly wind carried us well off from the island , and when I came on deck for the middle watch I could just distinguish it from its hiding a few low stars in the southern horizon , though my unpracticed eyes would hardly have known it for land . At the close of the watch a few trade-wind clouds which had arisen , though we were hardly yet in their latitude , shut it out from our view , and the next day , Thursday , Nov. 27th , upon coming on deck in the morning , we were again upon the wide Pacific , and saw no more land until we arrived upon the western coast of the great continent of America . CHAPTER VIII " TARRING DOWN "  --  DAILY LIFE  --  " GOING AFT "  --  CALIFORNIA As we saw neither land nor sail from the time of leaving Juan Fernandez until our arrival in California , nothing of interest occurred except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trades , and run before them for nearly three weeks , without so much as altering a sail or bracing a yard . The captain took advantage of this fine weather to get the vessel in order for coming upon the coast . The carpenter was employed in fitting up a part of the steerage into a trade-room ; for our cargo , we now learned , was not to be landed , but to be sold by retail from on board ; and this trade-room was built for the samples and the lighter goods to be kept in , and as a place for the general business . In the mean time we were employed in working upon the rigging . Everything was set up taught , the lower rigging rattled down , or rather rattled up , ( according to the modern fashion , ) an abundance of spun-yarn and seizing-stuff made , and finally , the whole standing-rigging , fore and aft , was tarred down . This was my first essay at this latter business , and I had enough of it ; for nearly all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men were needed at the other work , and M  --   --  , the other young man who came out with us , was laid up with the rheumatism in his feet , and the boy was rather too young and small for the business ; and as the winds were light and regular , he was kept during most of the daytime at the helm ; so that nearly all the tarring came upon us . We put on short duck frocks , and taking a small bucket of tar and a bunch of oakum in our hands we went aloft , one at the main royal-mast-head and the other at the fore , and began tarring down . This is an important operation , and is usually done about once in six months in vessels upon a long voyage . It was done in our vessel several times afterwards , but by the whole crew at once , and finished off in a day ; but at this time , as most of it came upon two of us , and we were new at the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always begin at the mast-head and work down , tarring the shrouds , back-stays , standing parts of the lifts , the ties , runners , etc. , and go out to the yard-arms , and come in , tarring , as they come , the lifts and foot-ropes . Tarring the stays is more difficult , and is done by an operation which the sailors call " riding down . " A long piece of rope  --  **25;29;TOOLONG halyards , or something of the kind  --  is taken up to the mast-head from which the stay leads , and rove through a block for a girt-line , or , as the sailors usually call it , a gant-line ; with the end of this a bowline is taken round the stay , into which the man gets with his bucket of tar and a bunch of oakum , and the other end being fast on deck , with some one to tend it , he is lowered down gradually , and tars the stay carefully as he goes . There he " sings aloft ' twixt heaven and earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is let go , or if the bowline slips , he falls overboard or breaks his neck . This , however , is a thing which never enters into a sailor 's calculation . He thinks only of leaving no holydays , ( places not tarred , ) for in case he should , he would have to go over the whole again ; or of dropping no tar upon deck , for then there would be a soft word in his ear from the mate . In this manner I tarred down all the head-stays , but found the rigging about the jib-booms , martingale , and spritsail yard , upon which I was afterwards put , the hardest . Here you have to hang on with your eye-lids and tar with your hands . This dirty work could not last forever , and on Saturday night we finished it , scraped all the spots from the deck and rails , and , what was of more importance to us , cleaned ourselves thoroughly , rolled up our tarry frocks and trowsers and laid them away for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a good comfortable sailor 's Saturday night . The next day was pleasant , and indeed we had but one unpleasant Sunday during the whole voyage , and that was off Cape Horn , where we could expect nothing better . On Monday we commenced painting , and getting the vessel ready for port . This work , too , is done by the crew , and every sailor who has been long voyages is a little of a painter , in addition to his other accomplishments . We painted her , both inside and out , from the truck to the water 's edge . The outside is painted by lowering stages over the side by ropes , and on those we sat , with our brushes and paint-pots by us , and our feet half the time in the water . This must be done , of course , on a smooth day , when the vessel does not roll much . I remember very well being over the side painting in this way , one fine afternoon , our vessel going quietly along at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sure precursor of the shark , swimming alongside of us . The captain was leaning over the rail watching him , and we quietly went on with our work . In the midst of our painting , on Friday , Dec. 19th , we crossed the equator for the second time . I had the feeling which all have when , for the first time , they find themselves living under an entire change of seasons ; as , crossing the line under a burning sun in the midst of December , and , as I afterwards was , beating about among ice and snow on the fourth of July . Thursday , Dec. 25th . This day was Christmas , but it brought us no holiday . The only change was that we had a " plum duff " for dinner , and the crew quarrelled with the steward because he did not give us our usual allowance of molasses to eat with it . He thought the plums would be a substitute for the molasses , but we were not to be cheated out of our rights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shipboard . In fact , we had been too long from port . We were getting tired of one another , and were in an irritable state , both forward and aft . Our fresh provisions were , of course , gone , and the captain had stopped our rice , so that we had nothing but salt beef and salt pork throughout the week , with the exception of a very small duff on Sunday . This added to the discontent ; and a thousand little things , daily and almost hourly occurring , which no one who has not himself been on a long and tedious voyage can conceive of or properly appreciate ,  --  little wars and rumors of wars ,  --  reports of things said in the cabin ,  --  misunderstanding of words and looks ,  --  apparent abuses ,  --  brought us into a state in which everything seemed to go wrong . Every encroachment upon the time allowed for rest , appeared unnecessary . Every shifting of the studding-sails was only to " haze " 1 the crew . In this midst of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself petitioned the captain for leave to shift our berths from the steerage , where we had previously lived , into the forecastle . This , to our delight , was granted , and we turned in to bunk and mess with the crew forward . We now began to feel like sailors , which we never fully did when we were in the steerage . While there , however useful and active you may be , you are but a mongrel ,  --  and sort of afterguard and " ship 's cousin . " You are immediately under the eye of the officers , can not dance , sing , play , smoke , make a noise , or growl , ( i.e. complain , ) or take any other sailor 's pleasure ; and you live with the steward , who is usually a go-between ; and the crew never feel as though you were one of them . But if you live in the forecastle , you are " as independent as a wood-sawyer 's clerk , " ( nautice ' , ) and are a sailor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peculiarities of feeling as well as speaking and acting ; and moreover pick up a great deal of curious and useful information in seamanship , ship 's customs , foreign countries , etc. , from their long yarns and equally long disputes . No man can be a sailor , or know what sailors are , unless he has lived in the forecastle with them  --  turned in and out with them , eaten of their dish and drank of their cup . After I had been a week there , nothing would have tempted me to go back to my old berth , and never afterwards , even in the worst of weather , when in a close and leaking forecastle off Cape Horn , did I for a moment wish myself in the steerage . Another thing which you learn better in the forecastle than you can anywhere else , is , to make and mend clothes , and this is indispensable to sailors . A large part of their watches below they spend at this work , and here I learned that art which stood me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the crew . Upon our coming into the forecastle , there was some difficulty about the uniting of the allowances of bread , by which we thought we were to lose a few pounds . This set us into a ferment . The captain would not condescend to explain , and we went aft in a body , with a Swede , the oldest and best sailor of the crew , for spokesman . The recollection of the scene that followed always brings up a smile , especially the quarter-deck dignity and eloquence of the captain . He was walking the weather side of the quarter-deck , and seeing us coming aft , stopped short in his walk , and , with a voice and look intended to annihilate us , called out , " Well , what do you want now ? " Whereupon we stated our grievances as respectfully as we could , but he broke in upon us , saying that we were getting fat and lazy , did n't have enough to do , and that made us find fault . This provoked us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never answer . He clenched his fist , stamped and swore , and sent us all forward , saying , with oaths enough interspersed to send the words home ,  --  " Away with you ! go forward every one of you ! I 'll haze you ! I 'll work you up ! You do n't have enough to do ! You 've mistaken your man . I 'm F  --   --  T  --   --  , all the way from ' down east . ' I 've been through the mill , ground , and bolted , and come out a regular-built down-east johnny-cake , good when it 's hot , but when it 's cold , sour and indigestible ;  --  and you 'll find me so ! " The latter part of the harangue I remember well , for it made a strong impression , and the " down-east johnny-cake " became a by-word for the rest of the voyage . So much for our petition for the redress of grievances . The matter was however set right , for the mate , after allowing the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at night we were all called aft to hear another harangue , in which , of course , the whole blame of the misunderstanding was thrown upon us . We ventured to hint that he would not give us time to explain ; but it would n't do . We were driven back discomforted . Thus the affair blew over , but the irritation caused by it remained ; and we never had peace or a good understanding again so long as the captain and crew remained together . We continued sailing along in the beautiful temperate climate of the Pacific . The Pacific well deserves its name , for except in the southern part , at Cape Horn , and in the western parts , near the China and Indian oceans , it has few storms , and is never either extremely hot or cold . Between the tropics there is a slight haziness , like a thin gauze , drawn over the sun , which , without obstructing or obscuring the light , tempers the heat which comes down with perpendicular fierceness in the Atlantic and Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full advantage of the north-east trades , and when we had reached the latitude of Point Conception , where it is usual to make the land , we were several hundred miles to the westward of it . We immediately changed our course due east , and sailed in that direction for a number of days . At length we began to heave-to after dark , for fear of making the land at night on a coast where there are no light-houses and but indifferent charts , and at daybreak on the morning of Tuesday , Jan 13th , 1835 , we made the land at Point Conception , lat 34 ? 32 ' N. , long 120 ? 06 ' W. The port of Santa Barbara , to which we were bound , lying about sixty miles to the southward of this point , we continued sailing down the coast during the day and following night , and on the next morning , Jan. 14th , 1835 , we came to anchor in the spacious bay of Santa Barbara , after a voyage of one hundred and fifty days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use on board ship , and never , I believe , used elsewhere . It is very expressive to a sailor , and means to punish by hard work . Let an officer once say , " I 'll haze you , " and your fate is fixed . You will be " worked up , " if you are not a better man than he is . CHAPTER IX CALIFORNIA  --  A SOUTH-EASTER California extends along nearly the whole of the western coast of Mexico , between the gulf of California in the south and the bay of Sir Francis Drake on the north , or between the 22d and 38th degrees of north latitude . It is subdivided into two provinces  --  Lower or Old California , lying between the gulf and the 32d degree of latitude , or near it ; ( the division line running , I believe , between the bay of Todos Santos and the port of San Diego ; ) and New or Upper California , the southernmost port of which is San Diego , in lat. 32 ? 39 ' , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered by Sir Francis Drake , in lat. 37 ? 58 ' , and called after him by the English , though the Mexicans call it Yerba Buena . Upper California has the seat of its government at Monterey , where is also the custom-house , the only one on the coast , and at which every vessel intending to trade on the coast must enter its cargo before it can commence its traffic . We were to trade upon this coast exclusively , and therefore expected to go to Monterey at first ; but the captain 's orders from home were to put in at Santa Barbara , which is the central port of the coast , and wait there for the agent who lives there , and transacts all the business for the firm to which our vessel belonged . The bay , or , as it was commonly called , the canal of Santa Barbara , is very large , being formed by the main land on one side , ( between Point Conception on the north and Point St. Buena Ventura on the south , ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands opposite to it and at the distance of twenty miles . This is just sufficient to give it the name of a bay , while at the same time it is so large and so much exposed to the south-east and north-west winds , that it is little better than an open roadstead ; and the whole swell of the Pacific ocean rolls in here before a southeaster , and breaks with so heavy a surf in the shallow waters , that it is highly dangerous to lie near to the shore during the south-easter season ; that is , between the months of November and April . This wind ( the south-easter ) is the bane of the coast of California . Between the months of November and April , ( including a part of each , ) which is the rainy season in this latitude , you are never safe from it , and accordingly , in the ports which are open to it , vessels are obliged , during these months , to lie at anchor at a distance of three miles from the shore , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea at a moment 's warning . The only ports which are safe from this wind are San Francisco and Monterey in the north , and San Diego in the south . As it was January when we arrived , and the middle of the south-easter season , we accordingly came to anchor at the distance of three miles from the shore , in eleven fathoms water , and bent a slip-rope and buoys to our cables , cast off the yard-arm gaskets from the sails , and stopped them all with rope-yarns . After we had done this , the boat went ashore with the captain , and returned with orders to the mate to send a boat ashore for him at sundown . I did not go in the first boat , and was glad to find that there was another going before night ; for after so long a voyage as ours had been , a few hours is long to pass in sight and out of reach of land . We spent the day on board in the usual avocations ; but as this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a little more freedom , and looked about us to see what sort of a country we had got into , and were to spend a year or two of our lives in . In the first place , it was a beautiful day , and so warm that we had on straw hats , duck trowsers , and all the summer gear ; and as this was mid-winter , it spoke well for the climate ; and we afterwards found that the thermometer never fell to the freezing-point throughout the winter , and that there was very little difference between the seasons , except that during a long period of rainy and south-easterly weather , thick clothes were not uncomfortable . The large bay lay about us , nearly smooth , as there was hardly a breath of wind stirring , though the boat 's crew who went ashore told us that the long ground swell broke into a heavy surf upon the beach . There was only one vessel in the port  --  a long , sharp brig of about 300 tons , with raking masts and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We afterwards learned that she was built at Guayaquil , and named the Ayacucho , after the place where the battle was fought that gave Peru her independence , and was now owned by a Scotchman named Wilson , who commanded her , and was engaged in the trade between Callao , the Sandwich Islands , and California . She was a fast sailer , as we frequently afterwards perceived , and had a crew of Sandwich Islanders on board . Beside this vessel there was no object to break the surface of the bay . Two points ran out as the horns of the crescent , one of which  --  the one to the westward  --  was low and sandy , and is that to which vessels are obliged to give a wide berth when running out for a south-easter ; the other is high , bold , and well wooded , and , we were told , has a mission upon it , called St. Buenaventura , from which the point is named . In the middle of this crescent , directly opposite the anchoring ground , lie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flat plain , but little above the level of the sea , covered with grass , though entirely without trees , and surrounded on three sides by an amphitheatre of mountains , which slant off to the distance of fifteen or twenty miles . The mission stands a little back of the town , and is a large building , or rather a collection of buildings , in the centre of which is a high tower , with a belfry of five bells ; and the whole , being plastered , makes quite a show at a distance , and is the mark by which vessels come to anchor . The town lies a little nearer to the beach  --  about half a mile from it  --  and is composed of one-story houses built of brown clay  --  some of them plastered  --  with red tiles on the roofs . I should judge that there were about an hundred of them ; and in the midst of them stands the Presidio , or fort , built of the same materials , and apparently but little stronger . The town is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an amphitheatre of hills behind . The only thing which diminishes its beauty is , that the hills have no large trees upon them , they having been all burnt by a great fire which swept them off about a dozen years before , and they had not yet grown up again . The fire was described to me by an inhabitant , as having been a very terrible and magnificent sight . The air of the whole valley was so heated that the people were obliged to leave the town and take up their quarters for several days upon the beach . Just before sun-down the mate ordered a boat 's crew ashore , and I went as one of the number . We passed under the stern of the English brig , and had a long pull ashore . I shall never forget the impression which our first landing on the beach of California made upon me . The sun had just gone down ; it was getting dusky ; the damp night wind was beginning to blow , and the heavy swell of the Pacific was setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " upon the beach . We lay on our oars in the swell , just outside of the surf , waiting for a good chance to run in , when a boat , which had put off from the Ayacucho just after us , came alongside of us , with a crew of dusky Sandwich Islanders , talking and halooing in their outlandish tongue . They knew that we were novices in this kind of boating , and waited to see us go in . The second mate , however , who steered our boat , determined to have the advantage of their experience , and would not go in first . Finding , at length , how matters stood , they gave a shout , and taking advantage of a great comber which came swelling in , rearing its head , and lifting up the stern of our boat nearly perpendicular , and again dropping it in the trough , they gave three or four long and strong pulls , and went in on top of the great wave , throwing their oars overboard , and as far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant that the boat touched the beach , and then seizing hold of her and running her up high and dry upon the sand . We saw , at once , how it was to be done , and also the necessity of keeping the boat " stern on " to the sea ; for the instant the sea should strike upon her broad-side or quarter , she would be driven up broad-side-on , and capsized . We pulled strongly in , and as soon as we felt that the sea had got hold of us and was carrying us in with the speed of a race-horse , we threw the oars as far from the boat as we could , and took hold of the gunwale , ready to spring out and seize her when she struck , the officer using his utmost strength to keep her stern on . We were shot up upon the beach like an arrow from a bow , and seizing the boat , ran her up high and dry , and soon picked up our oars , and stood by her , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain did not come immediately , we put our oars in the boat , and leaving one to watch it , walked about the beach to see what we could , of the place . The beach is nearly a mile in length between the two points , and of smooth sand . We had taken the only good landing-place , which is in the middle ; it being more stony toward the ends . It is about twenty yards in width from high-water mark to a slight bank at which the soil begins , and so hard that it is a favorite place for running horses . It was growing dark , so that we could just distinguish the dim outlines of the two vessels in the offing ; and the great seas were rolling in , in regular lines , growing larger and larger as they approached the shore , and hanging over the beach upon which they were to break , when their tops would curl over and turn white with foam , and , beginning at one extreme of the line , break rapidly to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the cards at one end . The Sandwich Islanders , in the mean time , had turned their boat round , and ran her down into the water , and were loading her with hides and tallow . As this was the work in which we were soon to be engaged , we looked on with some curiosity . They ran the boat into the water so far that every large sea might float her , and two of them , with their trowsers rolled up , stood by the bows , one on each side , keeping her in her right position . This was hard work ; for beside the force they had to use upon the boat , the large seas nearly took them off their legs . The others were running from the boat to the bank , upon which , out of the reach of the water , was a pile of dry bullocks ' hides , doubled lengthwise in the middle , and nearly as stiff as boards . These they took upon their heads , one or two at a time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number stowed them away . They were obliged to carry them on their heads , to keep them out of the water , and we observed that they had on thick woolen caps . " Look here , Bill , and see what you 're coming to ! " said one of our men to another who stood by the boat . " Well , D  --   --  , " said the second mate to me , " this does not look much like Cambridge college , does it ? This is what I call ' head work . ' " To tell the truth , it did not look very encouraging . After they had got through with the hides , they laid hold of the bags of tallow , ( the bags are made of hide , and are about the size of a common meal bag , ) and lifting each upon the shoulders of two men , one at each end , walked off with them to the boat , and prepared to go aboard . Here , too , was something for us to learn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the stern , and those that pulled the after oars sat upon their benches , with their oars shipped , ready to strike out as soon as she was afloat . The two men at the bows kept their places ; and when , at length , a large sea came in and floated her , seized hold of the gunwale , and ran out with her till they were up to their armpits , and then tumbled over the gunwale into the bows , dripping with water . The men at the oars struck out , but it would n't do ; the sea swept back and left them nearly high and dry . The two fellows jumped out again ; and the next time they succeeded better , and , with the help of a deal of outlandish hallooing and bawling , got her well off . We watched them till they were out of the breakers , and saw them steering for their vessel , which was now hidden in the darkness . The sand of the beach began to be cold to our bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one solitary owl , from the end of the distant point , gave out his melancholy note , mellowed by the distance , and we began to think that it was high time for " the old man , " as the captain is generally called , to come down . In a few minutes we heard something coming towards us . It was a man on horseback . He came up on the full gallop , reined up near us , addressed a few words to us , and receiving no answer , wheeled around and galloped off again . He was nearly as dark as an Indian , with a large Spanish hat , blanket cloak or surreppa , and leather leggins , with a long knife stuck in them . " This is the seventh city that ever I was in , and no Christian one neither , " said Bill Brown . " Stand by ! " said Tom , " you have n't seen the worst of it yet . " In the midst of this conversation the captain appeared ; and we winded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go off . The captain , who had been on the coast before and " knew the ropes , " took the steering oar , and we went off in the same way as the other boat . I , being the youngest , had the pleasure of standing at the bow , and getting wet through . We went off well , though the seas were high . Some of them lifted us up , and sliding from under us , seemed to let us drop through the air like a flat plank upon the body of the water . In a few minutes we were in the low , regular swell , and pulled for a light , which , as we came up , we found had been run up to our trysail gaff . Coming aboard , we hoisted up all the boats , and diving down into the forecastle , changed our wet clothes , and got our supper . After supper the sailors lighted their pipes , ( cigars , those of us who had them , ) length of the voyage , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were called aft , and the " anchor watch " set . We were to stand two in a watch , and as the nights were pretty long , two hours were to make a watch . The second mate was to keep the deck until eight o'clock , and all hands were to be called at daybreak , and the word was passed to keep a bright look-out , and to call the mate if it should come on to blow from the south-east . We had also orders to strike the bells every half-hour through the night , as at sea . My watchmate was John , the Swedish sailor , and we stood from twelve to two , he walking the larboard side , and I the starboard . At daylight all hands were called , and we went through the usual process of washing down , swabbing , etc. , and got breakfast at eight o'clock . In the course of the forenoon , a boat went aboard of the Ayacucho and brought off a quarter of beef , which made us a fresh bite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mate told us that we should live upon fresh beef while we were on the coast , as it was cheaper here than the salt . While at dinner , the cook called , " Sail ho ! " and coming on deck , we saw two sails coming round the point . One was a large ship under top-gallant sails , and the other a small hermaphrodite brig . They both backed their topsails and sent boats aboard of us . The ship 's colors had puzzled us , and we found that she was from Genoa , with an assorted cargo , and was trading on the coast . She filled away again , and stood out ; being bound up the coast to San Francisco . The crew of the brig 's boat were Sandwich Islanders , but one of them , who spoke a little English , told us that she was the Loriotte , Captain Nye , from Oahu , and was engaged in this trade . She was a lump of a thing  --  what the sailors call a butter-box . This vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we afterwards saw engaged in the same trade , have English or Americans for officers , and two or three before the mast to do the work upon the rigging , and to rely upon for seamanship , while the rest of the crew are Sandwich Islanders , who are active , and very useful in boating . The three captains went ashore after dinner , and came off again at night . When in port , everything is attended to by the chief mate ; the captain , unless he is also supercargo , has little to do , and is usually ashore much of his time . This we thought would be pleasanter for us , as the mate was a good-natured man and not very strict . So it was for a time , but we were worse off in the end ; for wherever the captain is a severe , energetic man , and the mate is wanting in both these qualities , there will always be trouble . And trouble we had already begun to anticipate . The captain had several times found fault with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been dropped that all was not right between them . When this is the case , and the captain suspects that his officer is too easy and familiar with the crew , then he begins to interfere in all the duties , and to draw the reins taughter , and the crew have to suffer . CHAPTER X A SOUTH-EASTER  --  PASSAGE UP THE COAST This night , after sundown , it looked black at the southward and eastward , and we were told to keep a bright look-out . Expecting to be called up , we turned in early . Waking up about midnight , I found a man who had just come down from his watch , striking a light . He said that it was beginning to puff up from the south-east , and that the sea was rolling in , and he had called the captain ; and as he threw himself down on his chest with all his clothes on , I knew that he expected to be called . I felt the vessel pitching at her anchor , and the chain surging and snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a few minutes it came  --  three knocks on the scuttle , and " All hands ahoy ! bear-a-hand up and make sail . " We sprang up for our clothes , and were about halfway dressed , when the mate called out , down the scuttle , " Tumble up here , men ! tumble up ! before she drags her anchor . " We were on deck in an instant . " Lay aloft and loose the topsails ! " shouted the captain , as soon as the first man showed himself . Springing into the rigging , I saw that the Ayacucho 's topsails were loosed , and heard her crew singing-out at the sheets as they were hauling them home . This had probably started our captain ; as " old Wilson " ( the captain of the Ayacucho ) had been many years on the coast , and knew the signs of the weather . We soon had the topsails loosed ; and one hand remaining , as usual , in each top , to overhaul the rigging and light the sail out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While sheeting home , we saw the Ayacucho standing athwart our bows , sharp upon the wind , cutting through the head sea like a knife , with her raking masts and sharp bows running up like the head of a greyhound . It was a beautiful sight . She was like a bird which had been frightened and had spread her wings in flight . After the topsails had been sheeted home , the head yards braced aback , the fore-top-mast staysail hoisted , and the buoys streamed , and all ready forward , for slipping , we went aft and manned the slip-rope which came through the stern port with a turn round the timber-heads . " All ready forward ? " asked the captain . " Aye , aye , sir ; all ready , " answered the mate . " Let go ! " " All gone , sir ; " and the iron cable grated over the windlass and through the hawse-hole , and the little vessel 's head swinging off from the wind under the force of her backed head sails , brought the strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantly all was gone , and we were under weigh . As soon as she was well off from the wind , we filled away the head yards , braced all up sharp , set the foresail and trysail , and left our anchorage well astern , giving the point a good berth . " Nye 's off too , " said the captain to the mate ; and looking astern , we could just see the little hermaphrodite brig under sail standing after us . It now began to blow fresh ; the rain fell fast , and it grew very black ; but the captain would not take in sail until we were well clear of the point . As soon as we left this on our quarter , and were standing out to sea , the order was given , and we sprang aloft , double reefed each topsail , furled the foresail , and double reefed the trysail , and were soon under easy sail . In those cases of slipping for south-easters , there is nothing to be done , after you have got clear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait for the gale to be over , which seldom lasts more than two days , and is often over in twelve hours ; but the wind never comes back to the southward until there has been a good deal of rain fallen . " Go below the watch , " said the mate ; but here was a dispute which watch it should be , which the mate soon however settled by sending his watch below , saying that we should have our turn the next time we got under weigh . We remained on deck till the expiration of the watch , the wind blowing very fresh and the rain coming down in torrents . When the watch came up , we wore ship , and stood on the other tack , in towards land . When we came up again , which was at four in the morning , it was very dark , and there was not much wind , but it was raining as I thought I had never seen it rain before . We had on oil-cloth suits and south-wester caps , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pour down upon us . There are no umbrellas , and no sheds to go under , at sea . While we were standing about on deck , we saw the little brig drifting by us , hove to under her fore topsail double reefed ; and she glided by like a phantom . Not a word was spoken , and we saw no one on deck but the man at the wheel . Toward morning the captain put his head out of the companion-way and told the second mate , who commanded our watch , to look out for a change of wind , which usually followed a calm and heavy rain ; and it was well that he did ; for in a few minutes it fell dead calm , the vessel lost her steerage-way , and the rain ceased . We hauled up the trysail and courses , squared the after yards , and waited for the change , which came in a few minutes , with a vengeance , from the north-west , the opposite point of the compass . Owing to our precautions , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with square yards . The captain coming on deck , we braced up a little and stood back for our anchorage . With the change of wind came a change of weather , and in two hours the wind moderated into the light steady breeze , which blows down the coast the greater part of the year , and , from its regularity , might be called a trade-wind . The sun came up bright , and we set royals , skysails , and studding-sails , and were under fair way for Santa Barbara . The little Loriotte was astern of us , nearly out of sight ; but we saw nothing of the Ayacucho . In a short time she appeared , standing out from Santa Rosa Island , under the lee of which she had been hove to , all night . Our captain was anxious to get in before her , for it would be a great credit to us , on the coast , to beat the Ayacucho , which had been called the best sailer in the North Pacific , in which she had been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an advantage over her in light winds , from our royals and skysails which we carried both at the fore and main , and also in our studding-sails ; for Captain Wilson carried nothing above top-gallant-sails , and always unbent his studding-sails when on the coast . As the wind was light and fair , we held our own , for some time , when we were both obliged to brace up and come upon a taught bowline , after rounding the point ; and here he had us on fair ground , and walked away from us , as you would haul in a line . He afterwards said that we sailed well enough with the wind free , but that give him a taught bowline , and he would beat us , if we had all the canvas of the Royal George . The Ayacucho got to the anchoring ground about half an hour before us , and was furling her sails when we came up to it . This picking up your cables is a very nice piece of work . It requires some seamanship to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without letting go another anchor . Captain Wilson was remarkable , among the sailors on the coast , for his skill in doing this ; and our captain never let go a second anchor during all the time that I was with him . Coming a little to windward of our buoy , we clewed up the light sails , backed our main topsail , and lowered a boat , which pulled off , and made fast a spare hawser to the buoy on the end of the slip-rope . We brought the other end to the captain , and hove in upon it until we came to the slip-rope , which we took to the windlass , and walked her up to her chain , the captain helping her by backing and filling the sails . The chain is then passed through the hawse-hole and round the windlass , and bitted , the slip-rope taken round outside and brought into the stern port , and she is safe in her old berth . After we had got through , the mate told us that this was a small touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have through the winter . After we had furled the sails and got dinner , we saw the Loriotte nearing , and she had her anchor before night . At sun-down we went ashore again , and found the Loriotte 's boat waiting on the beach . The Sandwich Islander who could speak English , told us that he had been up to the town ; that our agent , Mr. R  --   --  , and some other passengers , were going to Monterey with us , and that we were to sail the same night . In a few minutes Captain T  --   --  , with two gentlemen and one female , came down , and we got ready to go off . They had a good deal of baggage , which we put into the bows of the boat , and then two of us took the senora in our arms , and waded with her through the water , and put her down safely in the stern . She appeared much amused with the transaction , and her husband was perfectly satisfied , thinking any arrangement good which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oar , so that I heard the conversation , and learned that one of the men , who , as well as I could see in the darkness , was a young-looking man , in the European dress , and covered up in a large cloak , was the agent of the firm to which our vessel belonged ; and the other , who was dressed in the Spanish dress of the country , was a brother of our captain , who had been many years a trader on the coast , and had married the lady who was in the boat . She was a delicate , dark-complexioned young woman , and of one of the best families in California . I also found that we were to sail the same night . As soon as we got on board , the boats were hoisted up , the sails loosed , the windlass manned , the slip-ropes and gear cast off ; and after about twenty minutes of heaving at the windlass , making sail , and bracing yards , we were well under weigh , and going with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got under weigh at the same time , and was also bound up to Monterey , but as she took a different course from us , keeping the land aboard , while we kept well out to sea , we soon lost sight of her . We had a fair wind , which is something unusual when going up , as the prevailing wind is the north , which blows directly down the coast ; whence the northern are called the windward , and the southern the leeward ports . CHAPTER XI PASSAGE UP THE COAST  --  MONTEREY We got clear of the islands before sunrise the next morning , and by twelve o'clock were out of the canal , and off Point Conception , the place where we first made the land upon our arrival . This is the largest point on the coast , and is uninhabited headland , stretching out into the Pacific , and has the reputation of being very windy . Any vessel does well which gets by it without a gale , especially in the winter season . We were going along with studding-sails set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , we had to haul our wind , and take in the lee studding-sails . As the brig came more upon the wind , she felt it more , and we doused the sky-sails , but kept the weather studding-sails on her , bracing the yards forward so that the swinging-boom nearly touched the sprit-sail yard . She now lay over to it , the wind was freshening , and the captain was evidently " dragging on to her . " His brother and Mr. R  --   --  , looking a little squally , said something to him , but he only answered that he knew the vessel and what she would carry . He was evidently showing off his vessel , and letting them know how he could carry sail . He stood up to windward , holding on by the backstays , and looking up at the sticks , to see how much they would bear ; when a puff came which settled the matter . Then it was " haul down , " and " clew up , " royals , flying-jib , and studding-sails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " mess "  --  everything let go , nothing hauled in , and everything flying . The poor Spanish woman came to the companion-way , looking as pale as a ghost , and nearly frightened to death . The mate and some men forward were trying to haul in the lower studding-sail , which had blown over the sprit-sail yard-arm and round the guys ; while the topmast-studding-sail boom , after buckling up and springing out again like a piece of whalebone , broke off at the boom-iron . I sprang aloft to take in the main top-gallant studding-sail , but before I got into the top , the tack parted , and away went the sail , swinging forward of the top-gallant-sail , and tearing and slatting itself to pieces . The halyards were at this moment let go by the run ; and such a piece of work I never had before , in taking in a sail . After great exertions I got it , or the remains of it , into the top , and was making it fast , when the captain , looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D  --   --  , and furl that main royal . " Leaving the studding-sail , I went up to the cross trees ; and here it looked rather squally . The foot of the top-gallant-mast was working between the cross and trussel trees , and the royal-mast lay over at a fearful angle with the mast below , while everything was working , and cracking , strained to the utmost . There 's nothing for Jack to do but to obey orders , and I went up upon the yard ; and there was a worse " mess , " if possible , than I had left below . The braces had been let go , and the yard was swinging about like a turnpike-gate , and the whole sail having blown over to leeward , the lee leach was over the yard-arm , and the sky-sail was all adrift and flying over my head . I looked down , but it was in vain to attempt to make myself heard , for every one was busy below , and the wind roared , and sails were flapping in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the man at the wheel , who had his eyes aloft , soon saw my difficulty , and after numberless signs and gestures , got some one to haul the necessary ropes taught . During this interval I took a look below . Everything was in confusion on deck ; the little vessel was tearing through the water as if she were mad , the seas flying over her , and the masts leaning over at an angle of forty-five degrees from the vertical . At the other royal-mast-head was S  --   --  , working away at the sail , which was blowing from him as fast as he could gather it in . The top-gallant-sail below me was soon clewed up , which relieved the mast , and in a short time I got my sail furled , and went below ; but I lost overboard a new tarpaulin hat , which troubled me more than anything else . We worked for about half an hour with might and main ; and in an hour from the time the squall struck us , from having all our flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm-sails . The wind had hauled ahead during the squall , and we were standing directly in for the point . So , as soon as we had got all snug , we wore round and stood off again , and had the pleasant prospect of beating up to Monterey , a distance of an hundred miles , against a violent head wind . Before night it began to rain ; and we had five days of rainy , stormy weather , under close sail all the time , and were blown several hundred miles off the coast . In the midst of this , we discovered that our fore topmast was sprung , ( which no doubt happened in the squall , ) and were obliged to send down the fore top-gallant-mast and carry as little sail as possible forward . Our four passengers were dreadfully sick , so that we saw little or nothing of them during the five days . On the sixth day it cleared off , and the sun came out bright , but the wind and sea were still very high . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of miles , and the captain taking the sun every day at noon . Our passengers now made their appearance , and I had for the first time the opportunity of seeing what a miserable and forlorn creature a sea-sick passenger is . Since I had got over my own sickness , the third day from Boston , I had seen nothing but hale , hearty men , with their sea legs on , and able to go anywhere , ( for we had no passengers ; ) and I will own there was a pleasant feeling of superiority in being able to walk the deck , and eat , and go about , and comparing one 's self with two poor , miserable , pale creatures , staggering and shuffling about decks , or holding on and looking up with giddy heads , to see us climbing to the mast-heads , or sitting quietly at work on the ends of the lofty yards . A well man at sea has little sympathy with one who is seasick ; he is too apt to be conscious of a comparison favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the land at Point Pinos , ( pines , ) which is the headland at the entrance of the bay of Monterey . As we drew in , and ran down the shore , we could distinguish well the face of the country , and found it better wooded than that to the southward of Point Conception . In fact , as I afterwards discovered , Point Conception may be made the dividing line between two different faces of the country . As you go to the northward of the point , the country becomes more wooded , has a richer appearance , and is better supplied with water . This is the case with Monterey , and still more so with San Francisco ; while to the southward of the point , as at Santa Barbara , San Pedro , and particularly San Diego , there is very little wood , and the country has a naked , level appearance , though it is still very fertile . The bay of Monterey is very wide at the entrance , being about twenty-four miles between the two points , Ano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but narrows gradually as you approach the town , which is situated in a bend , or large cove , at the south-eastern extremity , and about eighteen miles from the points , which makes the whole depth of the bay . The shores are extremely well wooded , ( the pine abounding upon them , ) and as it was now the rainy season , everything was as green as nature could make it ,  --  the grass , the leaves , and all ; the birds were singing in the woods , and great numbers of wild-fowl were flying over our heads . Here we could lie safe from the south-easters . We came to anchor within two cable lengths of the shore , and the town lay directly before us , making a very pretty appearance ; its houses being plastered , which gives a much better effect than those of Santa Barbara , which are of a mud-color . The red tiles , too , on the roofs , contrasted well with the white plastered sides and with the extreme greenness of the lawn upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted about , here and there , irregularly . There are in this place , and in every other town which I saw in California , no streets , or fences , ( except here and there a small patch was fenced in for a garden , ) so that the houses are placed at random upon the green , which , as they are of one story and of the cottage form , gives them a pretty effect when seen from a little distance . It was a fine Saturday afternoon when we came to anchor , the sun about an hour high , and everything looking pleasantly . The Mexican flag was flying from the little square Presidio , and the drums and trumpets of the soldiers , who were out on parade , sounded over the water , and gave great life to the scene . Every one was delighted with the appearance of things . We felt as though we had got into a Christian ( which in the sailor 's vocabulary means civilized ) country . The first impression which California had made upon us was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; anchoring three miles from the shore ; running out to sea before every south-easter ; landing in a high surf ; with a little dark-looking town , a mile from the beach ; and not a sound to be heard , or anything to be seen , but Sandwich Islanders , hides , and tallow-bags . Add to this the gale off Point Conception , and no one can be at a loss to account for our agreeable disappointment in Monterey . Beside all this , we soon learned , which was of no small importance to us , that there was little or no surf here , and this afternoon the beach was as smooth as a duck-pond . We landed the agent and passengers , and found several persons waiting for them on the beach , among whom were some , who , though dressed in the costume of the country , spoke English ; and who , we afterwards learned , were English and Americans who had married and settled in the country . I also connected with our arrival here another circumstance which more nearly concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors will allow to be seamanship  --  sending down a royal-yard . I had seen it done once or twice at sea , and an old sailor , whose favor I had taken some pains to gain , had taught me carefully everything which was necessary to be done , and in its proper order , and advised me to take the first opportunity when we were in port , and try it . I told the second mate , with whom I had been pretty thick when he was before the mast , that I would do it , and got him to ask the mate to send me up the first time they were struck . Accordingly I was called upon , and went up , repeating the operations over in my mind , taking care to get everything in its order , for the slightest mistake spoils the whole . Fortunately , I got through without any word from the officer , and heard the " well done " of the mate , when the yard reached the deck , with as much satisfaction as I ever felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of a Latin exercise . CHAPTER XII LIFE AT MONTEREY The next day being Sunday , which is the liberty-day among merchantmen , when it is usual to let a part of the crew go ashore , the sailors had depended upon a day on land , and were already disputing who should ask to go , when , upon being called in the morning , we were turned-to upon the rigging , and found that the topmast , which had been sprung , was to come down , and a new one to go up , and top-gallant and royal-masts , and the rigging to be set up . This was too bad . If there is anything that irritates sailors and makes them feel hardly used , it is being deprived of their Sabbath . Not that they would always , or indeed generally , spend it religiously , but it is their only day of rest . Then , too , they are often necessarily deprived of it by storms , and unavoidable duties of all kinds , that to take it from them when lying quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears the more hardly . The only reason in this case was , that the captain had determined to have the custom-house officers on board on Monday , and wished to have his brig in order . Jack is a slave aboard ship ; but still he has many opportunities of thwarting and balking his master . When there is danger , or necessity , or when he is well used , no one can work faster than he ; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work for nothing , no sloth could make less headway . He must not refuse his duty , or be in any way disobedient , but all the work that an officer gets out of him , he may be welcome to . Every man who has been three months at sea knows how to " work Tom Cox 's traverse "  --  " three turns round the long-boat , and a pull at the scuttled-butt . " This morning everything went in this way . " Sogering " was the order of the day . Send a man below to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding it , then not bring it up till an officer had called him twice , and take as much time to put things in order again . Marline-spikes were not to be found ; knives wanted a prodigious deal of sharpening , and , generally , three or four were waiting round the grindstone at a time . When a man got to the mast-head , he would come slowly down again to get something which he had forgotten ; and after the tackles were got up , six men would pull less than three who pulled " with a will . " When the mate was out of sight , nothing was done . It was all uphill work ; and at eight o'clock , when we went to breakfast , things were nearly where they were when we began . During our short meal , the matter was discussed . One proposed refusing to work ; but that was mutiny , and of course was rejected at once . I remember , too , that one of the men quoted " Father Taylor , " ( as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them that if they were ordered to work on Sunday , they must not refuse their duty , and the blame would not come upon them . After breakfast , it leaked out , through the officers , that if we would get through our work soon , we might have a boat in the afternoon and go fishing . This bait was well thrown , and took with several who were fond of fishing ; and all began to find that as we had one thing to do , and were not to be kept at work for the day , the sooner we did it , the better . Accordingly , things took a new aspect ; and before two o'clock this work , which was in a fair way to last two days , was done ; and five of us went a fishing in the jolly-boat , in the direction of Point Pinos ; but leave to go ashore was refused . Here we saw the Loriotte , which sailed with us from Santa Barbara , coming slowly in with a light sea-breeze , which sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the first part of the day . We took several fish of various kinds , among which cod and perch abounded , and F  --   --  , ( the ci-devant second mate , ) who was of our number , brought up with his hook a large and beautiful pearl-oyster shell . We afterwards learned that this place was celebrated for shells , and that a small schooner had made a good voyage , by carrying a cargo of them to the United States . We returned by sun-down , and found the Loriotte at anchor , within a cable 's length of the Pilgrim . The next day we were " turned-to " early , and began taking off the hatches , overhauling the cargo , and getting everything ready for inspection . At eight , the officers of the customs , five in number , came on board , and began overhauling the cargo , manifest , etc . The Mexican revenue laws are very strict , and require the whole cargo to be landed , examined , and taken on board again ; but our agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the two last vessels , and saving the trouble of taking the cargo ashore . The officers were dressed in the costume which we found prevailed through the country . A broad-brimmed hat , usually of a black or dark-brown color , with a gilt or figured band round the crown , and lined inside with silk ; a short jacket of silk or figured calico , ( the European skirted body-coat is never worn ; ) the shirt open in the neck ; rich waistcoat , if any ; pantaloons wide , straight , and long , usually of velvet , velveteen , or broadcloth ; or else short breeches and white stockings . They wear the deer-skin shoe , which is of a dark-brown color , and , ( being made by Indians , ) usually a good deal ornamented . They have no suspenders , but always wear a sash round the waist , which is generally red , and varying in quality with the means of the wearer . Add to this the never-failing cloak , and you have the dress of the Californian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark of the rank and wealth of the owner . The " gente de razon , " or aristocracy , wear cloaks of black or dark blue broadcloth , with as much velvet and trimmings as may be ; and from this they go down to the blanket of the Indian ; the middle classes wearing something like a large table-cloth , with a hole in the middle for the head to go through . This is often as coarse as a blanket , but being beautifully woven with various colors , is quite showy at a distance . Among the Mexicans there is no working class ; ( the Indians being slaves and doing all the hard work ; ) and every rich man looks like a grandee , and every poor scamp like a broken-down gentleman . I have often seen a man with a fine figure , and courteous manners , dressed in broadcloth and velvet , with a noble horse completely covered with trappings ; without a real in his pocket , and absolutely suffering for something to eat . CHAPTER XIII TRADING  --  A BRITISH SAILOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due form , we began trading . The trade-room was fitted up in the steerage , and furnished out with the lighter goods , and with specimens of the rest of the cargo ; and M  --   --  , a young man who came out from Boston with us , before the mast , was taken out of the forecastle , and made supercargo 's clerk . He was well qualified for the business , having been clerk in a counting-house in Boston . He had been troubled for some time with the rheumatism , which unfitted him for the wet and exposed duty of a sailor on the coast . For a week or ten days all was life on board . The people came off to look and to buy  --  men , women , and children ; and we were continually going in the boats , carrying goods and passengers ,  --  for they have no boats of their own . Everything must dress itself and come aboard and see the new vessel , if it were only to buy a paper of pins . The agent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hold or in the boats . Our cargo was an assorted one ; that is , it consisted of everything under the sun . We had spirits of all kinds , ( sold by the cask , ) teas , coffee , sugars , spices , raisins , molasses , hardware , crockery-ware , tinware , cutlery , clothing of all kinds , boots and shoes from Lynn , calicoes and cottons from Lowell , crepes , silks ; also shawls , scarfs , necklaces , jewelry , and combs for the ladies ; furniture ; and in fact , everything that can be imagined , from Chinese fire-works to English cart-wheels  --  of which we had a dozen pairs with their iron rims on . The Californians are an idle , thriftless people , and can make nothing for themselves . The country abounds in grapes , yet they buy bad wines made in Boston and brought round by us , at an immense price , and retail it among themselves at a real ( 121/2 cents ) by the small wine-glass . Their hides , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give for something which costs seventy-five cents in Boston ; and buy shoes ( like as not , made of their own hides , and which have been carried twice around Cape Horn ) at three or four dollars , and " chicken-skin " boots at fifteen dollars apiece . Things sell , on an average , at an advance of nearly three hundred per cent upon the Boston prices . This is partly owing to the heavy duties which the government , in their wisdom , with the intent , no doubt , of keeping the silver in the country , has laid upon imports . These duties , and the enormous expenses of so long a voyage , keep all merchants , but those of heavy capital , from engaging in the trade . Nearly two-thirds of all the articles imported into the country from round Cape Horn , for the last six years , have been by the single house of Bryant , Sturgis &; Co. , to whom our vessel belonged , and who have a permanent agent on the coast . This kind of business was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few days , though we were hard at work every minute from daylight to dark ; and sometimes even later . By being thus continually engaged in transporting passengers with their goods , to and fro , we gained considerable knowledge of the character , dress , and language of the people . The dress of the men was as I have before described it . The women wore gowns of various texture  --  silks , crape , calicoes , etc. ,  --  made after the European style , except that the sleeves were short , leaving the arm bare , and that they were loose about the waist , having no corsets . They wore shoes of kid , or satin ; sashes or belts of bright colors ; and almost always a necklace and ear-rings . Bonnets they had none . I only saw one on the coast , and that belonged to the wife of an American sea-captain who had settled in San Diego , and had imported the chaotic mass of straw and ribbon , as a choice present to his new wife . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a very dark brown ) long in their necks , sometimes loose , and sometimes in long braids ; though the married women often do it up on a high comb . Their only protection against the sun and weather is a large mantle which they put over their heads , drawing it close round their faces , when they go out of doors , which is generally only in pleasant weather . When in the house , or sitting out in front of it , which they often do in fine weather , they usually wear a small scarf or neckerchief of a rich pattern . A band , also , about the top of the head , with a cross , star , or other ornament in front , is common . Their complexions are various , depending  --  as well as their dress and manner  --  upon their rank ; or , in other words , upon the amount of Spanish blood they can lay claim to . Those who are of pure Spanish blood , having never intermarried with the aborigines , have clear brunette complexions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English women . There are but few of these families in California ; being mostly those in official stations , or who , on the expiration of their offices , have settled here upon property which they have acquired ; and others who have been banished for state offences . These form the aristocracy ; inter-marrying , and keeping up an exclusive system in every respect . They can be told by their complexions , dress , manner , and also by their speech ; for , calling themselves Castilians , they are very ambitious of speaking the pure Castilian language , which is spoken in a somewhat corrupted dialect by the lower classes . From this upper class , they go down by regular shades , growing more and more dark and muddy , until you come to the pure Indian , who runs about with nothing upon him but a small piece of cloth , kept up by a wide leather strap drawn round his waist . Generally speaking , each person 's caste is decided by the quality of the blood , which shows itself , too plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least drop of Spanish blood , if it be only of quadroon or octoroon , is sufficient to raise them from the rank of slaves , and entitle them to a suit of clothes  --  boots , hat , cloak , spurs , long knife , and all complete , though coarse and dirty as may be ,  --  and to call themselves Espanolos , and to hold property , if they can get any . The fondness for dress among the women is excessive , and is often the ruin of many of them . A present of a fine mantle , or of a necklace or pair of ear-rings , gains the favor of the greater part of them . Nothing is more common than to see a woman living in a house of only two rooms , and the ground for a floor , dressed in spangled satin shoes , silk gown , high comb , and gilt , if not gold , ear-rings and necklace . If their husbands do not dress them well enough , they will soon receive presents from others . They used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine clothes and ornaments , and frequently made purchases at a rate which would have made a seamstress or waiting-maid in Boston open her eyes . Next to the love of dress , I was most struck with the fineness of the voices and beauty of the intonations of both sexes . Every common ruffian-looking fellow , with a slouched hat , blanket cloak , dirty under-dress , and soiled leather leggins , appeared to me to be speaking elegant Spanish . It was a pleasure , simply to listen to the sound of the language , before I could attach any meaning to it . They have a good deal of the Creole drawl , but it is varied with an occasional extreme rapidity of utterance , in which they seem to skip from consonant to consonant , until , lighting upon a broad , open vowel , they rest upon that to restore the balance of sound . The women carry this peculiarity of speaking to a much greater extreme than the men , who have more evenness and stateliness of utterance . A common bullock-driver , on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador at an audience . In fact , they sometimes appeared to me to be a people on whom a curse had fallen , and stripped them of everything but their pride , their manners , and their voices . Another thing that surprised me was the quantity of silver that was in circulation . I certainly never saw so much silver at one time in my life , as during the week that we were at Monterey . The truth is , they have no credit system , no banks , and no way of investing money but in cattle . They have no circulating medium but silver and hides  --  which the sailors call " California bank notes . " Everything that they buy they must pay for in one or the other of these things . The hides they bring down dried and doubled , in clumsy ox-carts , or upon mules ' backs , and the money they carry tied up in a handkerchief ;  --  fifty , eighty , or an hundred dollars and half dollars . I had never studied Spanish while at college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fernandez ; but during the latter part of the passage out , I borrowed a grammar and dictionary from the cabin , and by a continual use of these , and a careful attention to every word that I heard spoken , I soon got a vocabulary together , and began talking for myself . As I soon knew more Spanish than any of the crew , ( who indeed knew none at all , ) and had been at college and knew Latin , I got the name of a great linguist , and was always sent for by the captain and officers to get provisions , or to carry letters and messages to different parts of the town . I was often sent to get something which I could not tell the name of to save my life ; but I liked the business , and accordingly never pleaded ignorance . Sometimes I managed to jump below and take a look at my dictionary before going ashore ; or else I overhauled some English resident on my way , and got the word from him ; and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , contrived to get along . This was a good exercise for me , and no doubt taught me more than I should have learned by months of study and reading ; it also gave me opportunities of seeing the customs , characters , and domestic arrangements of the people ; beside being a great relief from the monotony of a day spent on board ship . Monterey , as far as my observation goes , is decidedly the pleasantest and most civilized-looking place in California . In the centre of it is an open square , surrounded by four lines of one-story plastered buildings , with half a dozen cannon in the centre ; some mounted , and others not . This is the " Presidio , " or fort . Every town has a presidio in its centre ; or rather , every presidio has a town built around it ; for the forts were first built by the Mexican government , and then the people built near them for protection . The presidio here was entirely open and unfortified . There were several officers with long titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , fed , clothed , and disciplined . The governor-general , or , as he is commonly called , the " general , " lives here ; which makes it the seat of government . He is appointed by the central government at Mexico , and is the chief civil and military officer . In addition to him , each town has a commandant , who is the chief military officer , and has charge of the fort , and of all transactions with foreigners and foreign vessels ; and two or three alcaldes and corregidores , elected by the inhabitants , who are the civil officers . Courts and jurisprudence they have no knowledge of . Small municipal matters are regulated by the alcaldes and corregidores ; and everything relating to the general government , to the military , and to foreigners , by the commandants , acting under the governor-general . Capital cases are decided by him , upon personal inspection , if he is near ; or upon minutes sent by the proper officers , if the offender is at a distant place . No Protestant has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , indeed , remain more than a few weeks on shore , unless he belong to some vessel . Consequently , the Americans and English who intend to remain here become Catholics , to a man ; the current phrase among them being ,  --  " A man must leave his conscience at Cape Horn . " But to return to Monterey . The houses here , as everywhere else in California , are of one story , built of clay made into large bricks , about a foot and a half square and three or four inches thick , and hardened in the sun . These are cemented together by mortar of the same material , and the whole are of a common dirt-color . The floors are generally of earth , the windows grated and without glass ; and the doors , which are seldom shut , open directly into the common room ; there being no entries . Some of the more wealthy inhabitants have glass to their windows and board floors ; and in Monterey nearly all the houses are plastered on the outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roofs . The common ones have two or three rooms which open into each other , and are furnished with a bed or two , a few chairs and tables , a looking-glass , a crucifix of some material or other , and small daubs of paintings enclosed in glass , and representing some miracle or martyrdom . They have no chimneys or fire-places in the houses , the climate being such as to make a fire unnecessary ; and all their cooking is done in a small cook-house , separated from the house . The Indians , as I have said before , do all the hard work , two or three being attached to each house ; and the poorest persons are able to keep one , at least , for they have only to feed them and give them a small piece of coarse cloth and a belt , for the males ; and a coarse gown , without shoes or stockings , for the females . In Monterey there are a number of English and Americans ( English or " Ingles " all are called who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become united to the Catholic church , and acquired considerable property . Having more industry , frugality , and enterprise than the natives , they soon get nearly all the trade into their hands . They usually keep shops , in which they retail the goods purchased in larger quantities from our vessels , and also send a good deal into the interior , taking hides in pay , which they again barter with our vessels . In every town on the coast there are foreigners engaged in this kind of trade , while I recollect but two shops kept by natives . The people are generally suspicious of foreigners , and they would not be allowed to remain , were it not that they become good Catholics , and by marrying natives , and bringing up their children as Catholics and Mexicans , and not teaching them the English language , they quiet suspicion , and even become popular and leading men . The chief alcaldes in Monterey and Santa Barbara were both Yankees by birth . The men in Monterey appeared to me to be always on horseback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Juan Fernandez . There are no stables to keep them in , but they are allowed to run wild and graze wherever they please , being branded , and having long leather ropes , called " lassos , " attached to their necks and dragging along behind them , by which they can be easily taken . The men usually catch one in the morning , throw a saddle and bridle upon him , and use him for the day , and let him go at night , catching another the next day . When they go on long journeys , they ride one horse down , and catch another , throw the saddle and bridle upon him , and after riding him down , take a third , and so on to the end of the journey . There are probably no better riders in the world . They get upon a horse when only four or five years old , their little legs not long enough to come half way over his sides ; and may almost be said to keep on him until they have grown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , to prevent their catching when riding through the woods ; and the saddles are large and heavy , strapped very tight upon the horse , and have large pommels , or loggerheads , in front , round which the " lasso " is coiled when not in use . They can hardly go from one house to another without getting on a horse , there being generally several standing tied to the door-posts of the little cottages . When they wish to show their activity , they make no use of their stirrups in mounting , but striking the horse , spring into the saddle as he starts , and sticking their long spurs into him , go off on the full run . Their spurs are cruel things , having four or five rowels , each an inch in length , dull and rusty . The flanks of the horses are often sore from them , and I have seen men come in from chasing bullocks with their horses ' hind legs and quarters covered with blood . They frequently give exhibitions of their horsemanship , in races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore during any holyday , we saw nothing of it . Monterey is also a great place for cock-fighting , gambling of all sorts , fandangos , and every kind of amusement and knavery . Trappers and hunters , who occasionally arrive here from over the Rocky mountains , with their valuable skins and furs , are often entertained with every sort of amusement and dissipation , until they have wasted their time and their money , and go back , stripped of everything . Nothing but the character of the people prevents Monterey from becoming a great town . The soil is as rich as man could wish ; climate as good as any in the world ; water abundant , and situation extremely beautiful . The harbor , too , is a good one , being subject only to one bad wind , the north ; and though the holding-ground is not the best , yet I heard of but one vessel 's being driven ashore here . That was a Mexican brig , which went ashore a few months before our arrival , and was a total wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was from the carelessness or ignorance of the captain , who paid out all his small cable before he let go his other anchor . The ship Lagoda , of Boston , was there at the time , and rode out the gale in safety , without dragging at all , or finding it necessary to strike her top-gallant masts . The only vessel in port with us was the little Loriotte . I frequently went on board her , and became very well acquainted with her Sandwich Island crew . One of them could speak a little English , and from him I learned a good deal about them . They were well formed and active , with black eyes , intelligent countenances , dark-olive , or , I should rather say , copper complexions and coarse black hair , but not woolly like the negroes . They appeared to be talking continually . In the forecastle there was a complete Babel . Their language is extremely guttural , and not pleasant at first , but improves as you hear it more , and is said to have great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are exceedingly animated , saying with their might what their tongues find to say . They are complete water-dogs , therefore very good in boating . It is for this reason that there are so many of them on the coast of California ; they being very good hands in the surf . They are also quick and active in the rigging , and good hands in warm weather ; but those who have been with them round Cape Horn , and in high latitudes , say that they are useless in cold weather . In their dress they are precisely like our sailors . In addition to these Islanders , the vessel had two English sailors , who acted as boatswains over the Islanders , and took care of the rigging . One of them I shall always remember as the best specimen of the thoroughbred English sailor that I ever saw . He had been to sea from a boy , having served a regular apprenticeship of seven years , as all English sailors are obliged to do , and was then about four or five and twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was standing by the side of others , for the great breadth of his shoulders and chest made him appear but little above the middle height . His chest was as deep as it was wide ; his arm like that of Hercules ; and his hand " the fist of a tar  --  every hair a rope-yarn . " With all this he had one of the pleasantest smiles I ever saw . His cheeks were of a handsome brown ; his teeth brilliantly white ; and his hair , of a raven black , waved in loose curls all over his head , and fine , open forehead ; and his eyes he might have sold to a duchess at the price of diamonds , for their brilliancy . As for their color , they were like the Irishman 's pig , which would not stay to be counted , every change of position and light seemed to give them a new hue ; but their prevailing color was black , or nearly so . Take him with his well-varnished black tarpaulin stuck upon the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes ; his white duck trowsers and shirt ; blue jacket ; and black kerchief , tied loosely round his neck ; and he was a fine specimen of manly beauty . On his broad chest he had stamped with India ink " Parting moments ; "  --  a ship ready to sail ; a boat on the beach ; and a girl and her sailor lover taking their farewell . Underneath were printed the initials of his own name , and two other letters , standing for some name which he knew better than I did . This was very well done , having been executed by a man who made it his business to print with India ink , for sailors , at Havre . On one of his broad arms , he had the crucifixion , and on the other the sign of the " foul anchor . " He was very fond of reading , and we lent him most of the books which we had in the forecastle , which he read and returned to us the next time we fell in with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain said he was a perfect seaman , and worth his weight in gold on board a vessel , in fair weather and in foul . His strength must have been great , and he had the sight of a vulture . It is strange that one should be so minute in the description of an unknown , outcast sailor , whom one may never see again , and whom no one may care to hear about ; but so it is . Some people we see under no remarkable circumstances , but whom , for some reason or other , we never forget . He called himself Bill Jackson ; and I know no one of all my accidental acquaintances to whom I would more gladly give a shake of the hand than to him . Whoever falls in with him will find a handsome , hearty fellow , and a good shipmate . Sunday came again while we were at Monterey , but as before , it brought us no holyday . The people on shore dressed themselves and came off in greater numbers than ever , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that we had hardly time to eat . Our cidevant second mate , who was determined to get liberty if it was to be had , dressed himself in a long coat and black hat , and polished his shoes , and went aft and asked to go ashore . He could not have done a more imprudent thing ; for he knew that no liberty would be given ; and besides , sailors , however sure they may be of having liberty granted them always go aft in their working clothes , to appear as though they had no reason to expect anything , and then wash , dress , and shave , after they get their liberty . But this poor fellow was always getting into hot water , and if there was a wrong way of doing a thing , was sure to hit upon it . We looked to see him go aft , knowing pretty well what his reception would be . The captain was walking the quarter-deck , smoking his morning cigar , and F  --   --  went as far as the break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice him . The captain took two or three turns , and then walking directly up to him , surveyed him from head to foot , and lifting up his forefinger , said a word or two , in a tone too low for us to hear , but which had a magical effect upon poor F  --   --  . He walked forward , sprang into the forecastle , and in a moment more made his appearance in his common clothes , and went quietly to work again . What the captain said to him , we never could get him to tell , but it certainly changed him outwardly and inwardly in a most surprising manner . CHAPTER XIV SANTA BARBARA  --  HIDE-DROGHING  --  HARBOR DUTIES  --  DISCONTENT  --  SAN PEDRO After a few days , finding the trade beginning to slacken , we hove our anchor up , set our topsails , ran the stars and stripes up to the peak , fired a gun , which was returned from the Presidio , and left the little town astern , running out of the bay , and bearing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now going to leeward , we had a fair wind and a plenty of it . After doubling Point Pinos , we bore up , set studding-sails alow and aloft , and were walking off at the rate of eight or nine knots , promising to traverse in twenty-four hours the distance which we were nearly three weeks in traversing on the passage up . We passed Point Conception at a flying rate , the wind blowing so that it would have seemed half a gale to us , if we had been going the other way and close hauled . As we drew near the islands off Santa Barbara , it died away a little but we came-to at our old anchoring-ground in less than thirty hours from the time of leaving Monterey . Here everything was pretty much as we left it  --  the large bay without a vessel in it ; the surf roaring and rolling in upon the beach ; the white mission ; the dark town and the high , treeless mountains . Here , too , we had our south-easter tacks aboard again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and rope-yarns for gaskets . We lay here about a fortnight , employed in landing goods and taking off hides , occasionally , when the surf was not high ; but there did not appear to be one-half the business doing here that there was in Monterey . In fact , so far as we were concerned , the town might almost as well have been in the middle of the Cordilleras . We lay at a distance of three miles from the beach , and the town was nearly a mile farther ; so that we saw little or nothing of it . Occasionally we landed a few goods , which were taken away by Indians in large , clumsy ox-carts , with the yoke on the ox 's neck instead of under it , and with small solid wheels . A few hides were brought down , which we carried off in the California style . This we had now got pretty well accustomed to ; and hardened to also ; for it does require a little hardening even to the toughest . The hides are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they are taken from the animal , they have holes cut in the ends , and are staked out , and thus dried in the sun without shrinking . They are then doubled once , lengthwise , with the hair side usually in , and sent down , upon mules or in carts , and piled above highwater mark ; and then we rake them upon our heads , one at a time , or two , if they are small , and wade out with them and throw them into the boat , which as there are no wharves , we are usually kept anchored by a small kedge , or keelek , just outside of the surf . We all provided ourselves with thick Scotch caps , which would be soft to the head , and at the same time protect it ; for we soon found that however it might look or feel at first the " head-work " was the only system for California . For besides that the seas , breaking high , often obliged us to carry the hides so , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were very large and heavy , and nearly as stiff as boards , it was the only way that we could carry them with any convenience to ourselves . Some of the crew tried other expedients , saying that they looked too much like West India negroes ; but they all came to it at last . The great art is in getting them on the head . We had to take them from the ground , and as they were often very heavy , and as wide as the arms could stretch and easily taken by the wind , we used to have some trouble with them . I have often been laughed at myself , and joined in laughing at others , pitching themselves down in the sand , trying to swing a large hide upon their heads , or nearly blown over with one in a little gust of wind . The captain made it harder for us , by telling us that it was " California fashion " to carry two on the head at a time ; and as he insisted upon it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we carried two for the first few months ; but after falling in with a few other " hide-droghers , " and finding that they carried only one at a time we " knocked off " the extra one , and thus made our duty somewhat easier . After we had got our heads used to the weight , and had learned the true California style of tossing a hide , we could carry off two or three hundred in a short time , without much trouble ; but it was always wet work , and , if the beach was stony , bad for our feet ; for we , of course , always went barefooted on this duty , as no shoes could stand such constant wetting with salt water . Then , too , we had a long pull of three miles , with a loaded boat , which often took a couple of hours . We had now got well settled down into our harbor duties , which , as they are a good deal different from those at sea , it may be well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called at daylight , or rather  --  especially if the days are short  --  before daylight , as soon as the first grey of the morning . The cook makes his fire in the galley ; the steward goes about his work in the cabin ; and the crew rig the head pump , and wash down the decks . The chief mate is always on deck , but takes no active part , all the duty coming upon the second mate , who has to roll up his trowsers and paddle about decks barefooted , like the rest of the crew . The washing , swabbing , squilgeeing , etc. , lasts , or is made to last , until eight o'clock , when breakfast is ordered , fore and aft . After breakfast , for which half an hour is allowed , the boats are lowered down , and made fast astern , or out to the swinging booms , by ges-warps , and the crew are turned-to upon their day 's work . This is various , and its character depends upon circumstances . There is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if heavy goods are to be taken ashore , or hides are brought down to the beach for us , then all hands are sent ashore with an officer in the long boat . Then there is always a good deal to be done in the hold : goods to be broken out ; and cargo to be shifted , to make room for hides , or to keep the trim of the vessel . In addition to this , the usual work upon the rigging must be done . There is a good deal of the latter kind of work which can only be done when the vessel is in port ;  --  and then everything must be kept taught and in good order ; spun-yarn made ; chafing gear repaired ; and all the other ordinary work . The great difference between sea and harbor duty is in the division of time . Instead of having a watch on deck and a watch below , as at sea , all hands are at work together , except at meal times , from daylight till dark ; and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only two at a time ; the whole crew taking turns . An hour is allowed for dinner , and at dark , the decks are cleared up ; the boats hoisted ; supper ordered ; and at eight , the lights put out , except in the binnacle , where the glass stands ; and the anchor-watch is set . Thus , when at anchor , the crew have more time at night , ( standing watch only about two hours , ) but have no time to themselves in the day ; so that reading , mending clothes , etc. , has to be put off until Sunday , which is usually given . Some religious captains give their crews Saturday afternoons to do their washing and mending in , so that they may have their Sundays free . This is a good arrangement , and does much toward creating the preference sailors usually show for religious vessels . We were well satisfied if we got Sunday to ourselves , for , if any hides came down on that day , as was often the case when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them off , which usually took half a day ; and as we now lived on fresh beef , and ate one bullock a week , the animal was almost always brought down on Sunday , and we had to go ashore , kill it , dress it , and bring it aboard , which was another interruption . Then , too , our common day 's work was protracted and made more fatiguing by hides coming down late in the afternoon , which sometimes kept us at work in the surf by star-light , with the prospect of pulling on board , and stowing them all away , before supper . But all these little vexations and labors would have been nothing ,  --  they would have been passed by as the common evils of a sea-life , which every sailor , who is a man , will go through without complaint ,  --  were it not for the uncertainty , or worse than uncertainty , which hung over the nature and length of our voyage . Here we were , in a little vessel , with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , and with a prospect of remaining an indefinite period , two or three years at the least . When we left Boston we supposed that it was to be a voyage of eighteen months , or two years , at most ; but upon arriving on the coast , we learned something more of the trade , and found that in the scarcity of hides , which was yearly greater and greater , it would take us a year , at least , to collect our own cargo , beside the passage out and home ; and that we were also to collect a cargo for a large ship belonging to the same firm , which was soon to come on the coast , and to which we were to act as tender . We had heard rumors of such a ship to follow us , which had leaked out from the captain and mate , but we passed them by as mere " yarns , " till our arrival , when they were confirmed by the letters which we brought from the owners to their agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been nearly two years on the coast ; had collected a full cargo , and was now at San Diego , from which port she was expected to sail in a few weeks for Boston ; and we were to collect all the hides we could , and deposit them at San Diego , when the new ship , which would carry forty thousand , was to be filled and sent home ; and then we were to begin anew , and collect our own cargo . Here was a gloomy prospect before us , indeed . The California had been twenty months on the coast , and the Lagoda , a smaller ship , carrying only thirty-one or thirty-two thousand , had been two years getting her cargo ; and we were to collect a cargo of forty thousand beside our own , which would be twelve or fifteen thousand ; and hides were said to be growing scarcer . Then , too , this ship , which had been to us a worse phantom than any flying Dutchman , was no phantom , or ideal thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that a name was given her , and it was said that she was to be the Alert , a well-known India-man , which was expected in Boston in a few months , when we sailed . There could be no doubt , and all looked black enough . Hints were thrown out about three years and four years ;  --  the older sailors said they never should see Boston again , but should lay their bones in California ; and a cloud seemed to hang over the whole voyage . Besides , we were not provided for so long a voyage , and clothes , and all sailors ' necessaries , were excessively dear  --  three or four hundred per cent . advance upon the Boston prices . This was bad enough for them ; but still worse was it for me , who did not mean to be a sailor for life ; having intended only to be gone eighteen months or two years . Three or four years would make me a sailor in every respect , mind and habits , as well as body  --  nolens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of me that college and a profession would be in vain to think of ; and I made up my mind that , feel as I might , a sailor I must be , and to be master of a vessel , must be the height of my ambition . Beside the length of the voyage , and the hard and exposed life , we were at the ends of the earth ; on a coast almost solitary ; in a country where there is neither law nor gospel , and where sailors are at their captain 's mercy , there being no American consul , or any one to whom a complaint could be made . We lost all interest in the voyage ; cared nothing about the cargo , which we were only collecting for others ; began to patch our clothes ; and felt as though we were fixed beyond all hope of change . In addition to , and perhaps partly as a consequence of , this state of things , there was trouble brewing on board the vessel . Our mate ( as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy man ;  --  a more honest , upright , and kind-hearted man I never saw ; but he was too good for the mate of a merchantman . He was not the man to call a sailor a " son of a b  --  -h , " and knock him down with a handspike . He wanted the energy and spirit for such a voyage as ours , and for such a captain . Captain T  --   --  was a vigorous , energetic fellow . As sailors say , " he had n't a lazy bone in him . " He was made of steel and whalebone . He was a man to " toe the mark , " and to make every one else step up to it . During all the time that I was with him , I never saw him sit down on deck . He was always active and driving ; severe in his discipline , and expected the same of his officers . The mate not being enough of a driver for him , and being perhaps too easy with the crew , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting relaxed , and began to interfere in everything . He drew the reins taughter ; and as , in all quarrels between officers , the sailors side with the one who treats them best , he became suspicious of the crew . He saw that everything went wrong  --  that nothing was done " with a will ; " and in his attempt to remedy the difficulty by severity , he made everything worse . We were in every respect unfortunately situated . Captain , officers , and crew , entirely unfitted for one another ; and every circumstance and event was like a two-edged sword , and cut both ways . The length of the voyage , which made us dissatisfied , made the captain , at the same time , feel the necessity of order and strict discipline ; and the nature of the country , which caused us to feel that we had nowhere to go for redress , but were entirely at the mercy of a hard master , made the captain feel , on the other hand , that he must depend entirely upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent provoked severity . Then , too , ill-treatment and dissatisfaction are no " linimenta laborum ; " and many a time have I heard the sailors say that they should not mind the length of the voyage , and the hardships , if they were only kindly treated , and if they could feel that something was done to make things lighter and easier . We felt as though our situation was a call upon our superiors to give us occasional relaxations , and to make our yoke easier . But the contrary policy was pursued . We were kept at work all day when in port ; which , together with a watch at night , made us glad to turn-in as soon as we got below . Thus we got no time for reading , or  --  which was of more importance to us  --  for washing and mending our clothes . And then , when we were at sea , sailing from port to port , instead of giving us " watch and watch , " as was the custom on board every other vessel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , rain or shine , making spun-yarn and rope , and at other work in good weather , and picking oakum , when it was too wet for anything else . All hands were called to " come up and see it rain , " and kept on deck hour after hour in a drenching rain , standing round the deck so far apart as to prevent our talking with one another , with our tarpaulins and oil-cloth jackets on , picking old rope to pieces , or laying up gaskets and robands . This was often done , too , when we were lying in port with two anchors down , and no necessity for more than one man on deck as a look-out . This is what is called " hazing " a crew , and " working their old iron up . " While lying at Santa Barbara , we encountered another south-easter ; and , like the first , it came on in the night ; the great black clouds coming round from the southward , covering the mountain , and hanging down over the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . We made sail , slipped our cable , cleared the point , and beat about , for four days , in the offing , under close sail , with continual rain and high seas and winds . No wonder , thought we , they have no rain in the other seasons , for enough seemed to have fallen in those four days to last through a common summer . On the fifth day it cleared up , after a few hours , as is usual , of rain coming down like a four hours ' shower-bath , and we found ourselves drifted nearly ten leagues from the anchorage ; and having light head winds , we did not return until the sixth day . Having recovered our anchor , we made preparations for getting under weigh to go down to leeward . We had hoped to go directly to San Diego , and thus fall in with the California before she sailed for Boston ; but our orders were to stop at an intermediate port called San Pedro , and as we were to lie there a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days , we lost the opportunity . Just before sailing , the captain took on board a short , red-haired , round-shouldered , vulgar-looking fellow , who had lost one eye , and squinted with the other , and introducing him as Mr. Russell , told us that he was an officer on board . This was too bad . We had lost overboard , on the passage , one of the best of our number , another had been taken from us and appointed clerk , and thus weakened and reduced , instead of shipping some hands to make our work easier , he had put another officer over us , to watch and drive us . We had now four officers , and only six in the forecastle . This was bringing her too much down by the stern for our comfort . Leaving Santa Barbara , we coasted along down , the country appearing level or moderately uneven , and , for the most part , sandy and treeless ; until , doubling a high , sandy point , we let go our anchor at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was like a vessel , bound to Halifax , coming to anchor on the Grand Banks ; for the shore being low , appeared to be at a greater distance than it actually was , and we thought we might as well have staid at Santa Barbara , and sent our boat down for the hides . The land was of a clayey consistency , and , as far as the eye could reach , entirely bare of trees and even shrubs ; and there was no sign of a town ,  --  not even a house to be seen . What brought us into such a place , we could not conceive . No sooner had we come to anchor , than the slip-rope , and the other preparations for south-easters , were got ready ; and there was reason enough for it , for we lay exposed to every wind that could blow , except the north-west , and that came over a flat country with a range of more than a league of water . As soon as everything was snug on board , the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , who had been several times in the port before , taking the place of steersman . As we drew in , we found the tide low , and the rocks and stones , covered with kelp and sea-weed , lying bare for the distance of nearly an eighth of a mile . Picking our way barefooted over these , we came to what is called the landing-place , at high-water mark . The soil was as it appeared at first , loose and clayey , and except the stalks of the mustard plant , there was no vegetation . Just in front of the landing , and immediately over it , was a small hill , which , from its being not more than thirty or forty feet high , we had not perceived from our anchorage . Over this hill we saw three men coming down , dressed partly like sailors and partly like Californians ; one of them having on a pair of untanned leather trowsers and a red baize shirt . When they came down to us , we found that they were Englishmen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican brig which had been driven ashore here in a south-easter , and now lived in a small house just over the hill . Going up this hill with them , we saw , just behind it , a small , low building , with one room , containing a fire-place , cooking apparatus , etc. , and the rest of it unfinished , and used as a place to store hides and goods . This , they told us , was built by some traders in the Pueblo , ( a town about thirty miles in the interior , to which this was the port , ) and used by them as a storehouse , and also as a lodging place when they came down to trade with the vessels . These three men were employed by them to keep the house in order , and to look out for the things stored in it . They said that they had been there nearly a year ; had nothing to do most of the time , living upon beef , hard bread , and frijoles ( a peculiar kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they told us , was a Rancho , or cattle-farm , about three miles off ; and one of them went up , at the request of our officer , to order a horse to be sent down , with which the agent , who was on board , might go up to the Pueblo . From one of them , who was an intelligent English sailor , I learned a good deal , in a few minutes ' conversation , about the place , its trade , and the news from the southern ports . San Diego , he said , was about eighty miles to the leeward of San Pedro ; that they had heard from there , by a Mexican who came up on horseback , that the California had sailed for Boston , and that the Lagoda , which had been in San Pedro only a few weeks before , was taking in her cargo for Boston . The Ayacucho was also there , loading for Callao , and the little Loriotte , which had run directly down from Monterey , where we left her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snug place , having very little trade , but decidedly the best harbor on the coast , being completely land-locked , and the water as smooth as a duck-pond . This was the depot for all the vessels engaged in the trade ; each one having a large house there , built of rough boards , in which they stowed their hides , as fast as they collected them in their trips up and down the coast , and when they had procured a full cargo , spent a few weeks there , taking it in , smoking ship , supplying wood and water , and making other preparations for the voyage home . The Lagoda was now about this business . When we should be about it , was more than I could tell ; two years , at least , I thought to myself . I also learned , to my surprise , that the desolate-looking place we were in was the best place on the whole coast for hides . It was the only port for a distance of eighty miles , and about thirty miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds of cattle , in the centre of which was the Pueblo de los Angelos  --  the largest town in California  --  and several of the wealthiest missions ; to all of which San Pedro was the sea-port . Having made our arrangements for a horse to take the agent to the Pueblo the next day , we picked our way again over the green , slippery rocks , and pulled aboard . By the time we reached the vessel , which was so far off that we could hardly see her , in the increasing darkness , the boats were hoisted up , and the crew at supper . Going down into the forecastle , eating our supper , and lighting our cigars and pipes , we had , as usual , to tell all we had seen or heard ashore . We all agreed that it was the worst place we had seen yet , especially for getting off hides , and our lying off at so great a distance looked as though it was bad for south-easters . After a few disputes as to whether we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we talked of San Diego , the probability of seeing the Lagoda before she sailed , etc. , etc . The next day we pulled the agent ashore , and he went up to visit the Pueblo and the neighboring missions ; and in a few days , as the result of his labors , large ox-carts , and droves of mules , loaded with hides , were seen coming over the flat country . We loaded our long-boat with goods of all kinds , light and heavy , and pulled ashore . After landing and rolling them over the stones upon the beach , we stopped , waiting for the carts to come down the hill and take them ; but the captain soon settled the matter by ordering us to carry them all up to the top , saying that , that was " California fashion . " So what the oxen would not do , we were obliged to do . The hill was low , but steep , and the earth , being clayey and wet with the recent rains , was but bad holding-ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with some difficulty , getting behind and putting our shoulders to them ; now and then our feet slipping , added to the danger of the casks rolling back upon us . But the greatest trouble was with the large boxes of sugar . These , we had to place upon oars , and lifting them up rest the oars upon our shoulders , and creep slowly up the hill with the gait of a funeral procession . After an hour or two of hard work , we got them all up , and found the carts standing full of hides , which we had to unload , and also to load again with our own goods ; the lazy Indians , who came down with them , squatting down on their hams , looking on , doing nothing , and when we asked them to help us , only shaking their heads , or drawling out " no quiero . " Having loaded the carts , we started up the Indians , who went off , one on each side of the oxen , with long sticks , sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the means of saving labor in California ;  --  two Indians to two oxen . Now , the hides were to be got down ; and for this purpose , we brought the boat round to a place where the hill was steeper , and threw them down , letting them slide over the slope . Many of them lodged , and we had to let ourselves down and set them agoing again ; and in this way got covered with dust , and our clothes torn . After we had got them all down , we were obliged to take them on our heads , and walk over the stones , and through the water , to the boat . The water and the stones together would wear out a pair of shoes a day , and as shoes were very scarce and very dear , we were compelled to go barefooted . At night , we went on board , having had the hardest and most disagreeable day 's work that we had yet experienced . For several days , we were employed in this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , and brought on board about two thousand hides ; when the trade began to slacken , and we were kept at work , on board , during the latter part of the week , either in the hold or upon the rigging . On Thursday night , there was a violent blow from the northward , but as this was off-shore , we had only to let go our other anchor and hold on . We were called up at night to send down the royal-yards . It was as dark as a pocket , and the vessel pitching at her anchors , I went up to the fore , and my friend S  --   --  , to the main , and we soon had them down " ship-shape and Bristol fashion , " for , as we had now got used to our duty aloft , everything above the cross-trees was left to us , who were the youngest of the crew , except one boy . CHAPTER XV A FLOGGING  --  A NIGHT ON SHORE  --  THE STATE OF THINGS ON BOARD  --  SAN DIEGO For several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing went right , or fast enough for him . He quarrelled with the cook , and threatened to flog him for throwing wood on deck ; and had a dispute with the mate about reeving a Spanish burton ; the mate saying that he was right , and had been taught how to do it by a man who was a sailor ! This , the captain took in dudgeon , and they were at sword 's points at once . But his displeasure was chiefly turned against a large , heavy-moulded fellow from the Middle States , who was called Sam . This man hesitated in his speech , and was rather slow in his motions , but was a pretty good sailor , and always seemed to do his best ; but the captain took a dislike to him , thought he was surly , and lazy ; and " if you once give a dog a bad name "  --  as the sailor-phrase is  --  " he may as well jump overboard . " The captain found fault with everything this man did , and hazed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at work . This , of course , was an accident , but it was set down against him . The captain was on board all day Friday , and everything went on hard and disagreeably . " The more you drive a man , the less he will do , " was as true with us as with any other people . We worked late Friday night , and were turned-to early Saturday morning . About ten o'clock the captain ordered our new officer , Russell , who by this time had become thoroughly disliked by all the crew , to get the gig ready to take him ashore . John , the Swede , was sitting in the boat alongside , and Russell and myself were standing by the main hatchway , waiting for the captain , who was down in the hold , where the crew were at work , when we heard his voice raised in violent dispute with somebody , whether it was with the mate , or one of the crew , I could not tell ; and then came blows and scuffling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came up , and we leaned down the hatchway ; and though we could see no one , yet we knew that the captain had the advantage , for his voice was loud and clear  --  " You see your condition ! You see your condition ! Will you ever give me any more of your jaw ? " No answer ; and then came wrestling and heaving , as though the man was trying to turn him . " You may as well keep still , for I have got you , " said the captain . Then came the question , " Will you ever give me any more of your jaw ? " " I never gave you any , sir , " said Sam ; for it was his voice that we heard , though low and half choked . " That 's not what I ask you . Will you ever be impudent to me again ? " " I never have been , sir , " said Sam . " Answer my question , or I 'll make a spread eagle of you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm no negro slave , " said Sam . " Then I 'll make you one , " said the captain ; and he came to the hatchway , and sprang on deck , threw off his coat , and rolling up his sleeves , called out to the mate  --  " Seize that man up , Mr. A  --   --  ! Seize him up ! Make a spread eagle of him ! I 'll teach you all who is master aboard ! " The crew and officers followed the captain up the hatchway , and after repeated orders the mate laid hold of Sam , who made no resistance , and carried him to the gangway . " What are you going to flog that man for , sir ? " said John , the Swede , to the captain . Upon hearing this , the captain turned upon him , but knowing him to be quick and resolute , he ordered the steward to bring the irons , and calling upon Russell to help him , went up to John . " Let me alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in irons . You need not use any force ; " and putting out his hands , the captain slipped the irons on , and sent him aft to the quarter-deck . Sam by this time was seized up , as it is called , that is , placed against the shrouds , with his wrists made fast to the shrouds , his jacket off , and his back exposed . The captain stood on the break of the deck , a few feet from him , and a little raised , so as to have a good swing at him , and held in his hand the bight of a thick , strong rope . The officers stood round , and the crew grouped together in the waist . All these preparations made me feel sick and almost faint , angry and excited as I was . A man  --  a human being , made in God 's likeness  --  fastened up and flogged like a beast ! A man , too , whom I had lived with and eaten with for months , and knew almost as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was resistance . But what was to be done ? The time for it had gone by . The two best men were fast , and there were only two beside myself , and a small boy of ten or twelve years of age . And then there were ( beside the captain ) three officers , steward , agent and clerk . But beside the numbers , what is there for sailors to do ? If they resist , it is mutiny ; and if they succeed , and take the vessel , it is piracy . If they ever yield again , their punishment must come ; and if they do not yield , they are pirates for life . If a sailor resist his commander , he resists the law , and piracy or submission are his only alternatives . Bad as it was , it must be borne . It is what a sailor ships for . Swinging the rope over his head , and bending his body so as to give it full force , the captain brought it down upon the poor fellow 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever give me any more of your jaw ? " The man writhed with pain , but said not a word . Three times more . This was too much , and he muttered something which I could not hear ; this brought as many more as the man could stand ; when the captain ordered him to be cut down , and to go forward . " Now for you , " said the captain , making up to John and taking his irons off . As soon as he was loose , he ran forward to the forecastle . " Bring that man aft , " shouted the captain . The second mate , who had been a shipmate of John 's , stood still in the waist , and the mate walked slowly forward ; but our third officer , anxious to show his zeal , sprang forward over the windlass , and laid hold of John ; but he soon threw him from him . At this moment I would have given worlds for the power to help the poor fellow ; but it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare-headed , his eyes flashing with rage , and his face as red as blood , swinging the rope , and calling out to his officers , " Drag him aft !  --  Lay hold of him ! I 'll sweeten him ! " etc. , etc . The mate now went forward and told John quietly to go aft ; and he , seeing resistance in vain , threw the blackguard third mate from him ; said he would go aft of himself ; that they should not drag him ; and went up to the gangway and held out his hands ; but as soon as the captain began to make him fast , the indignity was too much , and he began to resist ; but the mate and Russell holding him , he was soon seized up . When he was made fast , he turned to the captain , who stood turning up his sleeves and getting ready for the blow , and asked him what he was to be flogged for . " Have I ever refused my duty , sir ? Have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or not to know my work ? " " No , " said the captain , " it is not that that I flog you for ; I flog you for your interference  --  for asking questions . " " Ca n't a man ask a question here without being flogged ? " " No , " shouted the captain ; " nobody shall open his mouth aboard this vessel , but myself ; " and began laying the blows upon his back , swinging half round between each blow , to give it full effect . As he went on , his passion increased , and he danced about the deck , calling out as he swung the rope ,  --  " If you want to know what I flog you for , I 'll tell you . It 's because I like to do it !  --  because I like to do it !  --  It suits me ! That 's what I do it for ! " The man writhed under the pain , until he could endure it no longer , when he called out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Oh , Jesus Christ ! Oh , Jesus Christ ! " " Do n't call on Jesus Christ , " shouted the captain ; " he ca n't help you . Call on Captain T  --   --  , he 's the man ! He can help you ! Jesus Christ ca n't help you now ! " At these words , which I never shall forget , my blood ran cold . I could look on no longer . Disgusted , sick , and horror-struck , I turned away and leaned over the rail , and looked down into the water . A few rapid thoughts of my own situation , and of the prospect of future revenge , crossed my mind ; but the falling of the blows and the cries of the man called me back at once . At length they ceased , and turning round , I found that the mate , at a signal from the captain had cut him down . Almost doubled up with pain , the man walked slowly forward , and went down into the forecastle . Every one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling with rage and with the importance of his achievement , walked the quarter-deck , and at each turn , as he came forward , calling out to us ,  --  " You see your condition ! You see where I 've got you all , and you know what to expect ! "  --  " You 've been mistaken in me  --  you did n't know what I was ! Now you know what I am ! "  --  " I 'll make you toe the mark , every soul of you , or I 'll flog you all , fore and aft , from the boy , up ! "  --  " You 've got a driver over you ! Yes , a slave-driver  --  a negro-driver ! I 'll see who 'll tell me he is n't a negro slave ! " With this and the like matter , equally calculated to quiet us , and to allay any apprehensions of future trouble , he entertained us for about ten minutes , when he went below . Soon after , John came aft , with his bare back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadfully swollen , and asked the steward to ask the captain to let him have some salve , or balsam , to put upon it . " No , " said the captain , who heard him from below ; " tell him to put his shirt on ; that 's the best thing for him ; and pull me ashore in the boat . Nobody is going to lay-up on board this vessel . " He then called to Mr. Russell to take those men and two others in the boat , and pull him ashore . I went for one . The two men could hardly bend their backs , and the captain called to them to " give way , " " give way ! " but finding they did their best , he let them alone . The agent was in the stern sheets , but during the whole pull  --  a league or more  --  not a word was spoken . We landed ; the captain , agent , and officer went up to the house , and left us with the boat . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while John and Sam walked slowly away , and sat down on the rocks . They talked some time together , but at length separated , each sitting alone . I had some fears of John . He was a foreigner , and violently tempered , and under suffering ; and he had his knife with him , and the captain was to come down alone to the boat . But nothing happened ; and we went quietly on board . The captain was probably armed , and if either of them had lifted a hand against him , they would have had nothing before them but flight , and starvation in the woods of California , or capture by the soldiers and Indian blood-hounds , whom the offer of twenty dollars would have set upon them . After the day 's work was done , we went down into the forecastle , and ate our plain supper ; but not a word was spoken . It was Saturday night ; but there was no song  --  no " sweethearts and wives . " A gloom was over everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , and we all turned in , but for myself , not to sleep . A sound coming now and then from the berths of the two men showed that they were awake , as awake they must have been , for they could hardly lie in one posture a moment ; the dim , swinging lamp of the forecastle shed its light over the dark hole in which we lived ; and many and various reflections and purposes coursed through my mind . I thought of our situation , living under a tyranny ; of the character of the country we were in ; of the length of the voyage , and of the uncertainty attending our return to America ; and then , if we should return , of the prospect of obtaining justice and satisfaction for these poor men ; and vowed that if God should ever give me the means , I would do something to redress the grievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings , of whom I then was one . The next day was Sunday . We worked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After breakfast , we pulled the captain ashore , and finding some hides there which had been brought down the night before , he ordered me to stay ashore and watch them , saying that the boat would come again before night . They left me , and I spent a quiet day on the hill , eating dinner with the three men at the little house . Unfortunately , they had no books , and after talking with them and walking about , I began to grow tired of doing nothing . The little brig , the home of so much hardship and suffering , lay in the offing , almost as far as one could see ; and the only other thing which broke the surface of the great bay was a small , desolate-looking island , steep and conical , of a clayey soil , and without the sign of vegetable life upon it ; yet which had a peculiar and melancholy interest to me , for on the top of it were buried the remains of an Englishman , the commander of a small merchant brig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a solemn and interesting spot to me . There it stood , desolate , and in the midst of desolation ; and there were the remains of one who died and was buried alone and friendless . Had it been a common burying-place , it would have been nothing . The single body corresponded well with the solitary character of everything around . It was the only thing in California from which I could ever extract anything like poetry . Then , too , the man died far from home ; without a friend near him ; by poison , it was suspected , and no one to inquire into it ; and without proper funeral rites ; the mate , ( as I was told , ) glad to have him out of the way , hurrying him up the hill and into the ground , without a word or a prayer . I looked anxiously for a boat , during the latter part of the afternoon , but none came ; until toward sundown , when I saw a speck on the water , and as it drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain . The hides , then , were not to go off . The captain came up the hill , with a man , bringing my monkey jacket and a blanket . He looked pretty black , but inquired whether I had enough to eat ; told me to make a house out of the hides , and keep myself warm , as I should have to sleep there among them , and to keep good watch over them . I got a moment to speak to the man who brought my jacket . " How do things go aboard ? " said I. " Bad enough , " said he ; " hard work and not a kind word spoken . " " What , " said I , " have you been at work all day ? " " Yes ! no more Sunday for us . Everything has been moved in the hold , from stem to stern , and from the waterways to the keelson . " I went up to the house to supper . We had frijoles , ( the perpetual food of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best bean in the world , ) coffee made of burnt wheat , and hard bread . After our meal , the three men sat down by the light of a tallow candle , with a pack of greasy Spanish cards , to the favorite game of " treinta uno , " a sort of Spanish " everlasting . " I left them and went out to take up my bivouack among the hides . It was now dark ; the vessel was hidden from sight , and except the three men in the house , there was not a living soul within a league . The coati ( a wild animal of a nature and appearance between that of the fox and the wolf ) set up their sharp , quick bark , and two owls , at the end of two distant points running out into the bay , on different sides of the hills where I lay , kept up their alternate , dismal notes . I had heard the sound before at night , but did not know what it was , until one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told me it was the owl . Mellowed by the distance , and heard alone , at night , I thought it was the most melancholy , boding sound I had ever heard . Through nearly all the night they kept it up , answering one another slowly , at regular intervals . This was relieved by the noisy coati , some of which came quite near to my quarters , and were not very pleasant neighbors . The next morning , before sunrise , the long-boat came ashore , and the hides were taken off . We lay at San Pedro about a week , engaged in taking off hides and in other labors , which had now become our regular duties . I spent one more day on the hill , watching a quantity of hides and goods , and this time succeeded in finding a part of a volume of Scott 's Pirate , in a corner of the house ; but it failed me at a most interesting moment , and I betook myself to my acquaintances on shore , and from them learned a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . This , they told me , was a worse harbor than Santa Barbara , for south-easters ; the bearing of the headland being a point and a half more to windward , and it being so shallow that the sea broke often as far out as where we lay at anchor . The gale from which we slipped at Santa Barbara , had been so bad a one here , that the whole bay , for a league out , was filled with the foam of the breakers , and seas actually broke over the Dead Man 's island . The Lagoda was lying there , and slipped at the first alarm , and in such haste that she was obliged to leave her launch behind her at anchor . The little boat rode it out for several hours , pitching at her anchor , and standing with her stern up almost perpendicularly . The men told me that they watched her till towards night , when she snapped her cable and drove up over the breakers , high and dry upon the beach . On board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get along as smoothly as possible ; but the comfort of the voyage was evidently at an end . " That is a long lane which has no turning "  --  - " Every dog must have his day , and mine will come by-and-by "  --  and the like proverbs , were occasionally quoted ; but no one spoke of any probable end to the voyage , or of Boston , or anything of the kind ; or if he did , it was only to draw out the perpetual , surly reply from his shipmate  --  " Boston , is it ? You may thank your stars if you ever see that place . You had better have your back sheathed , and your head coppered , and your feet shod , and make out your log for California for life ! " or else something of this kind  --  " Before you get to Boston the hides will wear the hair off your head , and you 'll take up all your wages in clothes , and wo n't have enough left to buy a wig with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by us , in the forecastle . If any one was inclined to talk about it , the others , with a delicacy which I hardly expected to find among them , always stopped him , or turned the subject . But the behavior of the two men who were flogged toward one another showed a delicacy and a sense of honor , which would have been worthy of admiration in the highest walks of life . Sam knew that the other had suffered solely on his account , and in all his complaints , he said that if he alone had been flogged , it would have been nothing ; but that he never could see that man without thinking what had been the means of bringing that disgrace upon him ; and John never , by word or deed , let anything escape him to remind the other that it was by interfering to save his shipmate , that he had suffered . Having got all our spare room filled with hides , we hove up our anchor and made sail for San Diego . In no operation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting under weigh . Where things are " done with a will , " every one is like a cat aloft : sails are loosed in an instant ; each one lays out his strength on his handspike , and the windlass goes briskly round with the loud cry of " Yo heave ho ! Heave and pawl ! Heave hearty ho ! " But with us , at this time , it was all dragging work . No one went aloft beyond his ordinary gait , and the chain came slowly in over the windlass . The mate , between the knight-heads , exhausted all his official rhetoric , in calls of " Heave with a will ! "  --  " Heave hearty , men !  --  heave hearty ! "  --  " Heave and raise the dead ! "  --  " Heave , and away ! " etc. , etc. ; but it would not do . Nobody broke his back or his hand-spike by his efforts . And when the cat-tackle-fall was strung along , and all hands  --  cook , steward , and all  --  laid hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song of " Cheerily , men ! " in which all hands join in the chorus , we pulled a long , heavy , silent pull , and  --  as sailors say a song is as good as ten men  --  the anchor came to the cat-head pretty slowly . " Give us ' Cheerily ! ' " said the mate ; but there was no " cheerily " for us , and we did without it . The captain walked the quarterdeck , and said not a word . He must have seen the change , but there was nothing which he could notice officially . We sailed leisurely down the coast before a light fair wind , keeping the land well aboard , and saw two other missions , looking like blocks of white plaster , shining in the distance ; one of which , situated on the top of a high hill , was San Juan Campestrano , under which vessels sometimes come to anchor , in the summer season , and take off hides . The most distant one was St. Louis Rey , which the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At sunset on the second day , we had a large and well wooded headland directly before us , behind which lay the little harbor of San Diego . We were becalmed off this point all night , but the next morning , which was Saturday , the 14th of March , having a good breeze , we stood round the point , and hauling our wind , brought the little harbor , which is rather the outlet of a small river , right before us . Every one was anxious to get a view of the new place . A chain of high hills , beginning at the point , ( which was on our larboard hand , coming in , ) protected the harbor on the north and west , and ran off into the interior as far as the eye could reach . On the other sides , the land was low , and green , but without trees . The entrance is so narrow as to admit but one vessel at a time , the current swift , and the channel runs so near to a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch it . There was no town in sight , but on the smooth sand beach , abreast , and within a cable 's length of which three vessels lay moored , were four large houses , built of rough boards , and looking like the great barns in which ice is stored on the borders of the large ponds near Boston ; with piles of hides standing round them , and men in red shirts and large straw hats , walking in and out of the doors . These were the hide-houses . Of the vessels : one , a short , clumsy , little hermaphrodite brig , we recognized as our old acquaintance , the Loriotte ; another , with sharp bows and raking masts , newly painted and tarred , and glittering in the morning sun , with the blood-red banner and cross of St. George at her peak , was the handsome Ayacucho . The third was a large ship , with top-gallant-masts housed , and sails unbent , and looking as rusty and worn as two years ' " hide-droghing " could make her . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly along by the current , we overhauled our chain , and clewed up the topsails . " Let go the anchor ! " said the captain but either there was not chain enough forward of the windlass , or the anchor went down foul , or we had too much headway on , for it did not bring us up . " Pay out chain ! " shouted the captain ; and we gave it to her ; but it would not do . Before the other anchor could be let go , we drifted down , broadside on , and went smash into the Lagoda . Her crew were at breakfast in the forecastle , and the cook , seeing us coming , rushed out of his galley , and called up the officers and men . Fortunately no great harm was done . Her jib-boom ran between our fore and main masts , carrying away some of our rigging , and breaking down the rail . She lost her martingale . This brought us up , and as they paid out chain , we swung clear of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as bad luck as the first , for , before any one perceived it , we were drifting on to the Loriotte . The captain now gave out his orders rapidly and fiercely , sheeting home the topsails , and backing and filling the sails , in hope of starting or clearing the anchors ; but it was all in vain , and he sat down on the rail , taking it very leisurely , and calling out to Captain Nye , that he was coming to pay him a visit . We drifted fairly into the Loriotte , her larboard bow into our starboard quarter , carrying away a part of our starboard quarter railing , and breaking off her larboard bumpkin , and one or two stanchions above the deck . We saw our handsome sailor , Jackson , on the forecastle , with the Sandwich Islanders , working away to get us clear . After paying out chain , we swung clear , but our anchors were no doubt afoul of hers . We manned the windlass , and hove , and hove away , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable , but a good surge would take it all back again . We now began to drift down toward the Ayacucho , when her boat put off and brought her commander , Captain Wilson , on board . He was a short , active , well-built man , between fifty and sixty years of age ; and being nearly twenty years older than our captain , and a thorough seaman , he did not hesitate to give his advice , and from giving advice , he gradually came to taking the command ; ordering us when to heave and when to pawl , and backing and filling the topsails , setting and taking in jib and trysail , whenever he thought best . Our captain gave a few orders , but as Wilson generally countermanded them , saying , in an easy , fatherly kind of way , " Oh no ! Captain T  --   --  , you do n't want the jib on her , " or " it is n't time yet to heave ! " he soon gave it up . We had no objections to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and had an encouraging and pleasant way of speaking to us , which made everything go easily . After two or three hours of constant labor at the windlass , heaving and " Yo ho ! " - ing with all our might , we brought up an anchor , with the Loriotte 's small bower fast to it , Having cleared this and let it go , and cleared our hawse , we soon got our other anchor , which had dragged half over the harbor . " Now , " said Wilson , " I 'll find you a good berth ; " and setting both the topsails , he carried us down , and brought us to anchor , in handsome style , directly abreast of the hide-house which we were to use . Having done this , he took his leave , while we furled the sails , and got our breakfast , which was welcome to us , for we had worked hard , and it was nearly twelve o'clock . After breakfast , and until night , we were employed in getting out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us took the captain on board the Lagoda . As he came alongside , he gave his name , and the mate , in the gangway , called out to the captain down the companion-way  --  " Captain T  --   --  has come aboard , sir ! " " Has he brought his brig with him ? " said the rough old fellow , in a tone which made itself heard fore and aft . This mortified our captain a little , and it became a standing joke among us for the rest of the voyage . The captain went down into the cabin , and we walked forward and put our heads down the forecastle , where we found the men at supper , " Come down , shipmates ! Come down ! " said they , as soon as they saw us ; and we went down , and found a large , high forecastle , well lighted ; and a crew of twelve or fourteen men , eating out of their kids and pans , and drinking their tea , and talking and laughing , all as independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This looked like comfort and enjoyment , compared with the dark little forecastle , and scanty , discontented crew of the brig . It was Saturday night ; they had got through with their work for the week ; and being snugly moored , had nothing to do until Monday , again . After two years ' hard service , they had seen the worst , and all , of California ;  --  had got their cargo nearly stowed , and expected to sail in a week or two , for Boston . We spent an hour or more with them , talking over California matters , until the word was passed  --  " Pilgrims , away ! " and we went back with our captain . They were a hardy , but intelligent crew ; a little roughened , and their clothes patched and old , from California wear ; all able seamen , and between the ages of twenty and thirty-five . They inquired about our vessel , the usage , etc. , and were not a little surprised at the story of the flogging . They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes knock-downs and fightings , but they had never heard before of a regular seizing-up and flogging . " Spread-eagles " were a new kind of bird in California . Sunday , they said , was always given in San Diego , both at the hide-houses and on board the vessels , a large number usually going up to the town , on liberty . We learned a good deal from them about curing and stowing of hides , etc. and they were anxious to have the latest news ( seven months old ) from Boston . One of their first inquiries was for Father Taylor , the seamen 's preacher in Boston . Then followed the usual strain of conversation , inquiries , stories , and jokes , which , one must always hear in a ship 's forecastle , but which are perhaps , after all , no worse , nor , indeed , more gross , than that of many well-dressed gentlemen at their clubs . CHAPTER XVI LIBERTY-DAY ON SHORE The next day being Sunday , after washing and clearing decks , and getting breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ashore , on liberty . We drew lots , and it fell to the larboard , which I was in . Instantly all was preparation . Buckets of fresh water , ( which we were allowed in port , ) and soap , were put in use ; go-ashore jackets and trowsers got out and brushed ; pumps , neckerchiefs , and hats overhauled ; one lending to another ; so that among the whole each one got a good fit-out . A boat was called to pull the " liberty men " ashore , and we sat down in the stern sheets , " as big as pay passengers , " and jumping ashore , set out on our walk for the town , which was nearly three miles off . It is a pity that some other arrangement is not made in merchant vessels , with regard to the liberty-day . When in port , the crews are kept at work all the week , and the only day they are allowed for rest or pleasure is the Sabbath ; and unless they go ashore on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of a religious captain who gave his crew liberty on Saturdays , after twelve o'clock . This would be a good plan , if shipmasters would bring themselves to give their crews so much time . For young sailors especially , many of whom have been brought up with a regard for the sacredness of the day , this strong temptation to break it , is exceedingly injurious . As it is , it can hardly be expected that a crew , on a long and hard voyage , will refuse a few hours of freedom from toil and the restraints of a vessel , and an opportunity to tread the ground and see the sights of society and humanity , because it is on a Sunday . It is too much like escaping from prison , or being drawn out of a pit , on the Sabbath day . I shall never forget the delightful sensation of being in the open air , with the birds singing around me , and escaped from the confinement , labor , and strict rule of a vessel  --  of being once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own master . A sailor 's liberty is but for a day ; yet while it lasts it is perfect . He is under no one 's eye , and can do whatever , and go wherever , he pleases . This day , for the first time , I may truly say , in my whole life , I felt the meaning of a term which I had often heard  --  the sweets of liberty . My friend S  --   --  was with me , and turning our backs upon the vessels , we walked slowly along , talking of the pleasure of being our own masters , of the times past , and when we were free in the midst of friends , in America , and of the prospect of our return ; and planning where we would go , and what we would do , when we reached home . It was wonderful how the prospect brightened , and how short and tolerable the voyage appeared , when viewed in this new light . Things looked differently from what they did when we talked them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flogging at San Pedro . It is not the least of the advantages of allowing sailors occasionally a day of liberty , that it gives them a spring , and makes them feel cheerful and independent , and leads them insensibly to look on the bright side of everything for some time after . S  --   --  and myself determined to keep as much together as possible , though we knew that it would not do to cut our shipmates ; for , knowing our birth and education , they were a little suspicious that we would try to put on the gentleman when we got ashore , and would be ashamed of their company ; and this wo n't do with Jack . When the voyage is at an end , you may do as you please , but so long as you belong to the same vessel , you must be a shipmate to him on shore , or he will not be a shipmate to you on board . Being forewarned of this before I went to sea , I took no " long togs " with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck trowsers , blue jacket and straw hat , which would prevent my going in better company , and showing no disposition to avoid them , I set all suspicion at rest . Our crew fell in with some who belonged to the other vessels , and , sailor-like , steered for the first grog-shop . This was a small mud building , of only one room , in which were liquors , dry and West India goods , shoes , bread , fruits , and everything which is vendible in California . It was kept by a yankee , a one-eyed man , who belonged formerly to Fall River , came out to the Pacific in a whale-ship , left her at the Sandwich Islands , and came to California and set up a " Pulperia . " S  --   --  and I followed in our shipmates ' wake , knowing that to refuse to drink with them would be the highest affront , but determining to slip away at the first opportunity . It is the universal custom with sailors for each one , in his turn , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and obliging every one who is present , even the keeper of the shop , to take a glass with him . When we first came in , there was some dispute between our crew and the others , whether the new comers or the old California rangers should treat first ; but it being settled in favor of the latter , each of the crews of the other vessels treated all round in their turn , and as there were a good many present , ( including some " loafers " who had dropped in , knowing what was going on , to take advantage of Jack 's hospitality , ) and the liquor was a real ( 121/2 cents ) a glass , it made somewhat of a hole in their lockers . It was now our ship 's turn , and S  --   --  and I , anxious to get away , stepped up to call for glasses ; but we soon found that we must go in order  --  the oldest first , for the old sailors did not choose to be preceded by a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wait our turn , with the twofold apprehension of being too late for our horses , and of getting corned ; for drink you must , every time ; and if you drink with one and not with another , it is always taken as an insult . Having at length gone through our turns and acquitted ourselves of all obligations , we slipped out , and went about among the houses , endeavoring to get horses for the day , so that we might ride round and see the country . At first we had but little success , all that we could get out of the lazy fellows , in reply to our questions , being the eternal drawling " Quien sabe ? " ( " who knows ? " ) which is an answer to all questions . After several efforts , we at length fell in with a little Sandwich Island boy , who belonged to Captain Wilson of the Ayacucho , and was well acquainted in the place ; and he , knowing where to go , soon procured us two horses , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pommel . These we were to have all day , with the privilege of riding them down to the beach at night , for a dollar , which we had to pay in advance . Horses are the cheapest thing in California ; the very best not being worth more than ten dollars apiece , and very good ones being often sold for three , and four . In taking a day 's ride , you pay for the use of the saddle , and for the labor and trouble of catching the horses . If you bring the saddle back safe , they care but little what becomes of the horse . Mounted on our horses , which were spirited beasts , and which , by the way , in this country , are always steered by pressing the contrary rein against the neck , and not by pulling on the bit ,  --  we started off on a fine run over the country . The first place we went to was the old ruinous presidio , which stands on a rising ground near the village , which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open square , like all the other presidios , and was in a most ruinous state , with the exception of one side , in which the commandant lived , with his family . There were only two guns , one of which was spiked , and the other had no carriage . Twelve , half clothed , and half starved looking fellows , composed the garrison ; and they , it was said , had not a musket apiece . The small settlement lay directly below the fort , composed of about forty dark brown looking huts , or houses , and two larger ones , plastered , which belonged to two of the " gente de razon . " This town is not more than half as large as Monterey , or Santa Barbara , and has little or no business . From the presidio , we rode off in the direction of the mission , which we were told was three miles distant . The country was rather sandy , and there was nothing for miles which could be called a tree , but the grass grew green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the soil is said to be good . After a pleasant ride of a couple of miles , we saw the white walls of the mission , and fording a small river , we came directly before it . The mission is built of mud , or rather of the unburnt bricks of the country , and plastered . There was something decidedly striking in its appearance : a number of irregular buildings , connected with one another , and disposed in the form of a hollow square , with a church at one end , rising above the rest , with a tower containing five belfries , in each of which hung a large bell , and with immense rusty iron crosses at the tops . Just outside of the buildings , and under the walls , stood twenty or thirty small huts , built of straw and of the branches of trees , grouped together , in which a few Indians lived , under the protection and in the service of the mission . Entering a gate-way , we drove into the open square , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church ; on another , a range of high buildings with grated windows ; a third was a range of smaller buildings , or offices ; and the fourth seemed to be little more than a high connecting wall . Not a living creature could we see . We rode twice round the square , in the hope of waking up some one ; and in one circuit , saw a tall monk , with shaven head , sandals , and the dress of the Grey Friars , pass rapidly through a gallery , but he disappeared without noticing us . After two circuits , we stopped our horses , and saw , at last , a man show himself in front of one of the small buildings . We rode up to him , and found him dressed in the common dress of the country , with a silver chain round his neck , supporting a large bunch of keys . From this , we took him to be the steward of the mission , and addressing him as " Mayordomo , " received a low bow and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , we went in . It was a plain room , containing a table , three or four chairs , a small picture or two of some saint , or miracle , or martyrdom , and a few dishes and glasses . " Hay algunas cosa de comer ? " said I. " Si Senor ! " said he . " Que gusta usted ? " Mentioning frijoles , which I knew they must have if they had nothing else , and beef and bread , and a hint for wine , if they had any , he went off to another building , across the court , and returned in a few moments , with a couple of Indian boys , bearing dishes and a decanter of wine . The dishes contained baked meats , frijoles stewed with peppers and onions , boiled eggs , and California flour baked into a kind of macaroni . These , together with the wine , made the most sumptuous meal we had eaten since we left Boston ; and , compared with the fare we had lived upon for seven months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we took out some money and asked him how much we were to pay . He shook his head , and crossed himself , saying that it was charity :  --  that the Lord gave it to us . Knowing the amount of this to be that he did not sell it , but was willing to receive a present , we gave him ten or twelve reals , which he pocketed with admirable nonchalance , saying , " Dios se lo pague . " Taking leave of him , we rode out to the Indians ' huts . The little children were running about among the huts , stark naked , and the men were not much better ; but the women had generally coarse gowns , of a sort of tow cloth . The men are employed , most of the time , in tending the cattle of the mission , and in working in the garden , which is a very large one , including several acres , and filled , it is said , with the best fruits of the climate . The language of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , is the most brutish and inhuman language , without any exception , that I ever heard , or that could well be conceived of . It is a complete slabber . The words fall off of the ends of their tongues , and a continual slabbering sound is made in the cheeks , outside of the teeth . It can not have been the language of Montezuma and the independent Mexicans . Here , among the huts , we saw the oldest man that I had ever seen ; and , indeed , I never supposed that a person could retain life and exhibit such marks of age . He was sitting out in the sun , leaning against the side of a hut ; and his legs and arms , which were bare , were of a dark red color , the skin withered and shrunk up like burnt leather , and the limbs not larger round than those of a boy of five years . He had a few grey hairs , which were tied together at the back of his head ; and he was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he raised his hands slowly to his face , and taking hold of his lids with his fingers , lifted them up to look at us ; and being satisfied , let them drop again . All command over the lid seemed to have gone . I asked his age , but could get no answer but " Quien sabe ? " and they probably did not know the age . Leaving the mission , we returned to village , going nearly all the way on a full run . The California horses have no medium gait , which is pleasant , between walking and running ; for as there are no streets and parades , they have no need of the genteel trot , and their riders usually keep them at the top of their speed until they are fired , and then let them rest themselves by walking . The fine air of the afternoon ; the rapid rate of the animals , who seemed almost to fly over the ground ; and the excitement and novelty of the motion to us , who had been so long confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt willing to ride all day long . Coming into the village , we found things looking very lively . The Indians , who always have a holyday on Sunday , were engaged at playing a kind of running game of ball , on a level piece of ground , near the houses . The old ones sat down in a ring , looking on , while the young ones  --  men , boys and girls  --  were chasing the ball , and throwing it with all their might . Some of the girls ran like greyhounds . At every accident , or remarkable feat , the old people set up a deafening screaming and clapping of hands . Several blue jackets were reeling about among the houses , which showed that the pulperias had been well patronized . One or two of the sailors had got on horseback , but being rather indifferent horsemen , and the Spaniards having given them vicious horses , they were soon thrown , much to the amusement of the people . A half dozen Sandwich Islanders , from the hide-houses and the two brigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full gallop , hallooing and laughing like so many wild men . It was now nearly sundown , and S  --   --  and myself went into a house and sat quietly down to rest ourselves before going down to the beach . Several people were soon collected to see " los Ingles marineros , " and one of them  --  a young woman  --  took a great fancy to my pocket handkerchief , which was a large silk one that I had before going to sea , and a handsomer one than they had been in the habit of seeing . Of course , I gave it to her ; which brought us into high favor ; and we had a present of some pears and other fruits , which we took down to the beach with us . When we came to leave the house , we found that our horses , which we left tied at the door , were both gone . We had paid for them to ride down to the beach , but they were not to be found . We went to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders , and to our question , " Where are the horses ? " only answered  --  " Quien sabe ? " but as he was very easy , and made no inquiries for the saddles , we saw that he knew very well where they were . After a little trouble , determined not to walk down ,  --  a distance of three miles  --  we procured two , at four reals apiece , with an Indian boy to run on behind and bring them back . Determined to have " the go " out of the horses , for our trouble , we went down at full speed , and were on the beach in fifteen minutes . Wishing to make our liberty last as long as possible , we rode up and down among the hide-houses , amusing ourselves with seeing the men , as they came down , ( it was now dusk , ) some on horseback and others on foot . The Sandwich Islanders rode down , and were in " high snuff . " We inquired for our shipmates , and were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thrown or had fallen off , and were seen heading for the beach , but steering pretty wild , and by the looks of things , would not be down much before midnight . The Indian boys having arrived , we gave them our horses , and having seen them safely off , hailed for a boat and went aboard . Thus ended our first liberty-day on shore . We were well tired , but had had a good time , and were more willing to go back to our old duties . About midnight , we were waked up by our two watchmates , who had come aboard in high dispute . It seems they had started to come down on the same horse , double-backed ; and each was accusing the other of being the cause of his fall . They soon , however , turned-in and fell asleep , and probably forgot all about it , for the next morning the dispute was not renewed . CHAPTER XVII SAN DIEGO  --  A DESERTION  --  SAN PEDRO AGAIN  --  BEATING THE COAST The next sound we heard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuttle , saw that it was just daylight . Our liberty had now truly taken flight , and with it we laid away our pumps , stockings , blue jackets , neckerchiefs , and other go-ashore paraphernalia , and putting on old duck trowsers , red shirts , and Scotch caps , began taking out and landing our hides . For three days we were hard at work , from the grey of the morning until starlight , with the exception of a short time allowed for meals , in this duty . For landing and taking on board hides , San Diego is decidedly the best place in California . The harbor is small and land-locked ; there is no surf ; the vessels lie within a cable 's length of the beach ; and the beach itself is smooth , hard sand , without rocks or stones . For these reasons , it is used by all the vessels in the trade , as a depot ; and , indeed , it would be impossible , when loading with the cured hides for the passage home , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without getting them wet in the surf , which would spoil them . We took possession of one of the hide-houses , which belonged to our firm , and had been used by the California . It was built to hold forty thousand hides , and we had the pleasing prospect of filling it before we could leave the coast ; and toward this , our thirty-five hundred , which we brought down with us , would do but little . There was not a man on board who did not go a dozen times into the house , and look round , and make some calculation of the time it would require . The hides , as they come rough and uncured from the vessels , are piled up outside of the houses , whence they are taken and carried through a regular process of pickling , drying , cleaning , etc. , and stowed away in the house , ready to be put on board . This process is necessary in order that they may keep , during a long voyage , and in warm latitudes . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer and a part of the crew of each vessel are usually left ashore and it was for this business , we found , that our new officer had joined us . As soon as the hides were landed , he took charge of the house , and the captain intended to leave two or three of us with him , hiring Sandwich Islanders to take our places on board ; but he could not get any Sandwich Islanders to go , though he offered them fifteen dollars a month ; for the report of the flogging had got among them , and he was called " aole maikai , " ( no good , ) and that was an end of the business . They were , however , willing to work on shore , and four of them were hired and put with Mr. Russell to cure the hides . After landing our hides , we next sent ashore all our spare spars and rigging ; all the stores which we did not want to use in the course of one trip to windward ; and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make room for hides : among other things , the pig-sty , and with it " old Bess . " This was an old sow that we had brought from Boston , and which lived to get around Cape Horn , where all the other pigs died from cold and wet . Report said that she had been a Canton voyage before . She had been the pet of the cook during the whole passage , and he had fed her with the best of everything , and taught her to know his voice , and to do a number of strange tricks for his amusement . Tom Cringle says that no one can fathom a negro 's affection for a pig ; and I believe he is right , for it almost broke our poor darky 's heart when he heard that Bess was to be taken ashore , and that he was to have the care of her no more during the whole voyage . He had depended upon her as a solace , during the long trips up and down the coast . " Obey orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Break hearts , " he meant to have said ; and lent a hand to get her over the side , trying to make it as easy for her as possible . We got a whip up on the main-yard , and hooking it to a strap around her body , swayed away ; and giving a wink to one another , ran her chock up to the yard . " ' Vast there ! ' vast ! " said the mate ; " none of your skylarking ! Lower away ! " But he evidently enjoyed the joke . The pig squealed like the " crack of doom , " and tears stood in the poor darky 's eyes ; and he muttered something about having no pity on a dumb beast . " Dumb beast ! " said Jack ; " if she 's what you call a dumb beast , then my eyes a' n't mates . " This produced a laugh from all but the cook . He was too intent upon seeing her safe in the boat . He watched her all the way ashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole troop of her kind , who had been sent ashore from the other vessels , and had multiplied and formed a large commonwealth . From the door of his galley , the cook used to watch them in their manoeuvres , setting up a shout and clapping his hands whenever Bess came off victorious in the struggles for pieces of raw hide and half-picked bones which were lying about the beach . During the day , he saved all the nice things , and made a bucket of swill , and asked us to take it ashore in the gig , and looked quite disconcerted when the mate told him that he would pitch the swill overboard , and him after it , if he saw any of it go into the boats . We told him that he thought more about the pig than he did about his wife , who lived down in Robinson 's Alley ; and , indeed , he could hardly have been more attentive , for he actually , on several nights , after dark , when he thought he would not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket of nice swill , and returned like Leander from crossing the Hellespont . The next Sunday the other half of our crew went ashore on liberty , and left us on board , to enjoy the first quiet Sunday which we had had upon the coast . Here were no hides to come off , and no south-easters to fear . We washed and mended our clothes in the morning , and spent the rest of the day in reading and writing . Several of us wrote letters to send home by the Lagoda . At twelve o'clock the Ayacucho dropped her fore topsail , which was a signal for her sailing . She unmoored and warped down into the bight , from which she got under way . During this operation , her crew were a long time heaving at the windlass , and I listened for nearly an hour to the musical notes of a Sandwich Islander , called Mahannah , who " sang out " for them . Sailors , when heaving at a windlass , in order that they may heave together , always have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high and long-drawn note , varying with the motion of the windlass . This requires a high voice , strong lungs , and much practice , to be done well . This fellow had a very peculiar , wild sort of note , breaking occasionally into a falsetto . The sailors thought it was too high , and not enough of the boatswain hoarseness about it ; but to me it had a great charm . The harbor was perfectly still , and his voice rang among the hills , as though it could have been heard for miles . Toward sundown , a good breeze having sprung up , she got under weigh , and with her long , sharp head cutting elegantly through the water , on a taught bowline , she stood directly out of the harbor , and bore away to the southward . She was bound to Callao , and thence to the Sandwich Islands , and expected to be on the coast again in eight or ten months . At the close of the week we were ready to sail , but were delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  , the man who had been our second mate , and was turned forward . From the time that he was " broken , " he had had a dog 's berth on board the vessel , and determined to run away at the first opportunity . Having shipped for an officer when he was not half a seaman , he found little pity with the crew , and was not man enough to hold his ground among them . The captain called him a " soger , " 1 and promised to " ride him down as he would the main tack ; " and when officers are once determined to " ride a man down , " it is a gone case with him . He had had several difficulties with the captain , and asked leave to go home in the Lagoda ; but this was refused him . One night he was insolent to an officer on the beach , and refused to come aboard in the boat . He was reported to the captain ; and as he came aboard ,  --  it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told that he was to have a flogging . Immediately , he fell down on the deck , calling out  --  " Do n't flog me , Captain T  --   --  ; do n't flog me ! " and the captain , angry with him , and disgusted with his cowardice , gave him a few blows over the back with a rope 's end and sent him forward . He was not much hurt , but a good deal frightened , and made up his mind to run away that very night . This was managed better than anything he ever did in his life , and seemed really to show some spirit and forethought . He gave his bedding and mattress to one of the Lagoda 's crew , who took it aboard his vessel as something which he had bought , and promised to keep it for him . He then unpacked his chest , putting all his valuable clothes into a large canvas bag , and told one of us , who had the watch , to call him at midnight . Coming on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all still aft , he lowered his bag into a boat , got softly down into it , cast off the painter , and let it drop silently with the tide until he was out of hearing , when he sculled ashore . The next morning , when all hands were mustered , there was a great stir to find F  --   --  . Of course , we would tell nothing , and all they could discover was , that he had left an empty chest behind him , and that he went off in a boat ; for they saw it lying up high and dry on the beach . After breakfast , the captain went up to the town , and offered a reward of twenty dollars for him ; and for a couple of days , the soldiers , Indians , and all others who had nothing to do , were scouring the country for him , on horseback , but without effect ; for he was safely concealed , all the time , within fifty rods of the hide-houses . As soon as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a part of her crew , who were living there on shore , promised to conceal him and his traps until the Pilgrim should sail , and then to intercede with Captain Bradshaw to take him on board the ship . Just behind the hide-houses , among the thickets and underwood , was a small cave , the entrance to which was known only to two men on the beach , and which was so well concealed that , though , when I afterwards came to live on shore , it was shown to me two or three times , I was never able to find it alone . To this cave he was carried before daybreak in the morning , and supplied with bread and water , and there remained until he saw us under weigh and well round the point . Friday , March 27th . The captain , having given up all hope of finding F  --   --  , and being unwilling to delay any longer , gave orders for unmooring the ship , and we made sail , dropping slowly down with the tide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to Boston , and had the satisfaction of hearing him say that he should be back again before we left the coast . The wind , which was very light , died away soon after we doubled the point , and we lay becalmed for two days , not moving three miles the whole time , and a part of the second day were almost within sight of the vessels . On the third day , about noon , a cool sea-breeze came rippling and darkening the surface of the water , and by sundown we were off San Juan 's , which is about forty miles from San Diego , and is called half way to San Pedro , where we were now bound . Our crew was now considerably weakened . One man we had lost overboard ; another had been taken aft as clerk ; and a third had run away ; so that , beside S  --   --  and myself , there were only three able seamen and one boy of twelve years of age . With this diminished and discontented crew , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a couple of years of hard service ; yet there was not one who was not glad that F  --   --  had escaped ; for , shiftless and good for nothing as he was , no one could wish to see him dragging on a miserable life , cowed down and disheartened ; and we were all rejoiced to hear , upon our return to San Diego , about two months afterwards , that he had been immediately taken aboard the Lagoda , and went home in her , on regular seaman 's wages . After a slow passage of five days , we arrived , on Wednesday , the first of April , at our old anchoring ground at San Pedro . The bay was as deserted , and looked as dreary , as before , and formed no pleasing contrast with the security and snugness of San Diego , and the activity and interest which the loading and unloading of four vessels gave to that scene . In a few days the hides began to come slowly down , and we got into the old business of rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling our long league off and on . Nothing of note occurred while we were lying here , except that an attempt was made to repair the small Mexican brig which had been cast away in a south-easter , and which now lay up , high and dry , over one reef of rocks and two sand-banks . Our carpenter surveyed her , and pronounced her capable of refitting , and in a few days the owners came down from the Pueblo , and , waiting for the high spring tides , with the help of our cables , kedges , and crew , got her off and afloat , after several trials . The three men at the house on shore , who had formerly been a part of her crew , now joined her , and seemed glad enough at the prospect of getting off the coast . On board our own vessel , things went on in the common monotonous way . The excitement which immediately followed the flogging scene had passed off , but the effect of it upon the crew , and especially upon the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men were affected , corresponding to their different characters , was not a little remarkable . John was a foreigner and high-tempered , and , though mortified , as any one would be at having had the worst of an encounter , yet his chief feeling seemed to be anger ; and he talked much of satisfaction and revenge , if he ever got back to Boston . But with the other , it was very different . He was an American , and had had some education ; and this thing coming upon him , seemed completely to break him down . He had a feeling of the degradation that had been inflicted upon him , which the other man was incapable of . Before that , he had a good deal of fun , and mused us often with queer negro stories ,  --  ( he was from a slave state ) ; but afterwards he seldom smiled ; seemed to lose all life and elasticity ; and appeared to have but one wish , and that was for the voyage to be at an end . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was alone , and he took but little part or interest in John 's plans of satisfaction and retaliation . After a stay of about a fortnight , during which we slipped for one south-easter , and were at sea two days , we got under weigh for Santa Barbara . It was now the middle of April , and the south-easter season was nearly over ; and the light , regular trade-winds , which blow down the coast , began to set steadily in , during the latter part of each day . Against these , we beat slowly up to Santa Barbara  --  a distance of about ninety miles  --  in three days . There we found , lying at anchor , the large Genoese ship which we saw in the same place , on the first day of our coming upon the coast . She had been up to San Francisco , or , as it is called , " chock up to windward , " had stopped at Monterey on her way down , and was shortly to proceed to San Pedro and San Diego , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Valparaiso and Cadiz . She was a large , clumsy ship , and with her topmasts stayed forward , and high poop-deck , looked like an old woman with a crippled back . It was now the close of Lent , and on Good Friday she had all her yards a'cock-bill , which is customary among Catholic vessels . Some also have an effigy of Judas , which the crew amuse themselves with keel-hauling and hanging by the neck from the yard-arms. 1 Soger ( soldier ) is the worst term of reproach that can be applied to a sailor . It signifies a skulk , a sherk ,  --  one who is always trying to get clear of work , and is out of the way , or hanging back , when duty is to be done . " Marine " is the term applied more particularly to a man who is ignorant and clumsy about seaman 's work  --  a green-horn  --  a land-lubber . To make a sailor shoulder a handspike , and walk fore and aft the deck , like a sentry , is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a punishment inflicted upon an able seaman in a vessel of war , would break his spirit down more than a flogging . CHAPTER XVIII EASTER SUNDAY  --  " SAIL HO ! "  --  WHALES  --  SAN JUAN  --  ROMANCE OF HIDE-DROGHING  --  SAN DIEGO AGAIN The next Sunday was Easter Sunday , and as there had been no liberty at San Pedro , it was our turn to go ashore and misspend another Sabbath . Soon after breakfast , a large boat , filled with men in blue jackets , scarlet caps , and various colored under-clothes , bound ashore on liberty , left the Italian ship , and passed under our stern ; the men singing beautiful Italian boat-songs , all the way , in fine , full chorus . Among the songs I recognized the favorite " O Pescator dell ' onda . " It brought back to my mind pianofortes , drawing-rooms , young ladies singing , and a thousand other things which as little befitted me , in my situation , to be thinking upon . Supposing that the whole day would be too long a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we could take a ride , we remained quietly on board until after dinner . We were then pulled ashore in the stern of the boat , and , with orders to be on the beach at sundown , we took our way for the town . There , everything wore the appearance of a holyday . The people were all dressed in their best ; the men riding about on horseback among the houses , and the women sitting on carpets before the doors . Under the piazza of a " pulperia , " two men were seated , decked out with knots of ribbons and bouquets , and playing the violin and the Spanish guitar . These are the only instruments , with the exception of the drums and trumpets at Monterey that I ever heard in California ; and I suspect they play upon no others , for at a great fandango at which I was afterwards present , and where they mustered all the music they could find , there were three violins and two guitars , and no other instrument . As it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any dancing and hearing that a bull was expected down from the country , to be baited in the presidio square , in the course of an hour or two we took a stroll among the houses . Inquiring for an American who , we had been told , had married in the place , and kept a shop , we were directed to a long , low building , at the end of which was a door , with a sign over it , in Spanish . Entering the shop , we found no one in it , and the whole had an empty , deserted appearance . In a few minutes the man made his appearance , and apologized for having nothing to entertain us with , saying that he had had a fandango at his house the night before , and the people had eaten and drunk up everything . " Oh yes ! " said I , " Easter holydays ? " " No ! " said he , with a singular expression to his face ; " I had a little daughter die the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here I felt a little strangely , not knowing what to say , or whether to offer consolation or no , and was beginning to retire , when he opened a side door and told us to walk in . Here I was no less astonished ; for I found a large room , filled with young girls , from three or four years of age up to fifteen and sixteen , dressed all in white , with wreaths of flowers on their heads , and bouquets in their hands . Following our conductor through all these girls , who were playing about in high spirits , we came to a table , at the end of the room , covered with a white cloth , on which lay a coffin , about three feet long , with the body of his child . The coffin was lined on the outside with white cloth , and on the inside with white satin , and was strewed with flowers . Through an open door we saw , in another room , a few elderly people in common dresses ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stained walls , gave evident signs of the last night 's " high go . " Feeling , like Garrick , between tragedy and comedy , an uncertainty of purpose and a little awkwardness , I asked the man when the funeral would take place , and being told that it would move toward the mission in about an hour , took my leave . To pass away the time , we took horses and rode down to the beach , and there found three or four Italian sailors , mounted , and riding up and down , on the hard sand , at a furious rate . We joined them , and found it fine sport . The beach gave us a stretch of a mile or more , and the horses flew over the smooth , hard sand , apparently invigorated and excited by the salt sea-breeze , and by the continual roar and dashing of the breakers . From the beach we returned to the town , and finding that the funeral procession had moved , rode on and overtook it , about half-way to the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen before in the house ; the one looking as much like a funeral procession as the other did like a house of mourning . The little coffin was borne by eight girls , who were continually relieved by others , running forward from the procession and taking their places . Behind it came a straggling company of girls , dressed as before , in white and flowers , and including , I should suppose by their numbers , nearly all the girls between five and fifteen in the place . They played along on the way , frequently stopping and running all together to talk to some one , or to pick up a flower , and then running on again to overtake the coffin . There were a few elderly women in common colors ; and a herd of young men and boys , some on foot and others mounted , followed them , or walked or rode by their side , frequently interrupting them by jokes and questions . But the most singular thing of all was , that two men walked , one on each side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continually loaded , and fired into the air . Whether this was to keep off the evil spirits or not , I do not know . It was the only interpretation that I could put upon it . As we drew near the mission , we saw the great gate thrown open , and the padre standing on the steps , with a crucifix in hand . The mission is a large and deserted-looking place , the out-buildings going to ruin , and everything giving one the impression of decayed grandeur . A large stone fountain threw out pure water , from four mouths , into a basin , before the church door ; and we were on the point of riding up to let our horses drink , when it occurred to us that it might be consecrated , and we forbore . Just at this moment , the bells set up their harsh , discordant clang ; and the procession moved into the court . I was anxious to follow , and see the ceremony , but the horse of one of my companions had become frightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown his rider , and got one of his feet caught in the saddle , which had slipped , was fast dragging and ripping it to pieces . Knowing that my shipmate could not speak a word of Spanish , and fearing that he would get into difficulty , I was obliged to leave the ceremony and ride after him . I soon overtook him , trudging along , swearing at the horse , and carrying the remains of the saddle , which he had picked up on the road . Going to the owner of the horse , we made a settlement with him , and found him surprisingly liberal . All parts of the saddle were brought back , and , being capable of repair , he was satisfied with six reals . We thought it would have been a few dollars . We pointed to the horse , which was now half way up one of the mountains ; but he shook his head , saying , " No importe ! " and giving us to understand that he had plenty more . Having returned to the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the principal pulperia , and riding up , found that all these people  --  men , women , and children  --  had been drawn together by a couple of bantam cocks . The cocks were in full tilt , springing into one another , and the people were as eager , laughing and shouting , as though the combatants had been men . There had been a disappointment about the bull ; he had broken his bail , and taken himself off , and it was too late to get another ; so the people were obliged to put up with a cock-fight . One of the bantams having been knocked in the head , and had an eye put out , he gave in , and two monstrous prize-cocks were brought on . These were the object of the whole affair ; the two bantams having been merely served up as a first course , to collect the people together . Two fellows came into the ring holding the cocks in their arms , and stroking them , and running about on all fours , encouraging and setting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other contests , it remained for some time undecided . They both showed great pluck , and fought probably better and longer than their masters would have done . Whether , in the end , it was the white or the red that beat , I do not recollect ; but , whichever it was , he strutted off with the true veni-vidi-vici look , leaving the other lying panting on his beam-ends . This matter having been settled , we heard some talk about " caballos " and " carrera " and seeing the people all streaming off in one direction , we followed , and came upon a level piece of ground , just out of the town , which was used as a race-course . Here the crowd soon became thick again ; the ground was marked off ; the judges stationed ; and the horses led up to one end . Two fine-looking old gentlemen  --  Don Carlos and Don Domingo , so called  --  held the stakes , and all was now ready . We waited some time , during which we could just see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a shout along the lines , and on they came  --  heads stretched out and eyes starting ;  --  working all over , both man and beast . The steeds came by us like a couple of chain-shot  --  neck and neck ; and now we could see nothing but their backs , and their hind hoofs flying in the air . As fast as the horses passed , the crowd broke up behind them , and ran to the goal . When we got there , we found the horses returning on a slow walk , having run far beyond the mark , and heard that the long , bony one had come in head and shoulders before the other . The riders were light-built men ; had handkerchiefs tied round their heads ; and were bare-armed and bare-legged . The horses were noble-looking beasts , not so sleek and combed as our Boston stable-horses , but with fine limbs , and spirited eyes . After this had been settled , and fully talked over , the crowd scattered again and flocked back to the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guitar screaming and twanging away under the piazza , where they had been all day . As it was now sundown , there began to be some dancing . The Italian sailors danced , and one of our crew exhibited himself in a sort of West India shuffle , much to the amusement of the bystanders , who cried out , " Bravo ! " " Otra vez ! " and " Vivan los marineros ! " but the dancing did not become general , as the women and the " gente de razon " had not yet made their appearance . We wished very much to stay and see the style of dancing ; but , although we had had our own way during the day , yet we were , after all , but ' foremast Jacks ; and having been ordered to be on the beach by sundown , did not venture to be more than an hour behind the time ; so we took our way down . We found the boat just pulling ashore through the breakers , which were running high , there having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause or other , always brings on , or precedes a heavy sea . Liberty-men are privileged from the time they leave the vessel until they step on board again ; so we took our places in the stern sheets , and were congratulating ourselves upon getting off dry , when a great comber broke fore and aft the boat , and wet us through and through , filling the boat half full of water . Having lost her buoyancy by the weight of the water , she dropped heavily into every sea that struck her , and by the time we had pulled out of the surf into deep water , she was but just afloat , and we were up to our knees . By the help of a small bucket and our hats , we bailed her out , got on board , hoisted the boats , eat our supper , changed our clothes , gave ( as is usual ) the whole history of our day 's adventures to those who had staid on board , and having taken a night-smoke , turned-in . Thus ended our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an offset to our day 's sport , we were all set to work " tarring down " the rigging . Some got girt-lines up for riding down the stays and back-stays , and others tarred the shrouds , lifts , etc. , laying out on the yards , and coming down the rigging . We overhauled our bags and took out our old tarry trowsers and frocks , which we had used when we tarred down before , and were all at work in the rigging by sunrise . After breakfast , we had the satisfaction of seeing the Italian ship 's boat go ashore , filled with men , gaily dressed , as on the day before , and singing their barcarollas . The Easter holydays are kept up on shore during three days ; and being a Catholic vessel , the Crew had the advantage of them . For two successive days , while perched up in the rigging , covered with tar and engaged in our disagreeable work , we saw these fellows going ashore in the morning , and coming off again at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's no danger of Catholicism 's spreading in New England ; Yankees ca n't afford the time to be Catholics . American shipmasters get nearly three weeks more labor out of their crews , in the course of a year , than the masters of vessels from Catholic countries . Yankees do n't keep Christmas , and ship-masters at sea never know when Thanksgiving comes , so Jack has no festival at all . About noon , a man aloft called out " Sail ho ! " and looking round , we saw the head sails of a vessel coming round the point . As she drew round , she showed the broadside of a full-rigged brig , with the Yankee ensign at her peak . We ran up our stars and stripes , and , knowing that there was no American brig on the coast but ourselves , expected to have news from home . She rounded-to and let go her anchor , but the dark faces on her yards , when they furled the sails , and the Babel on deck , soon made known that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crew came aboard , bringing her skipper , and from them we learned that she was from Oahu , and was engaged in the same trade with the Ayacucho , Loriotte , etc. , between the coast , the Sandwich Islands , and the leeward coast of Peru and Chili . Her captain and officers were Americans , and also a part of her crew ; the rest were Islanders . She was called the Catalina , and , like all the others vessels in that trade , except the Ayacucho , her papers and colors were from Uncle Sam . They , of course , brought us no news , and we were doubly disappointed , for we had thought , at first , it might be the ship which we were expecting from Boston . After lying here about a fortnight , and collecting all the hides the place afforded , we set sail again for San Pedro . There we found the brig which we had assisted in getting off lying at anchor , with a mixed crew of Americans , English , Sandwich Islanders , Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we , yet she had three times the number of men ; and she needed them , for her officers were Californians . No vessels in the world go so poorly manned as American and English ; and none do so well . A Yankee brig of that size would have had a crew of four men , and would have worked round and round her . The Italian ship had a crew of thirty men ; nearly three times as many as the Alert , which was afterwards on the coast , and was of the same size ; yet the Alert would get under weigh and come-to in half the time , and get two anchors , while they were all talking at once  --  jabbering like a parcel of " Yahoos , " and running about decks to find their cat-block . There was only one point in which they had the advantage over us , and that was in lightening their labors in the boats by their songs . The Americans are a time and money saving people , but have not yet , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . " We pulled the long distances to and from the shore , with our loaded boats , without a word spoken , and with discontented looks , while they not only lightened the labor of rowing , but actually made it pleasant and cheerful , by their music . So true is it , that  --  " For the tired slave , song lifts the languid oar , And bids it aptly fall , with chime That beautifies the fairest shore , And mitigates the harshest clime . " We lay about a week in San Pedro , and got under weigh for San Diego , intending to stop at San Juan , as the south-easter season was nearly over , and there was little or no danger . This being the spring season , San Pedro , as well as all the other open ports upon the coast , was filled with whales , that had come in to make their annual visit upon soundings . For the first few days that we were here and at Santa Barbara , we watched them with great interest  --  calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the spout of one breaking the surface of the water ; but they soon became so common that we took little notice of them . They often " broke " very near us ; and one thick , foggy night , during a dead calm , while I was standing anchor-watch , one of them rose so near , that he struck our cable , and made all surge again . He did not seem to like the encounter much himself , for he sheered off , and spouted at a good distance . We once came very near running one down in the gig , and should probably have been knocked to pieces and blown sky-high . We had been on board the little Spanish brig , and were returning , stretching out well at our oars , the little boat going like a swallow ; our backs were forward , ( as is always the case in pulling , ) and the captain , who was steering , was not looking ahead , when , all at once , we heard the spout of a whale directly ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives ! " shouted the captain ; and we backed our blades in the water and brought the boat to in a smother of foam . Turning our heads , we saw a great , rough , hump-backed whale , slowly crossing our fore foot , within three or four yards of the boat 's stem . Had we not backed water just as we did , we should inevitably have gone smash upon him , striking him with our stem just about amidships . He took no notice of us , but passed slowly on , and dived a few yards beyond us , throwing his tail high in the air . He was so near that we had a perfect view of him and as may be supposed , had no desire to see him nearer . He was a disgusting creature ; with a skin rough , hairy , and of an iron-grey color . This kind differs much from the sperm , in color and skin , and is said to be fiercer . We saw a few sperm whales ; but most of the whales that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-whales , which are more difficult to take , and are said not to give oil enough to pay for the trouble . For this reason whale-ships do not come upon the coast after them . Our captain , together with Captain Nye of the Loriotte , who had been in a whale-ship , thought of making an attempt upon one of them with two boats ' crews , but as we had only two harpoons and no proper lines , they gave it up . During the months of March , April , and May , these whales appear in great numbers in the open ports of Santa Barbara , San Pedro , etc. , and hover off the coast , while a few find their way into the close harbors of San Diego and Monterey . They are all off again before midsummer , and make their appearance on the " off-shore ground . " We saw some fine " schools " of sperm whales , which are easily distinguished by their spout , blowing away , a few miles to windward , on our passage to San Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we came to anchor , in twenty fathoms ' water , almost out at sea , as it were , and directly abreast of a steep hill which overhung the water , and was twice as high as our royal-mast-head . We had heard much of this place , from the Lagoda 's crew , who said it was the worst place in California . The shore is rocky , and directly exposed to the south-east , so that vessels are obliged to slip and run for their lives on the first sign of a gale ; and late as it was in the season , we got up our slip-rope and gear , though we meant to stay only twenty-four hours . We pulled the agent ashore , and were ordered to wait for him , while he took a circuitous way round the hill to the mission , which was hidden behind it . We were glad of the opportunity to examine this singular place , and hauling the boat up and making her well fast , took different directions up and down the beach , to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . The country here for several miles is high table-land , running boldly to the shore , and breaking off in a steep hill , at the foot of which the waters of the Pacific are constantly dashing . For several miles the water washes the very base of the hill , or breaks upon ledges and fragments of rocks which run out into the sea . Just where we landed was a small cove , or " bight , " which gave us , at high tide , a few square feet of sand-beach between the sea and the bottom of the hill . This was the only landing-place . Directly before us , rose the perpendicular height of four or five hundred feet . How we were to get hides down , or goods up , upon the table-land on which the mission was situated , was more than we could tell . The agent had taken a long circuit , and yet had frequently to jump over breaks , and climb up steep places , in the ascent . No animal but a man or monkey could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look-out ; and knowing that the agent would be gone an hour or more , we strolled about , picking up shells , and following the sea where it tumbled in , roaring and spouting , among the crevices of the great rocks . What a sight , thought I , must this be in a south-easter ! The rocks were as large as those of Nahant or Newport , but , to my eye , more grand and broken . Beside , there was a grandeur in everything around , which gave almost a solemnity to the scene : a silence and solitariness which affected everything ! Not a human being but ourselves for miles ; and no sound heard but the pulsations of the great Pacific ! and the great steep hill rising like a wall , and cutting us off from all the world , but the " world of waters ! " I separated myself from the rest and sat down on a rock , just where the sea ran in and formed a fine spouting horn . Compared with the plain , dull sand-beach of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a great rock in a weary land . It was almost the first time that I had been positively alone  --  free from the sense that human beings were at my elbow , if not talking with me  --  since I had left home . My better nature returned strong upon me . Everything was in accordance with my state of feeling , and I experienced a glow of pleasure at finding that what of poetry and romance I ever had in me , had not been entirely deadened by the laborious and frittering life I had led . Nearly an hour did I sit , almost lost in the luxury of this entire new scene of the play in which I had been so long acting , when I was aroused by the distant shouts of my companions , and saw that they were collecting together , as the agent had made his appearance , on his way back to our boat . We pulled aboard , and found the long-boat hoisted out , and nearly laden with goods ; and after dinner , we all went on shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we drew in , we found an ox-cart and a couple of men standing directly on the brow of the hill ; and having landed , the captain took his way round the hill , ordering me and one other to follow him . We followed , picking our way out , and jumping and scrambling up , walking over briers and prickly pears , until we came to the top . Here the country stretched out for miles as far as the eye could reach , on a level , table surface ; and the only habitation in sight was the small white mission of San Juan Capistrano , with a few Indian huts about it , standing in a small hollow , about a mile from where we were . Reaching the brow of the hill where the cart stood , we found several piles of hides , and Indians sitting round them . One or two other carts were coming slowly on from the mission , and the captain told us to begin and throw the hides down . This , then , was the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , a distance of four hundred feet ! This was doing the business on a great scale . Standing on the edge of the hill and looking down the perpendicular height , the sailors ,  --  " That walk upon the beach , Appeared like mice ; and our tall anchoring bark Diminished to her cock ; her cock a buoy Almost too small for sight . " Down this height we pitched the hides , throwing them as far out into the air as we could ; and as they were all large , stiff , and doubled , like the cover of a book , the wind took them , and they swayed and eddied about , plunging and rising in the air , like a kite when it has broken its string . As it was now low tide , there was no danger of their falling into the water , and as fast as they came to ground , the men below picked them up , and taking them on their heads , walked off with them to the boat . It was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hides ; and the continual walking to and fro of the men , who looked like mites , on the beach ! This was the romance of hide-droghing ! Some of the hides lodged in cavities which were under the bank and out of our sight , being directly under us ; but by sending others down in the same direction , we succeeded in dislodging them . Had they remained there , the captain said he should have sent on board for a couple of pairs of long halyards , and got some one to have gone down for them . It was said that one of the crew of an English brig went down in the same way , a few years before . We looked over , and thought it would not be a welcome task , especially for a few paltry hides ; but no one knows what he can do until he is called upon ; for , six months afterwards , I went down the same place by a pair of top-gallant studding-sail halyards , to save a half a dozen hides which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took our way back again , and found the boat loaded and ready to start . We pulled off ; took the hides all aboard ; hoisted in the boats ; hove up our anchor ; made sail ; and before sundown , were on our way to San Diego . Friday , May 8th , 1835 . Arrived at San Diego . Here we found the little harbor deserted . The Lagoda , Ayacucho , Loriotte , and all , had left the coast , and we were nearly alone . All the hide-houses on the beach , but ours , were shut up , and the Sandwich Islanders , a dozen or twenty in number , who had worked for the other vessels and been paid off when they sailed , were living on the beach , keeping up a grand carnival . A Russian discovery-ship which had been in this port a few years before , had built a large oven for baking bread , and went away , leaving it standing . This , the Sandwich Islanders took possession of , and had kept , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or eight men  --  that is , it was as large as a ship 's forecastle ; had a door at the side , and a vent-hole at top . They covered it with Oahu mats , for a carpet ; stopped up the vent-hole in bad weather , and made it their head-quarters . It was now inhabited by as many as a dozen or twenty men , who lived there in complete idleness  --  drinking , playing cards , and carousing in every way . They bought a bullock once a week , which kept them in meat , and one of them went up to the town every day to get fruit , liquor , and provisions . Besides this , they had bought a cask of ship-bread , and a barrel of flour from the Lagoda , before she sailed . There they lived , having a grand time , and caring for nobody . Captain T  --   --  was anxious to get three or four of them to come on board the Pilgrim , as we were so much diminished in numbers ; and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to negotiate with them . One of them ,  --  a finely built , active , strong and intelligent fellow ,  --  who was a sort of king among them , acted as spokesman . He was called Mannini ,  --  or rather , out of compliment to his known importance and influence , Mr. Mannini  --  and was known all over California . Through him , the captain offered them fifteen dollars a month , and one month 's pay in advance ; but it was like throwing pearls before swine , or rather , carrying coals to Newcastle . So long as they had money , they would not work for fifty dollars a month , and when their money was gone , they would work for ten . " What do you do here , Mr. Mannini ? " 1 said the captain . " Oh , we play cards , get drunk , smoke  --  do anything we 're a mind to . " " Do n't you want to come aboard and work ? " " Aole ! aole make make makou i ka hana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Mamule , money pau  --  all gone . Ah ! very good , work !  --  maikai , hana hana nui ! " " But you 'll spend all your money in this way , " said the captain . " Aye ! me know that . By-'em-by money pau  --  all gone ; then Kanaka work plenty . " This was a hopeless case , and the captain left them , to wait patiently until their money was gone . We discharged our hides and tallow , and in about a week were ready to set sail again for the windward . We unmoored , and got everything ready , when the captain made another attempt upon the oven . This time he had more regard to the " mollia tempora fandi , " and succeeded very well . He got Mr. Mannini in his interest , and as the shot was getting low in the locker , prevailed upon him and three others to come on board with their chests and baggage , and sent a hasty summons to me and the boy to come ashore with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was unexpected to me ; but anything in the way of variety I liked ; so we got ready , and were pulled ashore . I stood on the beach while the brig got under weigh , and watched her until she rounded the point , and then went up to the hide-house to take up my quarters for a few months . 1 The letter i in the Sandwich Island language is sounded like e in the English . CHAPTER XIX THE SANDWICH ISLANDERS  --  HIDE-CURING  --  WOOD-CUTTING  --  RATTLE-SNAKES  --  NEW-COMERS Here was a change in my life as complete as it had been sudden . In the twinkling of an eye , I was transformed from a sailor into a " beach-comber " and a hide-curer ; yet the novelty and the comparative independence of the life were not unpleasant . Our hide-house was a large building , made of rough boards , and intended to hold forty thousand hides . In one corner of it , a small room was parted off , in which four berths were made , where we were to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table , a small locker for pots , spoons , plates , etc. , and a small hole cut to let in the light . Here we put our chests , threw our bedding into the berths , and took up our quarters . Over our head was another small room , in which Mr. Russell lived , who had charge of the hide-house ; the same man who was for a time an officer of the Pilgrim . There he lived in solitary grandeur ; eating and sleeping alone , ( and these were his principal occupations , ) and communing with his own dignity . The boy was to act as cook ; while myself , a giant of a Frenchman named Nicholas , and four Sandwich Islanders , were to cure the hides . Sam , the Frenchman , and myself , lived together in the room , and the four Sandwich Islanders worked and ate with us , but generally slept at the oven . My new messmate , Nicholas , was the most immense man that I had ever seen in my life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked , and now let himself out to the different houses to cure hides . He was considerably over six feet , and of a frame so large that he might have been shown for a curiosity . But the most remarkable thing about him was his feet . They were so large that he could not find a pair of shoes in California to fit him , and was obliged to send to Oahu for a pair ; and when he got them , he was compelled to wear them down at the heel . He told me once , himself , that he was wrecked in an American brig on the Goodwin Sands , and was sent up to London , to the charge of the American consul , without clothing to his back or shoes to his feet , and was obliged to go about London streets in his stocking feet three or four days , in the month of January , until the consul could have a pair of shoes made for him . His strength was in proportion to his size , and his ignorance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant as strong . " He neither knew how to read nor write . He had been to sea from a boy , and had seen all kinds of service , and been in every kind of vessel : merchantmen , men-of-war , privateers , and slavers ; and from what I could gather from his accounts of himself , and from what he once told me , in confidence , after we had become better acquainted , he had even been in worse business than slave-trading . He was once tried for his life in Charleston , South Carolina , and though acquitted , yet he was so frightened that he never would show himself in the United States again ; and I could not persuade him that he could never be tried a second time for the same offence . He said he had got safe off from the breakers , and was too good a sailor to risk his timbers again . Though I knew what his life had been , yet I never had the slightest fear of him . We always got along very well together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , he showed a respect for my education , and for what he had heard of my situation before coming to sea . " I 'll be good friends with you , " he used to say , " for by-and-by you 'll come out here captain , and then you 'll haze me well ! " By holding well together , we kept the officer in good order , for he was evidently afraid of Nicholas , and never ordered us , except when employed upon the hides . My other companions , the Sandwich Islanders , deserve particular notice . A considerable trade has been carried on for several years between California and the Sandwich Islands , and most of the vessels are manned with Islanders ; who , as they , for the most part , sign no articles , leave whenever they choose , and let themselves out to cure hides at San Diego , and to supply the places of the men of the American vessels while on the coast . In this way , quite a colony of them had become settled at San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently gone off in the Ayacucho and Loriotte , and the Pilgrim had taken Mr. Mannini and three others , so that there were not more than twenty left . Of these , four were on pay at the Ayacucho 's house , four more working with us , and the rest were living at the oven in a quiet way ; for their money was nearly gone , and they must make it last until some other vessel came down to employ them . During the four months that I lived here , I got well acquainted with all of them , and took the greatest pains to become familiar with their language , habits , and characters . Their language , I could only learn , orally , for they had not any books among them , though many of them had been taught to read and write by the missionaries at home . They spoke a little English , and by a sort of compromise , a mixed language was used on the beach , which could be understood by all . The long name of Sandwich Islanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all over the Pacific ocean , " Kanakas , " from a word in their own language which they apply to themselves , and to all South Sea Islanders , in distinction from whites , whom they call " Haole . " This name , " Kanaka , " they answer to , both collectively and individually . Their proper names , in their own language , being difficult to pronounce and remember , they are called by any names which the captains or crews may choose to give them . Some are called after the vessel they are in ; others by common names , as Jack , Tom , Bill ; and some have fancy names , as Ban-yan , Fore-top , Rope-yarn , Pelican , etc. , etc . Of the four who worked at our house one was named " Mr. Bingham , " after the missionary at Oahu ; another , Hope , after a vessel that he had been in ; a third , Tom Davis , the name of his first captain ; and the fourth , Pelican , from his fancied resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , etc . But by whatever names they might be called , they were the most interesting , intelligent , and kind-hearted people that I ever fell in with . I felt a positive attachment for almost all of them ; and many of them I have , to this time , a feeling for , which would lead me to go a great way for the mere pleasure of seeing them , and which will always make me feel a strong interest in the mere name of a Sandwich Islander . Tom Davis knew how to read , write , and cipher in common arithmetic ; had been to the United States , and spoke English quite well . His education was as good as that of three-quarters of the Yankees in California , and his manners and principles a good deal better , and he was so quick of apprehension that he might have been taught navigation , and the elements of many of the sciences , with the most perfect ease . Old " Mr. Bingham " spoke very little English  --  almost none , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best-hearted old fellow in the world . He must have been over fifty years of age , and had two of his front teeth knocked out , which was done by his parents as a sign of grief at the death of Kamehameha , the great king of the Sandwich Islands . We used to tell him that he ate Captain Cook , and lost his teeth in that way . That was the only thing that ever made him angry . He would always be quite excited at that ; and say  --  " Aole ! " ( no . ) " Me no eat Captain Cook ! Me pikinini  --  small  --  so high  --  no more ! My father see Captain Cook ! Me  --  no ! " None of them liked to have anything said about Captain Cook , for the sailors all believe that he was eaten , and that , they can not endure to be taunted with .  --  " New Zealand Kanaka eat white man ;  --  Sandwich Island Kanaka  --  no . Sandwich Island Kanaka ua like pu na haole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bingham was a sort of patriarch among them , and was always treated with great respect , though he had not the education and energy which gave Mr. Mannini his power over them . I have spent hours in talking with this old fellow about Kamehameha , the Charlemagne of the Sandwich Islands ; his son and successor Riho Riho , who died in England , and was brought to Oahu in the frigate Blonde , Captain Lord Byron , and whose funeral he remembered perfectly ; and also about the customs of his country in his boyhood , and the changes which had been made by the missionaries . He never would allow that human beings had been eaten there ; and , indeed , it always seemed like an insult to tell so affectionate , intelligent , and civilized a class of men , that such barbarities had been practised in their own country within the recollection of many of them . Certainly , the history of no people on the globe can show anything like so rapid an advance . I would have trusted my life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ; and certainly had I wished for a favor or act of sacrifice , I would have gone to them all , in turn , before I should have applied to one of my own countrymen on the coast , and should have expected to have seen it done , before my own countrymen had got half through counting the cost . Their costumes , and manner of treating one another , show a simple , primitive generosity , which is truly delightful ; and which is often a reproach to our own people . Whatever one has , they all have . Money , food , clothes , they share with one another ; even to the last piece of tobacco to put in their pipes . I once heard old Mr. Bingham say , with the highest indignation , to a Yankee trader who was trying to persuade him to keep his money to himself  --  " No ! We no all ' e same a ' you !  --  Suppose one got money , all got money . You ;  --  suppose one got money  --  lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Kanaka all ' e same a ' one ! " This principle they carry so far , that none of them will eat anything in the sight of others without offering it all round . I have seen one of them break a biscuit , which had been given him , into five parts , at a time when I knew he was on a very short allowance , as there was but little to eat on the beach . My favorite among all of them , and one who was liked by both officers and men , and by whomever he had anything to do with , was Hope . He was an intelligent , kind-hearted little fellow , and I never saw him angry , though I knew him for more than a year , and have seen him imposed upon by white people , and abused by insolent officers of vessels . He was always civil , and always ready , and never forgot a benefit . I once took care of him when he was ill , getting medicines from the ship 's chests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he never forgot it . Every Kanaka has one particular friend , whom he considers himself bound to do everything for , and with whom he has a sort of contract ,  --  an alliance offensive and defensive ,  --  and for whom he will often make the greatest sacrifices . This friend they call aikane ; and for such did Hope adopt me . I do not believe I could have wanted anything which he had , that he would not have given me . In return for this , I was always his friend among the Americans , and used to teach him letters and numbers ; for he left home before he had learned how to read . He was very curious about Boston ( as they call the United States ) ; asking many questions about the houses , the people , etc. , and always wished to have the pictures in books explained to him . They were all astonishingly quick in catching at explanations , and many things which I had thought it utterly impossible to make them understand , they often seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew enough to make them wish to go farther . The pictures of steamboats and railroad cars , in the columns of some newspapers which I had , gave me great difficulty to explain . The grading of the road , the rails , the construction of the carriages , they could easily understand , but the motion produced by steam was a little too refined for them . I attempted to show it to them once by an experiment upon the cook 's coppers , but failed ; probably as much from my own ignorance as from their want of apprehension ; and , I have no doubt , left them with about as clear an idea of the principle as I had myself . This difficulty , of course , existed in the same force with the steamboats and all I could do was to give them some account of the results , in the shape of speed ; for , failing in the reason , I had to fall back upon the fact . In my account of the speed I was supported by Tom , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ran over to New Bedford . A map of the world , which I once showed them , kept their attention for hours ; those who knew how to read pointing out the places and referring to me for the distances . I remember being much amused with a question which Hope asked me . Pointing to the large irregular place which is always left blank round the poles , to denote that it is undiscovered , he looked up and asked .  --  " Pau ? " ( Done ? ended ? ) The system of naming the streets and numbering the houses , they easily understood , and the utility of it . They had a great desire to see America , but were afraid of doubling Cape Horn , for they suffer much in cold weather , and had heard dreadful accounts of the Cape , from those of their number who had been round it . They smoke a great deal , though not much at a time ; using pipes with large bowls , and very short stems , or no stems at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths , take a long draught , getting their mouths as full as they can hold , and their cheeks distended , and then let it slowly out through their mouths and nostrils . The pipe is then passed to others , who draw , in the same manner , one pipe-full serving for half a dozen . They never take short , continuous draughts , like Europeans , but one of these " Oahu puffs , " as the sailors call them , serves for an hour or two , until some one else lights his pipe , and it is passed round in the same manner . Each Kanaka on the beach had a pipe , flint , steel , tinder , a hand of tobacco , and a jack-knife , which he always carried about with him . That which strikes a stranger most peculiarly is their style of singing . They run on , in a low , guttural , monotonous sort of chant , their lips and tongues seeming hardly to move , and the sounds modulated solely in the throat . There is very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could learn , are extempore . They sing about persons and things which are around them , and adopt this method when they do not wish to be understood by any but themselves ; and it is very effectual , for with the most careful attention I never could detect a word that I knew . I have often heard Mr. Mannini , who was the most noted improvisatore among them , sing for an hour together , when at work in the midst of Americans and Englishmen ; and , by the occasional shouts and laughter of the Kanakas , who were at a distance , it was evident that he was singing about the different men that he was at work with . They have great powers of ridicule , and are excellent mimics ; many of them discovering and imitating the peculiarities of our own people , before we had seen them ourselves . These were the people with whom I was to spend a few months ; and who , with the exception of the officer , Nicholas the Frenchman , and the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , to except the dogs , for they were an important part of our settlement . Some of the first vessels brought dogs out with them , who , for convenience , were left ashore , and there multiplied , until they came to be a great people . While I was on the beach , the average number was about forty , and probably an equal , or greater number are drowned , or killed in some other way , every year . They are very useful in guarding the beach , the Indians being afraid to come down at night ; for it was impossible for any one to get within half a mile of the hide-houses without a general alarm . The father of the colony , old Sachem , so called from the ship in which he was brought out , died while I was there , full of years , and was honorably buried . Hogs , and a few chickens , were the rest of the animal tribe , and formed , like the dogs , a common company , though they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses to which they belonged . I had been but a few hours on the beach , and the Pilgrim was hardly out of sight , when the cry of " Sail ho ! " was raised , and a small hermaphrodite brig rounded the point , bore up into the harbor , and came to anchor . It was the Mexican brig Fazio , which we had left at San Pedro , and which had come down to land her tallow , try it all over , and make new bags , and then take it in , and leave the coast . They moored ship , erected their try-works on shore , put up a small tent , in which they all lived , and commenced operations . They made an addition to our society , and we spent many evenings in their tent , where , amid the Babel of English , Spanish , French , Indian , and Kanaka , we found some words that we could understand in common . The morning after my landing , I began the duties of hide-curing . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole history of a hide , from the time it is taken from a bullock until it is put on board the vessel to be carried to Boston . When the hide is taken from the bullock , holes are cut round it , near the edge , by which it is staked out to dry . In this manner it dries without shrinking . After they are thus dried in the sun , they are received by the vessels , and brought down to the depot at San Diego . The vessels land them , and leave them in large piles near the houses . Then begins the hide-curer 's duty . The first thing is to put them in soak . This is done by carrying them down at low tide , and making them fast , in small piles , by ropes , and letting the tide come up and cover them . Every day we put in soak twenty-five for each man , which , with us , made an hundred and fifty . There they lie forty-eight hours , when they are taken out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vats . These vats contain brine , made very strong ; being sea-water , with great quantities of salt thrown in . This pickles the hides , and in this they lie forty-eight hours ; the use of the sea-water , into which they are first put , being merely to soften and clean them . From these vats , they are taken , and lie on a platform twenty-four hours , and then are spread upon the ground , and carefully stretched and staked out , so that they may dry smooth . After they were staked , and while yet wet and soft , we used to go upon them with our knives , and carefully cut off all the bad parts :  --  the pieces of meat and fat , which would corrupt and infect the whole if stowed away in a vessel for many months , the large flippers , the ears , and all other parts which would prevent close stowage . This was the most difficult part of our duty : as it required much skill to take everything necessary off and not to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , as six of us had to clean an hundred and fifty , most of which required a great deal to be done to them , as the Spaniards are very careless in skinning their cattle . Then , too , as we cleaned them while they were staked out , we were obliged to kneel down upon them , which always gives beginners the back-ache . The first day , I was so slow and awkward that I cleaned only eight ; at the end of a few days I doubled my number ; and in a fortnight or three weeks , could keep up with the others , and clean my proportion  --  twenty-five . This cleaning must be got through with before noon ; for by that time they get too dry . After the sun has been upon them a few hours , they are carefully gone over with scrapers , to get off all the grease which the sun brings out . This being done , the stakes are pulled up , and the hides carefully doubled , with the hair side out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are turned upon the other side , and at sundown piled up and covered over . The next day they are spread out and opened again , and at night , if fully dry , are thrown upon a long , horizontal pole , five at a time , and beat with flails . This takes all the dust from them . Then , being salted , scraped , cleaned , dried , and beaten , they are stowed away in the house . Here ends their history , except that they are taken out again when the vessel is ready to go home , beaten , stowed away on board , carried to Boston , tanned , made into shoes and other articles for which leather is used ; and many of them , very probably , in the end , brought back again to California in the shape of shoes , and worn out in pursuit of other bullocks , or in the curing of other hides . By putting an hundred and fifty in soak every day , we had the same number at each stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every day , the same work to do upon the same number : an hundred and fifty to put in soak ; an hundred and fifty to wash out and put in the vat ; the same number to haul from the vat and put on the platform to drain ; the same number to spread and stake out and clean ; and the same number to beat and stow away in the home . I ought to except Sunday ; for , by a prescription which no captain or agent has yet ventured to break in upon , Sunday has been a day of leisure on the beach for years . On Saturday night , the hides , in every stage of progress , are carefully covered up , and not uncovered until Monday morning . On Sundays we had absolutely no work to do , unless it was to kill a bullock , which was sent down for our use about once a week , and sometimes came on Sunday . Another good arrangement was , that we had just so much work to do , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing this , we worked hard , and needed no driving . We " turned out " every morning at the first signs of daylight , and allowing a short time , about eight o'clock , for breakfast , generally got through our labor between one and two o'clock , when we dined , and had the rest of the time to ourselves ; until just before sundown , when we beat the dry hides and put them in the house , and covered over all the others . By this means we had about three hours to ourselves every afternoon ; and at sundown we had our supper , and our work was done for the day . There was no watch to stand , and no topsails to reef . The evenings we generally spent at one another 's houses , and I often went up and spent an hour or so at the oven ; which was called the " Kanaka Hotel , " and the " Oahu Coffee-house . " Immediately after dinner we usually took a short siesta to make up for our early rising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fancies . I generally read , wrote , and made or mended clothes ; for necessity , the mother of invention , had taught me these two latter arts . The Kanakas went up to the oven , and spent the time in sleeping , talking , and smoking ; and my messmate , Nicholas , who neither knew how to read or write , passed away the time by a long siesta , two or three smokes with his pipe , and a paseo to the other houses . This leisure time is never interfered with , for the captains know that the men earn it by working hard and fast , and that if they interfered with it , the men could easily make their twenty-five hides apiece last through the day . We were pretty independent , too , for the master of the house  --  " capitan de la casa "  --  had nothing to say to us , except when we were at work on the hides , and although we could not go up to the town without his permission , this was seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hides , which we were obliged to roll about in wheelbarrows ; the continual stooping upon those which were pegged out to be cleaned ; and the smell of the vats , into which we were often obliged to get , knee-deep , to press down the hides ; all made the work disagreeable and fatiguing ;  --  but we soon got hardened to it , and the comparative independence of our life reconciled us to it ; for there was nobody to haze us and find fault ; and when we got through , we had only to wash and change our clothes , and our time was our own . There was , however , one exception to the time 's being our own ; which was , that on two afternoons of every week we were obliged to go off and get wood , for the cook to use in the galley . Wood is very scarce in the vicinity of San Diego ; there being no trees of any size , for miles . In the town , the inhabitants burn the small wood which grows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large numbers , every few days . Fortunately , the climate is so fine that they had no need of a fire in their houses , and only use it for cooking . With us the getting of wood was a great trouble ; for all that in the vicinity of the houses had been cut down , and we were obliged to go off a mile or two , and to carry it some distance on our backs , as we could not get the hand-cart up the hills and over the uneven places . Two afternoons in the week , generally Monday and Thursday , as soon as we had got through dinner , we started off for the bush , each of us furnished with a hatchet and a long piece of rope , and dragging the hand-cart behind us , and followed by the whole colony of dogs , who were always ready for the bush , and were half mad whenever they saw our preparations . We went with the hand-cart as far as we could conveniently drag it , and leaving it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own course , and looking about for some good place to begin upon . Frequently , we had to go nearly a mile from the hand-cart before we could find any fit place . Having lighted upon a good thicket , the next thing was to clear away the under-brush , and have fair play at the trees . These trees are seldom more than five or six feet high , and the highest that I ever saw in these expeditions could not have been more than twelve ; so that , with lopping off the branches and clearing away the underwood , we had a good deal of cutting to do for a very little wood . Having cut enough for a " back-load , " the next thing was to make it well fast with the rope , and heaving the bundle upon our backs , and taking the hatchet in hand , to walk off , up hill and down dale , to the hand-cart . Two good back-loads apiece filled the hand-cart ; and that was each one 's proportion . When each had brought down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took our way again slowly back , and unloading , covering the hides for the night , and getting our supper , finished the day 's work . These wooding excursions had always a mixture of something rather pleasant in them . Roaming about in the woods with hatchet in hand , like a backwoodsman , followed by a troop of dogs ; starting up of birds , snakes , hares and foxes , and examining the various kinds of trees , flowers , and birds ' nests , was at least , a change from the monotonous drag and pull on shipboard . Frequently , too , we had some amusement and adventure . The coati , of which I have before spoken ,  --  a sort of mixture of the fox and wolf breeds ,  --  fierce little animals , with bushy tails and large heads , and a quick , sharp bark , abound here , as in all other parts of California . These , the dogs were very watchful for , and whenever they saw them , started off in full run after them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran finely , the rascals generally escaped . They are a match for the dog ,  --  - one to one ,  --  but as the dogs generally went in squads , there was seldom a fair fight . A smaller dog , belonging to us , once attacked a coati , single , and got a good deal worsted , and might perhaps have been killed had we not come to his assistance . We had , however , one dog which gave them a good deal of trouble , and many hard runs . He was a fine , tall fellow , and united strength and agility better than any dog that I have ever seen . He was born at the Islands , his father being an English mastiff , and his mother a greyhound . He had the high head , long legs , narrow body , and springing gait of the latter , and the heavy jaw , thick jowls , and strong fore-quarters of the mastiff . When he was brought to San Diego , an English sailor said that he looked , about the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once seen at the Tower ; and , indeed , there was something about him which resembled the portraits of the Duke . From this time he was christened " Welly , " and became the favorite and bully of the beach . He always led the dogs by several yards in the chase , and had killed two coati at different times in single combats . We often had fine sport with these fellows . A quick , sharp bark from a coati , and in an instant every dog was at the height of his speed . A few moments made up for an unfair start , and gave each dog his relative place . Welly , at the head , seemed almost to skim over the bushes ; and after him came Fanny , Feliciana , Childers , and the other fleet ones ,  --  the spaniels and terriers ; and then behind , followed the heavy corps  --  bulldogs , etc. , for we had every breed . Pursuit by us was in vain , and in about half an hour a few of them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs sometimes made prizes of rabbits and hares , which are very plentiful here , and great numbers of which we often shot for our dinners . There was another animal that I was not so much disposed to find amusement from , and that was the rattlesnake . These are very abundant here , especially during the spring of the year . The latter part of the time that I was on shore , I did not meet with so many , but for the first two months we seldom went into " the bush " without one of our number starting some of them . The first that I ever saw , I remember perfectly well . I had left my companions , and was beginning to clear away a fine clump of trees , when just in the midst of the thicket , not more than eight yards from me , one of these fellows set up his hiss . It is a sharp , continuous sound , and resembles very much the letting off of the steam from the small pipe of a steamboat , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the sound of an axe , that one of my companions was near , and called out to him , to let him know what I had fallen upon . He took it very lightly , and as he seemed inclined to laugh at me for being afraid , I determined to keep my place . I knew that so long as I could hear the rattle , I was safe , for these snakes never make a noise when they are in motion . Accordingly , I kept at my work , and the noise which I made with cutting and breaking the trees kept him in alarm ; so that I had the rattle to show me his whereabouts . Once or twice the noise stopped for a short time , which gave me a little uneasiness , and retreating a few steps , I threw something into the bush , at which he would set his rattle agoing ; and finding that he had not moved from his first place , I was easy again . In this way I continued at my work until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quiet for a moment . Having cut my load , I strapped it together , and got everything ready for starting . I felt that I could now call the others without the imputation of being afraid ; and went in search of them . In a few minutes we were all collected , and began an attack upon the bush . The big Frenchman , who was the one that I had called to at first , I found as little inclined to approach the snake as I had been . The dogs , too , seemed afraid of the rattle , and kept up a barking at a safe distance ; but the Kanakas showed no fear , and getting long sticks , went into the bush , and keeping a bright look-out , stood within a few feet of him . One or two blows struck near him , and a few stones thrown , started him , and we lost his track , and had the pleasant consciousness that he might be directly under our feet . By throwing stones and chips in different directions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another attack . This time we drove him into the clear ground , and saw him gliding off , with head and tail erect , when a stone , well aimed , knocked him over the bank , down a declivity of fifteen or twenty feet , and stretched him at his length . Having made sure of him , by a few more stones , we went down , and one of the Kanakas cut off his rattle . These rattles vary in number it is said , according to the age of the snake ; though the Indians think they indicate the number of creatures they have killed . We always preserved them as trophies , and at the end of the summer had quite a number . None of our people were ever bitten by them , but one of our dogs died of a bite , and another was supposed to have been bitten , but recovered . We had no remedy for the bite , though it was said that the Indians of the country had , and the Kanakas professed to have an herb which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the test . Hares and rabbits , as I said before , were abundant , and , during the winter months , the waters are covered with wild ducks and geese . Crows , too , were very numerous , and frequently alighted in great numbers upon our hides , picking at the pieces of dried meat and fat . Bears and wolves are numerous in the upper parts , and in the interior , ( and , indeed , a man was killed by a bear within a few miles of San Pedro , while we were there , ) but there were none in our immediate neighborhood . The only other animals were horses . Over a dozen of these were owned by different people on the beach , and were allowed to run loose among the hills , with a long lasso attached to them , and pick up feed wherever they could find it . We were sure of seeing them once a day , for there was no water among the hills , and they were obliged to come down to the well which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at , from two , to six and eight dollars apiece , and were held very much as common property . We generally kept one fast to one of the houses every day , so that we could mount him and catch any of the others . Some of them were really fine animals , and gave us many good runs up to the Presidio and over the country . CHAPTER XX LEISURE  --  NEWS FROM HOME  --  " BURNING THE WATER " After we had been a few weeks on shore , and had begun to feel broken into the regularity of our life , its monotony was interrupted by the arrival of two vessels from the windward . We were sitting at dinner in our little room , when we heard the cry of " Sail ho ! " This , we had learned , did not always signify a vessel , but was raised whenever a woman was seen coming down from the town ; or a squaw , or an ox-cart , or anything unusual , hove in sight upon the road ; so we took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and general from all parts of the beach , that we were led to go to the door ; and there , sure enough , were two sails coming round the point , and leaning over from the strong north-west wind , which blows down the coast every afternoon . The headmost was a ship , and the other , a brig . Everybody was alive on the beach , and all manner of conjectures were abroad . Some said it was the Pilgrim , with the Boston ship , which we were expecting ; but we soon saw that the brig was not the Pilgrim , and the ship with her stump top-gallant masts and rusty sides , could not be a dandy Boston Indiaman . As they drew nearer , we soon discovered the high poop and top-gallant forecastle , and other marks of the Italian ship Rosa , and the brig proved to be the Catalina , which we saw at Santa Barbara , just arrived from Valparaiso . They came to anchor , moored ship , and commenced discharging hides and tallow . The Rosa had purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the other spare one between ours and the Ayacucho 's , so that , now , each one was occupied , and the beach , for several days , was all alive . The Catalina had several Kanakas on board , who were immediately besieged by the others , and carried up to the oven , where they had a long pow-wow , and a smoke . Two Frenchmen , who belonged to the Rosa 's crew , came in , every evening , to see Nicholas ; and from them we learned that the Pilgrim was at San Pedro , and was the only other vessel now on the coast . Several of the Italians slept on shore at their hide-house ; and there , and at the tent in which the Fazio 's crew lived , we had some very good singing almost every evening . The Italians sang a variety of songs  --  barcarollas , provincial airs , etc. ; in several of which I recognized parts of our favorite operas and sentimental songs . They often joined in a song , taking all the different parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had good voices , and all seemed to sing with spirit and feeling . One young man , in particular , had a falsetto as clear as a clarionet . The greater part of the crews of the vessels came ashore every evening , and we passed the time in going about from one house to another , and listening to all manner of languages . The Spanish was the common ground upon which we all met ; for every one knew more or less of that . We had now , out of forty or fifty , representatives from almost every nation under the sun : two Englishmen , three Yankees , two Scotchmen , two Welshmen , one Irishman , three Frenchmen ( two of whom were Normans , and the third from Gascony , ) one Dutchman , one Austrian , two or three Spaniards , ( from old Spain , ) half a dozen Spanish-Americans and half-breeds , two native Indians from Chili and the Island of Chiloe , one Negro , one Mulatto , about twenty Italians , from all parts of Italy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanaka from the Marquesas Islands . The night before the vessels were ready to sail , all the Europeans united and had an entertainment at the Rosa 's hide-house , and we had songs of every nation and tongue . A German gave us " Och ! mein lieber Augustin ! " the three Frenchmen roared through the Marseilles Hymn ; the English and Scotchmen gave us " Rule Britannia , " and " Wha 'll be King but Charlie ? " the Italians and Spaniards screamed through some national affairs , for which I was none the wiser ; and we three Yankees made an attempt at the " Star-spangled Banner . " After these national tributes had been paid , the Austrian gave us a very pretty little love-song , and the Frenchmen sang a spirited thing called " Sentinelle ! O prenez garde a vous ! " and then followed the melange which might have been expected . When I left them , the aguardiente and annisou was pretty well in their heads , and they were all singing and talking at once , and their peculiar national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the two vessels got under weigh for the windward , and left us in quiet possession of the beach . Our numbers were somewhat enlarged by the opening of the new houses , and the society of the beach a little changed . In charge of the Catalina 's house , was an old Scotchman , who , like most of his countrymen , had a pretty good education , and , like many of them , was rather pragmatical , and had a ludicrously solemn conceit . He employed his time in taking care of his pigs , chickens , turkeys , dogs , etc. , and in smoking his long pipe . Everything was as neat as a pin in the house , and he was as regular in his hours as a chronometer , but as he kept very much by himself , was not a great addition to our society . He hardly spent a cent all the time he was on the beach , and the others said he was no shipmate . He had been a petty officer on board the British frigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ideas of his own importance . The man in charge of the Rosa 's house was an Austrian by birth , but spoke , read , and wrote four languages with ease and correctness . German was his native tongue , but being born near the borders of Italy , and having sailed out of Genoa , the Italian was almost as familiar to him as his own language . He was six years on board of an English man-of-war , where he learned to speak our language with ease , and also to read and write it . He had been several years in Spanish vessels , and had acquired that language so well , that he could read any books in it . He was between forty and fifty years of age , and was a singular mixture of the man-of-war's-man and Puritan . He talked a great deal about propriety and steadiness , and gave good advice to the youngsters and Kanakas , but seldom went up to the town , without coming down " three sheets in the wind . " One holyday , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the town , and got so cozy , talking over old stories and giving one another good advice , that they came down double-backed , on a horse , and both rolled off into the sand as soon as the horse stopped . This put an end to their pretensions , and they never heard the last of it from the rest of the men . On the night of the entertainment at the Rosa 's house , I saw old Schmidt , ( that was the Austrian 's name ) standing up by a hogshead , holding on by both hands , and calling out to himself  --  " Hold on , Schmidt ! hold on , my good fellow , or you 'll be on your back ! " Still , he was an intelligent , good-natured old fellow , and had a chest-full of books , which he willingly lent me to read . In the same house with him was a Frenchman and an Englishman ; the latter a regular-built " man-of-war Jack ; " a thorough seaman ; a hearty , generous fellow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolute dog . He made it a point to get drunk once a fortnight , ( when he always managed to sleep on the road , and have his money stolen from him , ) and to battle the Frenchman once a week . These , with a Chilian , and a half a dozen Kanakas , formed the addition to our company . In about six weeks from the time when the Pilgrim sailed , we had got all the hides which she left us cured and stowed away ; and having cleared up the ground , and emptied the vats , and set everything in order , had nothing more to do until she should come down again , but to supply ourselves with wood . Instead of going twice a week for this purpose , we determined to give one whole week to getting wood , and then we should have enough to last us half through the summer . Accordingly , we started off every morning , after an early breakfast , with our hatchets in hand , and cut wood until the sun was over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as there was not a watch on the beach  --  and then came back to dinner , and after dinner , started off again with our hand-cart and ropes , and carted and " backed " it down , until sunset . This , we kept up for a week , until we had collected several cords ,  --  enough to last us for six or eight weeks  --  when we " knocked off " altogether , much to my joy ; for , though I liked straying in the woods , and cutting , very well , yet the backing the wood for so great a distance , over an uneven country , was , without exception , the hardest work I had ever done . I usually had to kneel down and contrive to heave the load , which was well strapped together , upon my back , and then rise up and start off with it up the hills and down the vales , sometimes through thickets ,  --  the rough points sticking into the skin , and tearing the clothes , so that , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt to my back . We were now through all our work , and had nothing more to do until the Pilgrim should come down again . We had nearly got through our provisions too , as well as our work ; for our officer had been very wasteful of them , and the tea , flour , sugar , and molasses , were all gone . We suspected him of sending them up to the town ; and he always treated the squaws with molasses , when they came down to the beach . Finding wheat-coffee and dry bread rather poor living , we dubbed together , and I went up to the town on horseback with a great salt-bag behind the saddle , and a few reals in my pocket , and brought back the bag full of onions , pears , beans , water-melons , and other fruits ; for the young woman who tended the garden , finding that I belonged to the American ship , and that we were short of provisions , put in a double portion . With these we lived like fighting-cocks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the sailors call " a blow-out on sleep ; " not turning out in the morning until breakfast was ready . I employed several days in overhauling my chest , and mending up all my old clothes , until I had got everything in order  --  patch upon patch , like a sand-barge 's mainsail . Then I took hold of Bowditch 's Navigator , which I had always with me . I had been through the greater part of it , and now went carefully through it , from beginning to end working out most of the examples . That done , and there being no signs of the Pilgrim , I made a descent upon old Schmidt , and borrowed and read all the books there were upon the beach . Such a dearth was there of these latter articles , that anything , even a little child 's story-book , or the half of a shipping calendar , appeared like a treasure . I actually read a jest-book through , from beginning to end , in one day , as I should a novel , and enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were no more to be got , I found , at the bottom of old Schmidt 's chest , " Mandeville , a Romance , by Godwin , in five volumes . " This I had never read , but Godwin 's name was enough , and after the wretched trash I had devoured , anything bearing the name of a distinguished intellectual man , was a prize indeed . I bore it off , and for two days I was up early and late , reading with all my might , and actually drinking in delight . It is no extravagance to say that it was like a spring in a desert land . From the sublime to the ridiculous  --  so with me , from Mandeville to hide-curing , was but a step ; for Wednesday , July 18th , brought us the brig Pilgrim from the windward . As she came in , we found that she was a good deal altered in her appearance . Her short top-gallant masts were up ; her bowlines all unrove ( except to the courses ) ; the quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; several blocks got rid of ; running-rigging rove in new places ; and numberless other changes of the same character . Then , too , there was a new voice giving orders , and a new face on the quarter-deck ,  --  a short , dark-complexioned man , in a green jacket and a high leather cap . These changes , of course , set the whole beach on the qui-vive , and we were all waiting for the boat to come ashore , that we might have things explained . At length , after the sails were furled and the anchor carried out , the boat pulled ashore , and the news soon flew that the expected ship had arrived at Santa Barbara , and that Captain T  --   --  had taken command of her , and her captain , Faucon , had taken the Pilgrim , and was the green-jacketed man on the quarter-deck . The boat put directly off again , without giving us time to ask any more questions , and we were obliged to wait till night , when we took a little skiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I stepped aboard , the second mate called me aft , and gave me a large bundle , directed to me , and marked " Ship Alert . " This was what I had longed for , yet I refrained from opening it until I went ashore . Diving down into the forecastle , I found the same old crew , and was really glad to see them again . Numerous inquiries passed as to the new ship , the latest news from Boston , etc. , etc . S  --   --  had received letters from home , and nothing remarkable had happened . The Alert was agreed on all hands to be a fine ship , and a large one : " Larger than the Rosa "  --  " Big enough to carry off all the hides in California "  --  " Rail as high as a man 's head "  --  " A crack ship "  --  " A regular dandy , " etc. , etc . Captain T  --   --  took command of her , and she went directly up to Monterey ; from thence she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in San Diego under two or three months . Some of the Pilgrim 's crew found old ship-mates aboard of her , and spent an hour or two in her forecastle , the evening before she sailed . They said her decks were as white as snow  --  holy-stoned every morning , like a man-of-war 's ; everything on board " shipshape and Bristol fashion ; " a fine crew , three mates , a sailmaker and carpenter , and all complete . " They 've got a man for mate of that ship , and not a bloody sheep about decks ! "  --  " A mate that knows his duty , and makes everybody do theirs , and wo n't be imposed upon either by captain or crew . " After collecting all the information we could get on this point , we asked something about their new captain . He had hardly been on board long enough for them to know much about him , but he had taken hold strong , as soon as he took command ;  --  sending down the top-gallant masts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having got all the news we could , we pulled ashore ; and as soon as we reached the house , I , as might be supposed , proceeded directly to opening my bundle , and found a reasonable supply of duck , flannel shirts , shoes , etc. , and , what was still more valuable , a packet of eleven letters . These I sat up nearly all the night to read , and put them carefully away , to be read and re-read again and again at my leisure . Then came a half a dozen newspapers , the last of which gave notice of Thanksgiving , and of the clearance of " ship Alert , Edward H. Faucon , master , for Callao and California , by Bryant , Sturgis &; Co . " No one has ever been on distant voyages , and after a long absence received a newspaper from home , who can not understand the delight that they give one . I read every part of them  --  the houses to let ; things lost or stolen ; auction sales , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes you feel so perfectly at home , as a newspaper . The very name of " Boston Daily Advertiser " " sounded hospitably upon the ear . " The Pilgrim discharged her hides , which set us at work again , and in a few days we were in the old routine of dry hides  --  wet hides  --  cleaning  --  beating , etc . Captain Faucon came quietly up to me , as I was at work , with my knife , cutting the meat from a dirty hide , asked me how I liked California , and repeated  --  " Tityre , tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi . " Very apropos , thought I , and , at the same time , serves to show that you understand Latin . However , a kind word from a captain is a thing not to be slighted ; so I answered him civilly , and made the most of it . Saturday , July 11th . The Pilgrim set sail for the windward , and left us to go on in our old way . Having laid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now long , and invariably pleasant , we had a good deal of time to ourselves . All the duck I received from home , I soon made up into trowsers and frocks , and displayed , every Sunday , a complete suit of my own make , from head to foot , having formed the remnants of the duck into a cap . Reading , mending , sleeping , with occasional excursions into the bush , with the dogs , in search of coati , hares , and rabbits , or to encounter a rattlesnake , and now and then a visit to the Presidio , filled up our spare time after hide-curing was over for the day . Another amusement , which we sometimes indulged in , was " burning the water " for craw-fish . For this purpose , we procured a pair of grains , with a long staff like a harpoon , and making torches with tarred rope twisted round a long pine stick , took the only boat on the beach , a small skiff , and with a torch-bearer in the bow , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side with the grains , went off , on dark nights , to burn the water . This is fine sport . Keeping within a few rods of the shore , where the water is not more than three or four feet deep , with a clear sandy bottom , the torches light everything up so that one could almost have seen a pin among the grains of sand . The craw-fish are an easy prey , and we used soon to get a load of them . The other fish were more difficult to catch , yet we frequently speared a number of them , of various kinds and sizes . The Pilgrim brought us down a supply of fish-hooks , which we had never had before , on the beach , and for several days we went down to the Point , and caught a quantity of cod and mackerel . On one of these expeditions , we saw a battle between two Sandwich Islanders and a shark . " Johnny " had been playing about our boat for some time , driving away the fish , and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a few moments heard a great shouting between two Kanakas who were fishing on the rock opposite to us : " E hana hana make i ka in nui ! " " E pii mai Aikane ! " etc. , etc. ; and saw them pulling away on a stout line , and " Johnny Shark " floundering at the other end . The line soon broke ; but the Kanakas would not let him off so easily , and sprang directly into the water after him . Now came the tug of war . Before we could get into deep water , one of them seized him by the tail , and ran up with him upon the beach ; but Johnny twisted round , turning his head under his body , and , showing his teeth in the vicinity of the Kanaka 's hand , made him let go and spring out of the way . The shark now turned tail and made the best of his way , by flapping and floundering , toward deep water ; but here again , before he was fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made a spring towards the beach , his companion at the same time paying away upon him with stones and a large stick . As soon , however , as the shark could turn , he was obliged to let go his hold ; but the instant he made toward deep water , they were both behind him , watching their chance to seize him . In this way the battle went on for some time , the shark , in a rage , splashing and twisting about , and the Kanakas , in high excitement , yelling at the top of their voices ; but the shark at last got off , carrying away a hook and liner and not a few severe bruises . CHAPTER XXI CALIFORNIA AND ITS INHABITANTS We kept up a constant connection with the Presidio , and by the close of the summer I had added much to my vocabulary , beside having made the acquaintance of nearly everybody in the place , and acquired some knowledge of the character and habits of the people , as well as of the institutions under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Cortes , and was subsequently visited by numerous other adventurers as well as commissioned voyagers of the Spanish crown . It was found to be inhabited by numerous tribes of Indians , and to be in many parts extremely fertile ; to which , of course , was added rumors of gold mines , pearl fishery , etc . No sooner was the importance of the country known , than the Jesuits obtained leave to establish themselves in it , to Christianize and enlighten the Indians . They established missions in various parts of the country toward the close of the seventeenth century , and collected the natives about them , baptizing them into the church , and teaching them the arts of civilized life . To protect the Jesuits in their missions , and at the same time to support the power of the crown over the civilized Indians , two forts were erected and garrisoned , one at San Diego , and the other at Monterey . These were called Presidios , and divided the command of the whole country between them . Presidios have since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country into four large districts , each with its presidio , and governed by the commandant . The soldiers , for the most part , married civilized Indians ; and thus , in the vicinity of each presidio , sprung up , gradually , small towns . In the course of time , vessels began to come into the ports to trade with the missions , and received hides in return ; and thus began the great trade of California . Nearly all the cattle in the country belonged to the missions , and they employed their Indians , who became , in fact , their slaves , in tending their vast herds . In the year 1793 , when Vancouver visited San Diego , the mission had obtained great wealth and power , and are accused of having depreciated the country with the sovereign , that they might be allowed to retain their possessions . On the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Spanish dominions , the missions passed into the hands of the Franciscans , though without any essential change in their management . Ever since the independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until , at last , a law was passed , stripping them of all their possessions , and confining the priests to their spiritual duties ; and at the same time declaring all the Indians free and independent Rancheros . The change in the condition of the Indians was , as may be supposed , only nominal : they are virtually slaves , as much as they ever were . But in the missions , the change was complete . The priests have now no power , except in their religious character , and the great possessions of the missions are given over to be preyed upon by the harpies of the civil power , who are sent there in the capacity of administradores , to settle up the concerns ; and who usually end , in a few years , by making themselves fortunes , and leaving their stewardships worse than they found them . The dynasty of the priests was much more acceptable to the people of the country , and indeed , to every one concerned with the country , by trade or otherwise , than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , and felt the necessity of keeping up its credit . Accordingly , their debts were regularly paid , and the people were , in the main , well treated , and attached to those who had spent their whole lives among them . But the administradores are strangers sent from Mexico , having no interest in the country ; not identified in any way with their charge , and , for the most part , men of desperate fortunes  --  broken down politicians and soldiers  --  whose only object is to retrieve their condition in as short a time as possible . The change had been made but a few years before our arrival upon the coast , yet , in that short time , the trade was much diminished , credit impaired , and the venerable missions going rapidly to decay . The external arrangements remain the same . There are four presidios , having under their protection the various missions , and pueblos , which are towns formed by the civil power , and containing no mission or presidio . The most northerly presidio is San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the mission of the same , St. Louis Obispo , and St. Buenaventura , which is the finest mission in the whole country , having very fertile soil and rich vineyards . The last , and most southerly , is San Diego , including the mission of the same , San Juan Campestrano , the Pueblo de los Angelos , the largest town in California , with the neighboring mission of San Gabriel . The priests in spiritual matters are subject to the Archbishop of Mexico , and in temporal matters to the governor-general , who is the great civil and military head of the country . The government of the country is an arbitrary democracy ; having no common law , and no judiciary . Their only laws are made and unmade at the caprice of the legislature , and are as variable as the legislature itself . They pass through the form of sending representatives to the congress at Mexico , but as it takes several months to go and return , and there is very little communication between the capital and this distant province , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that there will be revolutions at home before he can write and receive an answer ; if another member should be sent , he has only to challenge him , and decide the contested election in that way . Revolutions are matters of constant occurrence in California . They are got up by men who are at the foot of the ladder and in desperate circumstances , just as a new political party is started by such men in our own country . The only object , of course , is the loaves and fishes ; and instead of caucusing , paragraphing , libelling , feasting , promising , and lying , as with us , they take muskets and bayonets , and seizing upon the presidio and custom-house , divide the spoils , and declare a new dynasty . As for justice , they know no law but will and fear . A Yankee , who had been naturalized , and become a Catholic , and had married in the country , was sitting in his house at the Pueblo de los Angelos , with his wife and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficulty , entered the house , and stabbed him to the heart before them all . The murderer was seized by some Yankees who had settled there , and kept in confinement until a statement of the whole affair could be sent to the governor-general . He refused to do anything about it , and the countrymen of the murdered man , seeing no prospect of justice being administered , made known that if nothing was done , they should try the man themselves . It chanced that , at this time , there was a company of forty trappers and hunters from Kentucky , with their rifles , who had made their head-quarters at the Pueblo ; and these , together with the Americans and Englishmen in the place , who were between twenty and thirty in number , took possession of the town , and waiting a reasonable time , proceeded to try the man according to the forms in their own country . A judge and jury were appointed , and he was tried , convicted , sentenced to be shot , and carried out before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the men were then put into a hat and each one pledging himself to perform his duty , twelve names were drawn out , and the men took their stations with their rifles , and , firing at the word , laid him dead . He was decently buried , and the place was restored quietly to the proper authorities . A general , with titles enough for an hidalgo , was at San Gabriel , and issued a proclamation as long as the fore-top-bowline , threatening destruction to the rebels , but never stirred from his fort ; for forty Kentucky hunters , with their rifles , were a match for a whole regiment of hungry , drawling , lazy half-breeds . This affair happened while we were at San Pedro , ( the port of the Pueblo , ) and we had all the particulars directly from those who were on the spot . A few months afterwards , another man , whom we had often seen in San Diego , murdered a man and his wife on the high road between the Pueblo and San Louis Rey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in this case , the parties being all natives , nothing was done about it ; and I frequently afterwards saw the murderer in San Diego , where he was living with his wife and family . When a crime has been committed by Indians , justice , or rather vengeance , is not so tardy . One Sunday afternoon , while I was at San Diego , an Indian was sitting on his horse , when another , with whom he had had some difficulty , came up to him , drew a long knife , and plunged it directly into the horse 's heart . The Indian sprang from his falling horse , drew out the knife , and plunged it into the other Indian 's breast , over his shoulder , and laid him dead . The poor fellow was seized at once , clapped into the calabozo , and kept there until an answer could be received from Monterey . A few weeks afterwards , I saw the poor wretch , sitting on the bare ground , in front of the calabozo , with his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew there was very little hope for him . Although the deed was done in hot blood , the horse on which he was sitting being his own , and a great favorite , yet he was an Indian , and that was enough . In about a week after I saw him , I heard that he had been shot . These few instances will serve to give one a notion of the distribution of justice in California . In their domestic relations , these people are no better than in their public . The men are thriftless , proud , and extravagant , and very much given to gaming ; and the women have but little education , and a good deal of beauty , and their morality , of course , is none of the best ; yet the instances of infidelity are much less frequent than one would at first suppose . In fact , one vice is set over against another ; and thus , something like a balance is obtained . The women have but little virtue , but then the jealousy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certain . A few inches of cold steel has been the punishment of many an unwary man , who has been guilty , perhaps , of nothing more than indiscretion of manner . The difficulties of the attempt are numerous , and the consequences of discovery fatal . With the unmarried women , too , great watchfulness is used . The main object of the parents is to marry their daughters well , and to this , the slightest slip would be fatal . The sharp eyes of a duena , and the cold steel of a father or brother , are a protection which the characters of most of them  --  men and women  --  render by no means useless ; for the very men who would lay down their lives to avenge the dishonor of their own family , would risk the same lives to complete the dishonor of another . Of the poor Indians , very little care is taken . The priests , indeed , at the missions , are said to keep them very strictly , and some rules are usually made by the alcaldes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but little . Indeed , to show the entire want of any sense of morality or domestic duty among them , I have frequently known an Indian to bring his wife , to whom he was lawfully married in the church , down to the beach , and carry her back again , dividing with her the money which she had got from the sailors . If any of the girls were discovered by the alcalde to be open evil-livers , they were whipped , and kept at work sweeping the square of the presidio , and carrying mud and bricks for the buildings ; yet a few reals would generally buy them off . Intemperance , too , is a common vice among the Indians . The Spaniards , on the contrary , are very abstemious , and I do not remember ever having seen a Spaniard intoxicated . Such are the people who inhabit a country embracing four or five hundred miles of sea-coast , with several good harbors ; with fine forests in the north ; the waters filled with fish , and the plains covered with thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than which there can be no better in the world ; free from all manner of diseases , whether epidemic or endemic ; and with a soil in which corn yields from seventy to eighty fold . In the hands of an enterprising people , what a country this might be ! we are ready to say . Yet how long would a people remain so , in such a country ? The Americans ( as those from the United States are called ) and Englishmen , who are fast filling up the principal towns , and getting the trade into their hands , are indeed more industrious and effective than the Spaniards ; yet their children are brought up Spaniards , in every respect , and if the " California fever " ( laziness ) spares the first generation , it always attacks the second . CHAPTER XXII LIFE ON SHORE  --  THE ALERT Saturday , July 18th . This day , sailed the Mexican hermaphrodite brig , Fazio , for San Blas and Mazatlan . This was the brig which was driven ashore at San Pedro in a south-easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take in her cargo . The owner of her had had a good deal of difficulty with the government about the duties , etc. , and her sailing had been delayed for several weeks ; but everything having been arranged , she got under weigh with a light breeze , and was floating out of the harbor , when two horsemen came dashing down to the beach , at full speed , and tried to find a boat to put off after her ; but there being none on the beach , they offered a handful of silver to any Kanaka who would swim off and take a letter on board . One of the Kanakas , a fine , active , well-made young fellow , instantly threw off everything but his duck trowsers , and putting the letter into his hat , swam off , after the vessel . Fortunately , the wind was very light and the vessel was going slowly , so that , although she was nearly a mile off when he started , he gained on her rapidly . He went through the water leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw such swimming before . They saw him coming from the deck , but did not heave-to , suspecting the nature of his errand ; yet , the wind continuing light , he swam alongside and got on board , and delivered his letter . The captain read the letter , told the Kanaka there was no answer , and giving him a glass of brandy , left him to jump overboard and find the best of his way to the shore . The Kanaka swam in for the nearest point of land , and , in about an hour , made his appearance at the hide-house . He did not seem at all fatigued , had made three or four dollars , got a glass of brandy , and was in fine spirits . The brig kept on her course , and the government officers , who had come down to forbid her sailing , went back , each with something like a flea in his ear , having depended upon extorting a little more money from the owner . It was now nearly three months since the Alert arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . About a half a mile behind the hide-house , was a high hill ; and every afternoon , as soon as we had done our work , some one of us walked up to see if there were any sail in sight , coming down before the regular trades , which blow every afternoon . Each day , after the latter part of July , we went up the hill , and came back disappointed . I was anxious for her arrival , for I had been told by letter that the owners in Boston , at the request of my friends , had written to Captain T  --   --  to take me on board the Alert , in case she returned to the United States before the Pilgrim ; and I , of course , wished to know whether the order had been received , and what was the destination of the ship . One year more or less might be of small consequence to others , but it was everything to me . It was now just a year since we sailed from Boston , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under eight or nine months , which would make our absence two years in all . This would be pretty long , but would not be fatal . It would not necessarily be decisive of my future life . But one year more would settle the matter . I should be a sailor for life ; and although I had made up my mind to it before I had my letters from home , and was , as I thought , quite satisfied ; yet , as soon as an opportunity was held out to me of returning , and the prospect of another kind of life was opened to me , my anxiety to return , and , at least , to have the chance of deciding upon my course for myself , was beyond measure . Beside that , I wished to be " equal to either fortune , " and to qualify myself for an officer 's berth , and a hide-house was no place to learn seamanship in . I had become experienced in hide-curing , and everything went on smoothly , and I had many opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reading and studying navigation ; yet practical seamanship could only be got on board ship ; therefore , I determined to ask to be taken on board the ship when she arrived . By the first of August , we finished curing all our hides , stored them away , cleaned out our vats , ( in which latter work we spent two days , up to our knees in mud and the sediments of six months ' hide-curing , in a stench which would drive a donkey from his breakfast , ) and got in readiness for the arrival of the ship , and had another leisure interval of three or four weeks ; which I spent , as usual , in reading , writing , studying , making and mending my clothes , and getting my wardrobe in complete readiness , in case I should go on board the ship ; and in fishing , ranging the woods with the dogs , and in occasional visits to the presidio and mission . A good deal of my time was spent in taking care of a little puppy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within three days of one another , at our house . He was a fine , promising pup , with four white paws , and all the rest of his body of a dark brown . I built a little kennel for him , and kept him fastened there , away from the other dogs , feeding and disciplining him myself . In a few weeks , I got him in complete subjection , and he grew finely , was very much attached to me , and bid fair to be one of the leading dogs on the beach . I called him Bravo , and the only thing I regretted at the thought of leaving the beach , was parting with him . Day after day , we went up the hill , but no ship was to be seen , and we began to form all sorts of conjectures as to her whereabouts ; and the theme of every evening 's conversation at the different houses , and in our afternoon 's paseo upon the beach , was the ship  --  where she could be  --  had she been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring , etc. , etc . Tuesday , August 25th . This morning , the officer in charge of our house went off beyond the point a fishing , in a small canoe , with two Kanakas ; and we were sitting quietly in our room at the hide-house , when , just before noon , we heard a complete yell of " Sail ho ! " breaking out from all parts of the beach , at once ,  --  from the Kanakas ' oven to the Rosa 's house . In an instant , every one was out of his house ; and there was a fine , tall ship , with royals and skysails set , bending over before the strong afternoon breeze , and coming rapidly round the point . Her yards were braced sharp up ; every sail was set , and drew well ; the Yankee ensign was flying from her mizen-peak ; and having the tide in her favor , she came up like a race-horse . It was nearly six months since a new vessel had entered San Diego , and of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine appearance . Her light sails were taken in , as she passed the low , sandy tongue of land , and clewing up her head sails , she rounded handsomely to , under her mizen topsail , and let go the anchor at about a cable 's length from the shore . In a few minutes , the topsail yards were manned , and all three of the topsails furled at once . From the fore top-gallant yard , the men slid down the stay to furl the jib , and from the mizen top-gallant yard , by the stay , into the maintop , and thence to the yard ; and the men on the topsail yards came down the lifts to the yard-arms of the courses . The sails were furled with great care , the bunts triced up by jiggers , and the jibs stowed in cloth . The royal yards were then struck , tackles got upon the yard-arms and the stay , the long-boat hoisted out , a large anchor carried astern , and the ship moored . Then the captain 's gig was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew of fine lads , between the ages of fourteen and eighteen , pulled the captain ashore . The gig was a light whale-boat , handsomely painted , and fitted up with cushions , etc. , in the stern sheets . We immediately attacked the boat 's crew , and got very thick with them in a few minutes . We had much to ask about Boston , their passage out , etc. , and they were very curious to know about the life we were leading upon the beach . One of them offered to exchange with me ; which was just what I wanted ; and we had only to get the permission of the captain . After dinner , the crew began discharging their hides , and , as we had nothing to do at the hide-houses , we were ordered aboard to help them . I had now my first opportunity of seeing the ship which I hoped was to be my home for the next year . She looked as well on board as she did from without . Her decks were wide and roomy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which disfigures the after part of most of our vessels , ) flush , fore and aft , and as white as snow , which the crew told us was from constant use of holystones . There was no foolish gilding and gingerbread work , to take the eye of landsmen and passengers , but everything was " ship-shape and Bristol fashion . " There was no rust , no dirt , no rigging hanging slack , no fag ends of ropes and " Irish pendants " aloft , and the yards were squared " to a t " by lifts and braces . The mate was a fine , hearty , noisy fellow , with a voice like a lion , and always wide awake . He was " a man , every inch of him , " as the sailors said ; and though " a bit of a horse , " and " a hard customer , " yet he was generally liked by the crew . There was also a second and third mate , a carpenter , sailmaker , steward , cook , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had , on board , seven thousand hides , which she had collected at the windward , and also horns and tallow . All these we began discharging , from both gangways at once , into the two boats , the second mate having charge of the launch , and the third mate of the pinnace . For several days , we were employed in this way , until all the hides were taken out , when the crew began taking in ballast , and we returned to our old work , hide-curing . Saturday , Aug. 29th . Arrived , brig Catalina , from the windward . Sunday , 30th . This was the first Sunday that the crew had been in San Diego , and of course they were all for going up to see the town . The Indians came down early , with horses to let for the day , and all the crew , who could obtain liberty , went off to the Presidio and mission , and did not return until night . I had seen enough of San Diego , and went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom I found quietly at work in the forecastle , mending and washing their clothes , and reading and writing . They told me that the ship stopped at Callao in the passage out , and there lay three weeks . She had a passage of little over eighty days from Boston to Callao , which is one of the shortest on record . There , they left the Brandywine frigate , and other smaller American ships of war , and the English frigate Blonde , and a French seventy-four . From Callao they came directly to California , and had visited every port on the coast , including San Francisco . The forecastle in which they lived was large , tolerably well lighted by bulls-eyes , and , being kept perfectly clean , had quite a comfortable appearance ; at least , it was far better than the little , black , dirty hole in which I had lived so many months on board the Pilgrim . By the regulations of the ship , the forecastle was cleaned out every morning , and the crew , being very neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as having a large spitbox always under the steps and between the bits , and obliging every man to hang up his wet clothes , etc . In addition to this , it was holystoned every Saturday morning . In the after part of the ship was a handsome cabin , a dining-room , and a trade-room , fitted out with shelves and furnished with all sorts of goods . Between these and the forecastle was the " between-decks , " as high as the gun deck of a frigate ; being six feet and a half , under the beams . These between-decks were holystoned regularly , and kept in the most perfect order ; the carpenter 's bench and tools being in one part , the sailmaker 's in another , and boatswain 's locker , with the spare rigging , in a third . A part of the crew slept here , in hammocks swung fore and aft from the beams , and triced up every morning . The sides of the between-decks were clapboarded , the knees and stanchions of iron , and the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight as a drum , and a fine sea boat , her only fault being , that of most fast ships ,  --  that she was wet , forward . When she was going , as she sometimes would , eight or nine knots on a wind , there would not be a dry spot forward of the gangway . The men told great stories of her sailing , and had great confidence in her as a " lucky ship . " She was seven years old , and had always been in the Canton trade , and never had met with an accident of any consequence , and had never made a passage that was not shorter than the average . The third mate , a young man of about eighteen years of age , nephew of one of the owners , had been in the ship from a small boy , and " believed in the ship ; " and the chief mate thought more of her than he would of a wife and family . The ship lay about a week longer in port , when , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get under weigh . I now made my application to the captain to go on board . He told me that I could go home in the ship when she sailed ( which I knew before ) ; and , finding that I wished to be on board while she was on the coast , said he had no objection , if I could find one of my own age to exchange with me , for the time . This , I easily accomplished , for they were glad to change the scene by a few months on shore , and , moreover , escape the winter and the south-easters ; and I went on board the next day , with my chest and hammock , and found myself once more afloat . CHAPTER XXIII NEW SHIP AND SHIPMATES  --  MY WATCHMATE Tuesday , Sept. 8th . This was my first day 's duty on board the ship ; and though a sailor 's life is a sailor 's life wherever it may be , yet I found everything very different here from the customs of the brig Pilgrim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes and a half were allowed for every man to dress and come on deck , and if any were longer than that , they were sure to be overhauled by the mate , who was always on deck , and making himself heard all over the ship . The head-pump was then rigged , and the decks washed down by the second and third mates ; the chief mate walking the quarter-deck and keeping a general supervision , but not deigning to touch a bucket or a brush . Inside and out , fore and aft , upper deck and between decks , steerage and forecastle , rail , bulwarks , and water-ways , were washed , scrubbed and scraped with brooms and canvas , and the decks were wet and sanded all over , and then holy-stoned . The holystone is a large , soft stone , smooth on the bottom , with long ropes attached to each end , by which the crew keep it sliding fore and aft , over the wet , sanded decks . Smaller hand-stones , which the sailors call " prayer-books , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , where the large holystone will not go . An hour or two , we were kept at this work , when the head-pump was manned , and all the sand washed off the decks and sides . Then came swabs and squilgees ; and after the decks were dry , each one went to his particular morning job . There were five boats belonging to the ship ,  --  launch , pinnace , jolly-boat , larboard quarter-boat , and gig ,  --  each of which had a coxswain , who had charge of it , and was answerable for the order and cleanness of it . The rest of the cleaning was divided among the crew ; one having the brass and composition work about the capstan ; another the bell , which was of brass , and kept as bright as a gilt button ; a third , the harness-cask ; another , the man-rope stanchions ; others , the steps of the forecastle and hatchways , which were hauled up and holystoned . Each of these jobs must be finished before breakfast ; and , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cook scraped his kids ( wooden tubs out of which the sailors eat ) and polished the hoops , and placed them before the galley , to await inspection . When the decks were dry , the lord paramount made his appearance on the quarter-deck , and took a few turns , when eight bells were struck , and all hands went to breakfast . Half an hour was allowed for breakfast , when all hands were called again ; the kids , pots , bread-bags , etc. , stowed away ; and , this morning , preparations were made for getting under weigh . We paid out on the chain by which we swung ; hove in on the other ; catted the anchor ; and hove short on the first . This work was done in shorter time than was usual on board the brig ; for though everything was more than twice as large and heavy , the cat-block being as much as a man could lift , and the chain as large as three of the Pilgrim 's , yet there was a plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , more men , and more good will . Every one seemed ambitious to do his best : officers and men knew their duty , and all went well . As soon as she was hove short , the mate , on the forecastle , gave the order to loose the sails , and , in an instant , every one sprung into the rigging , up the shrouds , and out on the yards , scrambling by one another ,  --  the first up the best fellow ,  --  cast off the yard-arm gaskets and bunt gaskets , and one man remained on each yard , holding the bunt jigger with a turn round the tye , all ready to let go , while the rest laid down to man the sheets and halyards . The mate then hailed the yards  --  " All ready forward ? "  --  " All ready the cross-jack yards ? " etc. , etc. , and " Aye , aye , sir ! " being returned from each , the word was given to let go ; and in the twinkling of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bare yards , was covered with her loose canvas , from the royal-mast-heads to the decks . Every one then laid down , except one man in each top , to overhaul the rigging , and the topsails were hoisted and sheeted home ; all three yards going to the mast-head at once , the larboard watch hoisting the fore , the starboard watch the main , and five light hands , ( of whom I was one , ) picked from the two watches , the mizen . The yards were then trimmed , the anchor weighed , the cat-block hooked on , the fall stretched out , manned by " all hands and the cook , " and the anchor brought to the head with " cheerily men ! " in full chorus . The ship being now under weigh , the light sails were set , one after another , and she was under full sail , before she had passed the sandy point . The fore royal , which fell to my lot , ( being in the mate 's watch , ) was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I could handle the brig 's easily , I found my hands full , with this , especially as there were no jacks to the ship ; everything being for neatness , and nothing left for Jack to hold on by , but his eyelids . As soon as we were beyond the point , and all sail out , the order was given , " Go below the watch ! " and the crew said that , ever since they had been on the coast , they had had " watch and watch , " while going from port to port ; and , in fact , everything showed that , though strict discipline was kept , and the utmost was required of every man , in the way of his duty , yet , on the whole , there was very good usage on board . Each one knew that he must be a man , and show himself smart when at his duty , yet every one was satisfied with the usage ; and a contented crew , agreeing with one another , and finding no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-used , dissatisfied , grumbling , desponding crew of the Pilgrim . It being the turn of our watch to go below , the men went to work , mending their clothes , and doing other little things for themselves ; and I , having got my wardrobe in complete order at San Diego , had nothing to do but to read . I accordingly overhauled the chests of the crew , but found nothing that suited me exactly , until one of the men said he had a book which " told all about a great highway-man , " at the bottom of his chest , and producing it , I found , to my surprise and joy , that it was nothing else than Bulwer 's Paul Clifford . This , I seized immediately , and going to my hammock , lay there , swinging and reading , until the watch was out . The between-decks were clear , the hatchways open , and a cool breeze blowing through them , the ship under easy way , and everything comfortable . I had just got well into the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ordered to dinner . After dinner came our watch on deck for four hours , and , at four o'clock , I went below again , turned into my hammock , and read until the dog watch . As no lights were allowed after eight o'clock , there was no reading in the night watch . Having light winds and calms , we were three days on the passage , and each watch below , during the daytime , I spent in the same manner , until I had finished my book . I shall never forget the enjoyment I derived from it . To come across anything with the slightest claims to literary merit , was so unusual , that this was a perfect feast to me . The brilliancy of the book , the succession of capital hits , lively and characteristic sketches , kept me in a constant state of pleasing sensations . It was far too good for a sailor . I could not expect such fine times to last long . While on deck , the regular work of the ship went on . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their work to do upon the rigging , drawing yarns , making spun-yarn , etc. , as usual in merchantmen . The night watches were much more pleasant than on board the Pilgrim . There , there were so few in a watch , that , one being at the wheel , and another on the look-out , there was no one left to talk with ; but here , we had seven in a watch , so that we had long yarns , in abundance . After two or three night watches , I became quite well acquainted with all the larboard watch . The sailmaker was the head man of the watch , and was generally considered the most experienced seaman on board . He was a thoroughbred old man-of-war's-man , had been to sea twenty-two years , in all kinds of vessels  --  men-of-war , privateers , slavers , and merchantmen ;  --  everything except whalers , which a thorough sailor despises , and will always steer clear of , if he can . He had , of course , been in all parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His yarns frequently stretched through a watch , and kept all hands awake . They were always amusing from their improbability , and , indeed , he never expected to be believed , but spun them merely for amusement ; and as he had some humor and a good supply of man-of-war slang and sailor 's salt phrases , he always made fun . Next to him in age and experience , and , of course , in standing in the watch , was an Englishman , named Harris , of whom I shall have more to say hereafter . Then , came two or three Americans , who had been the common run of European and South American voyages , and one who had been in a " spouter , " and , of course , had all the whaling stories to himself . Last of all , was a broad-backed , thick-headed boy from Cape Cod , who had been in mackerel schooners , and was making his first voyage in a square-rigged vessel . He was born in Hingham , and of course was called " Bucketmaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . A tall , fine-looking Frenchman , with coal-black whiskers and curly hair , a first-rate seaman , and named John , ( one name is enough for a sailor , ) was the head man of the watch . Then came two Americans ( one of whom had been a dissipated young man of property and family , and was reduced to duck trowsers and monthly wages , ) a German , an English lad , named Ben , who belonged on the mizen topsail yard with me , and was a good sailor for his years , and two Boston boys just from the public schools . The carpenter sometimes mustered in the starboard watch , and was an old sea-dog , a Swede by birth , and accounted the best helmsman in the ship . This was our ship 's company , beside cook and steward , who were blacks , three mates , and the captain . The second day out , the wind drew ahead , and we had to beat up the coast ; so that , in tacking ship , I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most convenient , and running from place to place , wherever work was to be done , each man had his station . A regular tacking and wearing bill was made out . The chief mate commanded on the forecastle , and had charge of the head sails and the forward part of the ship . Two of the best men in the ship  --  the sailmaker from our watch , and John , the Frenchman , from the other , worked the forecastle . The third mate commanded in the waist , and , with the carpenter and one man , worked the main tack and bowlines ; the cook , ex-officio , the fore sheet , and the steward the main . The second mate had charge of the after yards , and let go the lee fore and main braces . I was stationed at the weather cross-jack braces ; three other light hands at the lee ; one boy at the spanker-sheet and guy ; a man and a boy at the main topsail , top-gallant , and royal braces ; and all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main brace . Every one here knew his station , must be there when all hands were called to put the ship about , and was answerable for every rope committed to him . Each man 's rope must be let go and hauled in at the order , properly made fast , and neatly coiled away when the ship was about . As soon as all hands are at their stations , the captain , who stands on the weather side of the quarter-deck , makes a sign to the man at the wheel to put it down , and calls out " Helm 's a lee ' ! " " Helm 's a lee ' ! " answers the mate on the forecastle , and the head sheets are let go . " Raise tacks and sheets ! " says the captain ; " tacks and sheets ! " is passed forward , and the fore tack and main sheet are let go . The next thing is to haul taught for a swing . The weather cross-jack braces and the lee main braces are each belayed together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the opposite braces hauled taught . " Main topsail haul ! " shouts the captain ; the braces are let go ; and if he has taken his time well , the yards swing round like a top ; but if he is too late , or too soon , it is like drawing teeth . The after yards are then braced up and belayed , the main sheet hauled aft , the spanker eased over to leeward , and the men from the braces stand by the head yards . " Let go and haul ! " says the captain ; the second mate lets go the weather fore braces , and the men haul in to leeward . The mate , on the forecastle , looks out for the head yards . " Well , the fore topsail yard ! " " Top-gallant yard 's well ! " " Royal yard too much ! Haul into windward ! So ! well that ! " " Well all ! " Then the starboard watch board the main tack , and the larboard watch lay forward and board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tackle upon it , if it blows very fresh . The after yards are then trimmed , the captain generally looking out for them himself . " Well the cross-jack yard ! " " Small pull the main top-gallant yard ! " " Well that ! " " Well the mizen top-gallant yard ! " " Cross-jack yards all well ! " " Well all aft ! " " Haul taught to windward ! " Everything being now trimmed and in order , each man coils up the rigging at his own station , and the order is given  --  " Go below the watch ! " During the last twenty-four hours of the passage , we beat off and on the land , making a tack about once in four hours , so that I had a sufficient opportunity to observe the working of the ship ; and certainly , it took no more men to brace about this ship 's lower yards , which were more than fifty feet square , than it did those of the Pilgrim , which were not much more than half the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braces run , and the state of the blocks ; and Captain Wilson , of the Ayacucho , who was afterwards a passenger with us , upon a trip to windward , said he had no doubt that our ship worked two men lighter than his brig . Friday , Sept. 11th . This morning , at four o'clock , went below , San Pedro point being about two leagues ahead , and the ship going on under studding-sails . In about an hour we were waked up by the hauling of the chain about decks , and in a few minutes " All hands ahoy ! " was called ; and we were all at work , hauling in and making up the studding-sails , overhauling the chain forward , and getting the anchors ready . " The Pilgrim is there at anchor , " said some one , as we were running about decks ; and taking a moment 's look over the rail , I saw my old friend , deeply laden , lying at anchor inside of the kelp . In coming to anchor , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . The light sails were clewed up and furled , the courses hauled up and the jibs down ; then came the topsails in the buntlines , and the anchor let go . As soon as she was well at anchor , all hands lay aloft to furl the topsails ; and this , I soon found , was a great matter on board this ship ; for every sailor knows that a vessel is judged of , a good deal , by the furl of her sails . The third mate , a sailmaker , and the larboard watch went upon the fore topsail yard ; the second mate , carpenter , and the starboard watch upon the main ; and myself and the English lad , and the two Boston boys , and the young Cape-Cod man , furled the mizen topsail . This sail belonged to us altogether , to reef and to furl , and not a man was allowed to come upon our yard . The mate took us under his special care , frequently making us furl the sail over , three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect cone , and the whole sail without a wrinkle . As soon as each sail was hauled up and the bunt made , the jigger was bent on to the slack of the buntlines , and the bunt triced up , on deck . The mate then took his place between the knightheads to " twig " the fore , on the windlass to twig the main , and at the foot of the mainmast , for the mizen ; and if anything was wrong ,  --  too much bunt on one side , clews too taught or too slack , or any sail abaft the yard ,  --  the whole must be dropped again . When all was right , the bunts were triced well up , the yard-arm gaskets passed , so as not to leave a wrinkle forward of the yard  --  short gaskets with turns close together . From the moment of letting go the anchor , when the captain ceases his care of things , the chief mate is the great man . With a voice like a young lion , he was hallooing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , at the same time , doing everything well . He was quite a contrast to the worthy , quiet , unobtrusive mate of the Pilgrim ; not so estimable a man , perhaps , but a far better mate of a vessel ; and the entire change in Captain T  --   --  ' s conduct , since he took command of the ship , was owing , no doubt , in a great measure , to this fact . If the chief officer wants force , discipline slackens , everything gets out of joint , the captain interferes continually ; that makes a difficulty between them , which encourages the crew , and the whole ends in a three-sided quarrel . But Mr. Brown ( the mate of the Alert ) wanted no help from anybody ; took everything into his own hands ; and was more likely to encroach upon the authority of the master , than to need any spurring . Captain T  --   --  gave his directions to the mate in private , and , except in coming to anchor , getting under weigh , tacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom appeared in person . This is the proper state of things , and while this lasts , and there is a good understanding aft , everything will go on well . Having furled all the sails , the royal yards were next to be sent down . The English lad and myself sent down the main , which was larger than the Pilgrim 's main top-gallant yard ; two more light hands , the fore ; and one boy , the mizen . This order , we always kept while on the coast ; sending them up and down every time we came in and went out of port . They were all tripped and lowered together , the main on the starboard side , and the fore and mizen , to port . No sooner was she all snug , than tackles were got up on the yards and stays , and the long-boat and pinnace hove out . The swinging booms were then guyed out , and the boats made fast by geswarps , and everything in harbor style . After breakfast , the hatches were taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrim . All day , boats were passing and repassing , until we had taken her hides from her , and left her in ballast trim . These hides made but little show in our hold , though they had loaded the Pilgrim down to the water 's edge . This changing of the hides settled the question of the destination of the two vessels , which had been one of some speculation to us . We were to remain in the leeward ports , while the Pilgrim was to sail , the next morning , for San Francisco . After we had knocked off work , and cleared up decks for the night , my friend S  --   --  came on board , and spent an hour with me in our berth between decks . The Pilgrim 's crew envied me my place on board the ship , and seemed to think that I had got a little to windward of them ; especially in the matter of going home first . S  --   --  was determined to go home on the Alert , by begging or buying ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other terms , he would purchase an exchange with some one of the crew . The prospect of another year after the Alert should sail , was rather " too much of the monkey . " About seven o'clock , the mate came down into the steerage , in fine trim for fun , roused the boys out of the berth , turned up the carpenter with his fiddle , sent the steward with lights to put in the between-decks , and set all hands to dancing . The between-decks were high enough to allow of jumping ; and being clear , and white , from holystoning , made a fine dancing-hall . Some of the Pilgrim 's crew were in the forecastle , and we all turned-to and had a regular sailor 's shuffle , till eight bells . The Cape-Cod boy could dance the true fisherman 's jig , barefooted , knocking with his heels , and slapping the decks with his bare feet , in time with the music . This was a favorite amusement of the mate 's , who always stood at the steerage door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hazed them round with a rope 's end , much to the amusement of the men . The next morning , according to the orders of the agent , the Pilgrim set sail for the windward , to be gone three or four months . She got under weigh with very little fuss , and came so near us as to throw a letter on board , Captain Faucon standing at the tiller himself , and steering her as he would a mackerel smack . When Captain T  --   --  was in command of the Pilgrim , there was as much preparation and ceremony as there would be in getting a seventy-four under weigh . Captain Faucon was a sailor , every inch of him ; he knew what a ship was , and was as much at home in one , as a cobbler in his stall . I wanted no better proof of this than the opinion of the ship 's crew , for they had been six months under his command , and knew what he was ; and if sailors allow their captain to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , for that is a thing they are not always ready to say . After the Pilgrim left us , we lay three weeks at San Pedro , from the 11th of September until the 2nd of October , engaged in the usual port duties of landing cargo , taking off hides , etc. , etc . These duties were much easier , and went on much more agreeably , than on board the Pilgrim . " The more , the merrier , " is the sailor 's maxim ; and a boat 's crew of a dozen could take off all the hides brought down in a day , without much trouble , by division of labor ; and on shore , as well as on board , a good will , and no discontent or grumbling , make everything go well . The officer , too , who usually went with us , the third mate , was a fine young fellow , and made no unnecessary trouble ; so that we generally had quite a sociable time , and were glad to be relieved from the restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the miserable , gloomy weeks we had spent in this dull place , in the brig ; discontent and hard usage on board , and four hands to do all the work on shore . Give me a big ship . There is more room , more hands , better outfit , better regulation , more life , and more company . Another thing was better arranged here : we had a regular gig 's crew . A light whale-boat , handsomely painted , and fitted out with stern seats , yoke , tiller-ropes , etc. , hung on the starboard quarter , and was used as the gig . The youngest lad in the ship , a Boston boy about thirteen years old , was coxswain of this boat , and had the entire charge of her , to keep her clean , and have her in readiness to go and come at any hour . Four light hands , of about the same size and age , of whom I was one , formed the crew . Each had his oar and seat numbered , and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped white , our tholepins in , and the fenders over the side . The bow-man had charge of the boat-hook and painter , and the coxswain of the rudder , yoke , and stern-sheets . Our duty was to carry the captain and agent about , and passengers off and on ; which last was no trifling duty , as the people on shore have no boats , and every purchaser , from the boy who buys his pair of shoes , to the trader who buys his casks and bales , were to be taken off and on , in our boat . Some days , when people were coming and going fast , we were in the boat , pulling off and on , all day long , with hardly time for our meals ; making , as we lay nearly three miles from shore , from forty to fifty miles ' rowing in a day . Still , we thought it the best berth in the ship ; for when the gig was employed , we had nothing to do with the cargo , except small bundles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry , besides the opportunity of seeing everybody , making acquaintances , hearing the news , etc . Unless the captain or agent were in the boat , we had no officer with us , and often had fine times with the passengers , who were always willing to talk and joke with us . Frequently , too , we were obliged to wait several hours on shore ; when we would haul the boat up on the beach , and leaving one to watch her , go up to the nearest house , or spend the time in strolling about the beach , picking up shells , or playing hopscotch , and other games , on the hard sand . The rest of the crew never left the ship , except for bringing heavy goods and taking off hides ; and though we were always in the water , the surf hardly leaving us a dry thread from morning till night , yet we were young , and the climate was good , and we thought it much better than the quiet , hum-drum drag and pull on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California ; for , besides carrying everybody in our boat ,  --  men , women , and children ,  --  all the messages , letters , and light packages went by us , and being known by our dress , we found a ready reception everywhere . At San Pedro , we had none of this amusement , for , there being but one house in the place , we , of course , had but little company . All the variety that I had , was riding , once a week , to the nearest rancho , to order a bullock down for the ship . The brig Catalina came in from San Diego , and being bound up to windward , we both got under weigh at the same time , for a trial of speed up to Santa Barbara , a distance of about eighty miles . We hove up and got under sail about eleven o'clock at night , with a light land-breeze , which died away toward morning , leaving us becalmed only a few miles from our anchoring-place . The Catalina , being a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out sweeps and got a boat ahead , and pulled out to sea , during the night , so that she had the sea-breeze earlier and stronger than we did , and we had the mortification of seeing her standing up the coast , with a fine breeze , the sea all ruffled about her , while we were becalmed , in-shore . When the sea-breeze died away , she was nearly out of sight ; and , toward the latter part of the afternoon , the regular north-west wind set in fresh , we braced sharp upon it , took a pull at every sheet , tack , and halyard , and stood after her , in fine style , our ship being very good upon a taughtened bowline . We had nearly five hours of fine sailing , beating up to windward , by long stretches in and off shore , and evidently gaining upon the Catalina at every tack . When this breeze left us , we were so near as to count the painted ports on her side . Fortunately , the wind died away when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward , so we were in-shore , and caught the land-breeze first , which came off upon our quarter , about the middle of the first watch . All hands were turned-up , and we set all sail , to the skysails and the royal studding-sails ; and with these , we glided quietly through the water , leaving the Catalina , which could not spread so much canvas as we , grad//
