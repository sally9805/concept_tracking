BY LADY PILKE . THE history of trades-unionism among women in England is the history of the Women 's Trades-Union League , and that history ought to have a special claim on the attention of American readers , since the organization of the league in 1874 was undertaken in avowed imitation of the " friendly societies " for women which had already , it was said , done much for the working classes in the United States . I first heard of these societies from a woman named Emma Smith ( afterwards Mrs. Paterson ) , a printer by trade . In her capacity of secretary to an organization for the promotion of women 's suffrage , Emma told me she had listened to many flaming speeches from women's-rights ' partisans , and had sat under many fair American orators ; but of all this talk one thing only had made a deep impression on her , and that was an account of certain " friendly " societies given in her hearing by one of these ladies . So Emma spent her savings on a journey to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now known throughout the land as the Women 's Trades-Union League . In those days none dared speak bravely of t-rades-unionism ; it was something which meant , to the common ear , deeds of violence , of darkness , and the use of illegal or even criminal methods , synonymous with the destruction of property and life , whilst to the more educated it was an irremissible sin against the inspired ordinances of " political economy . " When , therefore , Emma Smith came back from the States and called on her friends to support her scheme for helping working women to help themselves , they one and all insisted that the society should be christened in such wise as would not suggest , to the casual hearer , its true character . So it came about that we hit on the title Protective // and Provident League . It was not till about four years ago that our friends gathered courage sufficient to substitute the word " Trades-Union " for the adjective " Protective . " Since then , indeed , things have gone so fast that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Protective and Provident League now stands honestly confessed as a league for the promotion of trades-unions amongst women . In connection with this change I well remember an amusing incident which occurred during our early years , and which illustrates the necessity for what may now seem absurd precautions , as well as the uselessness of such prudential blinds except in the case of the general public . It was intended to start what was euphuistically termed a " society " amongst the women employed iu a factory in a provincial English town , and a meeting was called in which many of the leading inhabitants , noted for their general philanthropy , were expected to take part . One of our friends announced with great triumph , just before the proceedings commenced , that she had captured a university professor ,  --  a professor , indeed , of logic ,  --  and she added that he had not only said he would attend , but had also promised a donation toward the expenses of starting the good work . W4iien , however , Emma Paterson had finished her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is trades-unionism ! I can have nothing to do with you ; you are trying to violate the laws of political economy ! " So the professor withdrew his subscription and himself . He was quite ready to give money in charity ,  --  that is , as a voluntary rate in aid of insufficient wages ,  --  but he regarded as criminal any attempt to enable these suffering women to obtain by combination better remuneration for labor carried on under conditions which constituted a danger to society . Since those days the little league has made steady progress , working without encouragement against almost overwhelming odds , but within the last two years it has profited greatly by the public attentien which has been drawn to labor questions generally . The sympathy which was accorded to the " dockers " has since been widely extended to various other forms of underpaid labor , and of these women may certainly claim to have more than their full share . What is called the " new unionism , " which first attracted notice during the struggle at the docks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unionism proceeding by more // hazardous and sensational methods ; yet it has done good service to the cause , and especially to the cause which the Women 's Trades-Union League has in hand , in two ways . In the first place , by appealing to the element of sentiment which always plays so large a part in the decisions of the British public , the new** unionism has struck a great blow at the root of the prejudice which has long lingered against combination for any but " friendly " purposes ; and , in the second , it has shown that it is possible to organize with effect-if only for a time  --  the least skilled and the most underpaid forms of labor ; that is to say , it has touched the very classes amongst which the league is most desirous of promoting combination . The success which crowned the famous strike inspired our friends with fresh confidence , whilst the notoriety given in the daily press to facts concerning the conditions of the lowest forms of modern industry  --  to which for years past the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of sympathy and support which we had well-nigh despaired of obtaining . Even those who would still continue to deny to men the right of organization , change their tone when speaking of women , and are content to make an arbitrary distinction wherever they are concerned . Women , they will now tell us , must be regarded as standing on a wholly different footing to men translated into plain English this means , I take it , that they are , in fact , so helpless and oppressed that no amount of organization can ever enable them to hold their own , much less take the offensive successfully as men have done . The league has , therefore , recently received considerable support even from the most orthodox section of the British middle class , and this support it has done its best to deserve by the mingled prudence and resolution with which it has stecied its course in the past ; for , whilst always ready to act with determination , whenever there is clear occasion for it , in the protection of the interests of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to avoid those extreme courses which may be a good advertisement , but which too often have the most disastrous results for the interests of those concerned . At a critical moment , about two years ago , the secretary of the league , Miss Black , who had succeeded to Mrs. Paterson 's labors , and who had done good service to the cause by her // speeches and writings , transferred her services to a newer organization , which , being under the patronage of Mr. Champion and Mr. Burns , seemed likely to secure a larger measure of popular support . It was then feared that the elder society might suffer in consequence , and its friends felt some apprehension as to its future ; but the vacant place was instantly filled by Miss Florence Routledge , half-sister of Mr. Edmund iRoutledge , the well-known publisher , and she has discharged the duties of the post with such marked ability and energy that the league , then languishing , has taken a fresh lease of life and is slowly spreading its influence throughout the United Kingdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the work of disseminating the principles of trades-unionism has been systematized , and also vastly extended by a scheme of affiliation which grew out of the experience gathered in some country tours , undertaken by members of the committee , in different districts which it was desired to organize . Everywhere-even in places where the appeal to women to unite had seemed most successful-it was found that the enthusiasm aroused by the presence of the visitors from London failed or died away amongst the difficulties which had to be encountered in founding or carrying on the union after their departure . Sometimes the men unionists in the district were ready and able to help the women , but the women were afraid to trust themselves in their hands ; sometimes the women relapsed from fear ( often groundless ) of their employers ; and sometimes they dropped away solely because there seemed no immediate benefit to be derived from the self-denying thrift which would alone enable them to keep up their union contributions . " The men in Hawick , " writes a friend to Miss Routledge , " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers in their union have sunk again to a hundred . Of the thirty-six who sent in their names when you were here in March , only fourteen have turned out paying members . " Disappointments of this kind it has , however , seemed possible to prevent , either by authorizing delegates to spend several weeks in each district , or by undertaking that the speakers sent to organize , in the first instance , should revisit their converts within a stated time . It was clearly impossible that the league , with its limited staff , should permit its delegates to devote many w.eeks to // any one place , but the committee thought it feasible to arrange for periodical visits by systematizing and regulating the expeditions which the members were already in the habit of carrying out . It was therefore decided that any union composed of women , or admitting women as members , having previously satisfied the league of its sound financial condition , should be admitted as an affiliated union , being entitled* on condition of paying a small annual contribution to the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst which was that of receiving a visit , once a year , from the secretary or other member of the committee . With this object it was further decided that two annual tours should be mapped out and carried through in spring and autumn , by means of which it was hoped that new unions would be formed and old ones strengthened and stimulated to increasing exertions* In this connection it will be seen that public agitation is necessarily a prominent part of the programme of the league . A few months after the present honorable secretary took up the duties of her post , the committee , feeling that this part of their duties had hitherto been somewhat neglected , requested her to place herself in communication with every trades council existing in districts where women were largely employed . The result of this step at once showed that , even where the women were apathetic , the men in the trades were fully aware of the danger that disorganized labor , whether male or female , was to their own standing in the market . From every large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our women are not properly organized ; we can do nothing with them . Come and see if you can help us ! " From the far north of Scotland , from the linen mills of Ireland , we have heard repeated the same story that is echoing from the forges of Staffordshire or the looms of Lancashire and Yorkshire . " The women , " say the men , " are doing men 's work at half-pay ; they are driving us from the trades : we would stop their working if we could ; but as we ca n't , help us to organize them at once , lest worse befall us . " Not philanthropy , but selfinterest , is awake , and is forcing rapidly forward the extension and application to women 's labor of those principles on which men , to a large extent , have managed to protect their own . It is well known , for example , that in every district in which the weaving trades are carried on the labor of women has been supplanting the labor of men , not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaply . In other trades , as . for example , amongst the chain- and nail-makers , we find wives and danghters in active competition with their hnsbands and fathers , engaged , as Mr. Burnett forcibly put it in his report of 1888 , " in dragging down their wages to still lower levels . " It is plain that this condition of things can be turned to account and is too often turned to account by unscrupulous employers , so that it constitutes a menace to the industry of men . And when we pass from the factory to the " domestic workshop , " whether it be in the sweaters ' den in Whitechapel or at the hearth-forges of Halesowen and Cradley Heath , we find all such evils intensified , for domestic labor isolates the workers and renders well-nigh impossible that common understanding and unity of effort which are now necessary to the regulation of the trades . The most promising field for trades-unionism is , therefore , to be found in districts such as Lancashire , where the women are working in great factories ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where their labor for the most part is subdivided and they are broken up into twos and threes . Numbers as small as these will often be found working for sweaters in the shamjewelry trade . Thus it conies to pass , as we should naturally expect , that the highest numbers of women unionists are to be counted in such organizations as that of the Northern Counties ' Weavers ' Association , a society numbering nearly 47,000 members , of whom 26,000 are women . Mr. Birtwhistle , to whose kindness I am indebted for these figures , adds " There are other associations of weavers , not directly connected with this amalgamation , which will swell the numbers up to 65,000 , in which women will bear the same proportion . " The membership of the Card- and Blowing-Rooms Amalgamated Association , at Manchester , shows also a good twothirds women and girls out of a total of about 14,000 , and this proportion is preserved , with few exceptions , in other centres of the textile industries , where the unions are energetically and ably managed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as we come to the iron and hardware trades , the results are not so good . In the chain trade , for instance , the women are fairly well organized , thanks to the efforts of Mr. Juggius and Mr. Smith ; but in the spike-nail trade , although the union has secured for them an advance of 35 per cent. , the greatest difficulty is experienced in keeping them in the society , whilst of those employed in // the screwing department connected with the nut and bolt trade it may be said that they have never been organized at all . The Midland Counties ' Trade Federation , which has made great efforts to organize the districts in which these industries are carried on , has been , in fact , so seriously hampered by the large proportion of home labor affecting the general conditions of these trades that it has not reaped anything like the harvest which it had a right to expect from the very considerable sacrifices of time and money which it has made in the cause of the organization of female labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federation is still steadily working , and it is hoped that the delegates of the league may be able to arouse the women and induce them to profit by the help now so freely offered . The poorest result , at least in point of numbers , is shown when we come to look over the lists of unions formed and managed entirely by women themselves . In London there are some fifteen or sixteen formed by the league alone , and I would put their total membership at something under 2,000 , for hardly any single union counts more than 200 members . The Laundresses ' Union reckons , indeed , from 400 to 500 , but this figure is made up from several different branches ; the excellent Bookbinders ' Union has but 200 , and some , such as that of the shirt- and collarmakers , drop much lower . From all the inquiries which I have made I am inclined to think that the situation is much the same throughout the country , and is everywhere due to pretty much the same causes . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of women , and enters , as in the textile trades , into direct competition with the labor of men , it is worth the while of the men to take up their organization ; but where the women are not an appreciable factor , or where the trade , as shirt- and collarmaking , is entirely in their own hands , they are left to their sole resources . Now , women , as a rule , are " slack** officials and do not understand " working up " a society not only so , but the trades which are left wholly to them are the little trades , underpaid trades , and trades carried on , to a great extent , in small workshops and by home labor . Under these circumstances , it is sometimes asked whether , given the great difficulty of finding trained organizers and agitatots amongst working women , it would not be , on the whole , wiser for the league to confine itself to inducing women to enter // unions established and managed by men . This is , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is no existing union managed by men , or the existing union closes its doors to women , or the women are working in a trade in which they alone are employed , that the league urges the formation of an independent society . It is obviously better for women and better for the state that their industrial position , whenever possible , should be dealt with as but a part of the general problem , and that their organization should be as little as possible dissociated from the organization of the men . Unfortunately , the men do not often take sufficient pains to develop the business powers of the women who enter their unions , nor do they give them adequate representation in their management : the education of the women does not advance ; and in one case , where great difficulties had ariseu , and application for advice had been made to the league , it was found necessary , in order to give the women a chance for life , to recommend that they should be detached from the men s union and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , an extreme case . As a rule the situation may be described in the words of Mr. Birtwhistle writing to me of the constitution of the Northern Counties ' Weavers ' Association . " Females , " he says , " take no part in the management , although we do not prohibit them from doing so ; on the coutrary , we have on several occasions endeavored to induce them to do so , but have failed . " Yet it must be remembered that men in dealing with their women members are at present at a great disadvantage : one of the most capable and experienced of men unionists in the kingdom , after addressing a large meeting of women , turned round to me and said : " It is very strange , somehow ; say what we will we can not get at these women . " He forgot that the women had been for so long treated as a class apart , and as an inferior class , that they naturally distrusted the good intentio*i1s of men , whom they had been led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , both because there are many women 's trades to organize , and because the training in separate unions is a useful education for them , it is necessary to carry on the work on a double system ; but the growing tendency to unite - wherever trade conditions permit-various groups of workers in a single society seems likely , in the future , to afford a way out of our present difficulties . The strong caste feeling , which even // more than the pressure of trade exigencies has determined the separate organization of men 's unions hitherto , has prevailed with more than equal force amongst women . In the past it has been found impossible-except in individual instances  --  to induce women working in what may be called established trades of a well-paid and socially-respectable character , to join hands with those less fortunate and less skilled ; consequently it was of no use to look to them for the help by which the half-starved rank and file who belong to the odd trades might be moved and brought up to the level at which union becomes practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , by the new unionism and the birth , under its auspices , of societies such as the Gas-Workers and General Laborers ' Union , is already producing good effect , and the unions more recently organized by the league , as , for instance , the London Laundresses and General Working-Women 's Amalgamated Association , have been founded on an equally wide basis . The present pressure in this direction also necessarily affects the very constitution and character of these associations whereas it was once a cardinal point of doctrine that all unions should have their benefit or friendly side , as well as their trade objects , and the contributions of the members were therefore based on a scale sufficient to meet calls of both descriptions , the effort to combine the worst-paid workers has brought about the abandonment in many cases of that " friendly " character to which the league has always attached great importance . It is , indeed , evidently useless , where you find women whose total weekly earnings never exceed five shillings , to ask them to pay contributions adequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starvation level . Hence it seems not unlikely that societies of the type of the Newcastle National Labor Federation , which attempts the combination of all classes of workers ( men and women ) for purely trade objects , and which is conducted on the lowest possible rate of contribution , have a prospect of great immediate usefulness before them . In fact , I am inclined to think that as these amalgamations increase in size their business will be more and more subdivided-that is , the unions which undertake the insurance and risks of trade disputes will leave sick-insurance , superannuation funds , insurance against casualties , amid so forth , to other societies established with a view to one or more of these objects . // Under the influence of these considerations , the league , whilst continuing to set a high value on the provident side of its work , has freely accepted the task of coöperation with societies of the new class , and in this it has the advantage of its peculiar position in that it represents no section of opinion , but , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to work with any who are ready to forward their interests in thIs respect . Nothing , indeed , is more surprising to those who knew the position of this little society in its infancy than to look over the applications for help which now come in to the executive committee . This executive committee , on which every secretary properly accredited from a London women s union is allowed to sit and vote , transacts all its business in a shabby little den off Broad Street , Bloomsbury , which is dignified by the name " Industrial hall . " This " Hall** is the library , which is at the service of all women unionists on payment of a nominal fee ; it is the secretary 's only office , where she and her assistant , Miss llolyoake , sit daily . Meetings are held and even entertainments are given within its narrow four walls . Not , indeed , that the members would not thankfully accept premises better fitted for their work ,  - -  they are engaged at the present moment in raising funds for the building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members feel that whilst the scanty salary of the assistant secretary and all the expenses of the organizing work have to be found out of the precarious three hundred a year , which is the utmost received from the public even in a good year , it would not be right to indulge in the ordinary-some would say the **26;914;TOOLONG of a place of business . It must be confessed that it would be impossible to do anything with such an income and such machinery , were it not for the self-sacrificing devotion of the chief officers . The honorary secretary , Miss IRoutledge , gives her services , and so does the treasurer , Miss Abraham , who gets through , in the course of the year , fully as much organizing work as does Miss IRoutledge herself . Furthermore , in addition to its luck in securing the unpaid services of its chief officers , the league has been fortunate in inspiring outsiders with something of the same zeal , and thus it contrives to get the cause taken up in districts apparently beyond its influence . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to work , willing to accept responsibility , and fit to be // trusted , the league wisely delegates authority , treats the new worker as a corresponding member , and refrains from in , terference . Thus , in the country , it reckons amongst its stanch supporters and good friends Mrs. Byles , of Bradford , and Miss Isabella Ford , of Leeds ; and in London , in like manner , the work of organizing the match-box-makers of Shoreditch has been taken up by the generous action of Mrs. Reilly , a lady who , being occupied all day in a city office , gives her hardwon hours of leisure to the uphill work of nursing a union drawn from a class engaged in " homey ' labor . In another district we find a niece of His Eminence Cardinal Manning ready to devote herself to the equally difficult task of combining seamstresses , whilst a lady fresh from college honors is doing duty as general secretary for the laundresses . This sort of service is , it must be remembered , of the dullest possible description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to get . Ladies are often ready to help , but they can rarely help in the right way . They can not understand how inexorable the work is in its demands on time , and that , if a Tuesday be the night fixed for meeting by a young society , then on Tuesdays all other claims , however pleasant or pressing , must be set aside . Once fail to attend and meet your women on their " office ' * night , and they will be dissatisfied ; fail them twice , and symptoms of disorganization will show themselves , and will threaten results only to be averted by double the efforts and sacrifices needed in the first instance to keep the union on its feet . Hundreds of workers are wanted like the veteran Mrs. Ellis ; or Miss Whyte , of the London bookbinders , who was the first to join Mrs. Paterson in her crusade ; or Mrs. ilutchinson , the active secretary of the laundresses ; or Miss Kate Taylor , of Glasgow , the first woman sent as a delegate from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest is awakened and is growing in the class which the league desires to reach , confidence is slow to come , and it will take years of labor spent in rousing and drilling the " awkward squads " before we are likely to see an increase of unionism amongst women at all proportionate to its growth amongst men . Nevertheless , this need not discourage us . Men have been years in organizing , and there are peculiar difficulties in the way of women . The responsible officials of a trades-union must not only be acquainted with the conditions of labor , but must also have initiative and force // sufficient to deal with those conditions successfully . However willing the men may be to call women to their side , we must recognize the fact that the labor of the latter has been , as a rule , of too dependent a character to give them a chance of training for administrative posts , and for a long time to come they must rely on outside help . Those of us who , like myself , have been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of labor on a scale which is in itself an experience rarely granted to women of our class , have become more and more convinced that organization is the only way to meet the terrible problems which we have to face ; but , although we have to set ourselves against home labor and to call on the women at the forge , at the spindle , and the loom to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and fight the battle of modern industry with them in the market of the world , yet we do this feeling , many of us , day by day the more strongly , that our place , the place of the women in the land , is not here , but at the hearth . If there were no other reason , a sufficient ground for our labors might be found in this ,  --  that the homes of England are at stake ; we are fighting for the manhood of her men , for the health of her women , for the future of her little children . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaced by the unregulated competition which , in our agricultural districts , sends the wife into the winter fields whilst the husband too often lounges by the pothouse fire ; which hunts the Lancashire woman from her doors in the dawning day whilst the babe is yet hanging to her breast , or which chains the growing girl to the forge and rewards her week of labor by half a crown . We ask ourselves , Is it good that the man should stand idle ? Is it good that the wife should work whilst the little ones cry for their mother , and her girls and boys are at play in the streets ? And why does the married woman snatch greedily at the most miserably-paid forms of labor ? Not because she has not enough to do at home , but because the husband 's wage has been reduced till it no longer suffices for the maintenance of his family ; because the little boy has no boots to go to school in , or the little girl lacks the warm clothing necessary to protect her in the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such a case , sells her labor cheap ? Yet that is what we must do , for we have to tell // her that by accepting less than a fair day 's wage for a fair day 's work she is betraying her own interests , the interests of her husband , and the interests and future of her children . Even so it would be shameless to blame her , had we no remedy to propose ; but in organization and union we have , as we believe , an allpotent remedy to offer . " Women , " we say , " unite , combine , help your men to protect themselves and you . You will make things a little better soon for yourselves , and by-and-by a great deal better for the children who shall rise up to call you blessed . "
