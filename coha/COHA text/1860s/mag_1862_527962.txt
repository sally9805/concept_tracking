txt ONE OF MY CLIENTS . AFTER a practice in the legal profession of more than twenty years , I am persuaded that a more interesting volume could not be written than the revelations of a lawyer 's office . The plots there discovered before they were matured , - the conspiracies there detected " Ere they had reached their last fatal periods , " - the various devices of the Prince of Darkness ,  --  the weapons with which he fought , and those by which he was overcome , - the curious phenomena of intense activity and love of gain , - the arts of the detective , and those by which he was eluded , - and the never-ending and ever-varying surprises and startling incidents , - would present such a*panorama of human affairs as would outfly our fancy , and modify our unbelief in that much-abused doctrine of the depravity of our nature . To illustrate , let me introduce to you " one of my clients , " whom I will call Mr. Sidney , and with whom , perhaps , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal appearance you may find in the tho*ouglifare at any hour of the day . Thcrc is othing about him to attract attention . He is nearly forty-five years of age , and weighs , perhaps , two hundred pounds . His face is florid and his hair sandy . His eyes are small , piercing , and gray . His motions are slow , and none are made without a purpose . Intellectually he is above the average , and his perceptive faculties are well developed . The wrinkles in his lips are at rirht anoiles with his mouth , and a close observer might detect in his countenance self- reliance and tenacity of will and purpose . But with ordinary faculties much may he accomplished : in this sketch , let us see how much in two particulars . // His first entrance into my office was in the spring of 1853 . He handed me a package of papers , saying , if I would name an hour for a professional consultation , he would be punctual . The time was agreed upon and he withdrew . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of introduction were from several United States Senators , Judges of Supreme Courts , Cabinet Officers , and Governors , and one was from a Presidential candidate in the last election . Those directed specially to me were from a Senator an ( l a Member of Congress , both of whom were lawyers and my personal friends , men in whose judgment I placed great confidence . They all spoke in the highest terms of Mr. Sidney 's integrity , ability , and energy , and concluded by saying I might implicitly rely upon his judgment and be governed by his counsels . What man of the masses can this one be , thus heralded by the authorities of the nation , and what his labor , so commended by the rulers ? I glanced at him mentally again . Perhaps he is laboring for the endowment of some great literary or benevolent institution , for the building of a national monument . No . Perhaps he has some theory that thousands of facts must prove and illustrate ; or it may be he is a voracious gatherer of statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I mused , the more the fire burned within me to know more of his mission . I awaited impatiently his coming . It was on the stroke of the hour appointed . The object of that interview may not with propriety be stated , nor the results described ; but it may be said that that hour was the most intensely exciting of any of my professional life , causin* , the blood to chill and boil alternately . The business was so peculiar , and connected with men so exalted in position , and conducted with such wonderful ability and tact , that now , years after , scarcely a day passes that my mind does not revert to those hours and do homage to those transcendent abilities by which it was conducted , till I sometimes think the possessor of them was an overmatch for Lucifer himself . My eyes were for the first time opened to the marvellous in his department of knowledge and art ; and the region of impossibility was materially circumscribed , and the domain of the prince of the powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my present purpose to delve . After a business acquaintance of several years with Mr. Sidney , I have learned that he was formerly a rich manufacturer , and that he was nearly ruined in fortune by the burning of several warehouses in which he had stored a large amount of merchandise that was uninsured . The owners of these store-houses were men of wealth , influence , and respectability . Alone of all the citizens , Mr. Sidney suspected that the block was intentionally set on fire to defraud the insurance - offices . Without any aid or knowledge of other parties , he began an investigation , and ascertained that the buildings were insured far beyond their value . He also ascertained that insurance had been obtained on a far greater amount of merchandise than the stores could contain ; and still further , that the goods insured , as being deposited there , were not so deposited at the time of the fire . He likewise procured a long array of facts tending to fix the burning upon the " merchant princes " who held the policies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted these men , accused them of the arson , and demanded payment for his own loss . This was , of course , declined . Whereupon he gave them formal notice , that , if his demand were not liquidated within thirty days , never thereafter would an opportunity be afforded for a settlement . That the notice produced peculiar excitement was evident . Yet the thirty days elapsed and his claim was not adjusted . From that hour , with a just appreciation of the enormity *f the offence which he believed to have been committed , he consecrated his vast energies to the detection of crime . his whole soul was fired almost to frenzy with the greatness of his // work , and he pursued it with a firmness of principle and fixedness of purpose that seemed almost madness , till he exposed to the world the most stupendous league of robbers ever dreamed of , extending into every State and Territory of the Union , and numbering , to his personal knowledge , over seven hundred men of influence and power , whose business as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any other crimes that might afford rich pecuniary remuneration . I will not now stop to describe the organization of this band , which is as perfect as that of any corporation ; nor the enormous resources at its command , being computed by millions ; nor the great respectability of its directors and State agents ; nor the bloody oaths and forfeitures by which the members are bound together ; nor the places of their annual meetings ; nor a thousand other particulars , more startling than anything in fiction or history . Nor will I enumerate the great number of convictions of members of this gang for various offences through Mr. Sidney 's efforts . Prosecuting no other parties than these , - thwarting them in those defences that had never before failed ,  --  testifying in open court against the character of their witnesses , who appeared to be polished gentlemen , and enumerating the offences of which they had been guilty , - and harassing them by all le*al and legitimate means , he gathered around him a storm that not one man in a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food analyzed that had been suspiciously set before him , and in each instance poison was detected in it ; while in hundreds of instances he declined to receive from unknown hands presents about which hung similar suspicions . Numerous were the infernal-machines sent him , the explosion of some of which he escaped as if by miracle , and several exploded in his own dwelling . Without number were the anonymous letters he received , threatening his life , if he did not desist from prosecuting this band of robbers . Yet not for one moment swerved from his purpose , he moved unharmed through ten thousand perils , till at last he fell a victim to the enemy that had so long been hunting his life . On no one has his mantle fallen . His sole object in life seemed to be the breaking- up of this villanous gan* , of plunderers , and he pursued it with a genius and strength , a devotion , self-sacrifice , and true heroism , that are deserving of immortality . Not long before his death , while one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney 's instigation , awaiting a preliminary examination , he sent for Mr. Sidney and offered him one hundred thousand dollars , if he would desist from pursuing him alone . Mr. Sidney replied , that he had many times before been offered the like sum , if he would cease prosecuting the directors , and that the same reason which had inclined him to reject that proposition would compel him to refuse this . Whereupon the director offered , as an additional inducement , one-half of the money taken from the messenger of the Newport banks , while on his way to Providence to redeem their hills at the Merchants Bank , and also the mint where they had coined the composition that had passed current for years through all the banks and bankinghouses of the country , and which stood every test that could be applied , without the destruction of the coin itself , which mint had cost its owners upwards of two hundred thousand dollars . All of which Mr. Sidney indignantly rejected . And it was not till the year after his death that the coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a million and a quarter of the same was locked up in the vaults of the Government . The United States Government sought Mr. Sidney 's services , as appears of record . Those high in authority had decided on his employment , a fact which in less than six hours thereafter was known to the directors , and within that space of time five of them had arrived in Washington and paid over to their attorney the sum of thirty-five hundred dollars for // some purpose , - the attorney being no less a personage than an honorable member of a supreme court . The service desired of Mr. Sidney he was willing to perform , on the condition that he should not be called upon to prosecute any other parties than those to whose conviction he had sworn to devote his life . As a detective , Mr. Sidney was unequalled in this country . Vidocq may have been his superior in dissimulation , but in that alone . He certainly had not a tithe of Mr. Sidney 's genius and strength of mind and moral power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to expose it to the clear light of day . " His blood and judgment were so well com-mingled , " that his conclusions seemed akin to prophecy . But it is not as a detective that Mr. Sidney is here presented . This slight sketch of this remarkable man is given , that the reader may more willingly believe that he possessed , among other wonderful powers , one that is not known ever to have been attained to such a degree by any other individual , namely - The power of discerning , in a single specimen of handwriting , the character , the occupation , the habits , the temperament , the health , the age , the sex , the size , the nationality , the benevolence or the penuriousness , the boldness or the timidity , the morality or the immorality , the affectation or the hypocrisy , and often the intention of the writer . At the age of thirty-five , the genius of Mr. Sidney as a physiognomist , expert , and detective , remained wholly undeveloped . He was not aware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observ ' *tion , dissection , and deduction . Nor had he taken his first lesson by being brought in contact with the rogues . How , then , did he acquire this almost miraculous power ? After he had ascertained the names of the directors and State agents of the baud , he collected many hundred specimens of their handwritin* . These he studied with that energy which was equalled only by his patience . In a surprisingly short time he first of all began to perceive the differences between a moral and an immoral signature . Afterwards he proceeded to study the occupation , age , habits , temperament , and all the other characteristics of the writers , and in this he was equally successful . If this be doubted by any , let him collect a number of signatures of Frenchmen , Englishmen , Germans , and Americans , or , what is still better , of Jews of all nations , and at least in the latter instance , with ordinary perceptive faculties , there will be no difficulty in determining the question of nationality ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwriting of a Jew . Many can detect pride and affectation , and most persons the sex , in handwriting , how much soever it may be disguised . The bridegroom 's letters stand in row above , Tapering , yet straight , like pine-trees in his grove ; While free and fine the bride 's appear below , As light and slender as her jasmines grow . " Why , then , should it be strange , if remarkable powers of observation , analysis , and patient and energetic study should accomplish much more ? In this ( lepartment the Government had afforded Mr. Sidney great facilities , till at last he would take the letters dropped during the night in the post-office of a great city , and as rapidly as a skilful cashier could ( letect a counterfeit in counting bank-bills , and with unerring certainty , he would throw out those suspiciously superscribed . " In each of these nine , " he would say , " there is no letter , but money only . This pareel is from the W-.  --  Street office . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names : they are fictitious , and assumed for iniquitous purposes . Those are from thieves to thieves , and hint at opportunities , " and so on . Travelling over the principal railways of the country without charge , entertained at hotels where compensation was declined , Mr. Sidney was in some instances induced to impart to his friends some of that knowledge which he took much pains // to conceal , believing that by so doing he should best serve the great purposes of his life . Wbether he desired this remarkable power to be kept from the rogues , or whether he thought he should be too much annoyed by being called upon as an expert in handwriting in civil cases , or what his purpose was , is not known , and probably a large number of his intimate friends are not aware of his genius in this . On one occasion he was in a Canadian city for the first time , and stopped at a principal hotel . When about to depart , he was surprised that his host declined compensation . The landlord then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose handwriting he produced . Mr. Sidney consented , and , having retired to the private office , gave the writer 's age within a year , his nationality , being a native-born Frenchman , his height and size , being very short and fleshy , his temperament and occupation ; and described him as a generous , hightoned , public-spirited man , of strong religious convictions and remarkable modesty : all of which the landlord pronounced to be entirely correct . The hotel-register was then brought , and to nearly every name Mr. Sidney gave the marked character or peculiarity of the man . One was very nervous , another very tall and lean ; this one was penurious , that one stubborn ; this was a farmer , and that a clergyman ; this name was written in a frolic ; this was a genuine name , though not written by the man himself , - and that written by the man himself , but it was not his true name . Of the person last specified the clerk desired a full description , and obtained it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not christened by that name . He could never have written it before he was thirty . He has assumed it within a year . The character is bad , - very bad . I. judge he is a gambler by profession , and - something worse . He evidently is not confined to one department of rascality . He was born and educated in New England , is aged about thirty-nine , is about five feet ten in height , and is broad-shouldered and stout . His nerves are strong , and he is bold , hypocritical , and mean . He is just the kind of man to talk like a saint and act like a devil . " The little company raised their hands in holy horror . " As to age , size , nerve , etc. , " said the landlord , " you are entirely correct , but in his moral character you are much mistaken " ; and the clerk laughed outright . " Not mistaken at all , " replied Mr. Sidney ; " the immorality of the signature is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that he has graduated from a State 's prison . At any rate , he will show his true character wherever he remains a year. ** " But , my dear Sir , you are doing the greatest possible damage to your reputation ; he is a boarder of mine , and " - " You had better be rid of him , " chimed in Mr. Sidney . " Why , Mr. Sidney , he is the clergyman who has been preaching very acceptably at the - Church these two months ! " " Just as I told you , " said Mr. Sidney ; " he is a hypocrite and a rascal by profession . Will you allow me to demonstrate this ? " The landlord assented . A servant was called , and Mr. Sidney , having written on a card , sent it to the clergyman 's room , with the request that he would come immediately to the office . It was delivered , and the landlord waited patiently for his Reverence . " You think he will come ? " asked Mr. Sidney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said ,  --  " You will * A short time after , the servant was again ordered to make a reconnoissance , and reported that there was no response to his knocking , and that the door was locked on the inside . Whereupon Mr. Sidney expressed the hope that the religious society were responsible for the board , fur he would never again lead that flock like a shepherd . It was subsequently // ascertained that the parson had in a very irreverent manner slipped down the spout to the kitchen and jumped from there to the ground , and , what is " very remarkable , " like the load of voters upset by Sam Weller into the canal , " was never heard of after. * " Individual handwriting , " says Lavater , " is inimitable . The more I compare the different handwritings which fall in my way , the more am I confirmed in the idea that they are so many expressions , so many emanations , of the character of the writer . Every country , every nation , every city has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of painting for , if one hundred painters copy the same figure , an artist will distinguish the copyist . Some years since , a certain hank placed in my hands two promissory notes for large amounts , purporting to he signed by a Mr. Temple and indorsed by a Mr. Conway , and which both maker and indorser pronounced forgeries . Both notes were written on common white paper , and were purchased hy the hank of a certain broker at a time when it was difficult to make loans by discount in the usual manner . Before the maturity of the notes , the broker , who was a Jew , had left for parts unknown . He left behind him no liabilities , unless he might he holden for the payment of the notes above specified , and several others signed and indorsed in the same manner in the hands of other parties . Several attempts had been made hy professional experts to trace resemhlances between the forgeries and the genuine handwriting of said Temple and Conway , as well as the hroker , hut all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissimilar as well could be . The cashier was exceedingly embarrassed by the fact that Mr. Conway was one of the directors of the hank , and he was presumed to have been so * There is a curious story connected with this " clergymen , " which may yet appear in the biography of Mr. S. familiar with his signature as to be incapable of being deceived . After a most diligent investigation and the expenditure of much time and money , and after skilful experts and detectives had given up in despair of ascertaining either the whereabouts of the Jew or anything further till he could he produced , the holders of this paper had settled down quietly in the belief that the broker was the guilty party and that all further effort was useless . At this point of time , when all excitement had subsided , these notes came into my possession . I immediately telegraphed to Mr. Sidney , and it was with great joy that I received the reply that he was on his way . At three o'clock in the morning I met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not another man living for whom he would have left the city of - on a similar message . I thanked him , and we walked to the office . Before arriving there , I had merely informed him that I desired his services in the investigation of a forgery that baffled our art . He demanded all the papers . I produced the forged notes , several genuine checks and letters of Mr. Temple and Mr. Conway , and several specimens of the handwriting of the broker . Long as I live I can never forget the almost supernatural glow that came over his features . I could almost see the halo . No language can describe such a marked and rapid change of countenance . His whole soul seemed wrapt in a delightful vision . I can not say how long this continued , as I was lost in admiration , as he was in contemplation . I spoke , but he seemed not to hear . At last his muscles relaxed , and he began to breathe as if greatly fatigued . He wiped the perspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , - " Sure ! " I asked what was sure . A few minutes elapsed , and he said more loudly , - " As sure as you are horn , " - without seeming to have heard my inquiry . I proposed to state what could be // proved , and the suspicions that were entertained of the cashier . He objected , and said ,  --  " I take my departure from these papers . Mr. Temple is aged thirty-eight , a large , well-built man , full six feet high , strongly nerved , hold , proud , and fearless . His mind is active , and in his day he has been professor in a college . He fares well and is fashionably dressed . I think he is not in any legitimate business . He is a German by birth , though he has been in this country several years . He is somewhat affected and immensely hypocritical . I think he is a gambler and dealer in counterfeit money . He certainly is not confined to one department of rascality . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed he was ever christened at all . He could not have written it in his youth , and must have assumed it within a year and a half . " ( Exact in every known particular . ) " Mr. Conway I at first thought an attorney-at-law , but he is not . I reckon he administers on estates , acts as guardian , and settles up the affairs of the unfortunate in trade as their assignee , in connection with his business of notary and note - shaver . He is aged fifty-six , was born and educated in New England , and is probably a native of this city . He is tall , lean , and bony . His nerves are not steady , and he is easily excited . He probably has the dyspepsia , but he would not lose the writing of a deed to be rid of it . The remarkable feature of his character is stinginess . His natural abilities being good and his mind strong , he must therefore be a man of means , and I think it matters little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , he has considerable pride and caution , which , with his interest , keep him honest , as the world goes . If he were not an old bachelor , I should think better of his heart , and he would be less miser ly . " The Jew 's signature is the most honest of the three . Timidity is the marked character of the man . He could not succeed in any department of roguery . It is physically , as well as mentally and morally , impossible for him to have had any connection with the forgery . He would be frightened out of his wits at the very suggestion of his complicity . " " And so , Mr. Sidney , " said I , " you know all about these parties and the particulars of the forgery ? " " Nothing whatever , " he replied , " save by these specimens of their handwriting . I never heard of the forgery , nor of these men , till this hour . " To which I replied , - " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of them ( saving their moral characters , of which I know little ) without other means of knowledge . It must have been that you knew Temple to be a German , Conway to be the most penurious old bachelor in town , and the broker the most timid . And how , in the name of all that is marvellous , could you have known Conway to be afflicted with dyspcpsia ? " Then , " answered Mr. Sidney , " you are not prepared to believe one other thing , more strange an ( l paradoxical than all the rest . Listen ! These notes are forgeries both of the maker and the indorser . And who think you are the criminals ? " " The Jew ? " " No . " " The cashier ? " " No . But , as sure as you are born , these notes are in the handwriting of Temple and Conway , and the signatures are not only genuine , but they are forgeries also : for both had formed a well-matured and deliberate design of disputing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from my notion of Conway 's character and temperament , as expressed in his handwriting , I venture the assertion that I can make him own it , and pay the notes . He shall even faint away at my pleasure Temple is another kind of man , and would never own it , were it ten times proved . " A meeting of the directors of the bank was to be holden at nine o'clock of the same mornin * . None of them knew Mr. // Sidney , or were known by him . It was arranged that he should meet them , Mr. Conway included , and exhibit his skill , and if he should convince them of his power of divination , he should discuss the genuineness of the signatures of the supposed forgeries . For several hours he was on trial before the board with a very large number of specimens of handwriting of men of mark , and he astonished them all beyond measure by giving the occupation , age , height , size , temperament , strength of nerve , nationality , morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His success was not partial , it was complete . There was not simply a preponderance of evidence , it was beyond a doubt . The directors did not question the fact ; but how was it done ? Some thought mesmerism could account for it , and others thought it miraculous . The first experiment was this . Each director wrote on a piece of paper the names of all the board . Eleven lists were handed him , and he specified the writer of each by the manner in which he wrote his own name . He then asked them to write their own or any other name , with as much disguise as they pleased , and as many as pleased writing on the same piece of paper ; and in every instance he named the writer . As an example of the other experiments , take this one . The superscription of a letter was shown him . He began immediately - " A clergyman , without doubt , who reads his sermons , and is a little shortsighted . He is aged sixty-one , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is lean , bony , obstinate , irritable , economical , frank , and without a particle of hypocrisy or conceit . He is naturally miserly , and bestows charity only from a sense of duty . His mind is methodical and strong , and he is not a genius or an interesting preacher . If he has decided upon any doctrine or construction of Scripture , it would be as impossible to change him as to make him over again . The company began to laugh , when one of them said , - " Come , come , Mr. Sidney , you are diselosino altooether too much of my fa* a ther-in-law . " And now the supposed forged notes were handed him . He gave the characteristics of the signatures very nearly as he had before done in the office , but more particularly and minutely . He analyzed the handwriting , - showed the points of resemblance , where before none could be discerned , - showed that the writing , interpreted by itself , was intended to be disguised , - explained the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the writer was firm in his purpose , and his nerves well braced , and where his fears overcame his resolution , - where he had paused to recover his courage , and for a considerable time , - where he had changed his pen , and how the forgery was continued through several days , - what parts were done by Temple , and what by Conway , - " Till all the interim Between the acting of the dreadful thing And the first motion " was brought so vividly and truthfully to mind that Mr. Conway fell to the floor as if dead . The cashier , relieved from a pressure that had for weary months been grinding his very soul , burst into tears . A scene of strange excitement ensued , during which Mr. Conway muttered incoherent sentences in condemnation of Temple and then of himself , - now with penitence , and then with rage . Recovering his composure , he suggested the Jew as the guilty party . Mr. Sidney then dissected the handwriting of the Jew , and demonstrated that there was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as between the English and the Chinese characters , - showed how the Jew must have been exceedingly timid , and stated the probability that he had left the city not because he had taken any part in the forgery , but because he had been frightened away . Then turning to Conway , he gave him a // lecture such as no mortal before ever gave or received . The agony of Conway 's mind so distorted his body as made it painful in the extreme to all beholders . " His inmost soul seemed stung as by the bite of a serpent . " When at last Mr. Sidney turned and took from hi* valise a small steel safe , which Conway recognized as his own , " the terrors of hell got hold of him , " and his anguish was indescribably horrible . The little safe had been by some unknown and unaccountable process taken from a larger one in Conway 's office , and was unopened . Neither Mr. Sidney nor the directors have ever seen its contents but in consideration that it should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of Mr. Sidney 's description , paid the notes before leaving the bank , and remains a director to this day . As is often the case , the greater criminal goes unwhippcd of justice . Mr. Sidney , besides the faculty I have described , had acquired another , less wonderful perhaps , but still quite remarkable , and which was of incalculable assistance to him in the prosecution of his herculean labor . He was a most rare physiognomist . And by physiognomy is here intended , not simply the art of discernin* the character of the mind by the features of the face , but also the art of discovering the qualities of the mind by the conformation of the body , - and still further , ( although it may not be a legitimate use of the word , ) the power of distin , *uishing the character , mental and moral , the capacity , occupation , and all the distinctive qualities of a person , by his figure , action , dress , deportment , and the like : for Sterne said well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg very differently from a fool . " The ancient Egyptians acquired the greatest skill in this science and Tacitus affirms , not without reason , that their keen perception and acute observation , essential in communicating their ideas in hieroglyphics , contributed largely to their success . Certainly , few better proofs of the YOL . X 43 existence of the science have been furnished than that given by the Egyptian phvsiognomist at Athens in the days of Plato . Zopyrus pronounced the face of Socrates to be that of a lihertine . The physiognomist being derided by the disciples of the great philosopher , Socrates reproved them , saying that Zopyrus had spoken well , for in his younger days such indeed had been the truth , and that he had overcome the proclivities of his nature by philosophy and the severest discipline . Pliny affirms that Apelles could trace the likeness of men so accurately that a physiognomist could discover the ruling passion to which they were subject . Dante 's characters , in his view of Purgatory , are drawn with accurate reference to the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were clever in the art while Kempf and Zimmermann , in their profession , are said seldom to have erred as physiognomists . Surely it is a higher authority , and more practical , which saith , " A wicked man walketh with a frow rd mouth he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers . - A man is known by his look , and a wise man by the air of his countenance . " And yet again , " The wickedness of a woman changeth her face . " If it be true , as Sultzcr declares , that there is not a living creature that is not more or less skilled in physiognomy as a necessary condition of its existence , surely man , with all his parts fitly joined together , should be the most expert and there are circumstances and conditions , as well as qualities of mind and body , which will conduct him more surely along the pathway of his research , and direct him onward towards the goal of perfection . Consider , then , the characteristics of Mr. Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school in which he was taught , in order to determine if there were in him the elements of success . Chiefest among the essential qualities is to be named his astonishing strength of nerve . No danger could agitate him , // however imminent or sudden . No power could deprive him of his imperturbable coolness and courage . Perils seemed to render his mind more clear and his selfreliance more firm . ( And yet I have heard him say , that there was among the band of criminals before mentioned one woman of greater strehgth of mind and nervous power than any person he had ever seen , whom alone of all created beings , whether man or devil , he dreaded to encounter. ) had not Mr. Sidney been thus potently armed , he must , without doubt or question , have become almost a monomaniac ; for , secondly , he was for years enraged almost to madness that his entire estate had been swept from his grasp , as he believed , by the torch of the incendiary ; and he was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the merchant-princes who he supposed had occasioned his impoverishment yet walked abroad with the confidence of the community , and were still trusted by many a good man as the very salt of the city . Nevertheless , Mr. Sidney , solitary and alone , had arraigned them before a criminal tribunal , lie was therefore driven to his own resources , and there was no place in his nature , or in the nature of things , for the first retrograde step . All his vast energies were thenceforth consecrated to , and concentrated in , the detection of crime . And from the time that he was refused payment for his loss , so far as my observation extended , he seemed to have been governed by no other purpose in life than the extermination of that great gang of robbers which he subsequently discovered . Add to these incentives and capacities his extraordinary perceptive faculties and power of analytical observation , together with his wonderful patience , and it must be granted that he was qualified to discover in any incident connected with his pursuits more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater opportunities than almost any other man by which to be informed how it is that " the heart of a man changeth his countenance . " If I remember rightly , it was some two years after our acquaintance commenced that I became aware of Mr. Sidney 's proficiency as a physiognomist , and it was then communicated , not so much by his choice as by a necessity , for the accomplishment of one of his purposes . The object of Mr. Sidney 's visit to the city of P - , at that time , was nothing less difficult than the discovery and identification of an individual of whom no other knowledge or description had been obtained than what could be extracted from the inspection , in another city , of a single specimen of his handwriting in the superscription of a letter . So much from so little . Within three days thereafter , with no other instrumentalities than what were suggested by Mr. Sidney 's expertness in deciphering character in handwriting and his proficiency as a physiognomist , the result was reached and the object happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was important , if not essential , that I should believe that the data were sufficient by which to arrive at a correct conclusion , and that I should confide in Mr. Sidney 's skill in order that there might be hearty codperation . My office was so situated , that from its windows could most advantageously be observed , and for a considerable distance , the vast throng that ebbed and flowed , hour after hour , through the great thoroughfares of the city . For the greater part of three consecutive days I sat by Mr. Sidney 's side , watching the changing crowd through the half-opencd shutters , listening incredulously , at first , to the practical application of his science to the unsuspecting individuals below , till my derision was changed to admiration , and I was thoroughly convinced of his power . As my friends of both sexes passed under the ordeal , it was intensely bewitching . I-Jour after hour would he give , with rapidity and correctness , the occupation and peculiarity of character and condition of almost every individual who passed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not singled out , but all were included . He was a str* nger , and yet better acquainted with the pco // pie than any of our citizens . And this was the manner of his speaking - " That physician has a better opinion of himself than the people have of him : he is superficial , and makes up in effrontery what he lacks in qualification . The gambler yonder , with a toothpick in his mouth , has of late succeeded in his tricks . The affairs of this kind-hearted grocer are troubling him . Werewewithina yard of that round-shouldered man from the country , we should smell leather for he works on his hench , and is unmarried . here comes an atheist who is a joker and stubborn as a mule . There goes a man of no business at all : very probably it is the best occupation he is fitted for , as he has no concentrativeness . The schoolmistress crossing the street is an accomplished teacher , is very sympathetic , and . has great love of approbation . That lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This merchant should give up the use of tobacco , and pay his notes before dinner , else he will become a dyspeptic . Here comes a man of wealth who despises the common people and is miserly and hypocritical and next to him is a scamp . I think it is Burke who says , When the gnawing worm is within , the impression of the ravage it makes is visible on the outside , which appears quite disfigured by it ' : and in that young man the light that was within him has become darkness , and how great is that darkness I " Of some qualities of mind he would occasionally decline to speak until he could see the features in play , as in conversation . Some occupations he failed to discover , if the arms were folded , or the hands in the pockets , or the body not in motion . It is not my purpose to specify any of the rules by which he was governed , though they differed materially from those of Lavater , Redfield , and others , nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give results . I selected from the crowd acquaintances of marked character and standing , and obtained accurate descriptions of them . Of one he said , " lie is a good merchant , and has done and is doing a large business . He carries his business home with him at night , as he should not . lIe has been wealthy , and is now reduced in circumstances . his disaster weighs heavily upon him . He has a high sense of honor , a keen conscience , and is a meek , religious man . He has great goodness of nature , is very modest and retiring , has more ability than he supposes , and is a man of family and very fond of his children . " Another ho accurately described thus : " He is a mechanic , of a good mind , who has succeeded so well that I doubt if he is in active business . Certainly he does not labor . He is very in ( lependent and radical , - can be impudent , if occasion requires , - gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own. ** here the mechanic took his hands from his pocket . " Hold ! I said he was a mechanic . Lie is not , - he is a house-painter . " I desired to be informed by what indications he judged him to be a painter . lie replied , that he so judged from the general appearance and motions , and that it was difficult to specify . I insisted , and he remarked that " the easy roll of his wrists was indicative . " After obtaining similar correct descriptions of men well known to me , I spied one whom I did not know , and who was dressed peculiarly . I inquired his occupation , and Mr. Sidney , without turning a glance towards me , and still gazing through the half-opened shutters , replied , " Yes ! you never saw him before , yourself . lie is a stranger in town , as is evident from the fact of his being dressed in his best suit , and by the manner of his taking observations . Besides , there is no opportunity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a glass-blower . You may perceive he is a little deag and the curvature of his motions also indicates his occupation . " Whether this description was correct or not I failed to ascertain . Mr. Sidney contended that any man of ordinary perceptive *acultic need never // mistake a gambler , as the marks on the tribe were as distinct as the complexion of the Ethiopian , - that , of honest callings , dealers in cattle could be most easily discovered , - that immorality indicated its kind invariably in the muscles of the face , - that sympathetic qualities , love and the desire of being loved , taste and refinement , were among the most perspicuous in the outline of the face . A man of very gentlemanly appearance was approaching , whom Mr. Sidney pronounced a gambler , and also engaged in some other branch of iniquity . His appearance was so remarkably good that I doubted . He turned the corner , and immediately Mr. Sidney hastened to the street and soon returned , sayin he had ascertained his history : that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nerves , aud conse ( *uently his motions , - that he was a stranger in town , and was restless an ( l disquieted , - that he would not remain many hours here , as he had an enterprise on hand , and was about it . I remarked , that , as the contrary never could be proved , he was perfectly safe in his prophecy , when Mr. Sidney rose from his chair , and , approaching me , slowly said , with great energy , - " I will follow that man till it is proved . " The next day but one , I received a note from Mr. Sidney , simply saying , " I am on his track . " He followed the supposed counterfeiter to Philadelphia , where he ascertained that he had passed five-dollar hills of the - bank of Connecticut . Mr. Sidney obtained the hills the gambler had passed to compare with the genuine . Failing , however , to find any of the same denomination , he presented the supposed counterfeits to a broker skilled in detecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were genuine . At Baltimore , he repeated the inquiry at the counter of a well-known hanker relative to other similar bills , and received the same response . So again in Washington , Pittsburg , Chicago , and several other cities whither he had fol lowed the suspected man , and invariably the reply of the cashier would be , " We will exchange our bills for them , Sir . " In some Western cities he was offered a premium on the hills he had collected . At St. Louis he obtained a known genuine bill of the hank in question , and in oompany with a broker proceeded to examine the two with a microscope . The broker pronounced the supposed counterfeits to be genuine . In the mean time the gambler had left the city . Two days after , Mr. Sidney bad overtaken him . So great were his excitement and vexation that he could scarcely eat or sleep . In a fit of desperation , without law and against law , he pounced upon the suspected man and put him in irons . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two went to the gambler 's apartments in company . In a conversation of several hours , Mr. Sidney extracted from him the most valuable information relating to the gang he was so pertinaciously prosecuting , and received into his possession forty-seven thousand dollars in counterfeits of the aforesaid bank , some of which I now have in my possession , and which have been pronounced genuine by our most skilful experts . It would be gratifying to all lovers of science to he informed that the practical knowledge acquired by Mr. Sidney had been preserved , and that at least the elementary principles of the arts in which he became so nearly l ) erfect had been definitely explained and recorded . I am not aware , however , that such is the fact , but am persuaded that his uniform policy of concealment has deprived the world of much that would have been exceedingly entertaining and instructive . That this knowledge has not been preserved is owing mainly to the fact that he considered it of little importance , except as a means for the accomplishment of his purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his withholding from the common gaze the instrumentality by which they were to he attained . That he intended at some fu // ture period to make some communication to the public I am well assured , and some materials were collected by him with this view ; but the hot pursuit of the great idea that he never for an hour lost sight of would not allow sufficient rest from his labors , and he deferred the publication to those riper years of experience and acquirement from which he could survey his whole past career . It may be comforting for all rogues to know that he left behind him no note of that vast amount of statistical knowledge which he possessed , whether appertaining to crimes or criminals in general or in I ) articular , or more especially to the hand of robbers , - and that with him perished all knowledge of this organization as such , and the names of all the parties therewith connected . They also have the consolation , if there he any , of knowing that he was sent prematurely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and in an unknown manner and moment , and that he died in the firm faith of immortality .
