Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Rose Lady . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Walking in the garden , Where the lily blows , I saw a little lady Sitting in a rose . When the little lady laughs , The rose-bud opens wide ; And the dew-drops on the leaves Are tears the lady cried . And when the lady blushes The rose-leaves all turn red ; But when the flower fades away , The little dame is dead . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : When a Child-hides. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Merrily , Maryly , Marigold Queen ! My pussy is hiding , and will not be seen : She hides in the corner , she hides in the dark , But when I have found her , she 'll jump like a lark . She hides in the bedclothes , she hides in the screen : Merrily , Maryly , Marigold Queen !

But from that day , As I 've heard say , He never rose again : For in the pail The lazy snail Doth quietly remain . And in the well He means to dwell Till summer comes again . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Fiddle and the Shoes . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) I had a fiddle which lay on the shelf ,  --  A beautiful fiddle , which played of itself ,  --  Jinkety , junkety , crambo ; And silver shoes , with lining red , Which walked in the morning to my bed , With a rumpety , bumpety , slambo . But early one morn , at break of day , I found that my fiddle had walked away ,  --  Jinkety , junkety , crambo . In the right-hand shoe my fiddle did go , The left one carried my rosin and bow , With a rumpety , bumpety , slambo . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1864 ) If sunlight shines while the shower falls , The rainbow rises over the walls ; Violet , Indigo , Blue and Green , Yellow , Orange and Red , are seen . One end rises up in the air ; But where is the other end ? Oh , where ? Where the rainbow touches the ground , There a pot of money is found . But the boy who never killed a frog , Or threw a stone at a cat or dog , Is the only one , as I have been told , Who ever can find the rainbow-gold . P.S.  --  Read the rainbow song once more , Find seven words  --  not less or more  --  Whose first letters spell out V-I-B-G-Y-O-R Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Miss Fidgets . Dreadful Intelligence ! from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Saturday night , Fidgety Nervousness perished of fright ! She was scared at a mouse which ran into a hole ; She screamed at a bug which she found in the bowl ; She yelled at a petticoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gun going by ; She squalled at a spider which fell on her veil , And cried at a hat and a coat on a nail . A chestnut at roast , which went pop in the fire , Alarmed her so much that she thought she 'd expire : The lightning at last drove her out of her wits , To conniption convulsions and cranberry fits : High-faluting hysterics then seized on her mind , And the hickory spasms soon left her quite blind ; Her nerves were so stretched that they could n't untune ' em , And she died in a state of E pluribus Unum ! They sent for a doctor to stop the fit , But he could n't help her a single bit ; For before he arrived at her bedside , With a dreadful squeal , Miss Fidgety died . So they buried her under an aspen-tree ; And its leaves keep trembling , as all may see , Shaking and shivering , by night and by day , Till the winter comes and they 're frozen away . Leland , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Over the river and down the hill , Where grass and flowers are growing , Over the meadow I 'll chase you still , To where the boys are mowing . Over the meadow Miss Clarity ran , And over the rock she stumbled ; And down she went , like a rolling pan , Till into the brook she tumbled . And down the river Miss Clarity flew , And over the cataract after ; And out she paddled , wet through and through , But still could n't speak for laughter . They laid her to dry on the new-mown hay , And , while she lay there sunning , She said she would race for a penny a day , And beat us all round at running . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Donkey . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) The donkey went to the pigeon 's ball ; Next day he made a morning call : He sent up a green leaf for a card , By a pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maid , " I 'm sorry to say , My lady do n't receive to-day : But if she had known that you would come , I am very sure she 'd be at home . " Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Great Singer . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) You really ought to hear me sing : I do n't believe you ever , In all your life , heard any thing Which sounded half so clever . My voice would make a lover run From her he most adored : It sounds just like a carpenter When sawing at a board . Whene'er I raise my voice in song , It reaches to the eaves ; And when I try , the fancy notes , The peach-trees shed their leaves . The style I have is quite my own ; I can not rivalled be : There is no man in all the land Who sings a bit like me .

Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Rackety , Crackety ! from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Rackety , crackety , kettles and crumbs ! Save up your pence till a holiday comes ! Save up your pence till you go to the fair , And buy me a bodkin to twist in my hair : Save up your pence till a pedlar comes by , And get me a brooch , or I 'll whimper and cry : Get me a dolly , and get me a top , Get me a ball , or I 'll cry and I 'll hop ; Get me a dog , which goes bow-wow , and bark ; Get me a beautiful red Noah 's ark ,  --  Soldiers and bayonets , trumpets and drums . Rackety , crackety , kettles and crumbs ! Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Toads. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Over the forest and far away , Where the hills are green and the rocks are gray , There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year the toads all go . And there they are changed to ladies fair , With great black eyes and curly hair , And have fawn-skin dresses , and feather rings , And wampum beads , and beautiful things . There they dance , and there they play , Where the hills are green and the rocks are gray ; But it only lasts till there falls a rain , And they all are turned into toads again . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Burra Glone. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Burra glone ! burra glone ! My wife 's away , and I 'm alone . The swallows down the chimney flew , And scattered the pots and pans ; The little black cat danced on the floor , And her eyes looked like a man 's . Burra glone ! burra glone ! I 've lost my darlings every one ,  --  The rat , the cat , the dog , the bat , And the wolf who stole my tongs , The owl who came with her eyes aflame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : When a Child is too inquisitive . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Yes  --  Wherefore ?

" " Why  --  because it is not straight . " Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : King Orian. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) On a roaring wild bull King Orian rides , And spurs with a dagger his tawny sides ; The wild north wind is his friend so true , And over the mountain King Orian flew . He rode to the east , and he rode to the west , Till he found a boy in an eagle 's nest ; And over the water , and over the foam , King Orian rode , with the wild-boy , home . King Orian lives in the sunset red , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long beard the wild boy crept , And safely the king and the wild boy slept . A falling star is King Orian 's sword , And deep in the mountain his gold is stored ; And when night comes on , and the clouds go by , He roars with the boy on the mountain high . So listen , my children , when winter comes , And hear in the tempest King Orian 's drums ; And when storm and the winds are beating high , The king and his wild boy are riding by . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : I 'm Going Away . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) I 'm going this winter to France and to Spain , But my baby will see me next winter again : She 'll watch at the window , she 'll watch at the door , Till she hears my feet treading without on the floor ; And then , when I hold her again in my arm , I 'll pet her , and nurse her , and fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from over the sea , And I 'll love her , and kiss her , and she shall kiss me . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Devils Needle ! from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) On the brook , How trim and neat and nice you look ! " Well may I be fair to see , For my love has come to dance with me . " " How can you dance ? " " On our wings so strong , Over the trees , all summer long , She darts and dances high and low , And after her like the wind I go . There is music for our dancing wings Where the locust pipes and the tree-toad sings ; And one with his wife in the dogwood-tree Cries Katy-Did and Did n't to me . " " Devil 's Needle ! What do you eat ? " " The insects that hurt you are my meat ; For though I never bite nor sting , I catch mosquitoes on the wing , And gallinippers in the Spring . So let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you any harm . " Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Going out in the Rain . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) There was once a little boy Went out to walk in the rain ; He wandered far away , And never came home again . He went up into the clouds ,  --  He can not get away ; And so he goes floating on , For there he has to stay . He runs about in the clouds , In all the mist and foam , And sometimes over the edge He looks down at his dear old home . There his mother sits and cries ; There his aunt is full of fears ; And his father always sighs ; While even the cat 's in tears . Their heads with grief they bow Whenever they see it rain ; And pussy-cat cries , " Mee-ow ! He 'll never come back again !

Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Rose-Bush . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) I had a little rose-bush , Which grew beside my bed ; It used to talk of summer , And pretty things it said . And when I woke at midnight , I heard a lovely strain : It was my rose-bush singing , Until I slept again . There came two little rose-buds , And then my talks were o'er : Good-bye , my pretty rose-bush ! It speaks to me no more . Two buds upon the branches ,  --  Two leaves upon the stem : To me the bush is silent , And only sings to them .

Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Fish-Fortune. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) When you 're by the river , If you see a fish Jumping from the water , You should make a wish . And if you can speak it Before he 's out of sight , The wish will all be granted That very day or night . Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : The Star . from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) If you will take a looking-glass , And hold it to a star , And look upon it at the light Which comes from heaven afar , While you are looking in the glass , If never a word you speak , An angel will come down from heaven And kiss you on the cheek .

Leland , Charles Godfrey , 1824-1903 : Fairies at Marbles. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Fairies play at marbles : When the moon is bright , You may see them rolling All the summer night .

There never were people half so neat ; They scrub the rocks with hands and feet ; They polish the stones wherever they 're found ; And that 's what makes the pebbles so round . And when you walk by the water bright , And find a pebble round and white , You may see for yourself what the fairies do , Who placed it there as a present for you .

Where the smoke is rising , Pau-puck-kee-wis spreads ; All the world despising , he goes above their heads ; Blowing , flowing , growing , going , Shading , fading , masquerading , In the smoke he spreads . Where the river 's falling , Pau-puck-kee-wis gleams ; In its noisy brawling , in its flashing beams ; Thumping , bumping , plumping , jumping , Flashing , dashing , crashing , plashing , In the leaping streams . Where the pines are moaning with one long old Huron word , All the summer droning , when by breezes stirred , Humming , drumming , softly strumming , With a murmured , muttering thrumming , Like a storm forever coming , Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Indian Squaw. from Mother Pitcher 's poems For Little People ( 1864 ) Indian squaw goes up and down , Selling baskets , through the town : A little brown boy runs by her side , And a little pappoose to her back is tied . The Indian squaw wears blankets blue , With a moccasin instead of a shoe , Worked with quills in white and red , And has a hat upon her head . If mamma had been an Indian squaw , She 'd have worn a hat just like papa , And carried baskets up and down , And my face would have been all Indian brown .
