1 ' HERE are three classes of minds among men , and three groups of objecU * in the world  --  the curious , the scientific , and the practical . Not that any one mind or any single object is either of these to the entire exclusion of the other two ; but in every mind and in every object one or another of these characteristics prevails ; and this fact should be recognized in all discussion of a subject , and its three several aspects be presented separately , in order that each may produce its greatest impression . To pass from generals to particulars , some of my readers may have been interested in the discovery of the Neplilla plu ; nzpes ( the so-called silk spider of South Carolina ) , in its habits , and in the rather comical process by which its silk may be reeled from its body , as milk is drawn from a cow ; some of them , too , may have been impressed by what is already known of its structure , its develop . ment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all which have been more or less fully treated of elsewhere. * But there may have been others who cared for all these things only so far as they looked toward making some practical use of the silk ; and who , admitting that the spider 's habits are quite curious , and that what is already known of its structure and development render it a worthy subject of further investigation , nevertheless demand that some more explicit statement shall be made respecting the value of spiders ' silk ; who want to know whether a spider is or is not as good as a silk-worm ; whether it costs more or less to keep ; whether its silk is more or less desirable ; and , finally , how many of them will be required to produce a yard of fabric of a given weight and price . To these questions , the pertinence of which is fully admitted , will now be made such answers as are furnished by our present information ; but it must be first distinctly understood that these answers are based upon experiments made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that they are , therefore , at best , only approximate . Those who ask the questions must decide for themselves whether or no they justify trying the experiments upon a larger scale and vith a direct view to pecuniary advantage . What , then , are the advantages and the disadvantages of spiders and of spiders ' silk , as compared with silk worms and with ordinary silk or other fabrics . There are three ways of approaching the subject , first , through the spider itself  --  the physiological way ; second , through the silk  --  the physical way ; third , through the apparatus with which it is to be obtained  --  the mechanical way . As a man of science , I would prefer the first of these ; but as that privilege has always been allowed me in the previous presentation of the subject , and as this is understood to be a practical article for practical men , we ought to prove , first , that the silk is worth having , and that it can be used , before alluding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its production . 1. - ADVANTAGES OF SPIDERS ' SILK Perhaps its greatest , and cert*tinly its most obvious advantage over all other known fabrics , is one which it is impossible to represent , and which even words * Proceedings American Acad .

If you can picture to yourself a mass of pure and yellow gold , which not only reflects the light as from a smooth and polished surface , but which has all the depth and softness of liquid amber , you may realize in some degree the wonderful appearance of a sheet of spiders ' silk as seen in the sunshine ; and even in the shade its lustre is greater than that of gold . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half of the story ; for the same spider yields silver as well , so that you may draw from its body a thread of gold or a thread of silver , or both threads together ; their union giving silk of a light yellow color . These two differently-colored silks are drawn from two different parts of the spinning organ , which will be described hereafter ; and not only are their colors thus distinct , but also their other physical properties ; for the yellow is elastic , and may be stretched slightly and regain its former length , while the white is inelastic , and at once crinkles up when tension is removed during the process of drawing it from the spider . The two kinds of silk are employed also in the construction of different parts of the web ; but that has been sufficiently described elsewhere . Beauty and strength are natural partners , and we do not look in vain for the latter quality in spiders ' silk . It is indeed something prodigious as compared with even the strength of metals . A bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-eight tons ; a bar of steel fifty-eight tons , and , according to computation based upon the fact that a fibre only one four-thousandth of an inch in diameter will sustain fifty-four grains , a bar of spiders ' silk an inch in diameter would support a weight of seventy-four tons . I do not know how this compares with the strength of ordinary silk ; but it is natural to suppose the spiders ' to be the stronger , since each fibre is composed of a large number of still smaller fibrilke , whereas that of the worm is a single , or , at most , a double fibre . It is , doubtless , the extreme delicacy of the ultimate fibrilke of the silk that gives its surface the softness and depth already alluded to ; and even the ordinary fibres are only one seven-thousandth to one four-thousandth of an inch in diameter , and perfectly round and smooth , while that of the worm is about one two thousandth of an inch in diameter , and apt to be flattened and irregular . This very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk ; but it is only a real objection to those who do not desire a fine and delicate fabric , and the same could be brought up against ordinary silk as compared with cotton and wool . It is true that it is impossible to un*vind a single fibre of spider 's silk after it has once been wound upon a reel ; but it would be quite as impracticable to unwind the thread of a single cocoon ; the fibres of several cocoons must be combined so as to form a thread of manageable size , and the same method is applicable to the spider ; we have only to draw the silk from a number of spiders at once , and arrange the reel so as also to twist them into one thread , and the apparent difficulty wholly disappears . It is quite possible , too , that there are other and larger tropical species of spiders , especially of this genus Nephila , which will be found to yield silk of larger fibre and in greater abundance . It is useless to look for this among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their silk is scanty in amount , and pale grey or white in color . I may here allude to some previous statements concerning the rarity of the Nephila plumipes , which rarity might be considered an objection in a business point of view , as implying an ability to exist in any other than its natural habitat . Since the first specimens were found upon Folly and Long Islands , south of // 103 Charleston harbor , specimens or accurate descriptions have been sent from islands near Port Royal , from St. Simond 's Island , Georgia , and from Louisiana , where , indeed , the single specimen formerly described by Koch , was found . In no case , however , have they been found away from the coast , and as I have reared them from the eggs to maturity in a Northern winter , by keeping them in closed cases with a humid atmosphere like that of their native swamps , we must conclude that moisture is the only real necessity in its acclimatization . The relative humidity was indicated as 70 upon the hygrodeik ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aside from its excessive fineness , the only thing to be said against the silk is the small quantity which a single spider will yield , as compared with the production of a silk-worm . And when it is admitted that the latter spins a big cocoon which yields , upon an average , three hundred yards of silk , weighing about three grains , while the average length which can be reeled from a spider at one time is only one hundred and fifty yards , which is so much finer as to weigh but one-twentieth of a grain , our quantitative comparison looks rather discouraging and lessens the satisfaction we had derived from the previous comparison of quality . But there are several other facts to be considered which tend to greatly reduce this discrepancy between the productiveness of the two insects ; some of these relate directly to the one and some to the other . Let us first reduce the silk furnished by the worm from its apparent to its true amount . Three grains represents the average gross weight of silk yielded by one cocoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would materially interfere with its manufacture that it has to be cleansed by prolonged boiling in soap and water , which process costs each cocoon one-quarter of its weight , leaving the real amount of available silk supplied by each worm , two and a quarter grains ; but even this is forty-five times the yield of a single spider , and any practical inquirer will not gain much comfort from the comparison . Having now placed the worm 's production in its true light , what can we say of the spider to increase the statement of its yield ? So far from being destroyed , as is the worm , for the sake of one cocoon , and thereby being prevented from doing further service in way of laying its eggs , the spider is not at all injured by the reeling process and , after a day or two of rest , is ready to ) ield us a second hundred and fifty yards , more or less , and then a third and a fourth , until it has been reeled from , say twenty times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit of their capacity , under favorable conditions , but it will seen that , even granting it to be so , and its season to be limited to a month , the spider of a whole season is twenty times as valuable as the spider of a single day , and the total yield would be abOut three thousand yards , weighing just one grain . Now , the worm yields only two and a quarter times as much as this , and that is the end of it . Like the swan , it expends all its life in a last effort ; but the spider , like the canary , does something every day , and when no longer able to produce silk , can provide for future generations by laying five hundred or more eggs . Admitting then that a worm yields two and a quarter times as much as a spider . what is the number of each required for a piece of woven silk ? A yard of silk varies greatly in weight , and somewhat too in quality , and of course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as to weight and cost , a cheap silk at two dollars and fifty cents weighs from one half to three fourths of an ounce per // yard . A rich silk at from six dollars to ten dollars weighs two ounces or a little over . And between these two , the ordinary grades in which the majority of people are interested cost from three dollars to five dollars per yard , and weigh from one to one and a quarter ounces . An ounce is four hundred and thirty-seven and a half grains ( avoirdupois ) , and as each spider yields one grain , it will require , in round numbers , four hundred and fifty to produce a yard of silk ; or fifty-four hundred for an ordinary dress-pattern of twelve yards . The number of worms required for the same is to be ascertained by dividing those figures by two and a quarter , which makes , in round numbers , two hundred worms for a yard , and twenty-four hundred for a dress . And now supposing ( for the sake of comparison ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money as a worm , and that , therefore , a fabric of spiders ' silk costs two and a quarter times as much as one of ordinary silk , that fact by no means indicates that the former is not worth having . Honey costs more than molasses , but every body of taste thinks it worth the difference ; a steel knife is all very well , but a silver one is worth the difference in cost to all who can afford to pay it . A cotton or woollen dress is not to be despised by any one , but every women prefers a silken gown , and counts the increased price as small compared to the greater satisfaction it affords ; and now , so far at least , as we can judge , as honey is to molasses , as silver to steel , as silk to cotton , so is the product of our spider to that of the worm ; and the superior beauty , and elegance , and delicacy of the fabric will , no doubt , more than compensate for the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiders ' silk , which is apparent to all , but which I hope to prove real to but very few . It is drawn from the body of what sensitive ladies call a " horrid spider . " It may seem rash to enumerate beauty among the advantages of our spider ; but the instinctive denial of such a quality is , in great measure , due to the extreme ugliness of its more common relatives ; and I think very fe*v unprejudiced people would be willing to say the Nephila plumipes is positively ugly ; it has been compared to a passion-flower ; and , indeed , its graceful outlines , the slender tufted legs , and the combinations of black and orange and white and olivebrown , together with the golden web flashing in the sunlight as the breeze sways it to and fro upon its supporting boughs , all this is really beautiful . But supposing it to be one of the ugly black poisonous fellows that lurk in our cellars , or in the fields , yet " Handsome is that handsome does ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar because in its reuning are used blood and other disagreeable matters , and to give up letter-writing because ink has for its basis an ugly excrescence from an oak , and even to leave unworn their silks and satins because they certainly are produced by the fat , sluggish and , as Dickens would say , " demmed damp , disagreeable body " of a caterpillar-until I repeat they are ready to make all these not-to-be-thought-of concessions to sentiment , they must not try to resist the temptation which will surely assail the*m some day in the shape of a dress , or veil , or ribbon of spiders ' silk . 111. - MACHINERY . Having now , I trust , become convinced that spiders ' silk is worth having , the next question of the practical man will be , how do you get it and how is it to be manufactured ? First catch your spider , is a necessary preliminary , and although this matter // properly belongs to the last division of our subject , it may be well to quiet the apprehensions of any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sharp jaws of the Nephila plumipes , as elsewhere figured , and fears that it is an untamable creature which will resist an attempt to abstract its silken stores . I will leave the complete removal of this apparent obstacle until we come to consider the spider itself in all its relations , and merely say now that it seldom tries to escape or to bite ; that you have only to get its body between thumb and finger so that two legs are turned backward , to be perfectly safe from injury by its jaws ; and that all you have then to do is to secure it in such a manner as to accomplish the following objects : First. - To render its escape impossible . Second. - To avoid injuring it . Third-To prevent the legs from reaching the thread . Fourth-To give the legs some occupation . Fifth. - To invert the body . Sixth. - To make this inverted position comfortable . The importance of the first object is obvious ; and it is hardly necessary to dwell upon the extreme vexation caused by your spider getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with others , so as to spoil what you are doing and perhaps lose a leg or two in the fray . But while its confinement must be secure , great care must be taken not to inflict an injury upon either body or legs ; for a very slight wound of the former will prove fatal , and every leg has its own use , although the spider may get along after a fashion with less than the proper number . These precautions are necessary if you care to wind from the same spider more than once . Vhile making its web , and while running upon the ground , the spider always allows its thread to run between the claws of its hinder feet , which it employs as guides , alternately ; and such is the force of the instinct which leads it thus to hold on to its " line of retreat , " that when surprised or interfered with in any way , the first movement is of one hind foot to grasp the thread ; and by this means it will effectually prevent your drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected , its eight legs are not idle when its body is confined ; and as their length and strength enable it to reach and to pull upon the adjoining parts of the confining apparatus , and thereby either derange that , or twist its own body , it is quite important that some smooth and rounded body should be accessible which it may grasp , yet not be able to fix its claws upon too firmly . The inversion of the whole body is desirable , in view of the shape of the abdomen and the position of the FIGURE z. spinning organs ( Fig. 1 , 5 ) , for the thread sometimes breaks near the body , and we must then be able to seize the end which projects from the spinners . And as this inversion is not the natural position of the insect , ( for I refer here , not to its attitude in the *veb , where it hangs head downward , but to its being placed in the apparatus upon the back instead of the belly ) . we are bound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make that position comfortable . And finally , after carefully providing for its bodily comfort , we may recognize its excited mental condition , and its wrath at being fastened ignominiously in the stocks , in order that // JULY , its precious silken store may be stolen with impunity ; and may do what we can to calm its nerves by offering it a fly or a bit of chicken 's liver , which it generally accepts and devours with relish . In the figure above , the legs of the spider are removed . P represents the palpi or feelers ; A , the projecting shoulders of the abdomen ; S , two pair of large spinners ; I , papilla , through which opens the intestine . As may be imagined , an apparatus which should fulfil all the above conditions and be , at the same time , simple and compact , was not contrived without many experiments and failures , and long study of the form and disposition of of the spider . It so happened that the first from which I wound* silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stupid or so anxious to promote scientific investigations as to remain perfectly quiet for an hour and a quarter ; but its successors were less considerate ; I tried to fasten them by pins stuck in a sheet of cork and crossed over their backs ; but they pulled the pins out and got into great confusion ; a contrivance was adopted by which all the legs were grasped between a rubber band and a strip of metal ; but as the third leg on each side is much smaller than the others , these would soon be extricated , and then one by one the rest would follow ; and if they vere so tightly held as not to escape themselves , the spider was very apt to cast them loose . I tried a card with a long slot cut into one side , down which the body of the inverted spicIer was dropped so as to rest the pedicle connecting the two parts of the body upon the bottom of the slot ; another card was then let into slits cut on both sides of the slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedicle ; by this means the head and jaws and legs were left upon one side of the card partition and the abdomen upon the other ; but aside from the flimsy nature of the materials , and the ease with which the spider could disengage itself there was the great disadvantage of its requiring both hands to work it ; still it was with this that most of my specimens of silk were obtained . The device of Termever , * which came to my notice in the spring of i866 , was very ingenious and quite well adapted to the shape of the spiders he employed ; but it did not at all fulfil the last three conditions , and was wholly inapplicable to the peculiar form of the Nephila plum ipes . After many trials , the contrivance which I have FIGURE 2. adopted consists of two large corks , a bent hair-pin , two large common pins , a bit of card and a bit of lead . One cork serves as a base , ( Fig. 2 ) . Its bottom is loaded with the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angle of forty-five degrees ; upon the oblique surface so formed is fixed the piece of card , its upper edge projecting an eighth of an inch ( Fig. 2 , C ) ; into the remaining half of the upper end is cut a broad and shallow groove ( Fig. 2 , G ) , and upon each sjde of this groove , at the middle of its length , the two pins are stuck into the cork , so as to be about an inch apart ( Fig. 2 , P P ) ; and now when the insect is held with the legs behind the back and laid upside down into the groove , the projecting shoulders of the abdomen ( A , Fig . I ) bring up against the edge of the card , and the legs are kept in front of the two pins . But the spider will not stay in that position unless the rest of the apparatus is used . The second cork ( Fig. 3 ) is rounded and * Two Hundred Thousand Spiders. // smoothed at its smaller end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the lower corner of the larger end so as to form an angle of forty-five degrees **ith the lower side ; one or two tacks will retain the pin in its place ; at the distance of a quarter or third of an inch from the cork , the pin is bent outward on both sides so as to double its width , and then straightened . Now push the ends of the pin down between the card and the first cork , with the rounded end of the second cork projecting over the card . ( Fig. 4 . ) This may be done with the left forefinger while the first cork is held between the second finger and thumb ; the spider 's abdomen is now put through the opening formed by the pin on each side , the cork above , and the cork below ; its abdomen rests in the oroove , the shoulders come agairst the card , the upper cork is pressed down so that the narrow part of the pin embraces the pedicle ; the legs being set free , fly up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is fixed upon * screw , turned around so that the abdomen of the spider points to the right ; and we are ready to begin the reeling process . ( Fig. 5 . ) This is simple enough so far as mere experiment and scientific investigation are concerned ; the reel is either a cylinder or ring of some smooth substance as hard rubber , or consists of a set of radii set into an axle , and having their ends bent at a right angle and enamelled so as to present an even surface to the delicate silk . The reel I used had radii about three inches in length ; this made the whole diameter six inches , and of course at every revolution eighteen inches of silk were reeled upon it ; the motion could be quite rapid , and if steady , one or even two feet of silk could be drawn each second , so that a very few minutes would suffice to exhaust the day 's supply of a spider . Figure 5 represents the spider secured in the apparatus , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thread of a single spider can not be unwound , and the only way of using it when thus drawn upon the reel , is to cut the band at one point and twist it up in the fingers so as to form a thread composed of two or three hundred strands , according to the number of revolutions made . This thread is very strong , and by tying a number of such pieces together a long thread was obtained , which was doubled once or twice , and then put into a power loom and woven as a woof upon a warp of black silk ; thus simply demonstrating the feasibility of using spiders ' silk in manufacture . Now , in order to obtain a compound thread of such size as to permit us to unwind it from the reel , we have only to arrange a large number of spiders , and carry their combined threads upon the reel ; by well-known mechanical contrivances the reel itself ( which must not be a slender spindle ) may be made to revolve in two directions , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be nothing to hinder carrying the silk directly from the spider 's body to the sewing machine or the loom , for there is no gum to be removed , and its natural colors are beyond the capability of art . // juLr Before 1earnh*g that the spin- FIGURE 4. die itself could be made to revolve , so as to twist the silk of several spiders into a single thread , I had adopted a suggestion to attach the spiders themselves to the periphery of a disc , the revolution of which would accomplish the same object ; the small size of spiders ' brains and the constant position of this species head downward , relieved this plan from the charge of bringing on vertigo in the insects thus made to revolve ; but a more serious and indeed a fatal objection was that when once the apparatus was in motion , they were lost sight of ; the operator could not see when any thread broke , and if be could the spider could not be removed , or even its thread regained , without stopping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the same process applicable to the silk-worm as well ? I wish it were . For although the spiders ' silk would still be , in my opinion , far superior in many respects , yet there are some purposes for which ordinary silk is not only good enough , but better ; and especially would it prove an advantage in dealing with the so-called " American silk worm " ( Zella Polyphemus ) the cocoon of which it is impossible to unwind except by a process invented by Mr. Trouvelot. * But although some of this , and of other species of silk-producing larwe were obtained , it was at once found that the worm has the power of controlling the flow of silk through its mouth-tube , and of course speedily shut off the supply when we tried to reel it off ; chloroform was tried , but without success ; and so the experiment failed , although I still hope that an an*esthetic may be found which shall suspend the worm 's control over the orifice . The spider can retard the flow of silk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the reeling is regular it can not wholly prevent it . IV. - ORIGIN OF THE SILK . We have seen what the silk is ; we have learned how to obtain it ; and now we inquire whence does it come ? The spinning organs are located at the posterior extremity of the body and not upon the head , as in the worm ; and the difference in the mode of life of the two insects is a sufficient reason for the change without calling in the aid of the old proverb , " The spider lost her distaff and was ever after obliged to spin through her tail . " But the limits of this article make it impossible to enter fully into the structure of the internal and external silk-producing organs , for there are many points yet little understood , and what is known of them in this species has been told elsewhere . Were everything certain a few words would suffice here , but a detailed expression of various opinions would be out of place * American Naturalist . // V.-DISADVANTAGES OF THE SPIDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk , it is also a catcher of flies ; it is not merely an abdomen , but a head and chest , and legs and eyes , and even poison fangs , which are big enough and sharp enough to warrant us in a careful inquiry as to its disposition to use them . For if the spider is ferocious and intractable , our information concerning its silk and the means of getting and using it is of little value . But while admitting the fact that spiders have a very poor reputation for docility , and a very unenviable one as to poisonous qualities , let us be fair and impartial . " Give a dog a bad name and then hang him , " is a rule adopted too often with other animals as well as with dogs and men . Every Judas is not a traitor ; all serpents are not venomous ; and because one spider bites and poisons its prey . This by no means proves that all spiders would or could be guilty of the same thing . Indeed , the comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the black snake and many others need no fangs , because the strength of their bodies enables them to crush their preM to death ; and so although the short-legged , thick-bodied and dark-colored spiders which make no web , but lurk in holes or wander in the fields , or run upon the fences , and take their prey by leaping like a tiger , must have the means of killing it soon , in the shape of jaws furnished FiGURE 6. with virulent poison , which has no doubt often proved fatal to men , yet we ought not to look for such powers in the brighter-colored garden and forest spiders , whose broad and strong net is often able to entangle the most powerful insects and even young birds ; no doubt they all have venom , but the experiment of Mr. Blackwell upon the largest English garden spiders , which he forced to bite him in several places without any injury whatever , confirm the trial made with a full-grown and vigorous Nephila plumipes upon a little kitten . The spider was squeezed until it snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held so as to be deeply bitten in several places , but the little thing only mewed , and never gave any sign of permanent injury . But even if no real harm could result , it is not pleasant to be snapped at by such jaws as the spider 's , and two precautions may be followed . 1st . To wear thick kid gloves . 2d . To handle the spiders very gently , and avoid irritating them , for ordinarily they may be allowed to run over our clothes and even upon the hands , although occasionally if a heavy one finds itself in danger of falling , the jaws offer to assist the legs . Under the head of disadvantages we must include two very unpleasant facts . ist , that the young devour each other to such an extent that , as a rule , only a very few out of the several hundred hatched in every cocoon ever reach the age when they separate and build isolated webs ; and , 2d , that the female spider is apt to devour her partner sometimes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This latter fact is not of so much consequence ; for the females are the spinners , and are always in the majority , not only in the number but also in the size of the individuals ( the female being about one hundred and twenty-five times as large as the male ) , and the males can be easily protected . But the terrible destruction which , in a state of nature , seems necessary in order that a portion shall grow at all , is a very serious obstacle in the way of any increase of the species . This killing of each other , however , is not , apparently , from malice but from hunger , and both experiment and inference indicate that it may be almost entirely prevented by supplying the young and growing spiders // with suitable food . Each cocoon spun by the parent spider contains from five hundred to . a thousand eggs , all of which hatch , generally in the course of a month . For several days , or even weeks , they remain huddled together in the cocoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from absorption of moisture from the air , must be at the expense of the community ; nor can it be well prevented . But after this time has passed , and they begin to come forth , either singly or in parties , and spin their little lines over the leaf to which the cocoon is attached , they may be in great measure prevented from further cannibalism by putting in their reach drops of blood or crushed flies , or very minute flies , or bugs of almost any kind . If large numbers of them are to be reared , a special apartment should be arranged for them ; each cocoon should be attached to the top of a wire frame of say a foot in height and nearly the same diameter , which must stand in a shallow dish of water , lest the spiders travel about the room and collect in great numbers at the top , where they could not be cared for . They will spin at first an irregular common web , and eat together from whatever food falls upon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another frame over the first ; for they always ascend . After several weeks , they suddenly change their instincts ; and from living together in some sort of fellowship , which really does not seem to be incompatible with their peculiar style of eating each other up , they attempt to isolate themselves , and to make each for itself its own web , which is now geometrical , like that of the full-grown spiders ; and as they now need more room , and will jealously resent any trespassing upon their particular territory , it is time to remove them to the frames , which will be described in the following section . It is impossible to say how large a percentage may by this plan be reared from one cocoon ; but the fact that two or three out of every hundred have been saved at a first trial , under very unfavorable conditions , shows what may be expected of a plan like the above systematically conducted upon a large scale . As to the food of the young , there are some sub stances which breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in a place communicating with the outer air and another room ; but covered with fine wire netting . This would exclude the larger species , but would admit the little ones to deposit their eggs upon the meat , etc. ; and the flies produced therefrom could enter the apartment . The growing spider , like the worm , casts its skin several times before reaching its full size , and in both the operation is attended by some danger . It is , no doubt , a disadvantage , that the spider , in moulting , is obliged to draw eight such very long legs from their old skins ; but although the legs may be occasionally pulled off in the process , yet they generally separate at the second joint from the body , and thereby no blood is lost ; and moreover , although each pair of legs has its appointed office , they may act vicariously . To offset the liability to injury in consequence of their more complicated structure , the spiders are not known to be subject to diseases , such as have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not be sure that some maladies will not follow their domestication . VI-SPAcE REQUIRED flY THE SPIDER . The great obstacle to a final comparison of the worm and the spider in this respect , lies in the difference of opinion among sericu lturists as to what is required by the former ; so all I can do is to state as nearly as possible the amount of space needed for a given number of spiders ; this must , of course , be far less than they naturally occupy , for in their native woods , two or three , or at most // 1869 . THE PRACTICAL VIEW OF SPIDERS ' SILK . half a dozen , spre*d their great nets each three or four feet in diameter among the branches of a tree , and when left to locate themselves in a room , each spider constructs a web over a window or across a corner ; and as they rarely OCCUPY the same spot for many days , they would soon interfere in their wanderings , the rather since their eight eyes do not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they may be circum- FIGURE 7. scribed in the following manner : Make an incomplete ring one foot in diameter of thick galvanized iron *vire , and set the two ends into a plate of the same metal six inches wide and fifteen long ( Fig. 7 ) ; set the ring a little obliquely because the spiders will not make their webs upon a vertical frame , and wind a thread spirally around the *vire to afford some support to its claws . By setting the base-plate into water , you completely isolate the spider , which after running around the ring a few times , proceeds to construct a web after the manner fully described elsewhere . A shallow trough of water , ten feet long , would hold eight of these frames placed end to end , and if made a foot wide there would be two such rows , the rings inclining FIGURE 8. away from each other as in Fig. 8 . At the height of eighteen inches above the bottom of the trough another similar one may be placed , and above that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space six feet high , ten feet long and one foot wide we have sixtyfour spiders ; but when more are required we must make some provision for passing among them ; andapassage of at least three feet wide is required between each two such double-rows ; which space divided between the two single rows , adds a foot and a half to the practical width of the space required by each spider ; and we have now , as the minimum for one individuai , a space two feet wide , eighteen inches high , and fifteen inches long , or three and three-quarters cubic feet ; and from this unit it is very easy to estimate the space required for a given number of spiders ; for instance , l ) y having floors one above the other so as to give a height of about thirty feet , eight thousand spiders may be accommodated in a room forty feet long and twentyfive feet wide ; and eight thousand spiders would yield less than a yard of the medium silk at one reeling , or about eighteen yards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two other requirements to be observed , in making accommodation for the spiders : First , that the air be both warm and moist ; so as to resemble that of their native swamps . Second , That the roof be wholly or in part of glass , so as to let the direct rays of the sun upon them . It is certain that they do not thrive in the dark , but there is also some reason to believe that the yellow color of the gum in the silk-bags , which we have described as lying just below the skin , is du* to the action of light ; at any rate the colorless gum is contained in the bags which are in the centre of the abdomen . But the spider has one most decided advantage over the worm . Its food costs almost nothing , either in labor or material . As is well known , the feeding of the worm is a matter of great importance ; the mulberry tree is not very hardy and needs constant care ; and the leaves must be plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worms ; they also eat all the time and consume such a quantity of vegetable food as to require frequent removal of the excrement . The spider , on the contrary , eats but very little , since its food is wholly animal , and not only does very well for days without it , but will catch its own prey if allowed to do so . The arrangement for breeding flies would be similar to that already described , only the netting must have large meshes , so as to admit the largest flies , and yet exclude rats and other depredators from the putrifying meat . In both cases , of course , the opening into the apartment should be small . Many more practical suggestions might be given as to the method of rearing and feeding the spiders ; but the limits of this article forbid , and , indeed , the most of them will occur to the careful reader of the accounts given elsewhere of the habits of the Nephila plumipes . I trust to write no more concerning then-k until the question is decided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure of mankind , or until we have materially added to our present knowledge of many points in their structure , their habits and their capacities for improvement . The little we already know suggests numberless paths of inquiry in all directions , and , aside from any question of utility , every scientific question now answered raises ten more , concerning which nothing is known .
