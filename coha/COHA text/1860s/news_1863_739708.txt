txt In the House of Lords , on April 27 , the subject of the seizure of British vessels with mail-bags , came up , according to notice , when the following debate transpired : Bari RUSSELL  --  my lords , you will expect me. no doubt , to answer the questions which were put to me on Friday night . What I have to say will , I think , convince your lordships that it is not desirable that at this time I should state the opinion which I have received from the law officers of the Crown . On referring to the papers already presented to Parliament your lordships will see that a good deal of correspondence passed subsequently to the 8th of August . The letter written on the 8th of August has been published but I wrote afterwards to Mr. STUART , and on the 10th of October I made a further communication to the same gentleman . It Isnot necessary to trouble your lordships with the whole of the last mentioned dispatch . Part of it has already been presented to Parliament ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prilited papers , goes on to say : ' . Her Majesty 's r.overnment are glad to find from your dispatch of the ** of Aneust last that the orders originatty given to American cruisers in regard to interference with neutral vessels have been rescinded. if these orders had been sanctioned and continued in force by the Government of the United States , they would have called for prompt and firm remonstrance on the part of Her ! it ajest y 's Government , and it will be proper that you should intimate to Mr. Sewatun while expressing the satisfaction of Her Majesty 's Government at their revocation , that Her Majesty 's Government are glad to be thereby spared from the necessity of stating their decided objectious to their tenor . You will say that to order vessels . though apparently and prima facie carrying on a lawful trade . to be systematically seized on the high seas , without any preliminary search . or without the discovery during such search of any strong evidence of suspicion against such vessels , would be to subject the mercantile marine of neutrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government could be expected to tolerate . ' the unjust seizure under urgent circumstances of a neutral vessel may be con- idered as one of the occasional burdens which a state of war may impose upon a neutral . and it may be partiallycompensated by the condemnation of the captor in costs or iu costs and damages ; but the inliscriminate and general seizure of merchant vessels . without previous search , converts an occasional exception into an intolerable rule . The question which has arisen in this case , as to the seizure of Iicr Majesty 's mails on board the Ad/ la , while it torms a new and very important element in this czve. deserving very grave consideration . raises a point of some delicacy and difficulty . Her . Majesty 's Government can not doubt that the Government of the United States are prepared to concede that all mail-bags , clearly eel titled to be such . shall be exempt front seizure or visitation , and that some arrangement shall be made for immediately forwarding such bags to their destination in the event of the ships which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for discussing the claim , as a matter at strict right , that tier Majesty 's mails on board a private vessel should be exempted from visitation or detention . might be avoided ; and it is therefore desirable that you should ascertain from Mr. SE w /le whether the Government of the United States admits the principle that Her Majesty 's mail-bags shall neither be searched nor detained . " O receipt of this dispatch , Mr. STUART read it to Mr. SEWARD , who was ready to admit the principle therein laid down with regard to naval rights . That there might be no misunderstanding on the subject , it was agreed that special instructions should be issued . Accordingly , on the 31st of October , the following letter was addressed to Mr. WELLES : DEPARTNIINT or STATE , WA SIIINOTON . Oct. 31 , 11,162 . SIP. : It is thought expedient that instructions be given to the blockading and naval officers that , iu case of capture of merchant vessels suspected or found to be vessels of the insurgents or contraband , thepublic mails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authenticated as such , shall not be searched or opened , but be put . as speedily as may be convenient , on their way to their designated destinations . This instruction , however , will not be deemed to protect simulated mail-bags , verified by forged certificates or counterfeited seals . 1 have , dm . WILLIAM H. SEWARD . Those were the instructions given to American naval officers , and no question arose with respect to them , until the other day . I have just received the account of the preliminary proceedings in connection with the transaction . On the 4th of April , Mr. ARCHIBALD , Her Majesty 's Consul at New-York , was summoned to attend the Prize Commission in regard to the Peterholl ; which had been captured , as the House is aware , by the United States . On arriving at the office , Mr. ARCHIBALD was shown the mail-bag taken from the vessel , which was under the seal of Her Majesty 's Postmaster-General . Mr. ARCHIBALD protested against that seal being broken and the bag examined , and requested that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States officers , however , insisted that the bag should be opened , and that was accordingly done . The bag was found to contain several packages addressed to Matamoros . Nothing more took place on this occasion , and Mr. ARCHIBALD reported the matter to Lord LYONS . Lord LYONS immediately applied to Mr. SEWARD , and stated that the proceedings in question was in violation of the letter of the 31st of October , upon which he relied for the security of mails of this description certified by Her Majesty 's Postmaster-General . Mr. SEWARD said the subject would require consideration . Subsequently Mr. ARCHIBALD was again desired to attend the Prize Court , and was there informed by the counsel for the United States that it had been resolved to open the packages found in the mail-bag . In the first instance Mr. ARCHIBALD was invited to perform this task . In order to ascertain what were bona fide letters , which should be forwarded to their destination , and what were papers referring to the cargo , which should be handed over to the Prize Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a course . If the Court chose to order the packages to be opened , he said he would be present as a witness of the transaction , but could not approve or give any sanction to it . Upon this declaration the proceedings seem to have been suspended , and the opening of the packages was deferred . Mr. ARCHIBALD at once reported to Lord Lyons what had been done . Lord LYONS went to Mr. SEWARD , and pointed out that , in accordance with the ot.der of the 31st of October , the letters ought to be replaced in the mail-bag and forwarded to their destination . According to the latest intelligence which I have received , a telegram had been sent to the Prize Court , directing that the packages were not to be opened until further orders , but the Government of the United States had not come to any definIte determination on the subject . These are the facts of the case as they at present stand . The opinion of the law officers of the Crown must , of course , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps are taken . Instructions will be sent out probably by the next mail , but in the meantime fresh inforthation may arm ive which may quite alter the complexion of the affair . Under these circumstances , I have to press for the lilz ! ! ! lee.n " e of your lordships in forbearing , for the present , In state the opinion of the law officers of the Crown . Hear , hear. - ? . ? The Marquis of Ciairicarde said no one could approve more than tie did the discretion which the Government had exercised in postponing for the present the publication of the opinion of the law officers . He was also glad that the noble Earl had called attention to the agreement of the 31st of October , as to the security of the mails . On the 11th of the present month the owners of the Sea Queen , in addressing an inquiry to the Government as to the amount of protection which would be afforded to the mails , referred to the dictum of an American JuJge , to the effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally be opened in order to ascertain the character of the ship . Now , seeing that by the letter of October last , that contention was waived on the part of the United States Government , it would have been courteous in the noble earl , or in the noble lord , the Postmaster-General , to have stated the understanding now in force . He wished to know whatsteps had been taken by ifsr Majesty 's Government to obtain correct reports of the proceedings of the American Prize Courts . It was clearly of great importance that they should know whether there was any conflict of law between the Prize Courts and the United States Government . He understood that a number of ships had been seized , some of them as far back as fifteen months ago , and had been taken into port , but had not.yet been brought before the Prize Court . The reason of that delay was believed by the owners to be the want of evidence against the vessels , but from whatever cause it occurred , it was most unjustifiable . Hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the proceedings of the Prize Courts could be obtained , but he would take care to remind the British Minister in the United States of the importance of transmitting them whenever possible .
