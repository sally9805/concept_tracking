THE State of Virginia is , by appointment of nature , a splendid field for the practice of the art of war . Perhaps nowhere , in all our wide territory , can so many diversities of surface be found within the same stretch of area ; diversities which are everything in war , and always enter largely into the plans and calculations of great conunanders . It bad been demonstrated , long before civil war in America familiarized us with these matters , how a slight inequality of ground may cause the defeat of an army , and how the day may be lost because an insignificant muddy creek runs between the battle-field and the reserve ; and we may well believe that " the stars , in their courses , fought against Sisera " not more truly than the natural features of the land have fought for and against the hosts that have closed over them in the grapple of war . During the late war , Virginia was the great central theatre of the strife ; and neither North nor South could have wished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other countries of the earth , nature has been content to assign to each some striking natural feature ; in our land of magnificent extent she has multiplied them , and lavished variety through its length and breadth . And thus the Old Dominion teems with salient points and protected coverts , which for five years were the objects of plans and counter-plans , and which were marched for and fought over again and again . She has within her borders great rivers , majestic mountains , and plains , and hills , and valleys in profusion ; and to all these the wills of generals and the movements of armies were made subservient . But more especially is this true of the magnificent mountain system of Virginia  --  the giant ranges which bisect the State from corner to corner , lifting up their venerable battlements toward the skies , and leaving their earthfast feet in the streams which are born of them . They circumscribed the field of warfare , and limited communication across it to a few gaps which pierce their sides ; the army which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way of retreat up their frowning sides ; the partisan found shelter and concealment among them ; and often and again , from their skyward summits , the red lights of the signal corps , or their white banners , telegraphed to far-distant points the progress of an army , the fortunes of a battle , or the joyful note of victory . The traveller who follows the turnpike south from Winchester will reach the little straggling town of Strasburg after a short day 's journey ; and , having reached it , he may well pause and look // about him at the works of nature . Facing southward , he will have upon his left the line of the Blue Ridge , grandly massive ; further away on his right is the North Mountain , a parallel range , between which and the other lies the Shenandoah Valley , opulent in agriculture and natural beauty . To the east of the Blue Ridge is the Luray Valley ; along its side flows the smooth current of the Shenandoah ; while , pushed out from the range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massanutten Mountain , its side rising in an ahnost perpendicular wall from the river . Passing just beyond Strasburg , you will cross over a little stream called Tumbling Brook , brawling its way to the river ; and here let us pause a moment and look up . We are at the base of Fisher 's Hill , the bold , bluff-like eminence which runs east and west , from mountain-range to mountain-range . Its summit is a stretch of table-land , upon which the highway runs southerly to Staunton and beyond ; its sides are precipitous , bare and rocky in places , and elsewhere covered with thick growths of forest  --  but always difficult of access and ascent . The highway clambers a doubtful , zigzag course to the top , and where it crosses the brook is a stone bridge , where it would seem that the old story of Leonidas and Thermopyla* might be repeated . Such is Fisher 's IIill  --  a natural fortification , apparently an impregnable one , Virginia 's outwork against Northern invasion , a tower of refuge to her Shenandoah army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle , built by nature 's hand , To frown defiance on the foe . " It was here , " said a Richmond journal , after Sheridan 's victory at this place , " that Stonewall Jackson was accustomed to repair when threatened by the combined advances of l3anks , Fremont , and McDowell ; and here , perched and fortified upon this high vantage-ground , he could overlook the Valley even to the Pennsylvania border , like an outspread map , and wait in security for the coming of his foes . " True ; and 1-listory , when it speculates , may ask whether the result of the war in the Valley might not have been different , or , at least , indefinitely postponed , had Jubal Early faithfully pursued this policy of the great chieftain whom he succeeded , and , after retiring from the front of Washington in July , 1864 , set himself down upon these heights , and bidden Phil . Sheridan and his thirty thousand fight him there , when they would fight . his controlling motive in sacrificing this splendid position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winchester , was doubtless the securing of the plenteous harvest of the lower Valley ; but the mistake was one , as we can now well understand , which cost him his army , and gave the Valley permanently to our arms . // The spot whither I have conducted the reader is one prolific with reminiscences of the war ; here and within hail have some of its most stirring events occurred . Look eastward at the mountain wall , and you will see a shade lighter than its hazy blue in the dim distance . That is Manassas Gap , through which , in June , 1861 , Johnston and his army poured over the mountains to the salvation of Beauregard at Bull Run . Nearer us , on the same line of vision , is Front Royal , where , almost a year later , Banks ' outposts were cut to pieces by Jackson 's sudden , stealthy descent from the Luray ; and from this point the memorable retreat began . Ascend the hill , and , far off to the southeast , you behold Cedar Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a most stubborn and bloody fight ; and between us and it are the fields of Cross Keys , of Harrisonburg , and of Newmarket , where the varying fortunes of the war shifted now to one side and now to the other . Look northwardly ; mark the course of Cedar Creek , as it winds along to the river , and the romantic story of the battle that has made its name immortal in history will at once occur to you . Nor far beyond is Kearnestown , where Shields and Jackson measured arms , to the discomfiture of the latter ; just beyond is Winchester , with the Opequan Creek skirting it , over which , on a pleasant September day in 1864 , sixty thousand men , in blue and gray , fought for live long hours , at close musket range , one of the most obstinate and sanguinary battles of the war . Still further north are Darksville , Bunker Hill , and Martinsburg , where the armies and their detachments fought and man*uvred ; and , easterly from Winchester , you can plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ferry , now forever memorable from the strife which , in and over this cauldron of nature , has boiled , and smoked , and roared . The Shenandoah Valley must be forever named as classic ground in the story of the great war ; a ad , out of all its conflicts , none can be named where victory was so audaciously wrenched from the obstacles that nature set up against us , nor won with the exhibition of greater pluck and soldierly spirit , than in the Fight at Fisher 's 11i11 , whereof I write . It is the imperfection of history that it glances at , but does not faithfully report , the battles of a war , excepting those of the first magnitude . It tells us , * in regard to the one which I have named , that , " advancing the Sixth Corps against the front , and the Nineteenth on the left of the rebel stronghold , Sheridan again sent the Eighth on a long circuit around on the right , striking heavily in flank and rear , while a vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True again ; but here we learn nothing of the tremendous difficulties which beset this mountain-way to victory , or of the spirit , and * Vide Greeley 's " American Conflict , " Tol . II. , p. 610. // rush , and roar , and tumult of the light that for an hour before the sunset of October 22d , 1864 , raged over the lirecipitate sides of Fisher 's Hill . Nor is it to be expected that history , dealing with events in the war more than in detail , will stop to tell the story of how each field of the war was lost or won . Of those who were actual participants in the strife , something of this kind is rightfully expected . It is for them , now , while these stirring scenes are fresh and vivid in mind , to portray them as best they can , so that all the glories of these desperate fields may not be obscured in the one word " victory , " or lost in the other word , " defeat . " And , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due praise may be given to the achievements of our Union army , as well as that no just praise on the score of good fighting may be withheld from the Confederate aims , I desire briefly to tell the story of this one day , as I saw it . The battle of Winchester was fought and won on the afternoon of Monday , and Early 's proud and well-appointed host of veterans was driven from the field in disorder , almost in panic . So close and desperate a fi0ht as this had been was morally certain to result in overwhelming defeat for the one side or the other ; and when , at five o'clock , the Confederate army broke up and withdrew , under the combined attacks of the cavalry and the Eighth Corps on its flank , and the infantry and artillery in front , the retreat was speedily converted into a hurried flight before our cavalry . It was not in human endurance that our infantry , after the toils of the last twenty-four hours , could follow immediately in the pursuit , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated army to a new stand and another battle , was well known to General Sheridan . But he knew , too , that his exhausted soldiers could do no more without rest-rest and sleep , which I think the wearied body craves vastly more than the starving man craves food . And so that night the fires of our tired and crippled , but victorious , army glowed on the field of its valor , while every man in gray , horse and foot , whom the chances of the fight had left able to fly , sped southward toward Fisher 's Hill . rulirough Winchester the disordered throng hastened at sunset , deaf to the frantic appeals of the women , who rushed into the streets with sneering cries , " For shame ! for shame ! Is this the way you mean to protect us ? " Across the Opequan , on to Kearnestown , through Newtown , Middletown , and Strasbnrg they went , weary and footsore , beaten and dispirited , but not hopeless-for the flag of the stars and bars , which still waved over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fisher 's Hill , and victory might even yet be retrieved . So , at least , thought Early and his lieutenants : and this spirit was infused through the command . " To Fisher 's Hill ! // to Fisher 's Hill ! " was the cry which reanimated the broken regiments ; and after midnight the inhabitants of Strasburg were roused from their beds to see the army which had that day retreated from Winchester flitting like a spectral host through the streets , and mounting the steep sides of Fisher 's Hill . In the early morning we took the road in pursuit . More than twenty miles to the south , where the valley narrows by the approximation of the Blue Ridge and North Mountain , we could see the hill lifting itself up menacingly to our advance ; and presently the sullen boom and roar of heavy artillery told us that the enemy had guns in position on its summit , and were disputing the way with our cavalry . More and more frequent grew the discharges as we advanced , and aides flew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while from the roof of every high house , as we advanced , sig nal flags waved and fluttered . The story which their mysterious language told to Sheridan , not to us , was simply this : The enemy have made a stand on the hill ; they have several pieces of cannon there , and apparently a respectable army of infantry ; their pickets are near Strasburg . This we did not know ; but our campaigning of the previous Summer had given us a knowledge of Fisher 's 11111 , and the designs of the enemy were as plain to us as to the general commanding . Nor was the result at all certain to us . We had , it is true , the prestige of victory , and the Confederates had the discouragement of defeat ; but their army , even if but a fragment of an army , was made up of veterans , and now occupied one of the best defensive positions in Virginia ; and that it would be held with all the stubbornness of veterans , we could not doubt . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked by many a soldier of himself and his comrades , as our army marched on , over the high way and across the fields in three parallel columns ; and we answered it ourselves in the huzzas that greeted our leader as he rode slowly between them , nodding and bowing , his keen eyes glancing at every regiment , and his rosy face joyous with smiles . We had cheered him on the battle-field the day before , when , in the most critical hour of the afternoon , with the two armies hailing lead into each other 's ranks at the distance of barely two hundred yards , he dashed up and down the line , exhorting the men to stand fast to their terrible work ; and we cheered him now when we saw him among us , ready to lead us against the same enemy , through and over whatever obstacles might lie between . No commander , I verily believe , ever succeeded in establishing himself so firmly in the faith of those under him as Philip H. Sheridan . He is the impersonation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike other generals , he not only plans , but also executes ; and when he has loosed the elements of warfare , he will // always be present to " ride the whirlwind and direct the storm . " The army was halted before night , just north of Strasburg , and ordered to bivouac . Our proximity to the enemy was announced in the order that no fires must be kindled ; and my own regiment camped down in a ravine , and passed the night in comparative comfort , having previously partaken of an unostentatious repast of very hard bread , very raw salt pork , and water . Several of the curious who went out to make discoveries returned with the information that a reconnoissance in force had gone out ; and at intervals through the night the sullen booming of artillery disturbed our sleep . The following day was the 21st ; a day of excitement , but not of fighting . The movements of the army made it passably certain that Sheridan had assured himself of the enemy 's position , and now sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My regiment was moved out upon the heights west of the town , where it lay most of the day with stacked arms , watching the grand display around us . Far back were the immense masses of the Eighth Corps , silent , motionless , waiting to be brought into position ; nearer us was the Nineteenth , weaker in numbers , but proud with the laurels of the last battle on its victorious banners ; and here , close at hand , moving into the woods on the left , regiment after regiment , brigade after brigade , was the gallant Sixth , which had been assigned to the centre . The Nineteenth took the left , descending the slopes and passing into and around the town ; the Eighth , late in the day , continued the line to the right . It was all done in silence , without drum-beat or note of fife ; and when the movement was completed , Fisher 's Hill was girdled with the lines of Sheridan 's infantry , while the heavy artillery occupied an eminence in the rear , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former campaign . The lines of our army followed the course of the hill , the left wing being somewhat refused , to meet the character of the ground . Strasburg , lying in a little hollow nook between the ridges and the foot of the hill , looked out at sunset and saw the fires of Early 's army glowing all along its summit , while its base was belted by our own . All things seemed in readiness for an assault at the first gleam of daylight . The regiment of which I was a captain had been reserved to picket the extreme flank of the Nineteenth Corps ; and in the darkness of early evening we received orders to move there as fast as possible , and relieve the One hundred and Sixteenth New York . We stumbled through ravines and over ascents , skirting the north of Strasburg ; and , marching through it , left five companies for reserve , under the major . There were no other field // officers , for the late battles had dealt hardly with us , and I was ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right wing of the regiment a hundred rods up the road , whence we deviated into the middle of a large field . " Here leave a company for reserve , " said the officer whom I relieved . I did so , and then , hoping to become immediately familiar with the ground , I accompanied the other four to the picket line , which I traversed from end to end , a distance of rather more than a mile , and was quite glad to find my way back to the reserve in the dark , after being made the subject of suspicion by the vigilance of every sentinel . I wrapped my poncho about me , and reclined before some smouldering embers . Little or nothing could be judged of our position ; nothing could be seen more than the occasional glow of a distant fire from the long line , or a gleam of light from the town . Of a sudden , a burst of instrumental music came to my ears , and the familiar strains of " Dixie , " played by a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I presume , the headquarters band of one of the Confederate generals , on their extreme right , and , though I then judged it to be very near , and sent out immediately to warn the pickets to increased vigilance , it was in reality more than a mile distant . Certain conditions of the atmosphere of a still night are surprisingly favorable to the transmission of sound , of which truth this was a striking example . After " Dixie , " we were regaled with " Bonny Eloise , " and then , wonderful to relate , with " John Brown , " and " Yankee Doodle . " The two last raised serious doubts within me , for the moment , as to which side this music came from ; but there could be no real doubt . It was a Confederate band , playing within the Confederate lines , although it seemed decidedly unique to hear the old air of " John Brown " from such a source . When daylight came our position was at once made clear . Straight in front of us was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heads , hardly a rifle-shot away . The river ran at his base ; our picket line was posted obliquely to it , covering the left flank of the corps , with our backs to Strasburg . A stretch of meadow land lay between us and time river ; across it were scattered houses , and the land beyond gradually ridged up to the mountains . There was no reveille along our extended line , nor was there note or sign of attack . 1 visited the outposts during the morning , and repeated orders and cautions ; and the day wore away till noon without change or excitement . Not without incident , however ; during the morning there was a misadventure among us , which I recollect as the most ludicrous among all my experiences . A vagrant soldier , one of the class of // " bummers " who are nothing if not continually eating and drinking , had stolen forth from the reserve , bent upon plunder , and particulari y upon eatable plunder . A row of bee-hives in a yard near by attracted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore it triumphantly back to the reserve . It proved a perfect Pandora 's Box of ills to my little command . Just as he reached us , one of the bees stung him severely , causing him to drop the hive ; when the whole swarm rushed out upon us , scattering the reserve to the four corners of the lot , and stinging right and left . Before I could get away from the infected neighborhood , I was stung four times about the face . All over the field , the unhappy soldiers were rolling and twistin* about in the grass ; the air resounded with their laughter and expletives ; and the bees settled iu a great , angry cloud directly above the stacked arms , as if to forbid our resuming them . To add to the ridiculous aspect of the scene , the outposts , observing the commotion , took the alarm , faced toward us , and prepared to repel a rear attack . When we were enabled to gather again about the arms , there was such an assemblage of swelled and rueful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while the lull which preceded the storm was yet unbroken , the field officer of the day rode up with orders . " General Emory directs you to open fire along your front , " he said . " If there is anything across there , he wants to know it . " I complied ; and for half the afternoon the long picket line was noisy with musketry . " Aim anywhere to the front , " were my orders ; and the firing had not been continued three minutes , when from behind a stone wall across the river , behind fences , from the windows of a brick house , and from a clump of trees , the firing was briskly returned . The enemy 's bullets whistled over and by us , or pattered on the ground in front . Nobody was hit ; but a score of close escapes were reported . The range was long ; so long that our men used double cartridges , greatly to the discomfort of their shoulders , from the recoiling of the guns . The firing was continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I presume we shall never know . And this comprised my share in the battle of Fisher 's Hill . The wish that I had often expressed , of witnessing a battle from an advantageous standpoint , without participating in it , was here for the first time realized , and with an effect which will make the impressions of that hour life-long . It was quite late in the afternoon-almost sunset-when the first tokens of the assault were heard . A solitary gun from Fort Banks shook the hills with a defiant roar , and a huge shell screeched over Strasburg , and buried itself in the hill . I sprang to my feet , intent on hearing and seeing whatever might occur . In an instant the artillery opened upon the hill , in a hail of shot , shell and grape , // while guns from its summit vigorously responded . In the hazy obscurity of late afternoon the flame from the mouths of the pieces , and the bursting shells , gloxved vividly , and the rnshing and screaming of the ponderous missles filled the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no cessation in this artillery fight on either side ; it flamed and raged back and forth , faster and faster , more and more furiously , sending a broad pall of smoke over Strasburg , until it seemed to be the smoke of its own destruction . And curiously enough , I believe not a single 1 ) uilding was touched by shot or shell ( Iurino the battle . " There go the infantry ! " sang out one of the men . " There they go-there they go ! I looked and saw , with beating heart , and with a soldier 's instant desire to be among his comrades in action , the compact lines of the Nineteenth and Sixth , moving up against the hill , with arms at a right-shoulder-shift gleaming in the setting sun . The left of the line rested on Strasburg ; its right was thrown around the hill beyond my range of sight ; and steadily , yet swiftly , it went up , like a wall of gleaming steel-np , up , and right on ! It never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill , and from all the long line of its crest , angry spits of flame flashed in its face , and volleys of lead were hurled down upon it . Our artillery still kept up its tremendous diapason , and shot and shell now flew shrieking and humming over the heads of the advancing army , while shell from the Confederates burst along the line , and grape and bullets came thickly doxvn , smiting their victims here and there . But on , still on and right on went that magnificent line , at least fifteen thousand strong as I saw it , rising higher and higher , like a great blue wave , sometimes swallowed in izlaces by the clumps of trees and hollows into which it penetrated , and again emerging in to the light of sunset  --  but on , on-sternly and unfalteringly on ! I was not near enough to witness the sickly mimutUe of the fight , as I had seen it upon other fields . I could not mark the men who dropped from the line here and there , some falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others retracing their steps down the hill , with bleeding wounds and faces all inwrittea with acute agony . All these were there ; but I saw and heard nothing but the onward , triumphant rush of that tremendous blue wave , the flame and smoke of the artillery , pounding heavily above and below , the sharp , incessant rattling of the musketry , and the innumerable spits of fire darting from the sides and summit of the hill into the faces of the men who were scaling it . Snch , in brief is a picture of a short and desperate battle , lasting scareely an hour from the report of the first gun that brought me to my feet . // how much harder and how much bloodier the work of that hour might have been but for the hank attack of the Eighth Corps , must be left to speculation , since it was that attack which demoralized the enemy and drove his left from the position . I knew of the success of the Eighth by a mighty yell coming from the right of our line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal that the Army of West Virginia had gained the Confederate works on their extreme left , and driven in the flank in confusion . The Eighth charged in line , like the others ; and its front was so long that a part of the right flank overlapped the enemy 's left and swung upon it at right angles with the corps , actually coming upon the enemy from the rear of their own works . At this opportune moment the Nineteenth and Sixth pressed right up to the top of the hill , and with a cry of victory cleared the enemy 's works with the bayonet . Resistance was at once at an end ; the scenes of Winchester were re-enacted ; the defeated host fled in dismay , abandoning arms , stores and prisoners to the victors . It was now a thoroughly beaten , thoroughly dispirited army , and its flight was in fragments , while Sheridan pursued all night with both cavalry and infantry . And how was this result achieved  --  a result which to many would have scemed a positive impossibility ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which carried them over the Confederate works before the enemy was really awake to the fact that Sheridan was going to be foolhardy enough to order an attack . There is a little story connected with the giving of that order which entirely explains it , and as I heard it upon the spot , and know it to be true , I will embalm it here for the benefit of some future historian . As evening approached , upon the day of the fight , Sheridan had entirely completed his dispositions , and had his army in hand to his entire satisfaction . his intention was not , however , to attack that night , probably esteeming it best to await the dawn of another mornino* and he had withdrawn a little way to the rear , where headquarters had been hastily established , intending to rest a little , when a curious coincidence changed his plans and sent him forward that night to victory . An aide rode up with the announcement : " General Crook sends his compliments , sir , and says he is in position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that his men are in capital spil-its . " " Glad cf it , " said Sheridan . " Tell him to stay where he is . " In less than three minutes up came another aide , with another message : " General Wright 's compliments , general . He is ready to attack any minute , and the men are rather anxious for it . They were never in better spirits . " // " Good , again ! " responded Sheridan . " Tell the general he will hear from me in good time . " And hardly had he uttered the words when aide number three came up at a gallop . " General Emory sends his compliments , general . He told me to say to you that the enemy has developed nothing but a weak picket on his left . The corps is in excellent spirits . " " Well , now , by George ! " exclaimed Sheridan . " If the whole army is in such good trim and temper for the work , why delay it ? We wont , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " to the last aide , " ride back to General Emory rapidly , and tell him to attack at once vigorously with his whole force ! Major , take the same order to General Wright . Captain , the same to Crook . Mount , gentlemen , mount . We 'll have that hill befo e another hour . - And we did.
