THE MAN WHO STOLE A MEETING-HOUSE . ON a recent journey to the Pennsylvania oil regions , I stopped one evening with a fellow-traveller at a village xv hich had just been thrown into a turmoil of excitement by the exploits of a horse-thief . As we sat around the tavcrn hearth , after supper , we heard the particulars of the rogue 's capture and escape fully discussed ; then followed many another tale of theft and robbery , told amid curling puffs of tobacco-smoke ; until , at the close of an exciting story , one of the natives turned to my travelling acquaintance , and , with a broad laugh , said , " Kin ye beat that , stranger ? " " Well , I do n't know , - may be I could if I should try . I never happened to fall in with any such tall horsestealing as you tell of ; but I knew a man who stole a meeting-house once . " " Stole a meetin ' - house ! That goes a little beyant anything yit , " remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean he stole it and carried it away ? " " Stole it and carried it away , " repeated my travelling companion , seriously , crossing his legs , and resting his arm on the back of his chair . " And , more than all that , I helped him . " " How happened that ? - for you do n't look much like a thief , yourself . " All eyes were now turned upon my friend , a plain New England farmer , whose honest homespun appearance and candid speech commanded respect . " I was his hired man , and I acted under orders . His name was Jedwort , - Old Jedwort , the boys called him , although he was n't above fifty when the crooked little circumstance happened which I 11 make as straight a story of as I can , if the company would like to hear it . " " Sartin , stranger ! sartin ! about stealin ' the meetin ' - house ! " chimed in two or three voices . My friend cleared his throat , put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth face , but with a merry twinkle in his shrewd , gray eye , began as follows - " Jedwort , I said his name was ; and I shall never forget how he looked one particular morning . He stood leaninb on the front gate , - or rather on the post , for the gate itself was such a shackling concern a child could n't have leaned on t without breaking it down . And Jedwort was no child . Think of a stoutish , stooping , ducklegged man , with a mountainous back , strongly suggestive of a bag of grist under his shirt , and you have him . That imaginary grist had been growing heavier and heavier , and he more and more bent under it , for the last fifteen years and more , until his head and neck just came forward out from between his shoulders , like a turtle 's from its shell . His arms hung , as he walked , almost to the ground . Being curved with the elbows outward , he looked for all the world , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parenthesis . If man was ever a quadruped , as I ye heard some folks tell , and rose gradually from four legs to two , there must have been a time , very early in his history , when he went about like Old Jedwort . " The gate had been a very good gate in its day . It had even been a genteel gate when Jedwort came into possession of the place , by marrying his wife , who inherited it from her uncle . That was some twenty years before , and everything had been going to rack and ruin ever since . " Jedwort himself had been going to rack and ruin , morally speaking . He was a middling decent sort of man when I first knew him ; and I judge there must have been something about him more than common , or he never could have got such a wife . But then women do marry , sometimes , unaccountably . I ye known downright // ugly and disagreeable fellows to work around , till by and by they would get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see , and then marry her in spite of everything ; - just as you may have seen a magnetizer on the stage make his subjects do just what he pleased , or a black snake charm a bird . Talk about women marrying with their eyes open , under such circumstances ! They do n't marry with their eyes open : they are put to sleep , in one sense , and ai n't more than half responsible for what they do , if they are that . Then rises the question that has puzzled wiser heads than any of ours here , and will puzzle more yet , till society is different from what it is now , - boxy much a refined and sensitive woman is bound to suffer from a coarse and disgusting master , legally called her husband , before she is entitled to break off a bad bargain she scarce had a hand in making . I ye sat here , to-night , and heard about men getting goods under false pretences ; you ye told some astonishing big stories , gentlemen* a bout rogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you about the man who stole a meeting-house ; but , when all is said , I guess it will be found that more extraordinary thieving than all that often goes on under our own eyes , and nobody takes any notice of it . There s such a thing , rrentlemen , as getting hearts under false pretences . There s such a thing as a man s stealing a wife . " * speak with feeling on this subject , for I had an opportunity of seeing what Mrs. Jedwort had to put up with from a man no woman of her stamp could do anything but detest . She was just the prettiest , patientest creature you ever saw . She was even too patient . If I had been tied to such a cub , I think I should have cultivated the beautiful and benignant qualities of a wildcat ; there would have been one good fight , and one of us would have been living , and the other would have been dead , and that would have been the end of it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large num ber of children . She had had nine of these , and three were under the sod and six above it when Jedwort ran off with the meeting-house in the way I am going on to tell you . There was Maria , the oldest girl , a perfect picture of what her mother had been at nineteen . Then there were the two boys , Dave and Dan , fine young fellows , spite of their father . Then came Lottie , and Susie , and then Willie , a little four-yearold . " It was amazing to see what the mother would do to keep her family looking decent with the little means she had . For Jedwort was the tightest screw ever you saw . It was avarice that had spoilt him , and came so near turning him into a beast . The boys used to say he grew so bent , looking in the dirt for pennies . That was true of his mind , if not of his body . He was a poor man , and a pretty respectable man , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into possession of a little property , than he grew crazy for more . There are a good many men in the world , that nobody looks upon as monomaniacs , who are crazy in just that sort of way . They are all for laying up money , depriving themselves of comforts , and their families of the advantages of society and education , just to add a few dollars to their hoard every year ; and so they keep on till they die and leave it to their children , who would be much better off if a little more had been invested in the cultivation of their minds and manners , and less in stocks and bonds . " Jedwort was just one of that class of men , although perhaps he carried the fault I speak of a little to excess . A dollar looked so big to him , and he held it so close , that at last he could n't see much o* anything else . By degrees he lost all regard for decency and his neighbors ' opinions . 1-us children went barefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , because he was too mean to buy them shoes . It was pitiful to see a nice , interesting girl , like Maria , go about looking as she did , while her father was piling his money // into the bank . She wanted to go to school , and learn music , and he somebody ; hut he would n't keep a hired girl , and so she was obliged to stay at home and do housework ; and she could no more have got a dollar out of him to pay for clothes and tuition , than you could squeeze sap out of a hoe-handle . " The only way his wife could ever get anything new for the family was by stealing hutter from her own dairy , and selling it hehind his back . You need n't say anything to Mr. Jedwort about this batch of butter , ' she would hint to the storekeeper ; but you may band the money to me , or I will take my pay in goods . ' In this way a new gown , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else the family needed , would be smuggled into the house , with fear and trembling lest old J edwort should make a row and find where the money came from . " The house inside was kept neat as a pin ; but everything around it looked terribly shiftless . It was built originally in an amhitious style , and painted white . It had four tall front pillars , supporting the portion of the roof that came over the porch , - lifting up the eyebrows of the house , if I may so express myself ; and making it look as if it was going to sneeze . Half the blinds were off their hinges , and the rest flapped in the wind . The front door-step had rotted away . The porch had once a good floor , but for years Jedwort had been in the habit of going to it whenever he wanted a board for the pig-pen , until not a hit of floor was left . " But I began to tell about Jedwort leaning on the gate that morning . We had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk , his mother asked , What is your father planning now ? Half the time he stands there , looking up the road ; or else he s walking up that way in a brown study . ' " He s got his eye on the old meeting-house , ' says Dave , setting down his pail . He has been watching it and walking round it , off and on , for a week . ' " That was the first intimation I had of what the old fellow was up to . But after hreakfast he followed me out of the house , as if he had something on his mind to say to me . " Stark , ' says he , at last , you ye always insisted on t that I was n't an enterprisin ' man . ' " I insist on t still , ' says I ; for I was in the habit of talking mighty plain to him , and joking him pretty hard sometimes . If I had this farm , I 'd show you enterprise . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just for want of a good fence to keep em out . You would n't see the very best strip of land lying waste , just for want of a ditch . You would n't'see that stone wall by the road tumbling down year after year , till by and by you wo n't be able to see it for the weeds and thistles . ' " Yes , ' says he , sarcastically , ye d lay out ten times as much money on the place as ye d ever git back ag'in , I ye no doubt . But I believe in economy . ' " That provoked me a little , and I said , Economy ! you re one of the kind of men that 11 skin a flint for sixpence and spoil a jack-knife worth a shilling ; and that is n't economy any more than a corn-cob is a fiddlestick . You waste fodder and grain enough every three years to pay for a bigger barn , - to say nothing of the inconvenience . ' " Wal , Stark , ' says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my mind to have a bigger barn , if I have to steal one . ' " That wo n't he the first thing you ye stole , neither , ' says I. " He flared up at that . Stole ? ' says he . What did I ever steal ? ' " Well , for one thing , the rails the freshet last spring drifted off from Talcott 's land on to yours , and you grabbed : what was that but stealing ? ' " That was luck . He could n't swear to his rails . By the way , they 11 jest come in play now . ' " They ye come in play already , ' says I. They ye gone on to the old fences all over the farm , and I could use a thousand more without making much show . ' // " That s cause you re so dumbed extravagant with rails , as you are with everything else . A few loads can be spared from the fences here and there , as well as not . Harness up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make about ten rods o ' zi*zag , two rails high . ' " Two rails ? ' says Dave , who had a healthy contempt for the old man 's narrow , contracted way of doing things . What s the good of such a fence as that ? ' " It 11 be , ' says I , like the single bar in music . When our old singingmaster asked his class once what a single bar was , Bill Wilkins spoke up and said , " It s a bar that horses and cattle jump over , and pigs and sheep run under . " What do you expect to keep out with two rails ? " The law , boys , the law , ' says J edwort . I know what I m about . I 11 make a fence the law ca n't run under nor jump over ; and I do n't care a cuss for the cattle and pigs . You git the rails , and I 11 rip some boards off m the pig-pen to make stakes . ' " Boards ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave . Besides , none ca n't be spared from the pig-pen . ' " I 11 have boards enough in a day or two for forty pig-pens , ' says Jedxvort . Brino* along the rails and dump em out in the road for the present , and say nothin ' to nobody . ' " We got the rails , and he made his stakes ; and right away after dinner he called us out . Come , boys , ' says he , now we 11 astonish the natives . ' " The wagon stood in the road , with the last jag of rails still on it . Jedwort piled on his stakes , and threw on the crow-bar and axe , while we were hitching up the team . " Now , drive on , Stark , ' says he . " Yes ; but where shall I drive to ? ' " To the old meetin ' - house , ' says Jedwort , trudging on ahead . " The old meeting-house stood on an open common , at the northeast corner of his farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was bounded on the other two by Jedwort 's overgrown stone wall . It was a square , old-fashioned building , with a low steeple , that had a belfry , but no hell in it , and with a high , square pulpit and high , straight-backed pews inside . It was now some time since meetings had been held there ; the old society that used to meet there having separated , one division of it building a fashionable chapel in the North Village , and the other a fine new church at the Centre . " Now , the peculiarity about the old church property was , that nobody had any legal title to it . A log meetinghouse had been built there when the country was first settled and land was of no account . In the course of time that was torn down , and a good framed house put up in its place . As it belonged to the whole community , no title , either to the house or land , was ever recorded ; and it was n't until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property was to be disposed of . While the old deacons were carefully thinking it over , Jedwort was on hand , to settle it by putting in his claim . " Now , boys , ' says he , ye see what I m up to . ' " Yes , ' says I , provoked as I could be at the mean trick , and I knew it was some such mischief all along . You never show any enterprise , as you call it , unless it is to get the start of a neighbor . Then you are wide awake ; then you are busy as the Devil in a gale of wind . ' " But what are you up to , pa ? ' says Dan , who did n't see the trick yet . " The old man says , I m goin ' to fence in the rest part of my farm . ' " What rest part ? ' " This part that never was fenced ; the old meetin ' - house common . " But , pa , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim on that . ' " Wal , if I hai n't , I 11 make a claim . Give me the crow-bar . Now , here s the corner , nigh as I can squint ' ; - and he stuck the bar into the ground . Make a fence to here from the wall , both sides . ' // " Sho , pa ! ' says Dan , looking bewildered ; ye ai n't goin ' to fence in the old meetin-house , be ye ? " That s jest what I in goin ' to do . Go and git some big stuns from the wail , - the biggest ye can find , to rest the corners of the fence on . String the rails along by the road , Stark , and go for another load . Do n't stand gawpin ' there Gazqi5in ' ? says I ; it s enough to make any*dy garu* . You do beat all the critters I ever had to deal with . Have n't ye disgraced your family enough already , without stealing a meetinghouse ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then I put it to him . Look at your children ; it s all your wife can ( 10 to prevent em from growing up in rags and dirt and ignorance , because you are too close-fisted to clothe em decently or send em to school . Look at your house and yard . To see an Irishman 's shanty in such a condition seems appropriate enough , but a genteel place , a house with pillars , run down and gone to seed like that , is an eyesore to the community . Then look at your wife . You never would have had any property to mismanage , if it had nt been for her ; and see the way ye show your gratitude for it . You wo n't let her go into company , nor have company at home ; you wo n't allow a hired girl in the house , but she and Maria have to do all the drudgery . You make perfect slaves of em . I swear , if t wa ' n't for your wife , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best woman in the world , after all you ye done to break her spirit , and I hate to leave her . ' " The old fellow squirmed , and wrenched the crow-bar in the ground , then snarled back : Yes ! you re waitin ' for me to die ; then you mean to step into my shoes . ' I hope you 11 leave a decenter pair than them you ye got on , if I m to step into em , ' says I. " One thing about it , ' says he , *she v:o n't have ye. * " I should think , ' says I , a woman that would marry you would have most anybody . ' " So we had it hack and forth , till by and by he left me to throw off the rails , and went to show the boys how to build the fence . " Look here , ' says he ; jest put a thunderin ' big stun to each corner ; then lay your rail on ; then drive your pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair . Now put on your rider . There s your letter X , ridin ' one length of rails and carryin ' another . That s what I call puttin ' yer alphabet to a practical use ; and I say there ai n't no sense in havin ' any more edication than ye can put to a practical use . I ye larnin ' enough to git along in the world ; and if my boys have as much as I ye got , they 11 git along . Now work spry , for there comes Deacon Talcott . ' " Wal , wal ! ' says the Deacon , coming up , puffing with excitement ; what ye doin ' to the old meetin ' - house ? ' " Wal , ' says Jedwort , driving away at his stakes , and never looking up , I ye been considerin ' some time what I should do with t , and I ye concluded to make a barn on t . ' " Make a barn ! make a ham ! cries the Deacon . Who give ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " Nobody ; I take the liberty . Why should n't I do what I please with my own prop'ty ? ' " Your own property , - what do ye mean ? T ai n't your meetin-house . " Whose is t , if t ai n't mine ? says J edwort , lifting his turtle 's head from between his horizontal sh oulclers , and grinning in the Deacon 's face . It belongs to the society , ' says thc Deacon . But the s'ciety s pulled up stakes and gone off . ' " It belong , s to individooals of the society , - to individooals . ' " Wal , I m an individooal , ' says J edwort . " You ! you never went to meetin ' here a dozen times in your life " I never did have my share of the // old meetin ' - house , that s a fact , ' says Jedwort ; but I 11 make it up now . ' " But what are ye fencin ' up the common for ? ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . I ye never had my share o ' the vally o ' that , either . I ye let my neighbors ' pigs and critters run on t long enough ; and now I m jest goin ' to take possession o ' my own . ' " Your own ! ' says the Deacon , in perfect consternation . You ye no deed on t . ' " Wal , have you ? ' " No - hut - the society - " The s'ciety , I tell ye , ' says Jedwort , holding his head up longer than I ever knew him to hold it up at a time , and grinning all the while in Talcott 's face , - the s'ciety is split to pieces . There ai n't no s'ciety now , - any more n a pig s a pig after you ye hutchered and e't it . You ye e't the pig amongst ye , and left me the pen . The s'ciety never had a deed o ' this ere prop'ty and no man ever had a deed o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took up the land here , was a good-natered sort of man , and he allowed a corner on t for his neighbors to put up a temp'rary meetin ' - house . That was finally used up , - the kind o ' preachin ' they had them days was enough to use up in a little time any house that wa ' n't fire-proof ; and when that was preached to pieces , they put up another shelter in its place . This is it . And now t the land ai n't used no more for the puppose t was lent for , it goes hack natrally to the estate t was took from , and the buildin 's along with it . ' " That s all a sheer fabrication , ' says the Deacon . This land was never a part of what s now your farm , any more than it was a part of mine . ' " Wal , ' says Jedwort , I look at it in my way , and you ye a perfect right to look at it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' my way , by puttin ' a fence round the hull concern . ' " And you re usin ' some of my rails fer to do it with ! ' says the Deacon . " Can you swear f they re your rails ? ' " Yes , I can ; they re rails the freshet carried off from my farm last spring , and landed onto yourn . ' " So I ye heard ye say . But can you swear to the partic'lar rails ? Can you swear , for instance , t this ere is your rail ? or this ere one ? " No ; I ca n't swear to precisely them two , - but-  ' " Can you swear to these two ? or to any one or two ? ' says Jedwort . No , ye ca n't . Ye can swear to the lot in general , but you ca n't swear to any particlar rail , and that kind o ' swearin' ' wo n't stand law , Deacon Talcott . I do n't boast of bein ' an edicated man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and when I know it , I dror a line there , and I toe that line , and I make my neighbors toe that line , Deacon Talcott . Nine p'ints of the law is possession , and I 11 have possession o ' this ere house and land by fencin ' on t in ; and though every man t comes along should say these ere rails belong to them , I 11 fence it in with these ere very rails . ' " Jedwort said this , wagging his obstinate old head , and grinning with his face turned up pugnaciously at the Deacon ; then went to work again as if he had settled the question , and did n't wish to discuss it any further . " As for Talcott , he was too full of wrath and boiling indignation to answer such a speech . He knew that Jedwort had managed to get the start of him with regard to the rails , by mixing a few of his own with those he had stolen , so that nobody could tell em apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger of going the same way , just for want of an owner to swear out a clear title to the property . He did just the wisest thing , when he swallowed his vexation , and hurried off to alarm the leading men of the two societies and to consult a lawyer . " He 11 stir up the old town like a bumble-bees ' nest , ' says Jedwort . Hurry up , boys , or there 11 be a buzzin ' round our ears fore we git through ! ' // " I wish ye would n't , pa ! ' says Dave . Why do n't we tend to our own business , and be decent , like other folks ? I 'm sick of this kind of life . ' Quit it , then , ' says Jedwort . " Do you tell me to quit it ? ' says Dave , dropping the end of a rail he was handling . " Yes , I do ; and dolt dumbed quick , if ye ca n't show a proper respect to your father ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he trembled as he answered back , I should be glad to sho xv you respect , if you was a man I could feel any respect for . ' " At that , Jedwort caught hold of the iron bar that was sticking in the ground , where he had been making a hole for a stake , and pulled away at it . I 'll make a stake-hole in you ! ' says he . It 's enough to have a sassy hired man round , without bein ' jawed by one 's own children ! " Dave was out of reach by the time the bar came out of the ground . " Come here , you villain ! ' says the old man . " I d rather be excused , ' says Dave , backing off . I do n't want any stakeholes made in me to-day . You told me to quit , and I in going to . You may steal your own meeting-houses in future ; I wo n't help . ' " There was a short race . Dave 's young legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he got off . Then Jedwort , coming back , wheezing and sweating , with his iron bar , turned savagely on me . I ye a good notion to tell you to go too ! ' " Very well , why do n't ye ? ' says I. I in ready . ' " There s no livin ' with ye , ye re gittin ' so dumbed sassy ! What I keep ye for is a mystery to me. * " No , it ai n't : you keep me because you can t get another man to fill my place . You put up with my sass for the money I bring ye in . ' " Hold your yawp , ' says he , and go and git another load of rails . If ye see Dave , tell him to come back to work . ' " I did see Dave , but , instead of telling him to go back , I advised him to put out from the old home and get his living somewhere else . His mother and Maria agreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Dave was gone . " When I got back with my second load , I found the neighbors assembling to witness the stealing of the old meeting-house ; and Jedwort was answering their remonstrances . " A meetin ' - house is a respectable kind o ' propty to have round , ' says he . The steeple 11 make a good show behind my house . When folks ride by , they 11 stop and look , and say , " There s a man keeps a private meetin ' - house of his own . " I can have preachin ' in t , too , if I want . I in able to hire a preacher of my own ; or I can preach myself and save the expense. * " Of course , neither sarcasm nor argument could have any effect on such a man . As the neighbors were going away , Jedwort shouted after em : Call ag'in . Glad to see ye . There 11 be more sport in a few days , when I take the dumbed thing away . ' ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to see the show . Free gratis . It 'll he good as a circus , and a tarnal sight cheaper . The women can bring their knittin ' , and the gals their everlastin ' tattin ' . As it 11 be a pious kind o ' show . hem ' it s a meetin ' - house , guess I 11 have notices gi'n out from the pulpits the Sunday afore . ' " The common was fenced in by sundown ; and the next day Jedwort had over a house-mover from the North Village to look and see what could be done with the building . Can ye snake it over , and drop it back of my house ? ' says he . " It 'll be a hard job , ' says old Bob , without you tear down the steeple fust . ' " But Jedxvort said , What s a meetin ' - house thout a steeple ? I ye got my heart kind o ' set on that steeple ; and I m bound to go the hull hog on this ere concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says Bob , examining the // timbers , I wo n't warrant but what the old thing 11 all tumble down . ' " I 11 resk it . ' " Yes ; but who 11 resk the lives of me and my men ? ' " 0 , you 11 see if it s re'ly goin ' to tumble , and look out . I 11 engage t me and my boys 11 do the most dangerous part of the work . Dumbed if I would n't agree to ride in the steeple and ring the bell , if there was one . " I ye never heard that the promised notices were read from the pulpits ; hut it was n't many days before Bob came over again , bringing with him this time his screws and ropes and rollers , his men and timbers , horse and capstan ; and at last the old house might have been seen on its travels . " It was an exciting time all around . The societies found that Jedwort 's fence gave him the first claim to house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone through to beat him off , - and then it might turn out that he would beat them . Some said fight him ; some said let him be , - the thing ai n't worth going to law for ; and so , as the leading men could n't agree as to what should be done , nothing was done . That was just what Jedwort had expected , and he laughed in his sleeve while Bob and his boys screwed up the old meeting-house , and got their beams under it , and set it on rollers , and slued it around , and slid it on the timbers laid for it across into Jedwort 's field , steeple foremost , like a locomotive on a track . " It was a trying time for the womenfolks at home . Maria had declared that , if her father did persist in stealing the meeting-house , she would not stay a single day after it , but would follow Dave . " That touched me pretty close , for , to tell the truth , it was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the old man . If you go , ' says I , then there is no object for me to stay ; I shall go too . ' " That 's what I supposed , ' says she ; for there s no reason in the world why you should stay . But then Dan will go ; and who 11 be left to take sides with mother ? That s what troubles me. 0 , if she could only go too ! But she wo n't ; and she could n't if she would , with the other children depending on her . Dear , dear ! what shall we do ? ' " The poor girl put her head on my shoulder , and cried ; and if I should own up to the truth , I suppose I cried a little too . For where s the man that can hold a sweet woman 's head on his shoulder , while she sobs out her trouble , and he has n't any power to help her , - who , I say , can do any less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two for company ? " Never mind ; do n't hurry , ' says Mrs. Jedwort . Be patient , and wait awhile , and it 11 all turn out right , I 'm sure " Yes , you always say , " Be patient , and wait ! " ' says Maria , brushing back her hair . But , for my part , I m tired of waiting , and my patience has given out long ago . We ca n't always live in this way , and we may as well make a change now as ever . But I ca n't bear the thought of going and leaving you . ' " Here the two younger girls came in ; and , seeing that crying was the order of the day , they began to cry ; and when they heard Maria talk of going , they declared they would go ; and even little Willie , the four-year-old , began to howl . " There , there ! Maria ! Lottie ! Susie ! ' said Mrs. Jedwort , in her calm way ; Willie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ; but I feel that something is going to happen that will show us the right way , and we are to wait . Now go and wash the dishes , and set the cheese . ' " That was just after breakfast , the second day of the moving ; and sure enough , something like what she prophesied did happen before another sun . " The old frame held together pretty well till along toward night , when the steeple showed signs of seceding . There she goes ! She 's falling now ! ' sung out the boys , who had been hanging around all day in hopes of seeing the thing tumble . " The house was then within a few // rods of where Jedwort wanted it ; but Bob stopped right there , and said it was n't safe to haul it another inch . That steeple s bound to come down , if we do , ' says he . " Not by a dumbed sight , it ai n't , ' says Jedwort . Them cracks ai n't nothin ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob to go up and examine ; but Bob shook his head , - the concern looked too shaky . Then be told me to go up ; but I said I bad n't lived quite long enough , and had a little rather be smoking my pipe on terra Jir ; ; uz . Then the boys began to hoot . Dumbed if ye ai n't all a set of cowards , ' says he . I 'll go up myself . ' vVe waited outside while he climbed up inside . The boys jumped on* the ground to jar the steeple , and make it fall . One of them blew a horn , - as be said , to bring down the old Jericho , - and another thought he d help things along by starting up the horse , and giving the building a little wrench . But Bob put a stop to that ; and finally out came a head from the belfry window . It was Jedwort , who shouted down to us : " There ai n't a j'int or brace gin out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up that ere horn , and- ' " Just then there came a cracking and loosening of timbers ; and we that stood nearest had only time to jump out of the way , when down came the steeple crashing to the ground , with Jedwort in it . " " I hope it killed the cuss , " said one of the village story-tellers . " Worse than tj*at , " replied my friend ; " it just cracked his skull , - not enough to put an end to his miserable life , but only to take away what little sense he had . We got the doctors to him , and they patched up his broken head ; and , by George , it made me mad to see the fuss the women-folks made over him . It would have been my way to let him die ; but they were as anxious and attentive to him as if he had been the kindest husband and most indulgent father that ever lived ; for that s women 's style : they re unreasoning creatures . " Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been up all night , to lie down a spell and catch a little rest , while Maria and I sat up and watched with the old man . All was still except our whispers and his heavy breathing ; there was a lamp burning in the next room ; when all of a sudden a light shone into the windows , and about the same time we heard a roaring and crackling sound . We looked out , and saw the night all lighted up , as if by some great fire . As it appeared to be on the other side of the house , we ran to the door , and there what did we see but the old meeting-house all in flames . Some felloxvs had set fire to it to spite J edwort . It must have been burning some time inside ; for when we looked out , the flames had burst through the roof . " As the night was perfectly still , except a light wind blowing away from the other buildings on the place , we raised no alarm , but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glad sight it was to us , you may be sure . I just held Maria close to my side , and told her that all was well , - it was the best thing that could happen . 0 yes , ' says she , it seems to me as though a kind Providence was burning up his sin and shame out of our sight . ' " I had never yet said anything to her about marriage ,  --  for the time to come at that had never hardly seemed to arrive ; but there s nothing like a little excitement to bring things to a focus . You ye seen water in a tumbler just at the freezing point , but not exactly able to make up its mind to freeze , when a little jar will set the crystals forming , and in a minute what was liquid is ice . It was the shock of events that night that touched my life into crystals , - not of ice , gentlemen , by any manner of means . " After the fire had got along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alarm was given , probably by the very fellows that set it , and a hundred people were on the spot before the thing had done burning . " Of course these circumstances put i o8 January , // an end to the breaking up of the family . Dave was sent for , and came home . Then , as soon as we saw that the old man 's brain was injured so that he was n't likely to recover his mind , the boys and I went to work and put that farm through a course of improvement it would have done your eyes good to see . The children were sent to school , and Mrs. Jedwort had all the money she wanted new to clothe them , and to provide the house with comforts , without stealing her own butter . Jedwort was a burden ; but , in spite of him , that was just about the happiest family , for the next four years , that ever lived on this planet . " Jedwort soon got his bodily health , but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As near as I could get at his state of mind , he thought he bad been changed into some sort of animal . He seemed inclined to take me for a master , and for four years he followed me around like a dog . During that time he never spoke , but only whined and growled . When I said , Lie down , ' he d lie down ; and when I whistled , he d come . " I used sometimes to make him work ; and certain simple things he would do very well , as long as I was by . One day I had a jag of hay to get in ; and , as the boys were away , I thought I 'd have him load it . I pitched it on to the wagon about where it ought to lie , and looked to him only to pack it down . There turned out to be a higger load than I had expected , and the higher it got , the worse the shape of it , till finally , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled , and the old man with it , head foremost . " He struck a stone heap , and for a moment I thought he was killed . But he jumped up and spoke for the first time . I ii blow It , ' says he , finishing the sentence he had begun four years before , when he called for the horn to be passed up to him . " I could n't have been much more astonished if one of the horses had spoken . But I saw at once that there was an expression in Jedwort 's face that had n't been there since his tumble in the belfry ; and I knew that , as his wits had been knocked out of him by one blow on the head , so another blow had knocked em in again . " Where s Bob ? ' says he , looking all around . " Bob ? ' says I , not thinking at first who he meant . 0 , Bob is dead , - he has been dead these three years . ' " Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hay come from ? Where s the old meetin ' - house " Do n't you know ? ' says I. Some rogues set fire to it the night after you got hurt , and burnt it up . ' " He seemed then just beginning to realize that something extraordinary had happened . " Stark , ' says he , what s the matter with ye ? You re changed . ' " Yes , ' says I , I wear my beard now , and J ye grown older ! ' " Dumbed if t ai n't odd ! ' says he . Stark , what in thunder s the matter with me ? " You ye had meeting-house on the brain for the past four years , ' says I ; that s what s the matter . ' " It was some time before I could make him understand that he had been out of his head , and that so long a time had been a blank to him . " Then he said , Is this my farm ? ' " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slicked up than ever it used to , ' says he . " Yes , ' says I ; and you 11 find everything else on the place slicked up in about the same way . ' " Where s Dave ? ' says he . " Dave has gone to town to see about selling the wool . ' " Where s Dan ? ' " Dan s in college . Hetakesagreat notion to medicine ; and we re going to make a doctor of him . ' " Whose house is that ? ' says he , as I was taking him home . " No wonder you do n't know it , ' says I. It has been painted , and shingled , and had new blinds put on ; the gates and fences are all in prime 1867.1 109 // condition ; and that s a new barn we put up a couple of years ago . ' " Where does the money come from , to make all these improve-inents ? ' " It comes off the place , ' says I. " We have nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ye made the farm more profitable than it ever was before . ' " That my house ? ' he repeated wonderingly , as we approached it . What sound is that ? ' " That s Lottie practising her lesson on the piano . ' " A pianer in my house ! ' he muttered . I ca n't stand that ! He listened . It sounds pooty , though ! " Yes , it does sound pretty , and I guess you 11 like it . How does the place suit you ? " It looks pooty . ' He started . What young lady is that ? ' " It was Lottie , who had left her music , and stood by the window . " My dabter ! ye do n't say ! Dumbed if she ai n't a mighty nice gal . ' " Yes , ' says I ; she takes after her mother . ' " Just tl2en Susie , who heard talking , ran to the door . " Who s that ag'in ? ' says Jedwort . " I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gal ! ' " Yes , ' says I , ' ske takes after her mother . ' " Little Willie , now eight years old , came out of the wood-shed with a bowand-arrow in his hand , and stared like an owl , hearing his father talk . " What boy is that ? ' says Jedwort . And when I told him , he muttered , He s an ugly-lookin ' brat ! ' " He s more like his father , ' says I. " The truth is , Willie was such a fine boy the old man was afraid to praise him , for fear I d say of him , as I 'd said of the girls , that he favored his mother . " Susie ran back and gave the alarm ; and then out came mother , and Maria with her baby in her arms , - for I forgot to tell you that we had been married now nigh on to two years . " Well , the women-folks were as much astonished as I had been when J edwort first spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into b the house ; and I am bound to say he behaved remarkably well He kept looking at his wife , and his children , and his grandchild , and the new paper on the walls , and the new ftirniture , and now and then asking a question or making a remark . " It all comes back to me now , ' says he at last . I thought I was living in the moon , with a superior race of human hem 's ; and this is the place , and you are the people . ' " It was n't more than a couple of days before he began to pry around ; and find fault , and grumble at the expense ; and I saw there was danger of things relapsing into something like their former condition . So I took him one side , and talked to him . " Jedwort , ' says I , you re like a man raised from the grave . You was the same as buried to your neighbors , and now they come and look at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To you , it s like coming into a new world ; and I 'll leave it to you now , if you do n't rather like the change from the old state of things to what you see around you to-day . You ye seen how the family affairs go on , - how pleasant everything is , and how we all enjoy ourselves . You hear the piano , and like it ; * ou see your children sought after and respected , - your wife in finer health and spirits than you ye ever known her since the day she was marned ; you see industry and neatness everywhere on the premises ; and you re a beast if you do n't like all that . In short , you see that our management is a great deal better than yours ; and that we beat you , even in the matter of economy . Now , what I want to know is this : whether you think you d like to fall into our way of living , or return like a hog to your wallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your way of livin ' very well , ' he grumbled . " Then , ' says I , you must just let us go ahead , as we have been going ahead . Now s the time for you to // turn about and be a respectable man , like your neighbors . Just own up , and say you ye not only b*n out of your head the past four years , but that you ye been more or less out of your head the last four-and-twenty years . But say you re in your right mind now , and prove it by acting like a man in his right mind . Do that , and I m with you ; we re all with you . But go back to your old dirty ways , and you go alone . Now I sha ' n't let you off , till you tell me what you mean to do . ' " He hesitated some time , then said , May be you re about right , Stark ; you and Dave and the old woman seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let you goon. * ' * 1-lere my friend paused , as if his story was done ; when one of the villagers asked , " About the land where the old meetin ' - house stood , - what ever was done with that ? " " That was appropriated for a new school-house ; and there my little shavers go to school. * ' " And old Jedwort , is he alive yet ? " " Both Jedwort and his wife have gone to that country where meanness and dishonesty have a mighty poor chance , - where the only investments worth much are those recorded . in the Book of Life . Mrs. Jedwort was rich in that kind of stock ; and Jedwort 's account , I guess , will compare favorably with that of some respectable people , such as we all know . I tell ye , my friends , " continued my fellow-traveller , " there s many a man , both in the higher and lower ranks of life , that t would do a deal of good , say nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock em on the head , and make Nebuchadnezzars of em , - then , after they d been turned out to grass a few years , let em come back again , and see how happy folks have been , and how well they have got along without em . " I carry on the old place now , " he added . " The younger girls are married off ; Dan s a doctor in the North Village ; and as for Dave , he and I have struck ile . I 'm going out to look at our property now. **
