Main text By the late G. A. Slimton , Esq . Act I Scene I SCENE .  --  Oystershop . TIME .  --  10 o'clock , P. M. Room brilliantly illuminated by two tallow candles . OYSTERMAN in the background brandishing his knife with a tragic air over a prostrate oyster . Enter TOM and DICK . Thomas ( loquitur ) This hour is big with fate , and must decide , As Shakspeare well remarks  --  Richardus I like ' em fried , They suit me rather better ; and I think That , ( as you pay , ) we 'll have a little drink . I 'm not at all particular , but fain Would  --  ( to Oysterman )  --  hand that bottle  --  taste of this Champagne . ( To Oysterman ) Just file the wires or break them with a fork , And , when I 'm ready , liberate the cork . Thomas Say , gentle Oysterman , old Neptune 's son , Oh say and soothe me ! are the shellfish done ? Oysterman That war n't my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing poked at me ! But to add rubbing in to poking  --  yes , That 's most too hard for any one I guess , And as for me  --  young man I tell you what I am  --  no matter what I am  --  I 'm hot , Ay , in my wrath a very mustard pot ! A curse is on me , wander where I will That dreadful ban , by jingoes ! dogs me still ! E'en so some puppy , to whose harmless tail Some urchin 's hand has tied an old tin pail , Flees to escape it , yet forever feels The cumbrous pendent dangling at his heels , And finds the only method left to take Is  --  for his heart , or tail , or both , to break ! I once was gentle as my own sweet Sam , But perfidy has made me what I am ! I have been cheated , and have suffered wrong Not to be sneezed at , I have borne long , long , That pay deferred that makes the full heart ache  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's oysters , eat them up and say " Trust us , good Oysterman "  --  and never pay ! ! Thomas ( aside ) I 've heard of second-sight , but can it be That fate 's dark book is conned by such as he ? If it be so , perhaps he may not trust  --  We 'll eat the oysters though , and then he must ! Oysterman ' T is hard , at best , to keep a wife and child And grievous when the last , last tatur 's biled ! When the wide world is wrapt in slumbers all And only Sammy wakes , and wakes to squall , Footnote : 1Kb Then on my restless couch I sleepless turn . Richardus I say ! old cock , these oysters here will burn ! Oysterman Let me alone for that  --  I scratch my head To think the morrow brings no loaf of bread . All this is sad enough , but sadder far , When I pass by the tavern 's well-stocked bar , See rum o'er rum , o'er whiskey , whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To warm the blood that curdles round my heart , And add fresh vigor to my baser part ,  --  Often I 've told the bar-keeper how slick ' T would be for both , if he would only " tick , " Just tick this once , I 'd never ask again , ' T would so relieve an intermittent pain , A sort of daily cholic that would come , And only yielded to New England Rum . ( Aside ) Take that junk bottle , Samuel , my son , ( It stands up in the corner there , ) and run Round to the grocer 's ; get it filled with  --  stuff And hasten back again  --  Begone ! Enough ! Thomas Much like the frightful colds which students tell , Just reach their crisis at the matin bell , Sudden they come and sudden disappear When the loud breakfast peal salutes the ear . The symptoms are a deep lethargic snore Till much-loved prayers and more-loved Locke are o'er , At morning meal an appetite diseased , Which , like poor Rachel , will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Returns more dreadful by next morning 's chimes  --  In former days they had a funny cure , Which , though severe , was almost always sure ; The President in person used to pick In Craigie 's woods full many a walnut stick Of toughest quality , and having got ' em Applied the same unto the patient 's  --  . Footnote : 1Kb But now-a-days the country air is thought To cure such maladies of every sort . But are the oysters fried ? I can not wait Much longer , Oysterman , it 's getting late . I hear sad accents which you can not hear , Ventriloquistic voices meet my ear , My mental ear , and weeping , seem to say " Our Commons dinner was but poor to-day . " And when I strive to put the tempter down , They moan again , " Do have them fried quite brown ! " Dick , if Fate 's hand were ever shown in aught , These dreadful omens are not meant for nought . So ghosts , when Csar fell , wrapt up in sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " As Shakspeare says  --  Richardus Dear Tom , the oysters wait , Do n't stand and moralize , but fill your plate . Thomas Fill ! I 'll do more , I 'll empty it as fast As what is " present " hastens to be " past ; " For verily my nose , most mighty Dick , Informs my bowels that the treat is slick ! E'en so some grunter , monarch of the stye , Lifts o'er the new-brought swill his nostrils high , Keeps all the other rev'rent piglings off As he inhales the incense of the trough , And while his very tail for rapture curls , Prefers his banquet to a feast of pearls . Footnote : 1Kb Richardus Bring on the bottle , Oysterman , this knife Shall bring its prisoned energies to life , See how it foams and fizzles to be free ,  --  ( Cuts the cork loose . ) Pop ! that 's a sounder ! how it sparkles ! See ! Thomas E'en so my spirit , Richard , scorns the rules Of College order , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but galling chains , The empty work of still more empty brains ; A poor device , if history tell us true , To make the many buckle to the few ? Laws ! shame that such frail gossamer should bind The God-like powers of the mighty mind ! ( Dick , in the mean while , keeps alternately tipping the bottle towards his glass , and his glass towards his mouth , with a dexterity which Sancho Panza himself might have been proud to imitate . ) Oh how my spirit struggles to be loose And strives in vain ! alas it ai n't no use ! Oh Dick ! Dick ! Dick ! if you but had a soul Like mine , to grasp the world from pole to pole , And , in its universal charity take in Each fellow mortal of whatever skin ; Brown Indian , roasted by the eccentric sun , And ebon Ethiop , rather overdone , ( What time poor Phaton in Sol 's bright car , " Shot from the zenith like a falling star , " ) Had you a soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say  --  these things are fried in too much fat  --  You 'd say , What are the laws to me , to any one , If but approving conscience say , " Well done ! " Richardus Well done , forsooth ! Well done ! I do not care What conscience likes , but I prefer things rare ! ( With this he pours down the last glass of Champagne ) Thomas Yet why this eloquence ? he heeds me not , Far better eat my oysters while they 're hot . Besides , this speech , if husbanded with care , May one day make the Harvard Union stare , And bellowed forth with more than Stentor 's lungs Call thundering plaudits from a dozen tongues ! ! ! So some huge Freshman , hero of a tail , Delights to feel it fluttering in the gale , But more delights to save it nicely brushed , Till Sophs ' fell ire by Sunday 's calm is hushed , Then proudly does his young ambition soar , As he struts sternly to the chapel door , In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature 's noblest gift , New York Champagne ! Light of the sense ! Elysium of the brain ! Who cast aside the grape , and mixed instead With one part brandy , four of pure white lead , And thus our country 's freedom did enhance , No more dependent on the vines of France ? A leather medal his reward should be , A leather medal and an LL . D. ! ( after a pause , sings ) " Come hey down derry Let 's drink and be merry In spite of Mahomet 's law ! " But stop ! oh sight of horrors ! by the stove Stand two twin oystermen ! they do , by Jove ! Glaring at me , with look intent , they stand , And knives , for murder thirsty , in their hand , Oh men of oysters ! men of oysters oh ! What can possess ye to regard me so ? And Thomas ! long loved , honored Thomas too , Why have you thus transformed yourself to two ? I ne'er expected such a thing of you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuddled Dick , I say , Here , take my arm , and let us haste away . Richardus Believe me , Tom , I really am not high , This seeing double 's wholly " in my eye "  --  And really , ( hiccup , ) Tom , I can not see Why you should thus insinuate at me . E'en so the pot behind the kettle 's back , As history tells us , called his cousin black . A meddling saucepan to the kettle told The whole affair , before the words were cold . The latter boiled with wrath , ' called out ' the pot , And shot the luckless slanderer on the spot ! ! So prithee , Thomas , do not make a fuss , And let the pot 's sad fate take one of us . Thomas I will not , dearest Dick  --  but let us go , We 've something else to do to-night , you know ; And though some proctor , on his evening scout , Led by his nose , should chance to find us out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'd try his courage , Dick , I feel so bold ! ! Richardus Yes , Tom , if courage dwelleth in the feet , I think you 'd stand the fairest chance to beat . Exeunt Tom and Dick singing " We wo n't go home till morning ! " g ( A proctor comes out from the other cell in the shop ) Proctor Now will I keep a very strict look out , And , ( if thou'rt faithful to thy charge , my snout , And guid'st me truly yet this one time more As thou , unerring , oft hast done before , ) I hope to nip in time this budding scrape , Nor let the actors or the act escape ! Then in all future proctors ' mouths my name Shall be synonymous with deathless fame . Guy Fawkes was nothing to this horrid plot ,  --  But I must strike while yet the iron 's hot ! Exit Proctor , in his haste forgetting to pay . Manet Oysterman Now by the terrors of this mighty fist Which rival oystermen could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay , E'er yet the sun proclaims another day . Nor sword nor horrid oysterknife will sheathe Until I make him banquet on his teeth ! ! Footnote : 1Kb ( Takes a swallow from the bottle . ) To seal the oath I take one leetle drop  --  Sam ! while I 'm gone , do you attend the shop ! Footnote : 1Kb Exit . End of Act
