txt There is a good dealt of talk about these days of the importance of preserving the integrity of the judiciary by nominating and electing honest and capable men as judges . Nor is too much importance likely to be attached to this , or too much care and labor likely to be bestowed upon it in the coming election .. But even it the exertions which are being made should be successful , and none but honest and capable judges chosen , the people must not think that they thereby insure honesty and justice in the business of the Courts . The jury is still an important element in them , and that too will need watching . We have not found it entirely free from suspicion heretofore . Fraud and rascality have infinite variety , and when driven from one place , are sure to appear elsewhere . Eternal vigilance is the price of honesty as *ell as of liberty . We are led to these remarks by a scene which occurred yesterday in the United States Circuit Court in this City . Our readers may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Court has attracted some attention heretofore . Jurors in this Court are drawn by lot from a list of citizens made up by the Commissioners of Jurors as other Jurors are , but they are paid two dollars a day instead of a shilling a cause , as in the State Courts . Officials who had pensioners to keep , or friends whom they were willing to see fed by the Federal Government , had observed this difference , so that it was found that by some means the same parties were returned on the jury pannels term after term . The matter became so notorious that , at last , the Clerk of the Court was directed to have his juries drawn in Kings County . Brooklyn being the City of Churches , it was supposed , probably , that the difficulties which were met wit ! ! in this corrupt City of New-York would be entirely obviated by fetching the juries from across the East River . The plan worked well for a - while , and every one remarked what an improvement in the character and appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that the change for the better could not last . A panel of sixty jurors was ordered to be drawn for the petit jury of the present term , and the Deputy-Clerk went over to Brooklyn to draw them . He informed Mr. CAMPBELL , the Commissioner of Jurors , of his desire , and thereupon a parcel of ballots was produced and the Clerk was directed to draw his sixty names from that parcel when placed in the box ; and , singularly enough , when the sixty names were drawn out there remained but one name in the box undrawn . This proceeding coming to Judge NELSON 'S ears , he summoned the Deputy-Clerk before him , and having in open Court inquired into the facts , he at once discharged all the jury from further attendance upon the Court . The Judge remarked that this  --  ; roceeding of Mr. CAMPBELL 'S , if passed over unnoticed , would practically allow him to pack the juries for the Court , and he remarked also upon the singular fact that twelve out of the sixty so drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . He might have added , if he had known it , that Mr. CAMPBELL is a candidate for the Assembly , and that about twentyfive of the sixty proved , on examination , to be residents of his Assembly District , and . that one gentleman came to answer to a name which was not his exactly , but which he knew meant him , because Mr. CAMPBELL had told him be was going to be on that jury . The community is indebted to Judge NELSON for his prompt . condemnation of this transaction . It will have an effect for good , we doubt not , beyond the present instance . It is something to see a Judge with nerve enough not only to condemn in words , but to follow it up with speedy action of redress . Whether lack of nerve is a personal one , or an effect of the system of an elective judiciary , in either case Judge NELSON has set an example worthy to be followed by other Courts in time of need , and to which we call the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our City .
