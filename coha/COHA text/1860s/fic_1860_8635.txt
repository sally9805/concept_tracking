Elizabeth Only composed to-night ! Mil . John Milton A prelude , daughter ; I trust a prelude to a happy strain , Which even now is murmuring at my heart . As yet , the hour is early : ere I sleep , I 'll write some rhyming words  --  two songs , mayhap ; And " L ' Allegro " shall be the name of one ; And of its shadow  --  what ? " Il Penseroso . " Eliz . Elizabeth Stories of Italy ? Mil . John Milton But seeming so : The scene shall be in England .  --  And part of it is round our own dear porch . Eliz . Elizabeth The vines , the little garden ? Mil . John Milton Yes , of those A loving word or two : the porch may be The frame-work of the picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine , Or the twisted eglantine "  --  Eliz . Elizabeth I know it will be beautiful ! Your touch Can make our simple garden , Paradise ! Mil . John Milton ( Aside .  --  The garden  --  Paradise !  --  There is a thought in that ; it pleases me : Paradise Lost  --  a mournful , wondrous theme ! Yes , I will ponder it . ) Eliz . Elizabeth What think you , father ? Mil . John Milton Only of trifles , in the eyes of men . The age is stormed with troubles ! presently Shall peace return ; and then my lofty song , My universal song , shall win the world , Who will not let it die ! Eliz . Elizabeth ( Aside .  --  His mind is crowded With its mysterious guests . I ever know When fancies press upon him . So , good night ! His magic wants no witnesses . ) Dear father , I go to do my copying : the task Is nearly finished . Mil . John Milton ( Abstractedly . ) Would to Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best  --  Mil . John Milton Right patiently and well . But not of that I spoke : not words , my daughter . The swiftly-coming future teems with deeds , And those , I fear , of blood ! O , Liberty ! Is there no music welcome unto thee But sighs and groans and shrieks ! No offering But human hearts , piled , quivering , on thy altar ! Must thou behold the widow 's agony ; The orphan 's helplessness ; the death of pity ; Ere thou wilt smile to bless us ! Eliz . Elizabeth Speak not thus ! Surely it is a dream ! England is safe ! These sorrows are thin clouds ; the light shines through , And brighter still , to chase them far away ! Mil . John Milton It may be , but mine eyes shall never see it ! Eliz . Elizabeth Why not ? Have patience yet a little while . Mil . John Milton I shall not see it ! Eliz . Elizabeth Why , dear father , why ? Mil . John Milton Dost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Milton There comes a darkness Over my eyes , at times , that , as I write , Changes the paper to a sombre grey , In which the words do fade , like stars at morning ! Eliz . Elizabeth My poor , dear father , wilt thou not , for me , For one who loves thee  --  yea ! with all her soul ! Wilt thou not rest ? Wilt not refrain these studies , That so devour thy sight ? Mil . John Milton There 's one who urges me to constant toil , One whom I love even better than my daughter  --  England ! For her sake , grant me power , O Heaven , To labor on ! Like Sampson , blind yet strong , Let me defy the enemies of freedom , Hug the huge pillars of the tyrant 's temple , And crush it to the earth  --  though I , too , perish ! Not for a day , not for a day , O God ! I work for centuries ; and grope in darkness That light may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deed is grand . I almost worship that , But still I love my father , and would save him . Mil . John Milton Be brave , my child ; for kind thou ever wert , Obedient ever . Thy reward is sure . Remember , then , I , too , obey my Father ! Now to thy chamber ; write no more to-night : And I will only whisper to the Moon , An hour at most , then his me to repose . Good night ! Eliz . Elizabeth Good night ! Mil . John Milton And in thy prayer  --  Eliz . Elizabeth As ever ! Exit . Milton crosses to the casement , and gazes upward . Mil . John Milton Beautiful light ! Beautiful lamp of Heaven ! What marvel that the heathen worshipped thee ? That from a thousand hills their altars sent The silvery smoke of adoration up ? Not knowing Him , the One , the Uncreate , What marvel thou shouldst seem a Deity , The first-born offspring of His earliest gift , And blessd emanation from His glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain To wean my heart from thee ! Though , soon , no more Shall I behold thy spirit-soothing smile . A dread and everlasting midnight comes . What duty , then , remains ? Why , still to labor , That mental blindness follow not ! Enter Andrew . And . Andrew There be a man on the perch . Mil . John Milton Robber , or honest man ? And . Andrew Verily , he should be honest , for he looketh not like a Cavalier ; and his name is Cromwell . Mil . John Milton Why came he not in ? And . Andrew In good sooth , and of a verity , because I did not ask him ; but rather did desire he should wait without , till it should be plain unto me that you reclined not , even in the arms of Somebody . Mil . John Milton Somnus were more correct . And . Andrew We live and learn ; yea , and verily do we learn more evil than good . For the times are full of wickedness , yea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and the King , like unto another Csar , would grind the Parliament under his iron heel , but for such a friend of liberty , such a noble soldier of the Lord , as brave Master Cromwell  --  Mil . John Milton Who waits in the chilly night ! And . Andrew I will go straightway , and admit that faithful servant  --  Mil . John Milton As thou art one thyself . And . Andrew Yea , verily ! Exit . Mil . John Milton His words are wrong , but those are from the lips . His life is right , and that is from the heart . Enter Cromwell . Give you good evening , Cromwell . Crom . Oliver Cromwell Master Milton , The Lord be over you ! Mil . John Milton I cry you pardon that you stood without . Crom . Oliver Cromwell Nay , but a moment , with the pleasant moon  --  The only pleasant thing in England 's night ! Nor , were there blame , were you the least to blame  --  And Andrew did his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cry pardon , Intruding on your studies . Mil . John Milton Of a truth , Good Cromwell , you are ever welcome here . Crom . Oliver Cromwell I thought so , and I came :  --  especially  --  Mil . John Milton With news ? Crom . Oliver Cromwell From Ireland . Ulster 's all ablaze ! The forts are captured ! Connaught , Leinster , revel In massacre ! The Counties of the Pale , Arrayed to quell the insurrection  --  join it ! Already twenty thousand of our brethren Are slain !  --  Mil . John Milton But of the King ? Crom . Oliver Cromwell Ay , of the King ! Well said ! Have I not told you horrors ? Mil . John Milton Too , too many ; Save that , at last , they may arouse our England ! Crom . Oliver Cromwell They shall ! From Parliament I 'll thunder them , Round all the sea-girt coast ! But what  --  what think you ? What name for him who leads this mad rebellion ? ' T is England 's King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proved ? Crom . Oliver Cromwell It can : and is ! Mil . John Milton Then is there cause to fear ! No life is safe ! Woe to the man who dares uplift his voice For England 's Constitution and her Church ! But now we see our enemy . Forewarned , ' T is our own fault if not foreweaponed , too ! Crom . Oliver Cromwell I watch for that !  --  With girded loins , and burning lamps , I watch ! And to this end now do I come to you . What of the youth , Ardenne ? Mil . John Milton Right well of him . I kept my messenger on guard , who found him , To-day , the very hour of his arrival ; Gave him the letters  --  Crom . Oliver Cromwell Answered he at all ? Mil . John Milton Read the reply . ( Giving Cromwell a letter . ) Crom . Oliver Cromwell ( Reading , and speaking aloud at times . ) We wrestled with the Lord ; Yea , with the Lord in prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came unto our minds As with an audible and potent voice : ' Call to your aid the man  --  even the youth  --  Edgar Ardenne ! ' He answers : " Here am I ! " Mil . John Milton ' T was well our offer had no bribery in ' t , Nor aught of doubt , nor word of one condition ! This do I know : he is a worshipper Of wisdom , truth , and liberty ! To these , Let him once see the way , he will not fail , Though at the price of all he holds most dear , To follow it ! Crom . Oliver Cromwell Why came he not to-day ? Mil . John Milton I know not . Still , There is good reason . He will surely come . Crom . Oliver Cromwell I do begin to doubt him . Let him not , In promises , take Charles for an example  --  His Majesty , the Liar ! Mil . John Milton Be assured . Enter Edgar . Edgar . Edgar Ardenne Milton !

I have heard , Even in a single day , my first in England , The story of your life . Crom . Oliver Cromwell A simple story , Nor worth the telling . In the hands of Him , Whom I would serve , I am a blade of grass , But if it be His will to give me strength , Yes , as the warrior 's spear I may be strong , To do His holy bidding . Mil . John Milton ( To Edgar . ) Troublous times Have darkened England , since I saw you last . That moonlight night , more beautiful than ours , Musing within the haunted Coliseum , Our pensiveness was for the glorious past , The old renown of Rome  --  not England 's fall ! Crom . Oliver Cromwell The fall of England !  --  Truly it will be so , unless her children Rise to the rescue ! England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have no home but here : If here they dwell not , they return to Heaven ! Edgar . Edgar Ardenne The news to-day  --  it went in whispers by me  --  Can it be true  --  the King ? Mil . John Milton It is too true ! Crom . Oliver Cromwell A damnd crime ! Too black to think upon ! A thousand hearts this day will blaze in England , At telling of the wrong ! A thousand arms Be ready to avenge it ! Insult , first , Then persecution , tyranny , and murder ! We have no laws , but by his high permission ; We have no liberty , save he may grant it ; We have no faith , but his , the Lord 's Anointed ! We have  --  no English blood ! Edgar .
