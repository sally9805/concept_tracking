IN TWO PARTS. - PART II . MISS HILTON came-I may also say , she saw , she conquered . Hearing that her success as a belle had been almost incredible ; that she counted her admirers by hundreds where other charming women counted them by tens ; that wherever she appeared people seemed to take leave of their common-sense , we were prepared for any revelation of beauty and fascination . For myself ; I think I vaguely expected to see a combination of Circe and Venus , clad in the latest Paris fashion . It was in this frame of mind that Alston and I came over to the ball-room that night . Miss Hilton had remained in her cottage all day , and was then to be seen for the first time . We found the entire population of the Springs assembled , deliberately gazing at her ; and stepping into the room , we followed their example . What I expected to see , I have stated-what I saw , was a tall , elegantlooking woman of ; perhaps , twenty-four years of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity of brown hair peculiarly arranged , firm , even , white teeth , a solid ja*v , and a pair of calm , steady hazel eyes , which had a singular power and habit of seeing , weighing , and cataloguing you as it were , in one slow , cool look of ; perhaps , half a moment 's duration . As we came near her , she passed her eyes quietly over us . " Alston , " I exclaimed , " do n't you know now exactly how a book feels when it has been read through and put upon a shelf . " " Yes , " he laughed ; " she has undoubtedly read us as far as we are written in her language ! My only hope is , that a good deal of our contents is in an unknown tongue , in hieroglyphics to her . " The calm ease , the depth of comfort to herself with which Miss Hilton stood talking to those around her , renewing her acquaintance with many persons whom she had met at other places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sight to have seen . It was that to which she had always been accustomed , and its absence rather than its presence would have disconcerted her-if ; indeed , her discomposure were possible . She was in her native element , and had the grace of a bird in air or a fish in water . Her manner was repose itself-quiet to coldness . The attention she accepted was won by no apparent effort ; she simply stood receiving tribute . There are women called good and pure and virtuous , who sway many men for a season by stirring their lower natures , by awaking their senses to unsatisfied hunger ; but we all at a glance acquitted Miss Hilton of having built her throne on such a foundation . No ; if this were a goddess , Diana , not Venus , was her name . Again , there are women in whom there is such an electrical force , such an exuberant vitality , that they rouse and excite and charm you like fresh , cool breezes or dancing sunlight-as there are others who bind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still others to whom winsome ways and infinite variety of mood and manner give a means of fascination beyond the ability of beauty . But Miss Hilton evidently was none of these ; and the longer we watched her the less we could determine what she was , the less we could discover the cause of a result which we knew to be a fact . We all looked at each other in a blank , perplexed way , and criticism came slowly and in* disjointed sentences . // " She is handsome , " some one would remark , hesitatingly , " but really I do n't see- " and here she would stop , " finding it difficult to formulate her objection , " as Mr. Howells somewhere admirably puts it . " Exactly so . Neither do I , " another would eagerly answer , comprehending her meaning perfectly . " An elegant woman ! " said a gentleman in front of me . " Elegant skirts , you mean , " returned his wife . And when you remember how much of what we call style in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , I am inclined to think her criticism possessed some truth . " Handsome " - " stylish " - we all agreed thus far , but could get no nearer to an analysis or solution of that which puzzled us  --  the source of Miss Hilton 's undoubted power . The exhibition of it was before our eyes ; for gentleman after gentleman went up to be introduced to her ; and so surely as they did so they stayed . She received them all with the same tranquil composure , but evidently kept them interested in some way-though how , I could not imagine . The crowd around her was soon so large that none but those nearest her could hear or enjoy what she might be saying ; yet those on the outskirts held firmly to her circle , and seemed content to do so while they looked at her and talked to each other . So general did this gradually become , that she had soon absorbed nearly the whole male population under her jurisdiction ; and still without our exactly comprehending how it was accomplished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old rhyme , that the men were so many Grasshoppers sitting on a sweet potato vine , Big torkey gobbter came op behind And gobbled them off that sweet potato vine ; b.tt I was sincerely shocked at the remark , as I looked at Miss Hilton 's cold fine impassivity . The evening wore on , and , though Miss Hilton puzzled and consequently entertained me , I was conscious of no bias in her favor , untila small circumstance occurred which won her my warm gratitude . Marie Palfrey had been among the lookers on ; and , although she had wisely said nothing , her thoughts were amusingly evident in her face and manner . Hitherto , partly from nature , but chiefly because she made the requisite exertion1 she had assumed a sort of social sway over the whole company ; a sway at which many of us laughed and protested , but to which we all submitted , because it was too much trouble to rebel . But the handwriting which told of a stronger rule than hers was now upon the wall and slse suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To watch her face , as she watched Miss Hilton , was to see a certain admiration wrung from her ; for that lady was what Marie aspired to be . Miss Palfrey had openly stated that she hoped the other lady might not come to the Springs while she remained ; hut now that the event had happened , she clearly made up her mind to accommodate herself to circumstances . Opposition was idle ; but divided sovereignty , alliance , offensive and defensive , as between two friendly powers , was very apparently Marie 's plan . When , at last , she rose , gathered up her draperies , and , accel ) ting the arm of a gentleman near , swept across the room to be introduced to vIiss Hilton , I could not help thinking of Maria Theresa making overtures to Elizabeth of Russia , or addressing " the Pompadour " as " my sister , " for reasons of State policy . I saw both ladies bow , then Marie said a few words , to which Miss Hilton bowed again slightly , whtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // 479 Marie visibly hesitated for a moment as to what she should do next , and then fell back into the crowd , upon Miss Hilton 's left hand . I saw her face then , and I knew instantly that the co-sovereignty idea had entirely vanished from her mind , that she had been absorbed into the queen 's train , and assi brled her place therein . Or , to speak in army phrase , she had in one moment been captured and sent to the rear ; and that , too , not with the honors of a geneAl officer , but merely as a l ) rivate soldier . I may say , in the words Mrs. Chick , " I forgave dear Fanny everything . " For several clays Marie made ineffectual attempts to gain the place of chiefof-staff ; or first maid of honor , whichever it might be termed ; but failing signally , she quietly accepted the situation with that practical sense which was the grain of salt in her insipidity . The truth was , Miss Hilton did not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficing for her needs ; and the unaccustomed encumbrance merely annoyed her . I have always believed that this deposition was the decisive cause of Marie 's engaging herself , within the next few days , to one of her old admirers ; thereby resigning from active service and entering the retired list with dignity . From this slight new elevation she surveyed lIiss Hilton and her successes with an air of gentle condescension , of . indulgence for human weakness , which was so absurdly well done that it used to send me off into apparently idiotic fits of laughter almost before her face . Alston said I kept him so nervous with apprehension that I would break out into untimely and unseemly mirth , that when I did so he hardly had presence of mind to find some excuse for my merriment , or to divert her attention with wild attempts at wit-attempts which I ungratefully told him were an insult to even Marie Palfrey 's sense of humor . But to go back to the events of that first evening . We had left Rob Dearing sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not shared in the general excitement , and when asked to accompany us , Rob had said , indolently , that " they would come in a little while and see what she looked like . " But the little while grew to be a long while , and it was after ten o'clock before they came idly sauntering in , and , standing in front of us , looked at the new belle . " She 's very well made , and so are her clothes , " said Rob , in his offhand way , but I ca n't see why they make such a wonderful fuss about her . " " Just what I think ; but Alston says he is not surl ) rised that a woman with such a jawbone should succeed in anything she attempted , " I rejoined . " But then he judges people chiefly by their jawbones , " I added , like a postcript addressed only to Alston 's comprehension , and with a guilty reference to his old criticism upon Rob . " Certainly I do , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To weigh a man 's practical importance , I always look at the lower rather than at the upper half of his face . Why even the jawbone of an ass has accomplisheci something in the world , and maintains a respectable place in history to this day . " Rob laughed merrily , in blissful ignorance of any.personal connection with the matter , and went back to the special rather than the general aspect of the subject . " She 's nothing very wonderful , " he repeated ; " but as everybody seems to have been introduced to her , I think I 'll be introduced , too . I 'll leave Miss Letty in your charge . " And nodding gaily , he strode off . It gave me quite the sensation of being present at a court reception , or better // still , at an old tournament , to see Rob bow in his magnificent way before that stately lady , as though he were doing homage to the queen of love and beauty . The charm of his appearance and manner told even upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made place for him beside her . Indeed , she must have been a stock or a stone not to have shone faintly in return on the sun which fairly beamed upon her . IIiss Hilton might not possess much intellect , but her social perceptions and instincts were so finely developed that they served her purpose better than brains . She knew a splendid gentleman when she saw him , and comprehended Rob Dearing 's value instantly . I was watching the pair as they talked what I knew to be agreeable commonplaces , and enjoying the scene not a little , when , glancing down at Letty , it occurred to me that she was not exactly sharing my feeling . " Letty , you have n't given us your criticism yet . What do you think of her ? " I asked . The blue eyes looked up at me with a tired , troubled expression . " She is so strong and splendid that she takes away my breath-she almost frightens me , " she answered , hesitatingly . " Nonsense , Bopeep ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who is n't half as pretty as you are She was evidently depressed and nervous ; and , as she was a woman , I gave her a compliment to stimulate her vanity , just as I would have administered a dose of brandy to a weary man , to stimulate his blood . Letty laughed and brightened in a way which confirmed my theory of the virtue of flattery as a remedy , both spiritual and physical . XVith most women the nervous system , and consequently the health , runs down without judiciously supplied praise and even overpraise . It is as dangerous to cut off their proper modicum of flattery as it is to deprive them entirely of animal food . To be charming , a woman must be made to feel that she is so ; otherwise , her spirits and self-confidence fall below the point of agreeability . Desiring earnestly that Letty should retain her power of fascination , I petted her for the next hour as though she was irresistible , because I wanted to convince her that such was the case . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was dis appointed . Like all those who came within Miss Hilton 's sphere , he remained there . It grew late , and I proposed going back to our cottage , asking Letty whether she would stay with some other party or leave the place with us . She said she was tired , and would prefer going . I hoped Rob would join us when we left ; but I think he scarcely noticed our departure . XVe missed him and his gay ways as we walked home , and I said so ; but Letty made me no reply . Still , thinking it but the most temporary eclipse of our sun , I bade her goodnight , cheerily , and went to bed with no anxiety for her upon my mind-with merely a feeling that the latter part of the evening had not passed as agreeably as usual for either of us . Oneof the first sounds I heard next morning was Letty 's voice ringing little peals of bells between Rob 's joyous tones , which were like a solid laugh . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nervous vibration thrQugh it , which made it scarcely the calm , childlike merriment of the day before . It told of relief* and spoke not only of present pleasure , but hinted of past pain . " That poor child has been worrying herself over Rob 's absence last night , " I thought , " and manufacturing a terror for herself out of Miss Hilton . The little goose to fear any one 's attractions when he loves her so seriously and // honestly , " I went on , in my superior wisdom . I was soon to learn which of us had read him most rightly , the woman who loved him or the woman who merely liked him-she who felt , or I who only thought . I went out on the porch and found them standing in the fresh , early sunshine , which seemed their natural atmosphere , awaiting the collection of the two families . Rob had apparently forgotten Miss Hilton 's existence , and was as devoted to Letty as heart could wish . He breakfasted with our party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then some one suggested a game of tenpins as a good compromise between deliberate exercise and recreation ; so to the tenpin alley we went . We found a party playing upon one of the alleys , and taking possession of the other we offered to play against them , as was the fashion of the place ; Alston , Letty , Rob , and myself against four ladies and gentlenien on the other side . I have always said that as we play any game , so we play the game of life ; that it is in such things we display our real characters beyond our own control . Consequently , I watch varieties of play with much interest , feeling that a consonance with character is there , if I can but discover it . I could not support my theory by four better instances than those then present . Alston played in a steady , even way , seldom making brilliant points , but scoring up at the end a solid , unbroken column of double figures , which might be calculated upon almost to a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rob to superintend her play , was rolling neat little balls , which went straight on their errand and clicked smartly against the pins , though they failed to knock many of them down . For myseW I confess that tenpins have always been to me a shame and a humiliation . In this matter , I am just what I most aspire not to be-showy and unreliable . Summer after summer have I gone to different watering-places and made unto myself a reputation in their respective tenpiri alleys , until I have been sought after as a partner , and even looked upon as out weighing a gentleman on the opposite side . Then , when I have raised the hopes of my party and have been regarded as a tower of strength , my right hand ha* suddenly forgotten its cunning , and my play only become more nervous , wild and uncertain as I strove to improve . I confess it-I am , in this thing , an innc cent impostor , and only soothe my conscience by warning all persons who tak. me upon my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out a bad bargai upon their hands at any moment . Poor Rob and I were nearly related in thi* matter ; with the difference that , while I took my irregularities sorely to heart Rob rather enjoyed his , and gloried in them as giving an element of excitemen and variety to an otherwise monotonous pursuit . He was capable of making ten strike , and then rolling off all three balls upon the very next round . W never felt sure , until the last ball was played , that he might not make us lose th game ; and yet , on other occasions , when affairs seemed desperate , we all in stinctively looked to him to retrieve the fortunes of the day by some piece o triumphant good luck . A most trying partner was Rob ; hut as I watched hii that morning , and gaily told him that it was necessary to take him for better fc worse , to balance his failings against his merits , and to forgive him one in virtu of the other , I little imagined how soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper matter than tenpins . We had won the first game , and being , consequently , in a very good hum with ourselves and our opponents , were making up a new score to give the ' their revenge , when Miss Hilton entered with her mother and three attend a gentlemen . Whereupon we were all introduced to each other , and Miss Hiltc // was invited to join in our game . She acquiesced most graciously , coming over to our side with one of our companions , and sending the other two gentlemen to our antagonists to preserve a balance . With my previous curiosity in Miss Hilton , it may be readily imagined that I was glad to apply my tenpin test to her , that I surveyed her game with close interest . I found she played remarkably well , with the ease and confidence of long practice . Alston 's game was not more steady and reliable than hers , while she constantly made strokes as brilliant as Rob 's in his most inspired moments . Yet she took her success in this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been surprised in case only of failure . By this time I had begun to feel her influence , and faintly to perceive the source of her power . She reminded me of Mirabeau 's judgment of Robespierre , when the latter was but an unknown Deputy- " That man will certainly come to somewhat ; doubt is not in him . " I found she was perfectly goodnatured , as assured strength * enerally is ; and was free from " envy , malice , and all uncharitableness . " She was the least self-conscious of women , being too absolutely satisfied , rooted in assurance , to leave her room for further thought on the subject ; consequently , she gave her whole consciousness and attention to the person addressing her-an incalculable source of agreeability so long as human vanity and amour *roJre maintain their present proportions . She had not the least ill feeling or sense of triumph over the women whose admirers she swel ) t away . She did not glory over conquests made by no effort of hers , over captives who surrendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her mission as a belle ; called to it by nature , as other women are to writing books or painting pictures . I never saw a clearer case of destiny . She might have said , literally , " For this purpose I was born , to walk in triumphal procession through life and society , until I reach that wealthy marriage and grand establishment over which I shall reign with such eminent grace and fitness . " She had been born the fashion , lived the fashion , and would die the fashion . I was so keenly interested in studying her , and , indeed , had fallen so far under her influence that it seemed natural to me that the entire party should enter her service , as it were ; especially that Rob should constitute himself her devoted cavalier . I remembered Rob as I had first seen him , in the costume of Sir Valter Raleigh , and fancied he had found his Queen Elizabeth , and was casting before her feet , not his cloak , but himself . Yet it seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind until I happened to glance at Alston . His eyes had that dull , hazy look , which shuts you out and his thoughts in , and which always comes into his face with trouble . Then I woke up and thought of Letty . I found Alston was taking care of her , choosing her bails , and trying to supply Rob 's place outwardly , though no one knew better than himself how entirely he failed to do so in reality . Letty had faded out , not only comparatively , hut positively ; the pink in her cheeks had died away , the very color in her eyes and hair seemed lessened . Yet the girl bore her pain bravely , the boyish , resolute chin stood her in good stead . Her gayety had vanished , and she had become almost silent ; but further than this , there was little noticeable change in her manner . When her turn came to roll , she did so ; but her weak balls were weaker than ever , while they had lost all their neatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling out to her in good-natured , unconscious cruelty , // " Miss Letty , take care this time , or we shall lose the game . You are not pbsying as well as you did an hour ago . " And then turned back to Miss Hilton , almost before the girl would have had time to answer him , had she desired to do so . I began to realize what Aiston 's look said , that there was trouble ahead for the poor child ; and every moment our party passed together confirmed my impression . At last , having won three games in succession , the satiety of victory on our side and the continuance of defeat on theirs , made us all tacitly agree to desist until fortune should be in a more even-handed mood . As we came straggling out of the tenpin alley , by twos and threes , we saw a cart coming up the road , and instantly there was a rush toward it ; for we knew that it had been driven in from the surrounding country and contained fruit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door at each of the Virginia springs ought to he written a form of Dante 's words " XVho enters here leaves hope ( of fruit ) behind . " Blackberries and huckleberries I do not class under that title , known places where these wantino I thouah I have even were * . n consequence of this dearth , outside supplies are hailed with delight , and , if possible , intercepted and bought up by fortunate first-comers . The feast that day was of tolerable pears and intolerable peaches ; yet we devoured them as though they had grown in Paradise , as some one remarked . " The truth is , " I replied , excited to enthusiasm by an almost ripe pear , and wishing also to divert any attention which might have fastened upon Letty , who stood by me in total silence , too heart-sick even to make a pretence of eating the fruit in her hand , " considering the temptation , I never could feel very hardly toward Eve for the choice she made . My only strong objection always has been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been for an Angoul*me pear , or a perfect peach , or even a great bunch of white grapes , I could not have found it in my heart to condemn her , " I went on , elaborating my poor little joke . The perfectly unaffected way in which Miss Hilton looked at me , as though seriously taking my remark into consideration and trying to deal it impartial justice , crushed me to silence for the next ten minutes , and made Alston smile in the midst of his sympathy for L*tty . Miss Hilton occasionally smiled gracefully , but I do not think she knew boxy to laugh . Yet I soon found that this  --  a most , reassuring lack of sense of humor - was a strong cause of her power and popularity . She never laughed at any one ; not so much from good manners and good sense , as because she saw nqthing at which to laugh . Men sensitive from diffidence or from vanity  --  and do not these two divisions include nearly all mankind-felt safe with her upon this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , her social success was largely founded upon her negative qualities . Vhen we had finished our fruit lunch , Rob proposed going up to the hotel parlor and playing cards until dinner time ; and he and Miss Hilton led the way thither . The party followed , but many of us dropped off at our respective cottages . Letty went quietly into her room and shut the door behind her . Not daring to follow her , I sat down upon the porch where Alston stood lighting his cigar . I was idly gazing after Rob and Miss Hilton , when Alston broke out , viciously scratching a match upon his boot heel , " I suppose it is consummate folly to expect people to be anything but what they are , to hope that they may not act in accordance with their natures ; but I do wish that fellow was a little less of a sheep " AIton , I am sure he does n't mean any harm " I exclaimed , eagerly . // OCTOBER , " Perhaps SO , " he answered drily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here is this dear little fool breaking her heart over him , " he went on , in an odd state of pity and impatience . " I told you he always would be at the mercy of the strongest influence near him , and now you see it for yourself . He was born a sheep ; and *vhenever the bellwether appears , it is the inevitable necessity of his nature to follow , no matter where it may lead . I suppose it is somewhat the case with everybody , that no one is free from the inherent sheephood of human nature , which acts like social cohesive attraction and enables fashion to lead us all by the nose , " he added , with a slight peculiarity of tone which showed me instantly that he had marked the way in which I had involuntarily given my adhesion Li Miss Hilton . Self-consciousness kept me quiet for a moment , and then made me change the exact point under discussion . " But I am sure he will come back as soon as this outside influence passes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so myself " Alston answered , " but while that Miss Hilton is here , he has no more free-will than a boat borne out to sea by the tide , or a feather tossed before the wind . " " But Alston , " I again protested , " I really do not believe that she means to do any harm to any one either . " " No , " he rejoined vehemently , as though it were the quintessence of his exasperation that he felt there was great cause of complaint , and yet could not in strict justice fasten it upon any one , " it is no fault of hers . I rather like that woman ; she is perfectly natural and straightforward , and is only dangerous from the constitution of the characters around her . She has that rarest of gifts-an ability to create a current and absorb her fellow-beings in to it . As far as I can see , that talent is quite apart from intellect , beauty , goodness , or even force of character , though it often goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which sucks all lighter craft into its wake ; and she will be a leader in her social circle long after she is an ugly , and apparently weak old woman . You can only call this power a gift , assigning no satisfactory reason for it . You see the same quality in men . When it is taken into military life , it makes generals who win the undying , unreasoning devotion of their soldiers in the midst of defeat and disgrace ; and if it be taken into political life , it produces great leaders , one of whom can hold in hand and drive together innumerable factions and shades of opinion , while he utilizes and manages the brilliant men about him like so many children . You gene rally hear such persons called dull and slow , but they seem to possess a power akin to a spiritual law of gravity . " And having summed up Miss Hilton and her class to his own satisfaction , he sat down and smoked , in a much calmer frame of mind and body . " XVhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him in surprise and amusement , " you must have spent all your leisure time upon the study of Miss Hilton , you must have given your entire mind to the subject since she came . " " Yes , " he laughed , " I have been reckoning her up like a sum . When I found she was taking away Bopeep 's sheep , I investigated her systematically . " " But I am sure Rob will return , " I exclaimed , harping upon the same string , and making excuses for him in my heart which I fear I would not have made for any one else in the same case . But , as I said before , Rob was Rob , and not to be judged by ordinary rules . " I think that depends very much upon Miss Letty herself . If she makes the least attempt to win him back at present , she will not only fail , but will weaken , if not lose , her influence over him forever . " // " Letty will never try to recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the honor of the sex . " I am much more afraid that she will instantly give up all hope and break her heart before he has time to return . " " Very likely , " he answered , " but in either case you can do nothing to help her , except to pet and comfort her as much as possible . For us to interfere , with the best intention , would be worse than useless ; for this fable teaches , to my thinking , that sheep will be sheep to the end of time . " The days of the ensuing week worked out Alston 's prediction . Rob seemed to belong to Miss Hilton , soul and body , and to follow her and perform her bidding like a tamed animal ; yet I felt sure that in his heart he loved Letty as well as ever . There were moments when he looked at her with such a gleam of the old bright tenderness , that her heart must have leaped with hope that he was about to throw off the singular fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , ah me , it was only that she had passed on to the second verse of the ballad , where Little Bopeep fell fast asleep And dreamt she heard them bleating ; When she awoke , she found it a joke , For still they all were fleeting . Through all this trying time , Letty behaved like the high-bred little lady that she was . The joyous spirits and radiant bloom were gone , for it was not in human nature to retain them ; but otherwise she gave small cause for comment , holding her quiet course with a steady courage and endurance which reminded me of certain stories I had heard of the gallantry and dogged pluck displayed in battle by that mild-mannered old soldier , her father . Neither father nor mother saw any alteration in Letty to alarm or even distress them ; and Marie was too thoroughly occupied with her own affairs to agitate herself about any misfortune to her relatives less startling than a sunstroke or a fit of apoplexy . Thus the girl escaped , at least , the added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So brave a face did she carry , that I believe Alston and myself were the only persons who understood her trouble , or imagined how terribly she was hurt ; and we , of course , were intentionally blind , where apparent perception could only further wound . Letty 's former admirers and attendants , whom Rob had displaced , now flocked . around her again , and entirely saved her from the appearance of being a deserted , love-loin maiden . She received them as politely as she could , and made an heroic effort to seem interested in them , and pleased by their kindness ; but the effort was so often a piteous failure , that the fragment of song was continually repeating itself in my mind , There is but one vith whom she has heart to be gay . It was strong proof of the genuineness of Letty 's attractions that some of he lovers thus far resisted the general current which was sweeping everything before it . For Miss Hilton certainly reigned triumphant over all of us , women quite as entirely as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius , of a true vocation , and not a woman of us all but vainly strove to imitate her . She always gave you the impression of being richly apparelled ; yet when you examined her clothes ) you found they were but as the clothes of other women , often simpler even in material . Yet I defy any one else to xvear them with the same effect . One day she would fill us with despair by some inspiration in the way of headdress , or 31 // some ineffably becoming arrangement of collar or necktie ; and when , in twentyfour hours , we had lamely followed suit , she-would pass on to some more brilliant improvisation in ribbons and laces , leaving us her cast-off custom , as we give beggars cast-off clothes . The more impressionable among us almost unconsciously caught her walk , her manner of sitting and speaking ; until we had a sensation of being surrounded by counterfeit Miss Hiltons . But that which demanded my respect and admiration was the genuineness of her equanimity under flattery in every form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was undoubtedly the true queen , born to the throne , and no pretender who had merely usurped it . She reminded me of the fairy story , in which-after a dozen impostors have slept comfortably upon a pile of feather beds  --  the true princess instantly discovers , and is bruised by the pea hidden beneath them . It is impossible not to respect any one who does any thing thoroughly well ; and upon this ground those who were otherwise indifferent to her rendered Miss Hilton homage . My party had been for some time past impatient to turn their faces homeward , and had only been detained by my care to remain where I was . I did not wish to depart while Letty 's fate hung in the balance . But one day Marie Palfrey announced to me that , as she intended to be married in the early winter and wished to begin her preparations thereto , she had proposed to her father and mother that they should all return home immediately . As I knew the entire family was as wax in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springs next morning , as she stated . The proposal renewed the impatience of my friends ; and as my only reason for dissenting was now removed , it was agreed that we should travel back to the city in company with the Palfreys . I did not see Letty until late that night , when I found her standing near her mother in the ball-room , looking white and quiet , but striving to seem interested in the conversation of the gentleman before her . Rob and Miss Hilton were waltzing together , with such perfection of grace that most of the other dancers were grouped about the room simply watching them . I went up to Letty , and standing by her , watched them also . The young man who had been talking to her presently vanished ; and we two had been silent for perhaps five minutes , when I stole a glance at the sad , absorbed , little face beside me . Then I forgot Alston 's injunction not to interfere , forgot the danger of doing harm , the fear of impertinence or want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb , piteous pain , in the sweet blue eyes , and I broke out into words , almost before I knew what I was doing . " Bopeep , Bopeep , let them alone , and they 'll come home ! ' I know it . I feel it ! " Half afraid and half ashamed to look at her and see the effect of my sentence , I caught a passing friend and went immediately out of the room . I was too nervous about what I had done to confess it even to Alston ; but the next day Letty , saying she was tired , sat down at my feet and putting her head in my lap , lay there in perfect quietude for a long while . Then I knew that she had understood both my meaning and my intention , and that she had accepted the help I meant to bring her just as it had been given . Rob knew that we intended to leave the Springs , but his free-will did not enable him to do more than bid us good-by with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , upon my word I would . But I have // 487 promised Miss Hilton to go with her to see the Natural Bridge , and so I must stay here another week , " he said , as he held Letty 's hand , and looked wistfully at her . " But I shall return about that time , and shall see you both immediately . " I knew Rob meant what he said with all his heart at that moment , and only hoped he might mean it with equal sincerity a week hence . Then he assisted us into the stage , and we rolled away . From the interminable length of the next week to me , I surmised what its duration must have been to Letty . We never talked of that which occupied all our thoughts , but the intense anxiety with which we were both looking forward toward Rob 's arrival was perfectly understood between us . The week had gone by , and soon ten days had passed since the time of our return home . My heart began to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have little room for further disappointment . At last , taking up a newspaper one morning , I saw his name among the arrivals at one of the hotels upon the previous day . In three minutes I had put on my bonnet , and was speeding on the wings of the wind toward Letty 's home . But arriving there , I was smitten with sudden doubt . If Rob were what I thought him , he would see Letty that day ; but if he were again found wanting , the knowledge that he was in the city would only increase her pain and disappointment . I concluded to let events develop themselves as they would , and to keep silence . Thus , when the girl came down into the parlor to meet me , I found I had nothing to say . I could only drivel off into a few commonplaces ; and these were scarcely coherent in my absorption in my withheld information . I sat down by the window , another Sister Anne in the watch-tower , and Letty took up some fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps an hour , we carried on a disjointed conversation in which neither quite understood what the other said . Suddenly I apparently lost my senses , and started up almost inarticulate with excitement aNd delight . " Bopeep , " I cried out , " your sheep has come home ! " For there upon the pavement stood Rob , bowing and beaming in just the old lovable , irresistible way ; and in a moment more he had mounted the steps and was ringing the bell . In far less time than it requires to tell it , I had retreated from that parlor and taken refuge in the dining-room . I never knew what took place after I left ; I never inquired . I only know that I walked about the room for the rest of the morning , too restless to remain quiet , and too deeply interested to leave the house at that critical moment ; and that Marie finding me there and looking her astonishment , I warded off her inquiries by mentioning a new pattern and promising to lend it to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a state of blushes , and smiles , and tears , that I did not require a word of explanation ; and , indeed , I did not receive one , until she managed to tell me that Rob had begged so hard that she would let their wedding take place at the same time with Marie 's , that she had said " yes . " I went home quite exhausted with emotion , and thus Alston found me that afternoon . " He has come back , Alston ; and everything is all right , " was my comprehensive announcement from the depths of an easy chair . " Of course , " he laughed . " I knew all about it as soon as I saw your blissful expression of countenance . " And being relieved from anxiety on Letty 's be-
