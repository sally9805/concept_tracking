txt About 7 o'clock last night , a construction train , coming up from Coscob Bridge on the down track , when about a mile and a quarter from that point , came into collision with a milk train from the Danbury and Norwalk road , which was running down to the bridge . The shock was so great as to wedge the two engines firmly together , to throw several cars of the train off the track , and to pile up three platform cars of the construction train one upon another . Two passenger cars in the latter train were smashed up some , and , of course , both engines were badly demolished . Conductor HURLBUT , of the New-York road , ran down to the wreck with two passenger cars , and took on board the persons injured , leaving some at Stamford and Norwalk , and arriving there with others about 10 o'clock . By this accident only one person was silica , so far as we have yet learned . This was a hatter from Bethel , named HURLBUT , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to Stamford , but died after reaching there , as the physicians think in consequence of the rupture of an artery in the head . He was riding on the milk train  --  or rather on the engine , it is said  --  having come down for a pleasure trip to see the burned bridge . Mr. Peasoss , a conductor on the Danbury and Norwalk train , was hurt quite badly , and was taken to Norwalk . Engineer LYMAN , of the N. Y. &; N. H. RR. , who was on the milk train piloting it down from Norwalk , was also injured in the legs , but not dangerously , it is thought . Mr. WILLIS MANFIELD , track superintendent at New-Haven , had his ankles badly sprained in jumping from the construction train . Mr. HEBRON T. DOUGLAS , car repairer , of this city , was also hurt considerably . Mr. DAILY , formerly switchman here , who was on the construction train , was injured in the legs . Joim DORLAY , of Stamford , a workman , had an arm dislocated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whose names we could not ascertain , and several others , more or less hurt , were brought to this city , or left at different pia-ryes on the route . Of the whole number of persona injured ; we have been unable to gain accurate information ; some passengers representing that there were nearly thirty , while others ( and much the larger number ) believe that there were from twelve to fifteen . The employes of the road were of course busily employed in caring for the sufferers , and in getting things righted , and were unable to state the exact number injured , or how many were left at different places . It seems , however , that all the persons hurt , except Mr. HURLBUT , of Bethel , were railroad employes . The cause of this accident , it is stated , was that orders given by Superintendent HOYT to delay the milk train were not regarded , or , some say , did not reach the person in charge of that train . The construction-train having run down to the bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Stamford , and the Superintendent therefore gave orders that the construction-train should have the right of way on that track to Stamford after 7 o'clock . The ' milk train , it would seem , was running contrary to that order , though on its regular time . Even then the accident probably might - have been avoided , had there not been a curve just at the point where the collision took place . It is stated that the Superintendent was on the construction-train himself ; but was not injured. , Offe man , name unknown , had a very narrow escape . He was caught under a truck and so buried in ruins , that it was fully half an . hour before he could be extricated , but he had no. bones broken , and was only considerably bruised and cut . Through the kindness of the telegraph operator at Stamford we learn that of those left at that place , except the one who since died , no one was seriously injured .               @ @ @ @ @ @
