txt CONVERSATIONAL OPINIONS OF THE LEADERS OF SECESSION . A MONOG1*APII. rfllE causes of the present Rebellion , the personal history of its leaders , and the incidents immediately preceding the breaking out of the conspiracy , will ever remain objects of chief interest to the historian of the present period of the Republic . Influenced by a desire to obtain unimpeachable information upon these topics from unprejudiced sources , the writer of the following article , then a student at Yale College , availed himself of the vacation in December , 1860 , and January , 1861 , to visit the National capital , and while there to improve the reason ably ready access with which most public men are approached , whenever the object is either to give or to receive information , for the purpose of studying a period then promising to exceed in importance anything in the past history of the nation . It has been suggested to the writer , that certain interviews , such as younger men , when collegians , were then allowed with the frank Southern leaders , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal of privacy removed by // the tide of events , and should now be described for the public , as aiding to unmask , from unquestionable authority , the real causes and origin of the Rebellion , and contributing something , perhaps , to sustain public sentiment in the defence of the nation against a conspiracy which the statements of these Southern apologists themselves prove to have been conceived in the roost reckless disregard of honor and law , and which , if successful , will give birth to a neighboring nation actuated by the same spirit . The more important interviews alluded to were with the Honorable Robert Toombs , the Honorable R. M. T. Hunter , and the Honorable Jefferson Davis , at that time prominent members , as is well known , of the United States Senate , from the States respectively of Georgia , Virginia , and Mississippi . The communications of the Senators are proved to have been sincere by their subsequent speeches and by public events . The writer is by no means insensible to the breach of privilege , of which , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be guilty , in detailing in print private conversations ; but he believes that the public will sustain the propriety of the present revelations , now that the persons chiefly concerned have become enemies of the nation and of mankind . Not , as he may possibly be accused , with the purpose of adding a syllable of unnecessary length to the narrative , but for the sake of vividness in presenting the idea of the personnel of the Southem leaders , soon to be known only as historical characters , and of scrupulous accuracy in representing their sentiments , to which , in this case , a notice of time , place , and manner seems as necessary as that of matter , the writer has taken not a little pains , through all the usual means , to remember , and will endeavor to state , the conversations , always with logical , and nearly always , he believes , with verbal accuracy , in order that the conclusions to ho drawn from them by the reader may have the better support . It is well known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are visited without formal introduction or letters , especially upon their reception-days , and that the privilege of a single interview implies no distinction to the visitor . The urbanity and frankness with which proper approaches are met , especially by the Southern leaders , are also well known . Young men , with unprejudiced minds , upon whom public characters are always anxious to impress the stamp of their own principles , are perhaps received with quite as much frankness as others . The first interview sought was with Mr. Toorobs , the most daring and ingenuous , and perhaps the most gifted in eloquence of the Southern leaders , whose house , at that time , was a lofty building upon F Street , only two doors from the residence of Mr. Seward . A negro servant , who , with all the blackness of a native African , yet with thin lips and almost the regular features of a Caucasian , appeared to the writer to be possibly the descendant of one of the superior , princely African tribes , showed the way to an unoccupied parlor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste : a magnificent pianoforte , several wellchosen paintings , and a marble bust of some public character standing upon a high pedestal of the same material in the corner , attracting particular attention , and a pleasant fire in the open grate making the December evening social . A step presently heard in the hall , elastic , buoyant , and vigorous , was alto , ether too characteristic of Mr. Toorobs 's portly , muscular , confident , and somewhat dashing figure , to be mistaken for any other than his own . Mr. Toombs appeared to be now about forty-five years of age , but carried in his whole mien the elastic vigor , and irresistible self- reliance , frankness , decision , and sociality of character , which mark his oratory and his public career . His good-evening , and inquiry concerning the college named on the card of the writer , were in a tone that at once placed his visitor at ease . // " Your first visit to Washington , Mr. - ? " " Yes , Sir . Like others , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of studying it from unprejudiced sources . " Crisis ? Oh , that s past . " The writer will not soon forget the tone of perfect confidence and nonchalance with which this was uttered . The time was the last week of December , 1860 . " You are confident , then , Sir , that fifteen States will secede ? " " Secede ? Certainly , - they must secede . You Northerners , - you are from a Northern college , I believe , " - referring to the writer 's card , - " you Northerners wish to make a new Constitution , or rather to give such an interpretation to the old one as to make it virtually a new document . How can society be kept together , if men will not keep their compacts ? Our fathers provided , in adopting their Constitution , for the protection of their property . But here are four billions of the property of the South which you propose to outlaw from the common Territories . You say to us , by your elected President , by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , in short , by every means through which one party can speak to another , that these four billions of property , representing the toil of the head and hand of the South for the last two hundred years , shall not be respected in the Territories as your property is respected there . And this property , too , is property which you tax and which you allow to be represented ; but yet you will not protect it . How can we remain ? We should be happy to remain , if you would treat us as equals ; but you tax us , and will not protect us . We will resist . D-n it , " - this and other striking expressions are precisely Mr. Toombs 's language , - " we will meet you on the border with the bayonet . Society can not be kept together , unless men will keep their compacts . " This was said without the intonation of fierceness or mali*nity , but with great decision and the vigor of high spirit . It was taking , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Constitutional question , familiar to all readers of American Congressional Debates , once supported by Mr. Calhoun , and r*sther strangely , too , with that philosophical leader , confusing the absurdly asserted State right of seceding at will with the undoubted right , when there exists no peaceful remedy , of seceding from iutolerable oppression : an entire position which Mr. Webster especially , and subsequent statesmen , in arguments elucidating the nature and powers of the General Government , to say nothing of the respect due to a moral sentiment concerning slavery , which , permeating more than a majority of the people , has the force , when properly expressed , wherever the Constitution has jurisdiction , of supreme law , are thought by most men , once and forever , to have satisfactorily answered . It was a complaint , certainly , which the South had had ever since the Constitution was formed , and which could with no plausibility be brought forward as a justification of war , while there existed a Constitutional tribunal for adjusting difficulties of Constitutional interpretation . Yet , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern partisan presses , and by Northern Congressmen , that the Rebellion was utterly causeless , and as the writer was therefore exceedingly anxious to obtain , concerning their grievances , the latest opinions of the Southern leaders , as stated by themselves , he ventured to propose , in a pause of Mr. Toombs 's somewhat rapid rhetoric , a question which , at that moment , seemed of central importance to the candid philosophical inquirer into the moving forces of the times : - " Are we , then , Sir , , to consider Mr. Calhoun 's old complaint - the non-reco* ,  - -  nition of slave-property under the Federal Constitution - as constituting now the chief grievance of the South ? " " Undoubtedly , " was Mr. Toombs 's instant reply , " it all turns on that . lVhat you tax you must protect . " This is the very strongest argument of // the Southern side . But the alleged slaveproperty is protected , though only under municipal law , by the Constitution . To protect it elsewhere is against its whole spirit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its very letter . Originally , as is well known , it was not proposed to protect at all , under the General Government , property so monstrous , except as it became necessary as a compromise , in order to secure a union . But the provision of the Constitution that the slave-trade should be abolished , the absolute power given to Congress to make all laws for the Territories , the spirit of the preamble , the principles of the Declaration , indeed , the whole history of the origin and adoption of the fundamental law , prove that its principle and its expectation were , if not absolutely to place slavery in the States in process of extinction , at least never to recognize it except indirectly and remotely under municipal law , not even by admitting the word slave to its phraseology . " Even in the Northern States themselves , to say nothing of the Territories , I am not safe with my property . I can travel through France or England and be safe ; but if I happen to lose my servant up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat marked accent of derision ,  --  " and undertake to recover him , I get jugged . Besides , your Northern statesmen are far from being honest . Here is Billy Seward , for instance , " - with a gesture toward his neighbor 's house , - " who says slavery is contrary to the 1-ligher Law , and that he is bound as a Christian to obey the higher Law ; but yet he takes an oath to uj hold the Constitution , which protects slavery . This inconsistency runs through most of the Northern platforms . flow can we live with such men ? They will not be true even to a compact which they themselves acknowledge . " " You would think , then , Wendell Phillips , for instance , more consistent in his political opinions than Mr. Seward ? " " Certainly . I can understand his position . Slavery , ' he says , is wrong . The Constitution protects slavery ; therefore I will have nothint* to do with the Constitution , and can not become a citizen . ' This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that . " Here Mr. Toombs - ejecting , as perhaps the writer ought not to relate , a competent mass of tobacco-saliva into the blazing coal - paused somewhat reflectively , perhaps unpleasantly revolving certain possible indirect influences of the position he had characterized . " Upon which side , Sir , do you think there is usually the most misunderstanding , - on the part of the North concerning the South ? or on the part of the South concerning the North ? " " Oh , by all odds , " he replied , instantly , " we understand you best . We send fifty thousand travellers , more or less , North every summer to your watering places . Hot down in Mobile , " - his style taking somewhat unpleasantly the intonation as well as the negligence of the bar-room , - " ca n't live in Mobile in the summer . Then your papers circulate more among us than ours among you . Our daughters are educated at INorthem boarding-schools , our sons at Northern colleges : both my colleague and myself were educated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have a better opportunity for understanding you than you have for understanding us . " " In case of general secession and war , " the writer ventured next to inquire , " would there probably , in your opinion , be danger of a slave insurrection ? " " None at all . Certainly far less than of ' Bread or Blood ' riots at the North . " The writer was surprised to find , notwithstanding Mr. Toombs 's eulogy of Southern opportunities , his understanding of the North so imperfect , and still more surprised at the political and social principles involved in the spirit of what followed . " Your poor population can bold wardmeetings , and can vote . But we know better how to take care of ours . They are in the fields , and under the eye of their // overseers . There can be little danger of an insurrection under our system . " The subject and the manner of the man , in spite of his better qualities , were becoming painful , and the writer ventured only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if war comes between North and South . " " Ugly time ? Oh , no I " The writer will never forget the tone of utter carelessness and nonchalance with which the last round-toned exclamation was uttered . " Oh , no ! War is nothing . Never more than a tenth part of the adult population of a country in the field . We have four million voters . Say a tenth of them , or four hundred thousand men , are in the field on both sides . A tenth of them would be killed or die of camp diseases . But they would die , any way . War is nothing . " The tone perfectly proved this belief , not badinage . " Some property would be destroyed , towns injured , fences overturned , and the Devil raised generally ; hut then all that would have a good effect . Only yallercovered-literature men and editors make a noise about war . Wars are to history what storms are to the atmosphere ,  --  purifiers . We shall meet , as we ought , whoever invades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen of this land , and gentlemen always make revolutions in history . " This was said in the tone of an injured , but haughty man , with perfect intellectual poise and earnestness , yet with a fervor of feeling that brought the speaker erect in his chair . The signiicance of the last remarks , which the writer can make oath he has preserved verbatim , being somewhat calculated to draw on a debate , of course wholly unfitted to the time and place , the writer , apologizing for having taken so much time at a formal interview , and receiving , of course , a most courteous invitation to renew the call , found himself , after but twenty minutes ' conversation , on the street , in the lonely Decem her evening , with a mind full of reflections . The utter recklessness concerning life and property with which the splendid intellect , under the lead of the ungovernable passions of this man , was plunging the nation into a civil war of which no one could foresee the end , was the thought uppermost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be infringed it was in itself impossible not to respect . But the man seemed to love war for its own sake , as pugnacious schoolboys love sham-fights , with a sort of glee in the smell of the smoke of battle . The judicial calmness of statesmanship had entirely disappeared in the violence of sectional passion . Perhaps he might be capable of ruining his country from pure love of turbulence and power , could he but find a pretext of force sufficient to blind first himself and then others . Yet Robert Toombs , in the Senate Chamber , takes little children in his arms , and is one of the kindest of the noblemen of Nature in the sphere of his unpolitical sympathies . The reader who is familiar with Mr. Toombs 's speeches will need no assurance that he spoke frankly. * * Ten days later , in the Senate , with a face full of the combined erubescence of revolutionary enthusiasm and unstatesmanlike anger , Mr. Toomhs closed a speech to the Northern Senators in the following amazing words , ( Congressional Globe , 1860-61 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , every syllable of the report of the conversation upon the same points : - " You will not regard confederate obligations ; you will not regard constitutional obligations ; you will not regard your oaths . What am I to do * Am I a freeman ? Is my State , a free State , to lie down and submit because political fossils raise the cry of The Glorious Union ' ? Too long already have we listened to this delusive song . We are freemen . We have rights : I have stated the , n . We have wrongs : I have recounted them . I have demonstrated that the party now coming into power has declared us outlaws , and is determined to exclude four thousand millions of our property from the common territories , - that it has declared us under the ban of the empire and out of the protection of the laws of the United States , everywhere . // Sick at heart , as the future of the nation stood to his dim vision through the present , the writer found his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , apparently apathetic , unbelieving , almost criminally allowed to he undeceived by its presses and hy public men who had means of information , while this volcano continued to prepare itself thus defiant- They have refused to protect us from invasion and insurrection by the Federal power , and the Constitution denies to us in the Union the right either to raise fleets or armies for our own defence . All these charges I have proven by the record , and I put them before the civilized world , aud demand the judgment of today , of to-morrow , of distant ages , and of Heaven itself ; upon these causes . I am conteut , whatever it be , to peril all in so noble , so holy a cause . We have appealed time and time again for these constitutional rights . You have refused them . We appeal again . Restore us these rights as we had them , as your court adjudges them to be , just as all our people have said they are , redress these flagrant wrongs , seen of all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of us . Refuse them , and what then ? We shall then ask you to let us depart in peace . ' Refuse that , and you present us war . We accept it ; and inscribing upon our banners the glorious words , Liberty and Equality , ' we will trust to the blood of the brave and the God of battles for security and tranquillity . " Sincere , but undoubtedly mistaken , Mr. Toombs ! To this philippic , let the words of another Southern , but not sectional Senator , reply , and that from a golden age : - " Bnt if , unhappily , we should be involved in war , in civil war , between the two parts of this Confederacy , in which the effort upon the one side should be to restrain the introdnction of slavery into the new territories , and upon the other side to force its introduction there , what a spectacle should we present to the astonishment of mankind , in an effort , not to propagate right , but - I must say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with no design to excite feeling - a war to propagate wrong in the territories thus acquired from Mexico . It would be a war in which we should have no sympathies , no good wishes , in which all mankind would be against us ; for , from the commencement of the Revolution down to the present time , we have constantly reproached our British ancestors for the introduction of slavery into this country . " - hENRY CLAY , Congressional Globe , Part II. , Vol. 22 , p. 117. ly beneath the very feet of a President sworn to support the laws ! The formal interview with the Honorable R. M. T. Hunter was sought in company with two other students of NewEngland colleges . We had hoped to meet Mr. Mason at the same apartments , but were disappointed . The gre at contrast of personal character between Mr. hunter and Mr. Toomhs made the concurrence of the former in the chief views presented by the latter the more significant . The careful habits of thought , the unostentatiousness , and the practical common sense for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his name a prominent one for President of a Central Confederacy , in case of the separate secession of the Border States , were curiously manifested both in his apartments and his manner . The chamber was apparently at a boarding-house , but very plainly furnished with red cotton serge curtains and common hair-cloth chairs and sofa . The Senator 's manner of speech was slow , considerate ,  --  indeed , sometimes approaching awkwardness in its plain , farmer-like simplicity . One of the first questions was the central one , concerning the chief grievance of the South , which had been presented to Mr. Toombs . " Yes , " was Mr. Hunter 's reply , somewhat less promptly given , " it may be said to come chiefly from that , - the nonreco* nition of our property under the Constitution . We wish our property recoguized , as we think the Constitution provides . We should like to remain with the North . " lie spoke without a particle of expressed passion or ardor , though by no means incapable , when aroused , as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of both . " We are mutually helpful to each other . We want to use your navy and your factories . You want our cotton . The North to manufacture , and the South to produce , would make the strongest nation . But , if we separate , we shall tr*v to do // more in Virginia than we do now . We shall make mills on our streams . " His langua0e was chiefly Saxon monosyllables . " The climate is not as severe , the nights are not as long with us as with you . I think we can do well at manufacturing in Virginia . The Chesapeake Bay and our rivers should aid commerce . As for the slaves , I think there is little danger of any trouble . There may be some , " he said , with a frankness that surprised us slightly , but in the same moderate , honest way , his hands clasped upon his breast , and the extended feet rubbing together slowly , " in the Cotton States , where they are very thick together ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . The way they take to rise in never shows much skill . The last time they rose in our State , I think the attempt was brought on by some sign in an eclipse of the moon . " Nearly all that passed of political interest is contaiued in the foregoing sentences , except one honest reply to a question concerning his opinion of the probability of the North 's attempting coercion . " If only three States go out , they may coerce , " said Mr. Hunter ; " but if fifteen go , I guess they wo n't try . " At the present period of the Rebellion , this indication of the anticipations of its leaders in engaging in it must be of interest . It must be understood that the writer and his companions presented themselves simply as students , with no fixed exclusive predilections for either of the public parties in politics , - which , in the writer 's case at least , was certainly a statement wholly true , - and that this evident freedom from political bias secured perhaps an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be remembered , also , that in every conversation , however startling the revelation of criminal purpose or absurd motive , the manner of these Senators was always totally devoid of any approach to that vulgar intellectual levity which too often , in treating of public affairs , painfully characterizes the fifth-rate men whom the North sometimes chooses to make its representatives . The manner of the Southern leaders was to us a sufficient proof of their sincerity . At the house of the Honorable Jefferson Davis , now in the world 's gaze President of the then nascent Confederacy , the writer , in the intelligent and genial company of the graduate of Harvard and the student of Amherst before mentioned , called formally , on the evening of the New Year 's reception-day . A representative from one of the Southwestern States was present , but we were soon admitted to the front of the open blazing grate of the reception-parlor . We had before seen Mr. Davis busy in the Senate . The urbanity , the intellectual energy , and the intensely shrewd watchfulness and ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct for strategy and command , which have made Mr. Davis a public leader , were evident at the first glance . The Senator seemed compact of ambition , will , intellect , activity , and shrewdness . A high and broad , but square forehead ; the aquiline nose ; the square , fighting chin ; the thin , compressed , but flexible lips ; the almost haggardly sunken cheek ; the piercing , not wholly uncovered eye ; the dark , somewhat thinning hair ; the clear , slightly browned , nervous complexion , all well given in the best current photographs , were united to a figure slightly bent in the shoulders , of more respiratory than digestive breadth , in outlines almost equally balancing ru*gedness and grace , of compactness wrought by the pressure of perhaps few more than fifty summers , not above medium height , but composed throughout of silk and steel . A certain similarity between the decorations of the parlor and the character of the owner , perhaps more fanciful than real , at once attracted attention . Everything was simple , graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings appeared to be often of airy , winged , or white-robed // figures , that suggested a reflective and not unimaginative mind in the one who had chosen them . This was the leader whom Mr. Calhoun 's fervent political metaphysics and his own ambition for place and power had misled . His conversation was remarkable in manner for perfect Unostentatiousness , clearness , and self-control , and in matter for breadth and minuteness of political information . In the whole conversation , he never uttered a broken or awkwardly constructed sentence , nor wavered , while stating facts , by a single intonation . This considerable intellectual energy , combined with courtesy , was his chief fascination . Yet , underneath all lay an atmosphere of covert haughtiness , and , at times , even of audacious remorselessness , which , under stim. ulative circumstances , were to be feared . Undoubtedly , passion and ambition were natively stronger in the countenance than reason , conscience , and general sympathy , - an observation best felt to be true when the face was compared in imagination with the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , native urbanity , and a powerful reflective tendency had evidently so wrought , that , though conscience might be imperilled frequently by great adroitness in the casuistry of selfexcuse , justice could not be consciously opposed for any length of time without powerful silent reaction . The quantity of being , however , though superior , was not of so high a measure as the quality , and the principal deficiencies , though perhaps almost the sole ones , were plainly moral . In his presence , no man could deny to him something of that dignity , of a kind superior to that of intellect and will , which must be possessed by every leader as a basis of confidence . But mournful severe truth would testify that there was yet , at times , palpably something of the treacherous serpent in the eye , and it could not readily be told where it would strike . In reply to a reference to a somewhat celebrated speech by Senator Benjamin of Louisiana , which we had heard the day previous , he said that we might consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arguments and the purposes of the South . Perhaps a speech of more horrible doctrine , upheld by equal argumentative and rhetorical power , has never been heard in the American Senate . In reply , also , to the one central question concerning the chief grievance of the South , he gave in substance the same answer , uttered perhaps with more logical calmness , that had been given by Mr. Hunter and Mr. Toombs , that it was substantially covered by Mr. Calhoun 's old complaint , the non-recognition of slaveproperty under the Federal Constitution . Of course we were as yet too well established in the belief that slavery in the United States is upheld by the Constitution only very remotely and indirectly , under local or municipal law , to desire , even by questions , to draw on any ( lebate . In reply to a question by the gentleman from Harvard , he spoke of a Central Confederacy as altogether iinprobabie , and thought , if Georgia seceded , as the telegrams for the last fortnight had indicated she would , Maryland would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political interests of Maryland , " he remarked , in his calm and simple , but distinct and watchful manner , manifesting , too , at the same time , a natural command of dignified , antithetical sentences , " would be promoted , perhaps can be only preserved , by secession . Her territory extends on both sides of a great inland water communication , and is at the natural Atlantic outlet , by railway , of the Valley of the West . Baltimore in the Union is sure to be inferior to Philadelphia and New York : Baltimore out of the Union is sure to become a great commercial city . In every way , whether we regard her own people or their usefulness to other States , I think the interests of Maryland would be promoted by secession . " " But would not Maryland lose many more slaves , as the border member of a foreign confederacy , than she does now in the Union ? " The reply to this question we looked for with the greatest interest , since no // foreign nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the attempted Confederacy , ever thinks of giving up fugitives , and since the policy of the South upon this point , in case she should succeed , would determine the possibility or impossibility of peace between the two portions of the Continent . Mr. Davis 's reply was in the following words , uttered in a tone of equal shrewdness , calmness , and decision - " I think , for all Maryland would lose in that way she would be more than repaid by reprisals . While we are one nation and you steal our property , we have little redress but when we become two nations , we shall say , Two can play at this game. ** We breatbed more freely after so frank an utterance . The great importance of this reply , coming from the even then proposed political chief of the Confederacy , as indicating the impossibility of peace , even in case of the recognition of the South , so long as it should continue , as it has begun , to snake Slavery the chief corner-stone of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the writer ventured to inquire , " what will become of the Federal District , since its inhabitants have no State right of secession ' ? " " Have you ever studied law ? " he asked . The gentleman from Amherst confessed our ignorance of any point covering the case . " There is a rule in law , " continued Mr. Davis , " that , when property is granted by one party to another for use for any specified purpose , and ceases to be used for that purpose , it reverts by law to the donor . Now the territory constituting at present the District of Columbia was granted , as you well know , by Maryland to the United States for use as the seat of the Federal capital . When it ceases to be used for that purpose , it , with all its public fixtures , will revert by law to Maryland . But , " and his eye brightened to the hue of cold steel in a way the writer will never forget , as he uttered , in a tc*e perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that is a point which may be settled by force rather than by reason . " This was January 1,1861 , only eleven days after South Carolina had passed her Act of Secession , and shows that even then , notwithstanding the professed desire of the South to depart in peace , the attack not only upon the national principles of union , but upon the national property as well , was projected . Mr. Davis , loaded with the benefits of his country , yet occupied a seat in the Senate Chamber , under the most solemn oath to uphold its Constitution , which , even if his grievances had been well founded , afforded Constitutional and peaceful remedies that he had never attempted to use . Presenting regards , very formal indeed , sick at heart , indignant , and anxious , we left the house of the traitor . The historical conclusions to be drawn from the above slight sketches are important in several respects . Mr. Davis , Mr. Toombs , and Mr. Hunter are among the strongest leaders of the Rebellion . Representing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , their testimony bad a wide application , and was perhaps as characteristic and pointed in these brief conversations , occurring just upon the eve of the burstin* of the storm , as we should have heard in a hundred interviews . That they spoke frankly was not only evidenced to us by their entire manner , but , as it is not unimportant to repeat , has been proved by subsequent events . The conversations , therefore , indicate , - 1 . That the grand , fundamental , legal ground for the Rebellion was a view of Constitutional rights by which property in human beings claimed equal protection under the General Government with the products of Free Labor , and to be admitted , therefore , at will , to all places under the jurisdiction of the Federal power , and not simply to be protected under local or municipal law , - rights which the South proposed to vindicate , constitutionally , by // Secession , or , in other words , by the domination of State over National sovereignty : an entire view of the tine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great debates between Mr. Webster and Mr. Calhoun , to say nothing of elucidations by previous and subsequent jurists and statesmen , has been again and again abundantly demonstrated to be absurd . 2 . That the immediate , comprehensive pretext for the Rebellion was the success of a legal majority having in its platform of principles the doctrine of the non-extension of involuntary human bondage in the territories over which the Constitution had given to the whole people absolute control , a doctrine which the mass of the Southern populations were educated to believe not only deadly to their local privileges , but distinctly unconstitutional . 3 . That the leaders of the Rebellion frankly admitted , that , excepting this one point of Constitutional grievance , the interests of the populations which they represented would be better subserved in the Union than Out of it . 4 . That the leaders of the Rebellion appear not to have anticipated coercion ; but yet , from the earliest days of Secession , contemplated the spoliation of the Southern National property , and particularly the seizure of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South be acknowledged , peace could not result so long as Slavery should continue : their avowed system of reprisals for the certain escape of slaves precluding all force in any but piratical international law . 6 . That the spirit of the Rebellion is the haughty , grasping , and , except within its own circle , the remorseless spirit universally characteristic of oli*archies , before the success of whose principles upon this continent the liberties of the whites could be no safer than those of the blacks . " We are the entlemen of this land , " said the Georgian senator , " and gentlemen always make revolutions in history . " And just previously he had said , with haughty significance , " Your poor population can hold ward-meetings , and can vote . But we know better how to take care of ours . They are in the fields , and under the eye of their overseers . " In these two brief remarks , taken singly , or , especially , in juxtaposition , from so representative a source , and so characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning of these times , indeed of all times , and which a people regardful of civil and religious liberty can never be slow to heed . Let the pride of race and the aristocratic tendencies which underlie the resistance of the South prevail , and we shall see a new America . The land of the fathers and of the present will become strange to us . In place of a thriving population , each member socially independent , self-respecting , contented , and industrious , contributing , therefore , to the general welfare , and preserving to posterity and to mankind a national future of inconceivable power and grandeur , we shall see a class of unemployed rich and unemployed poor , the former a handful , the latter a host , in perpetual feud . The asylum of nations , ungratefully rejecting the principles of equality , to which it has owed a career of prosperity unexampled in history , will find in arrested commerce , depressed credit , checked manufactures , an effeminate and selfish , however brilliant , governing class , and an impoverished and imbruted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of advance . The condition of the most unfortunate aristocracies of the Old World will become ours . But the venerated principles partially promulgated in our golden age forbid such unhappy auspices . Undoubtedly gentlemen make revolutions in history ; but since nIl may be Christians , may not all men be gentlemen ? At least , have not all men , everywhere , the sacred and comprehensive right of equal freedom of endeavor to occupy their highest capacities ? Does not the C*reator , who makes nothing in vain , // wherever He implants a power , imply a commend to exercise that power according to the highest aspiration , and is not responsibility eternally exacted , wherever power and command coexist * By that fearful sanction , may not all men , everywhere , become the best they can become ? What that may be , is not free , equal , and perpetual experiment , judged by conscience in the individual and by philanthropy in his brother , and not by arrogance or cupidity in his oppressor , to decide ? To secure the wisdom and perpetuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a monopoly of opportunity by any single class , by all historical and theoreti cal proof , not only unjust to the excluded , but crippling and suicidal to the State ? Nay , is not the slightest infringement of regulated social and political justice , liberty , and humanity , in the person of black or of white , that makes the greatest potential development of the highest in human nature impossible or difficult , to be resisted , as a violation of the peace of the soul , endless treachery to mankind , an affront to Heaven ? Would not the very soil of America , in which Liberty is said to inhere , cry out and rise against any but an affirmative answer to such questions ? A near future will decide .
