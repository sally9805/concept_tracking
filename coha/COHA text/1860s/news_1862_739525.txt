txt A gentleman from Williamsport this morning , says no troops had passed into Virginia up is Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock . Neither had any of the different divisions received any orders for a forward movement . The impression seemed to prevail among the soldiers that when they did move , they would proceed into Western Virginia , crossing at port . The enemy , he says , will undoubtedly dispute the crawling here , and when Gen. MeCeituari orders a forward movement , a battle will , no doubt , take place at that point . This gentleman dined at a house in Hagerstown where Gen. In and Staff had made their headquarters . The lady of the house says she heard Len instruct his officers to see that no depredations were committed by the soldiers while in Maryland , but when they entered Pennsylvania , they might pillage and destroy everything on their route .
