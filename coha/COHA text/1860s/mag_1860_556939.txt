ART . III . - The History of North Carolina : with Maps and illustrations . By FRANCIS L. HAWKS , D. D. , LL . D. Vols . I. , II . Fayetteville : E. J. Hale and Son . 1857- 58. 8vo. pp. 254 , 591 . WE are glad that the task of writing the history of North Carolina has been undertaken by one whose devotion to his native State will prompt him to consecrate his best energies to the illustration of her annals . We have now some assurance that this much desired work will be completed , and in a style befitting the manly deeds of those whose achievements are to be recorded , and the calm and constant prosperity of that steadfast commonwealth . The task is undertaken by IDr . Hawks with many and great advantages over his predecessors , and the work is commended to the public by the high prestige of his widely extended reputation . He has been , for many years , well known , both at home and abroad , as one of the ablest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications have made him familiar with the mysteries of authorship ; and he is understood to have been long engaged in gathering the materials for this favorite work . Of the value of these , and of the skill with which he uses them , the two volumes before us will enable us to judge . Of the memorials of past events which are necessary for the clear understanding of the history of North Carolina , it is very evident that IDr . Hawks has succeeded in obtaining large numbers , and those of inestimable worth , which were beyond the reach , or escaped the research , of the previous historians of that State . Many of them we owe to his examination of the repositories of public records in England , and many al*so have been brought out from their hiding-places in old chests and clerks ' offices , at the bidding of one who , it was believed , would keep them safe and use them to an excellent purpose . We speak of safe-keeping advisedly , as it is well known , and deeply regretted , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former historians of North Carolina relied for their representations are now lost beyond the hope of recovery . They have been taken away from the State , and no // knowledge of them now remains . The historical inquirer is therefore compelled to depend simply on the declaration of some who have gone before him , ( and this in matters involving the good name of large bodies of men , ) and can not test their accuracy by an appeal to the testimony on which they rested . If in any quarter he finds statements conflicting with theirs , it becomes no easy matter to decide how much credit is to be given to those who quote no authority , or an authority which they themselves have caused or allowed to disappear . Within a few years , however , a new sense of the value of such treasures , and a new interest in the disclosures to which they lead , seem to have been awakened in that region . The result has been the bringing to light and use of a vast number of important documents whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost of course , must follow , that many transactions about which men had made up their minds are to be re-examined , and a new verdict rendered . The same may be true again . The discovery of new testimony hereafter may enforce a revision of our judgments also . Tryon , Martin , and Howard may lose some portion of the opprobrium that now rests on their names , as we see Mr. Froude has cleared away the reproach from Henry VIII . But certainly , in regard to the richness and value of his materials , Dr. Hawks has vastly the advantage of his predecessors , while in historical judgment , and in skill as a writer , he has no very formidable competitors among them . Indeed , it is a cause of wonder that the people of North Carolina have been so long content with a meagre outline , and an unskilfully written compilation . The earliest permanent settlements in North Carolina were made about the time when the first charter was granted to the Proprietors by Charles II. , in 1Q63 . The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and published in 1709 . Lawson came to this State , from England , through Charleston , in 1700 . Leaving that city near the close of that year , he started on an overland expedition , by a route* which it is now difficult to trace , though his narrative of it is very curious , and came finally to Bath , on the Pamlico River , where he established his head-quarters . In 1711 he was the Surveyor-General of North Carolina . This office demanded 4* // skill , energy , integrity , and some measure of learning ; and as it conferred a rather high social rank , and brought him into frequent association with the leading men of the Province , it implied a general confidence in him , and authorizes us to suppose him in every way a man of worth and a gentleman . Of the events of his personal history little is known except the tragical circumstances of his death . The Indians who dwelt on the borders of the white settlements , especially the Tuscaroras , feared and hated him ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of their lands . Speedily after Lawson had traversed the country with his surveyingchain , portions of these lands , one after another , passed under the claim and into the possession of their grasping neighbors* Well aware , no doubt , of the danger into which he was entering , though not aware of the conspiracy the savages had already formed to exterminate at one blow all their enemies , Lawson , in company with the Baron de Graffenried and a single servant , started from Newbern to ascertain how far the Neuse IRiver was navigable , and discover what kind of country there was farther on . They were seized by the Indians , brought before a numerous council of chiefs , and sentenced to death . This sentence was executed on Lawson with every refinement of savage cruelty . " They stuck him full ( so the Indians said ) of fine , small splinters of torch-wood , like hog 's bristles , and so set them gradually on fire . " This was on the 22d of Sept6mber . On the same day , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one universal act of horrid massacre , of which Lawson 's murder was the first scene , and a specimen only of its hideous cruelties . In every settlement , at almost every house , the slaughter was begun , and that by Indians who had become inmates or welcome guests in the households , where they entered with smiles for purposes of death . In two hours ' time one hundred and thirty were slain . For three days the slaughter raged , passed the Chowan , and rayaged the whole district north of the Albemarle . The planter was shot down in the field , the traveller was waylaid in the forest , and the blood of old men and maidens dyed their own hearthstone . In the alarm it excited , the manly resistance and punishment it called out , and // its final result in breaking down the power of the Indians , this was the most memorable event in the first half-century of civilized life in North Carolina . As no one had a more extensive and accurate knowledge of the country than Lawson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he wrote . It contains the results of the observations made during his travels and surveys in North Carolina , in which little that was noteworthy seems to have escaped him ; and , with no large amount of information touching the character of individuals , or the policy of parties , or the frame and operation of the government , he has left us a picture of the resources , natural features , and social habits of the Province , which , while highly interesting in itself , is rendered the more so to us by the lapse of a hundred and fifty years . His sketches of the natural history of the country form the largest portion of the work , and he seems to have been well fitted for this labor by scientific attainments , as well as by the habit of careful observation . His account of the Indian tribes , which is remarkably full and minute , is of complete authority , and now , when most of them have disappeared from the country , it has a peculiar and melancholy value . This work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know , after much inquiry , of the existence of only four copies in this country . About 1820 a copy , then thought to be unique , was offered for sale at auction in North Carolina , and after a very spirited competition of public institutions , as well as private persons , who were anxious to possess so rare a work , it is said to have been knocked down - a very small , thin quarto - for nearly sixty dollars . The next in the series of sketches of North Carolina is entitled , " The Natural History of North Carolina : with an Account of the Trade , Manners , and Customs of the Christian and Indian Inhabitants , &amp;c . " It was written by John Brickell , M.D. , and was pub*1ished in Dublin in 1737 . He seems to have resided in Carolina several years in the practice of his profession , under the patronage , it is supposed , of Governor Burrington , and perhaps sent out by the company of the Lords Proprietors . The resemblances between his and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brickell is supposed to have been largely indebted to his predecessor , and indeed to have trusted to Lawson 's report as much as to his own observation . It is understood to have been written for the especial purpose of inducing emigrants to select their homes in that Province , and many of the statements in it , and the coloring of the whole , are thought to have had their origin in his earnest desire to gratify the wish of those who owned the country to sell their lands . There prevails , therefore , a very general distrust of his authority , and a well-grounded doubt of his claims to originality . In these respects his book is of very little worth , and certainly has no peculiar excellence of style to compensate for so great deficiencies . Three quarters of a century had passed , the feeble Province had for many years been a State , and the actors in the Revolution which wrought this change had mainly passed away , before another attempt was made to write the history of North Carolina . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soil . Hugh Williamson was a native of Pennsylvania , and was , in his day , a man of much celebrity for his scientific attainments and philosophical researches , as well as for the part he took in the events of the Revolution . He was one of the committee of the American Philosophical Society who were selected to observe the transit of Venus and Mercury over the sun 's disc , in 1T67 ; and many of his papers are published in the Transactions of that Society . Some commercial business brought him to Edenton , N. C. , where he resided for many years , and was engaged in the practice of medicine . He mingled much also in political affairs , was a member of the convention that formed the Constitution of the United States , and served for more than one term in the House of Representatives . The later years of his life were passed in the city of New York , in the quiet pursuit of literary and philosophical studies . Here he published , in 1812 , his History of North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only work on the subject , and even now perhaps is as extensively known as any other ; yet it has never been satisfactory to the historical student , nor adequate to the wants of the people of the State , nor in any way very creditable to them . // 1860. hAWKS ' s HISTORY OF NORTH CAROLINA . It is brought substantially to a close with a scanty narrative of " the Regulators ' war , " and of the fight at Alamance in 17T1 ; and does not pretend to give a sketch even of the causes and events which introduced the Revolution . Of the period actually included in the work the details are meagre , and often very imperfect . However extensive and careful the author 's researches may have been , they do not seem to have provided him very amply with materials , nor were the materials which he possessed used with any uncommon skill . The work is written in a neat , easy , agreeable style ; yet is in no way a History that the people of North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are familiar with the name of Fran*ois Xavier Martin . His was a siu.gular career . A native of Marseilles , a bankrupt merchant in Martinique , a friendless stranger in Newbern , he rose to vast wealth , the highest professional distinction , and a national reputation , by his own patient energy of will . When he came to Newbern , he gained a livelihood by teaching French , and by translating , printing , and selling French novels . In addition to these pursuits , he occasionally printed a newspaper , packed the copies in his saddle-bags , and peddled them through the adjoining counties . He became a very voluminous writer , and was subsequently the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice of Louisiana . During his residence in North Carolina , he made the necessary preparations for a History of that State , in two octavo volumes , though it 4as not given to the public till after his removal . It was published in 1829 . It is plain to every reader of these volumes , that Judge Martin had no ambition to be what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth events in their relation of cause and effect , nor even to state them in such a way that this relation shall become obvious to the reader . On the contrary , his History is thrown mainly into the form of annals . The succession of paragraphs seems to be determined by nothing else than by the juxtaposition of their contents in the order of time . So far does he carry this principle of mere chronological connection , that he inserts events which occurred in distant quarters of the globe , and had no relation other than of time , to events which took place in North Carolina . In reading this History , // one can not suspect that the author was ever tempted to misstate a fact for the sake of an antithesis , or to sacrifice the truth of history for point and elegance of style . The utmost he seems to have aimed at - if indeed his real aim was not simply to make a book , to sell - was clearness and precision ; and though he sometimes rises to a rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously , and he falls back , with no appearance of remorse , to the bald ' disjointedness of his ordinary expression . Yet , with these defects , the work has certainly great merits also . There is a large accumulation of important facts . The statement of them is made with much perspicuity . Though doubtless , . in many particulars , imperfect and inaccurate , still'we know him to have been a careful compiler . Whenever documents , now accessible , are quoted or abridged , we find that this is done with a painstaking regard to truth . The structure of the work betrays marty marks of haste , and of a deficient sense of fitness and proportion , but there are no indications of carelessness in ascertaining and truly expressing the meaning of his authorities . The narrative comes down no later than the Declaration of Independence . The volume by Joseph Seawell Jones , " Defence of North Carolina , " ( Raleigh , 1834 , ) though written in a very sprightly and vigorous style , and entirely trustworthy , except where the prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history . It was written to vindicate the State of North Carolina , and especially the character of William looper , " from the aspersions of Mr. Jefferson . " It answers this purpose admirably , and is a work of much interest and value for the period it covers , from 1774 to 1776 . Thus far we find that no one attempted the history of the State , nor of the Revolutionary war , except in its earliest periods . Monographs , which can not be too highly prized , have indeed been written , on different aspects or portions of this latter period , by Dr. Hawks , Governor Swain , and Governor Graham ; - all , men eminently qualified to do justice to such themes , and than whom none are more familiar with the history of the State which has reared and honored them . The memoir of General Davie , by Professor Hubbard , that of David // 1860 . HAWKS 'S HISTORY OF NORTH CAROLINA . Caidwell , by Dr. Caruthers , and " The Old North State " of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church in North Carolina , by William Henry Foote , and the memoir of Judge Iredell , by G. J. McRee , all throw some light on the events of the Revolutionary times , and are important aids to the historical inquirer ; yet their value in this respect , however great , is only incidental to their main purpose . The " Historical Sketches of North Carolina , from 1584 to 1851 , " by John H. Wheeler , published in two octavo volumes , in 1851 , is a more comprehensive work , and , as its title shows , covers the whole ground . Yet we can not but think it very inadequate and unsatisfactory . The whole of the proper history of the Colony , Province , and State is very meagrely told , in one volume of one hundred and forty pages . The second volume , of nearly five hundred pages , is occupied with a series of County Histories , and these are chiefly filled with biographical sketches of the more prominent men in each county . The form of the second volume is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Mr. Wheeler has certainly rescued from oblivion a great number of events , which but for his researches might have been lost , and of persons , of whom this will be the only memorial . Some of these biographies are ably written , and the State may well be grateful for them , as also for the narratives of many encounters between the Whigs and Tories , which he has procured from the actors , or culled from the newspapers of the day , and which , though they may make a slight figure in a general history , are matters which will long stir the blood of those who live in their immediate precinct . There is also in this volume a very large amount of statistical information . It has been compiled , evidently , with great labor ; and we can only regret that a like labor was not bestowed upon the collation of its several parts , and the correction of the press . We find contradictory statements of the same subject in different portions of the volume , and the work is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can hardly anywhere be relied on . No one would be safe in referring to it as a sole authority . The style of this work , though generally plain and explicit , need not discourage competitors on the same field . // This brief review of the historical literature of North Carolina will show that Dr. Hawks has no very formidable rivalry to encounter . There is another fact , of which he will understand the import , that , of all the works we have named , no one has ever appeared in a second edition . This fact we are disposed to impute not so much to an indifference of the people to their history , as to their demand that the story of their trials , sufferings , achievements , and success shall be worthily told . The two volumes of his History which Dr. Hawks has given to the public are fair specimens of his ability and skill in this department , and furnish good augury of what the coming volumes are to be . The first volume is prepared on a plan which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a reprint from Hakluyt of the reports and narratives of the original explorers and adventurers under Raleigh 's patent . Intermingled with these is a copious running commentary , intended to clear up obscure statements and settle disputed points . This commentary is inserted , in a smaller type , in the text . We incline to the opinion , that it would have been better to place these comments and illustrations at the bottom of the page . Snch a course would have avoided the interruptions - sometimes vexatious - to the continuity of the narrative . We do not like to have the notes thus thrust upon us , and choose to be left to our own discretion when to read them , as well as whether to read them at all . We notice with more regret , that throughout these narratives the spelling has been modernized , - a change which affects only the aspect indeed , and not the substance , of the record , yet alters , to our eye very disagreeably , its original character . The plan of giving the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , is worthy of all commendation . We are thus brought face to face with those early worthies . We behold the wonders of the New World as with their eyes , and thus can sympathize with their impressions , and enjoy as they did the strange novelties they saw everywhere . We hear them relate , at each day 's close , the discoveries and rare adventures of the day , in their own simple , racy language . We lose all thought of the lapse of nearly three hundred years , and seem to stand // beside them on the sandy shores of Roanoke Island , to take our place in the boat that explores the unknown windings of the far-off Moratoc , to feast with them on the endless profusion of luscious grapes , the rich odors and imperial beauty of the flowers and forests , and all the splendors of that " goodliest soil under the cope of heaven , " and to feel our hearts stirred by prophetic hopes of the coming greatness and glory of the new continent . That was indeed a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set foot on the soil of Carolina . Efforts had been made , at intervals , for more than seventy years , by different European nations , to gain a permanent foothold on the eastern shore of what is now the United States . De Leon had vainly sought on the coasts of Florida for his fountain , whose waters should impart an immortality of youth ; and Narvaez and De Soto had made similar fruitless quests , and had , like him , perished in the search for the yellow ore which it was thought would make man 's brief life happy . Coligni bad , to no purpose , sought a distant refuge and home for the oppressed and despairing ilugnenots , even in the region where , in after generations , the descendants of that noble race of men found most hospitable entertainment . The Spanish Catholic , who called the country his , could murderously shut out his erring brethren , who yet claimed to be of the same household of faith , but could make no permanent lodgement there for himself . The savage atrocities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were effective against their enemy , but fruitless as regarded themselves . The efforts of the French and of the Spanish crown were alike abortive . It was reserved for a more enterprising people to achieve the mastery of the newly discovered world ; and the , first step was taken in that series of wonderful and glorious successes which have made this nation what it is , when that feeble company planted the standard of Elizabeth on the shores of North Carolina . This effort even was rewarded with no immediate and complete prosperity . A permanent settlement was to be made elsewhere . Jamestown and Plymouth were to be the spots , chosen of Heaven and revered by men , to which the coming generations of this vast country were to trace upward the line of // their derivation . But the endeavor of these noble adventurers , though in the common estimate of men a failure , was still a glorious success ; for thirty and forty years before Jamestown and Plymouth were known , or named , it intimated the direction , showed the way , demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of all who read history aright , and care to pause in reverence at those points on which the world 's history has turned , no less than Plymouth and Jamestown will that sandy island in the Albemarle be a hallowed spot forever . Yet what a difference has been made between these places in the actual judgments of men ! Plymouth is the Mecca of New England , - we may say , of the United States . From every quarter of our wide confederacy men come , in groups or as solitary pilgrims , to pay their thanksgivings and renew their vows of patriotic devotion at the rock which , as they think , became the corner-stone of this vast empire . And of the sons of New England , who is ever weary in speaking , or hearing , of that birthplace of our country 's existence ? Year by year its multitudes assemble there to celebrate its anniversary ; its most eloquent orators bring thither the master-works of their genius , to perpetuate and augment , if that may be , the renown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on no other , the affections of all loyal Americans turn to it , as to the common home of their sentiments , their recollections , and their hopes . And surely no man can censure this spontaneous reverence , this heart 's homage , as honorable to the living men who feel it , as it is to the memory of those whose generous deeds have inspired it . Thus is it also , in a degree , at Jamestown . As the traveller , native or stranger , is borne along the smooth current of the James River , the sight , as he passes it , of that solitary broken arch mantled with ivy , and in its whole aspect proclaiming its utter loneliness and abandonment , breaks off his merry talk , and he , perforce , bows his head reverently for a moment ; for he feels himself in the presence of those heroic men , who , ages ago , laid the foundations of this ancient commonwealth . There was the scene of their labors . There they planted and builded ; - planted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; builded , or at least began to build , a // frame of government , which has expanded to the wide-spreading dome of our confederated Republic . The spirit of the place for a while overpowers him ; but , as he passes onward , the spell loses its hold upon him , and speedily the great and good of other days cease to be remembered . How seldom it is that the people of Virginia gather there ! There have been such doings , - a crowded assembly , a display of soldiery , words of eloquence , smiles of beauty , the souls of spectators roused to a fitful and transient emotion ; and when the morrow 's sun has risen , all has passed away into oblivion . It may be that the wise and patriotic statesmen of the Old Dominion have no taste for such ceremonials , or set a slight value on such modes of commemoration . It may be that to the children of that noble State , the ivy-clad ruins of Jamestown speak more eloquently of the past than any word or work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually judge , one would think that a real reverence would find some fit expression ; and that silence and seeming neglect are hardly a natural testimony of genuine feeling and an earnest memory . If the order of time gives precedence , one would look at Jamestown for more frequent assemblies , for a constant succession of pilgrims , and every outward testimonial which might worthily commemorate the virtues of the founders of the State , and express their children 's gratitude and veneration . As we pass a few degrees farther south , and a few years farther back in time , we find a scene of equal daring , labor , selfdenial , and suffering , sustained by men no less brave and highminded , and no less deserving of the admiration - at least , of the grateful remembrance - of those who have come after them . Yet we hear of no monument erected there , no words of eulogy uttered , no crowded assemblies of commemoration , no brief homage of the passing stranger . Within a mile or two is a summer watering-place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds that haunt it , or of the grave men whom illness or fashion draws together there , how seldom does one hear a hint that hard by them is the place where was landed the first English colony in America ! If its being left to-day as it was when Ralph Lane watched and waited there , is to be taken as a proof that those first settlers are held in // honor by later generations , then is the present condition of Roanoke Island a plain and palpable token of the filial admiration of North Carolina for her founders . Dr. Hawks 's first volume contains , besides a biographical sketch of Sir Walter Raleigh , the projector and patron of the entire movement , and an historical summary of the contents of the original records , a reprint of the seven documents which teach us all we know of this brave but disastrous attempt at colonization . The first is the narrative of the voyage of exploration by Amadas and Barlow . Then we have the accounts of the two voyages made by Sir Richard Greenville ; Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which , for ten months , he presided ; Thomas ilariot 's invaluable Report of the country ; and two narratives by John White , of the settlement of what was designed to be a permanent colony , in 1587 , and his fruitless endeavor to discover and relieve that colony in 1590 . A charter was granted by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584 , by which he was empowered to discover and colonize new and unclaimed countries , and , under a general subjection to the crown , to exercise almost a supreme jurisdiction over them . Under this charter he sent out an expedition , with two vessels , under Captains Amadas and Barlow , which reached the coast of North Carolina in July , 1584 , and spent about two months in exploring the country and investigating the character of its inhabitants . Encouraged by their report , he sent out in the following year , under the command of the famous and heroic Sir Richard Greenville , a larger expedition , of seven sail , which carried out a number of persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and seven were left there , under the government of Ralph Lane ; and during a period of ten months they were busily occupied in preparing the way for other settlers yet to come . They made wide researches , from their head-quarters on Roanoke Island , among the adjacent sounds and rivers , and on the mainland , and studied the natural history of the country under the guidance of the careful and learned Master Hariot . To Lane and Hariot are we mainly indebted for our knowledge of the aspect which the New World presented to the // eye of the first Englishmen who adventured on it . A variety of untoward events made them wish to return to England , and in the summer of 1586 they were taken home in the vessels of Sir Francis Drake . A few days after they set sail , Greenville came again , with means for their relief , and left fifteen men to prepare for other immigrants . Before the next arrival , however , these fifteen had quarrelled with the natives , and were driven from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his slight measure of success thus far , Sir Walter projected another expedition under some new conditions and with fairer prospects . He associated with himself some leading merchants of London , and others , giving them a share in the cost and anticipated profits of the adventure , and engaging , by the ties of self-interest , their most strenuous efforts . He organized a form of government also , incorporating " the Governor and Assistants of the City of Raleigh in Virginia . " Colonists of a different character were selected , men of some means probably , who took their wives and children with them , and were bound by their best affections , as well as by the hope of prosperous fortune , to zealous labor and constant good behavior . This colony was ordered to a new place of settlement . The island where the previous adventurers had lodged was thought to have some disadvantages for their purpose , and they were directed to a point farther north , among the " Chesepians . " Had they gone thither , they very probably might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governorship of John White , who seems to have been a prudent and careful man , and had deep and tender interests staked on the issue of the enterprise . Soon after they reached the soil of North Carolina , - they were not conveyed to their northern destination , - they despatched Governor White back to England for the further and speedy aid they needed . He left them , a hundred and seventeen in number , men , women , and children , - a child and grandchild of his own among them ; and they were never seen , or certainly heard of again . Wars and other hinderances kept him from returning till 1590 , and when he came , the colony had been broken up , all were dispersed or lost , and his brief stay disclosed to him only traces of devastation and 5* // ruin . A sad close this of a most noble epterprise , - money , energy , and life , wasted seemingly for naught ; the innocent and the brave , who had crossed the Atlantic to found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home , swept away by the tomahawk , or worn down by famine , or lost in the fellowship of savage life ; and the stout hearts in England , made bankrupt in fortune , more than bankrupt in hope , and turned away finally from an enterprise which they must have thought had no benediction from above ! Yet we can hardly see why this enterprise should not have succeeded . The adventurers at Roanoke Island might have prophesied to themselves prosperity , at least as fairly as those at Jamestown , and far more hopefully than those at Plymouth . We are not disposed to enter into the details of the comparison ; but we must say a word on one point , in respect to which impressions prevail , unreasonably as we think , to the disadvantage of the Southern colony , - the personal character , we mean , of the adventurers themselves . The Pilgrim fathers have been held up before the world , by their warm-hearted eulogists , as patterns of every virtue , and especially as men who had sacrificed all else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina are thought - it is rather implied than openly asserted - to have been influenced solely by the hope of worldly gain , and many of them are supposed to have been , before leaving England , lawless , criminal , and reprobate . We , of course , shall say nothing to disparage the Puritans . Yet no one can study their own story of their own doings , without deriving from it the *conviction , that their eyes were always open when a bargain was to be made , and that they knew full well the value of beads and beaver . Bradford , devout as indeed he was , contended as strongly for commercial interests as for any other . On the other hand , the record now before us of what was done on the coasts of Carolina is the history of honest , sincere , God-fearing men . There is no evidence of unfairness in their dealings with the natives , - no proof , anywhere , of a sordid temper , or of habits of vice . They did not , indeed , dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity and of England were good enough for them , and they never thought of re-enacting those of Moses . // HAWKS ' S HISTORY OF NORTH CAROLINA . They were not men of loud professions ; there rather prevailed , in this matter , a quiet unconsciousness , which speaks well for the soundness of their moral health . Yet we know that there were among them earnestly religious men ; nay , that the habit of the community was one of open , public , common prayer . So it was in the ten long months when Lane and ilariot and their company sojourned in the land : public prayers and the singing of psalms were the order within their precinct , and the Indian sought and was permitted to join in these acts of Christian worship . When the settlei*s went abroad , - we know it to be true of some of them , - the solitary pathways they traversed with their savage companions bore witness to their prayers , and the lofty arches of the forests echoed their sacred hymns ; nor were they backward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of the wondering and overawed natives the sacred truths of our holy religion . " Many times , " says one of them , " and at every town where I came , according as I was able , I made declaration of the contents of the Bible , that therein was set forth the true and only God and his mighty works , that therein was contained the true doctrine of salvation through Christ , with many particularities of miracles and chief points of religion , as I was able then to utter , and thonght fit at the time . " And however imperfect the communication may have been , he says of the effect of it , that " many were glad to touch it the Bible , to embrace it , to kiss it , to hold it to their breasts and heads , and stroke over all their body with it , to show their hungry desire of that knowledge that was spoken of . " Again he says : " The Werowance the king at our prayers , and many times call upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others whither he sometimes accompanied us , to pray and sing psalms , hoping thereby to be partaker of the same effects which we by that means also expected . " The Indian may have been superstitious , may have looked on their devotions as a magic ceremonial ; but surely the teacher must have been sincere and earnest . What , after many years of intercourse with them , did the sainted Eliot do , or attempt to do , more than this ? // Not as religious men oniy will these Southern colonists well sustain the comparison , but equally as men of stout muscle and steadfast will , of lofty and far-seeing purposes , of scholarly temper and attainments , resolute in danger , patient in suffering , not easily puffed up by any measure of success . They had the faults , perhaps , they certainly had the virtues , of Englishmen . Entering on what was to them an untried enterprise , their means were wisely chosen , as their ends were clearly understood . They learned by their owg experience . Each later effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they did not succeed , we fully believe that they deserved success . There were eminent names among them , of men whom their contemporaries loved to honor , and of whom subsequent generations have not been careless . There was Sir Richard Greenville , Raleigh 's cousin , a rough , bold , unflinching warrior , who had served against the Turks , who had approved his prowess at the battle of Lepanto , and whose death is unmatched , for heroic constancy , on any battle-field , or ship 's deck , where the British soldier has shown the world how to die . There was Sir Thomas Cavendish , the promise of whose life was cut off in his earliest manhood , wasteful and turbulent , yet a good seaman and a brave commander , the terror of the Spaniard on the South Seas , and a fit associate and peer of those sea-lions of his day , whom Sir Francis Drake best represents in history . Of Ralph Lane and John White it is commendation enough that they were selected by so wary and sagacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving so much of his estate , and so many lives . The original records furnish ample proof of their considerate wisdom , firmness , and patient effort . In some respects the superior of them all was Master Thomas Hariot , the naturalist , philosopher , and journalist of , the expedition which he accompanied . He was an Oxford man , a notable mathematician , whose discoveries in divers departments of natural philosophy and astronomy , and improved processes in algebra , have preserved his memory even to our time . His own love of science , no less than his affection for Raleigh , induced him to join the exploring corps . It was his ambition to be among the foremost to learn the secrets of the New World , and to // report them in the Old World to his fellow-seekers after truth . For ten months he dwelt there with the company which Lane commanded , studying , with a genuine scientific zeal , the wonders of this strange soil and climate , watching the character of its inhabitants , and noting with a well-trained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarge the range of philosophic thought , or check or encourage the aspirations of his patron . It is chiefly through his Report , made public soon after the voyage , that we know in what aspect this country presented itself to those who first explored it . We have his account , as minute and precise as his opportunities allowed him to make it , of its beasts , birds , forest-trees , and native plants , and of its capacities for sustaining human life and the enterprises of commerce . Seldom was such a man found , in those days , in such a company , and commissioned for such an undertaking . The projector and leading spirit of the whole enterprise was Sir Walter Raleigh . Rather he may be said to have been the leading spirit in the entire scheme of English colonization in America ; for of all who bore an active part in those glorious adventures he was the foremost , the boldest , incurred the heaviest hazards , and was the most persistent in his plans . Though his plans failed utterly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent , still the success of later adventurers is largely due to his example ; and in connection with the attempts to plant and settle America , surely no name claims a higher reverence than his . The State of North Carolina has shown her grateful sense of his high merits by giving his name to her capital , a fitting though slight monument of his greatness , and of her affection for his memory . His services in the cause of American colonization should alone keep the remembrance of him fresh and green among us ; but for many other reasons should his name be cherished with loving veneration in the State on whose borders he sought to plant civilization and Christianity . Among the great men of that age , so fruitful in great men , no one stands out more conspicuously than Sir Walter Raleigh . It is quite remarkable that most of the distinguished personages of the time of Elizabeth were eminent in a great diversity of charac // ters and ways ; - alike in contemplation and active life ; at once skilful soldiers and experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments , and bold , hardy , impetuous adventurers also , familiar with strange lands and distant oceans ; polished in the refinement and subtlety of courts , and no less at home in the wigwam of the savage , or , as it fared with many , in the solitude of the Tower . Among those so variously gifted Raleigh had hardly a superior , while in the splendid combination of his great and noble qualities he far overtopped the crowd of those even who have left traces of their being on the history of their country , and were the marked men of their time . There was no one of them whose career was watched with a more eager interest by their contemporaries , and no one certainly whose life 's story is read at this day with such mingled emotions of admiration and sorrow . It is , indeed , a captivating narrative , involving so many elements of romance , so full of high aspirations , far-reaching enterprises , and glorious achievements , and yet fitful with all its brilliancy , its serene light too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and queenly displeasure , the climax of popular applause and virtual exile , abounding riches and the most distressful poverty . High hopes and efforts , so enriched with the graces of scholarship , and made attractive by all manly virtues , invested , withal , with the sad and touching interest that comes from disappointment and failure , as if it had been too much for our mortal estate to crown such excellences with success ; the love and confidence of troops of friends set off , and darkened too , by a long and weary struggle with treachery , and the resistance of a silly and jealous king ; a life of heroic action , closed by a death of more heroic dignity and worth , - all form a picture which has challenged the utmost skill of the historian to paint , and on which the men of all the generations since have gazed with reverent admiration , not without sadness and tender regret . Well may the people of North Carolina indulge an honest pride , when they can point to a figure of such genuine greatness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's second volume resumes the story after an interval of some seventy years , and carries us onward from the // granting of the first charter by Charles II . in 1663 to the transformation of the Proprietary into a Royal government in 1729 . During that interval hardly any progress had been achieved in the exploration of the country , and hardly any attempt had been made to effect a permanent settlement within its borders ; and indeed very little interest seems to have been felt in the one or the other , either in England or in the adjacent Colonies . Soon after the accession of Charles II. , however , a small number of his chief counsellors and favorites sought a reward for their services , or a means of wealth , in this far-off and neglected portion of his Majesty 's dominions ; and in 1663 that careless monarch gave them , probably without a thought of its value , a tract of territory which , if we take the full dimensions of the grant , outmeasured the realm of which he remained lord at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon of history . Clarendon , Shaftesbury , Albemarle , and Carteret , - it was these and other men of equal renown who were called to deliberate on the destinies of Carolina , and whose decisions gave shape , in a degree , to those destinies , perhaps forever . Though to us , who judge after the event , many of their determinations appear eminently unwise , and unworthy of their fame , yet we are to remember that colonization was comparatively a new thing among them , and their plans such as could be tested only by their issue ; and we may not fairly allow their mistakes and failure in a policy of which they had no experience to disparage their reputation so well earned in fields that were more familiar . The plan which Dr. Hawks has followed in his narrative of the Proprietary history is quite unlike that of his first volume , and unlike that which has been chosen by most historians . Henry 's History of Great Britain resembles it as to method , in some important respects . Instead of a continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in chronological order , we have the subject here broken up into a variety of discussions of leading topics , which in their combination are designed to furnish a complete view of the progress of the Colony . This method has some obvious advantages . We thus see the growth of the several great // social interests and political institutions , more clearly than in the ordinary narrative method . It demands , however , in the writer , a *cry just sense of the proportion of the parts , so that no one may be unduly expanded ; and skill in grouping them also , and in summing up the results of the whole , that the entire history be not distorted and misshapen . It requires also no slight power of integration , or constructive effort on the part of the reader , to combine several independent essays into a complete and simple whole . Dr. Hawks has divided his volume into eight chapters . Of these , seven treat successively of Exploration and Settlements , of the Law and its Administration , of Agriculture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning , of Civil and Military History , and of Manners and Customs ; while the eighth is a general review . Prefixed to each chapter is a collection of papers illustrating the subject of it , - old reports , letters by actors in the scenes there described , and the like . It is better , perhaps , thus to place such documents at the head of the chapters than to convert them into foot-notes , or put them into an Appendix , where they are liable to be entirely overlooked . When they occupy the front , as here , there is some chance of their being read , and then the only danger - the author 's risk merely - is that they may prove so interesting as to throw what follows into the shade . To most readers the letters of Pollock , Spotswood , and Gale , touching the Indian war of 1711 - 12 , will prove more attractive than the r ( sum* that succeeds them . The historian 's narrative is apt to be tantalizingly meagre or feebly redundant ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyewitnesses , and with the earnest eloquence of men whose dearest interests are involved in the events of which they bear record . In some respects , Dr. Hawks has been very fortunate in regard to the witnesses on whom he relies , and has done his readers a very acceptable service in reprinting so largely the letters and other memorials in which they have recorded their impressions of men and things in Carolina . The missionaries sent out in the first decade of the last century , by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts , have left not only an entertaming // picture of their own labors , adventures , and sufferings , but very interesting sketches also , or rather glimpses , of the state of social life in general , as it then existed in Albemarle , and especially of the very loose attachment of the people to the forms of worship , and their too general indifference to the principles and restraints of religion . We are sincerely thankful to the author of these volumes for the copious collection of such proofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with a single reading of the minute statements and hopeful vaticinations of William Gordon and good Parson Adams , and we can not find it in our heart to be displeased at 4ohn Urmstone 's grumblings , so clearly do these men set before us the real , rude aspect of the little world in which they lived . Yet we fear that the author may himself suffer somewhat in the contrast he has thus furnished of their earnest and effective representations with his cooler and more abstract way of summing up and combining their materials ; though we would by no means intimate that in his share of the work he has been otherwise than successful . The fact , we think , is quite otherwise . The documents prefixed to his chapters have indeed a peculiar quality of sprightly story-telling ; yet the chapters also give us a clear and connected impression of the progress of events , and of the character and agency of all the men who were conspicuous in them . We have an ample discussion also of causes and consequences , of motives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former historians are here unravelled and made plain , and the position of some of the leading men in the Colony is placed in a new or clearer light . It will be the reader 's fault if he does not gather from this volume a well-defined conception of the entire history of North Carolina under the government of the Lords Proprietors . The peculiarity in their frame of government , their dependence on a body of Proprietors residing in a distant country , will serve to account for some singular things in the history of the people of Carolina . The supreme authority was in the hands of a body of men thousands of miles away . Power was scantily given to the actual settlers , however greedily // taken , and however frequently usurped . The Proprietors were not only non-residents , they were of a privileged class ; and the breadth of the Atlantic was a slighter barrier between them and their colonists than was the difference of social rank . The interests of the two parties were unlike , and there was no bond of sympathy between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharp diversity of their interests . And , what was worse than this , and made all this worse , the Lords Proprietors were thoroughly ignorant of the condition of affairs among their colonists . They seem to have had no clear notion of the principles on which a colony should be managed ; and they took no pains to inform themselves of what was needed in Carolina , or whether what was needed was , or could be , supplied . They had invested their money in the enterprise , and , while they did not utterly neglect its higher interests , they mainly sought a prompt and large return for the investment , How could it be expected that the foremost men in the nobility of England could sympathize with the humble hopes and plans of the rude pioneers , who owed them quit-rents in Carolina ? How could they turn away from the strife of politics , on which their own promotion depended , and from the splendors of a court , in whose brilliant amusements was found the grave occupation of their lives , to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loftier aim than to cut down the forests of that far-off region , and to raise crops of corn and tobacco ? They might , of course , expect the colonists to comply strictly with their contract , and to pa*y rents and dues punctually ; but they seem to have forgotten that they owed any duty of care and anxious watchfulness to the men whom they had tempted to the wilderness . For periods of several years in the most perilous crises in the affairs of the Colony , the settlers went on without a single communication from their masters , who neither knew nor wished to know of what transpired beyond the seas . And IDr . Hawks declares , after a survey of the cases in which they did interpose , that their interference was not less mischievous than their neglect . Of these unwise interpositions on the part of the Lords Proprietors the one most conspicuous for its folly was their // HAWKS 'S HISTORY OF NORTH CAROLINA . attempt to establish the system of organic law , now so well known under the name of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the request of some of the Proprietors , by a philosopher so renowned and so truly great , that the highest and purest results of political wisdom and experience might fairly be looked for in it . John Locke , if any theorist , might , one would think , have been fitly intrusted with such a work . A glance at the work itself will convince the reader that Locke was well aware of the vast importance of the instrument which he was commissioned to frame , and that he gave to . it an amount of laborious thought which he would have felt bound to give to nothing else than to a frame of government for a great people , designed for a perpetual duration . We need not say here that the system never went into operation . Some of the high officers , who were to bear rule under it , some Landgraves , some Caciques , were named . It was most earnestly commended by the Proprietors to the people of Carolina ; those who had an interest in maintaining it struggled for a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powers were made under it ; but the body of the settlers in the Colony , both in the northern and southern sections , were no more consciously impressed or lastingly affected by it than by the shadow of a passing cloud . The whole scheme was an utter and ignominious failure . Not only was it never executed ; hardly was an attempt made to execute it . It was conceived in absolute ignorance of the country and people . One scarcely knows which most to wonder at , the exceeding simplicity of the sage who devised it , or the lack of ordinary sagacity on the part of those who sought to impose it on the settlers in Albemarle . There was hardly a point in which it was adapted to their character and wants . The Fundamental Constitutions were suited to a compactly settled community , at an advanced stage of wealth and refinement ; and they were offered to a people who were yet in the poor and rude beginnings of a settlement , where society was hardly organized , and on whose soil no semblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It were folly , doubtless , to propose any complete code of laws to such a people , for fit laws must grow from and with them ; but to propose such // a code , under such circumstances , is an act of folly to which history can not readily furnish a parallel . This whole matter is made painfully ludicrous , by the simple gravity and obvious good faith of the Lords Proprietors through the whole transaction . This affair is perhaps the worst instance , yet only an instance , of the extreme carelessness or ignorance of the Lords Proprietors in all matters touching the real prosperity of the Colony . It occurred in the early part of their term of government ; and instead of learning by experience , they seem to have grown more careless and more ignora*zit . Dr. Hawks states that in 1724 they appointed Colonel Thomas Pollock , by name , as one of the councillors who were to administer the oaths of office to Governor Burrington . Yet Colonel Pollock had been in his grave since August , 1722 . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no Governor , and was perhaps the most prominent citizen in the Colony . Not content with one such blunder , they named him again in the commission to administer the oaths to Sir iRichard Everard , in 1725 . And this body of Proprietors had the supreme power over the Colony , controlled all its legislation , and appointed and governed by instructions its chief executive officers . We need not intimate , what every one must see , the sad hinderance which such a ruling power must have proved to the success of the Colony . One result of such a relation of the governing power to the governed is only too plain and certain . The people could have had but little confidence in either the wisdom or the affection of the Proprietors , and must have held their own duty of allegiance and submission rather loosely . In no one of the American Colonies was there so frequent resistance to authority , lawlessness suffering so little punishment , and rebellion so openly resorted to , and so successful . Culpepper 's rebellion in 1677 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in 1707-8 , are only striking illustrations and outbreaks of a temper , at some times almost universal there , which the powers in England did nothing to repress , and which the acts and the omissions of the Proprietors served equally to encourage . There was a wild instinct of independence , a , // shrinking from restraint , which corrupt men not seldom used for their selfish purposes , and which might have been swayed to noble ends , had their legal superiors known how to use it . Often men of bad character were sent over to govern them , - men who only alienated them by oppression ; and often , again , for years they had no Governor of lawful authority . Though they seem to have flourished most when left most to their own guidance , we may well be surprised that they attained any measure of prosperity under so fitful and feeble an administration . We have referred to this relation of the Colony to the Lords Proprietors , to give one instance , out of many , of the peculiarities in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonies . The reader of these volumes will notice many other essential peculiarities , from which came , of necessity , a different method , and direction , and degree of progress . The results of these differences did not cease when Carolina ceased to be a Colony or a Province . They are as manifest to-day as they were a hundred years ago , and will continue for many ages yet to shape the destinies of the people of that region . There were other strongly marked peculiarities which have now passed away . These too are essential to a true presentation of the history of that country , and we find that Dr. Hawks has not overlooked them . One of these , of by no means the least importance , was the great remoteness of the residents from one another . They sought , naturally , the best lands , and easily secured large tracts . Thus there might be found a family here , and another there , on the water-courses , with wide intervals between them ; and from river to river only a trackless solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group the settlers in villages . We need not say how unlike was the case in New England , nor how vast the issues of this difference have been , resulting in the continued tendency to plantation life in the one region , and to village life in the other . There is no more striking difference between the early history of the two sections than is that in regard to their religioim institutions . In New England , church-membership and citi-6* // zenship being convertible terms , the outward forms of religion were everywhere displayed ; while in most cases , we may believe , its principles swayed the deepest feelings of the heart , and shaped all the actions of the life . The peculiar religious faith of our Pilgrim fathers - whatever may be thought of its doctrinal truth , and whether one should rejoice or mourn that the children have swung so far from the old moorings - had certainly no little power . Held as they held it , in profound earnestness , - brought by it , as they were , every hour , face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heaven and hell were but the issues of each day 's doings , - it wrought on the character with an intensity which the world has seldom seen . The assurance that they were the elect of God gave them in all their plans a persistent energy , and an unworldly hope , which are the best of all conditions of even worldly success ; and these , helped by that hardness of character which their gloomier doctrines engendered , made them , of all men , the most fit to subdue a continent and build up a commonwealth . Among the earlier adventurers in North Carolina the state of things , in a somewhat sad contrast to the case of Raleigh 's colonists also , was far otherwise . Most of them came from Virginia , and many were outlaws , whose crimes had forced them to flee from the dwellings of civilized men ; many more , doubtless , withdrew to this region from the restraints of a creed they disliked , or from the burdens of an ecclesiastical system whose weight they would not bear ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate adventure , or to repair fortunes broken or reputations ruined elsewhere . Such men were not likely to bring the institutions of the Church with them , or to encourage their introduction by others . How many devout hearts there were in the wilderness we can not tell . We can not doubt that many a settler rendered earnest thanks for peace and plenty in his solitary cabin . We must believe that those Carolina mothers were ' used , in their lonely homes , to seek a Divine protection and guidance for their children . Human nature can not do otherwise . But however much of private devotion there may have been , of the outward form of worship , for a generation , // there was nothing . Neighbors may have assembled in one another 's houses for acts of common devotion , but for nearly forty years after the charter , and fifty after the settlements began , there was in Albemarle no church or consecrated house for joint and general use , no ordained priest , no gathering to hear sermons , no holy sacrament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the people belonged in name , by descent , and probably by preference , to the Church of England . Of the various forms of dissent they seem to have known but little . Yet it was not till the year 1700 that the first Episcopal clergyman set foot in that land . It was two years later that the first church was erected . The leading men in the affairs of the Colony from this time were Inainly Churchmen ; yet we believe that , during the rest of the Proprietary government , till 1729 , there were at no time more than half a dozen Episcopal clergymen there , perhaps at no time so many , and sometimes for periods of several years none at all . This shows a melancholy contrast with the beginnings of other Colonies . We trust that the state of things in Carolina was better than the scanty records would indicate . So far as morals and worship are concerned , no doubt the Quakers , who were quite numerous there in the latter part of the seventeenth century and the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox was there as early as 1672 , and his principles were eagerly embraced by many . In some precincts his followers outnumbered all others , and excelled them in wealth and influence . If they took as much pains to secure pure morals as they did to gain political power , and were as much in earnest to propagate true religion as their opponents say they sometimes were to excite sedition , the condition of the people could not have been so gloomy as the historian is forced to represent it . What we have thus hinted at of the condition of affairs under the government of the Lords Proprietors will serve to show that the historian of North Carolina has a subject , in some respects , of remarkable interest . We have said enough too , perhaps , to express our sense of the way in which Dr. Hawks has discharged his self-imposed duty . His ability and skill are more clearly exhibited , however , in some of the // 68 HAWKS 'S HISTORY OF NORTH CAROLINA . chapters to which we have not referred . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration is the theme , is written with surpassing skill . The legal training of the author 's early life gives him here a great advantage , and in his arrangement , the copiousness of his materials , and the felicity of his statements and illustrations , he leaves us little to desire . There is one department , however , in which we thiiik he would have done wisely to avail himself of the knowledge of those who have made their researches in it a special study . We refer to Natural History . In the narrative of Ilariot , and in Lawson 's History , as well as in some pages of Dr. Hawks 's second volume , an attempt is made to enumerate and describe the more important animal and vegetable productions found in that country . In his notes to Hariot 's narrative , especially , Dr. Hawks is very precise in settling , or conjecturing , the various kinds and species which Hariot mentions . Here , particularly in reference to the botanical portion , we think he has failed of his usual success ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent naturalist who is familiar with the productions of that region would have found very little difficulty in giving him accurate and trustworthy information . In his interpretation of the names and descriptions given by Hariot , where some degree of scientific accuracy is very desirable , as well as in the sketch of the natural growth of the country , in the chapter on Agriculture , &amp;c. , which he compiled from the memoranda left by the earliest explorers , he is often at a loss , and oftener mistaken . Dr. Hawks , to give an instance , must have had a rarely good fortune in his observations , if he has ever seen what he speaks of , a tulip-tree with its flowers of pure white . We have seen thousands of those flowers , but never a white one . Again , he *peaks of " the Gum , with its sweet-scented drops exuding from the wounded bark : invaluable for its toughness , almost impossible to split , and hallowed in the superstition of the Indian as the tree that was never struck by the thunderbolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entirely distinct , and which are so held in the common language of the country , no less than by the practised dendrologist . The Sweet Gum ( Liquidambar styracijlua ) is // the one that yields the odorous " drops , " and it is the Black Gum ( Nyssa ) which it is " impossible to split . " So he writes of " the Mulberry of three varieties , black , white , and red , " as having been found by the first settlers in Carolina ; yet it is well known that the first variety only is a native of this continent . Most of the plants referred to by ilariot are only guessed at by our author , many of them wrongly ; and in almost every case where he declines to conjecture , a skilful botanist could readily have informed him ariglit . Hariot gives the Indian names , and such names as Tsihaw and Okeepenauk might well , perhaps , alarm an ordinary editor ; yet the one is still called China root , and the other is plainly the Tuckahoc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's birthplace , could have told him , from ilariot 's description , that Okeepenauk is the common and favorite Groundnut . Dr. Hawks gives us quite an extended argument to show the identity of the Yaupon , a shrub which grows abundantly on the coast of North Carolina , and which is much used by the negroes for making tea , with the Mat6 of Brazil . Botanists have always distinguished them as species of Ilex , naming one flex vomitoria , and the other flex Parctguayensis , and this on the ground of very marked specific differences . They can hardly be expected to change their classification on the authority of an unknown naturalist , - who , to carry on an imposture ( we can imagine no other reason ) , called it flex Yanponia f  --  and of an old woman in Brazil who sold " boiled pork and beans , " and who , in her enthusiasm at the sight of what seemed to her an old acquaintance , exclaimed , " This is the same truck we use in Carolina to make tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Hawks did not consult some competent naturalist , familiar with the forms of vegetable and animal life in the low countries of North Carolina , who could easily have saved him from numerous errors on these subjects . Errors of this sort , though it were very desirable to avoid . them , do not affect the general character of the work , or alter our estimate of its worth as a whole . As regards style , we do not see that the author had in his eye any peculiar model of historical excellence , or any ambition to give the world a new // model . He seems to have been content , wisely , as we think , to narrate in simple , clear , and forcible language , the events of the period he has selected for his theme . Were we disposed to be critical in this respect , we should say that his profession is too apparent . Not that there is much sermonizing , though we could well spare some of the moral reflections and judgments ; but he has overlooked the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that is to be read . He must have written , no doubt unconsciously , with an audience before him . This is evident often in the structure of sentences and paragraphs ; it influences the choice of words , determines the emphasis , and leads sometimes to an undue amplitude of discussion . We can not shake off the impression as we read , that each chapter was designed to be delivered as a lecture . There is an air of advocacy about it , something of the ad captandum in allusions to the present time , and a lack of the repose that belongs to narrative , and of the judicial impartiality which we demand in it . Not satisfied with a simple statement of the case , he is so earnest to have his reader on his side , as at times to become vehement and declamatory . He has great power of sarcasm , and uses it unsparingly , and is led by it to paint some characters , we fear , too darkly , as if he had a strong personal dislike for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relieved by no single trait of goodness . Is not even Sir William Berkeley , a narrow-minded but most upright Governor , in whom the sentiment of loyalty and law subdued all other sentiments , dealt with rather harshly , in such language as " the inconceivable littleness of his vulgar soul " ? Making due allowance for the defects we have specified , we have read these volumes with great pleasure . The materials are often scanty , yet we feel assured that the author has made the most of them . Under his guidance we follow the progress of the Colony for nearly seventy years ; a progress sometimes impeded by domestic discord and commotion , hindered in no slight degree - though less than one might have anticipated - by an almost uninterrupted misgovernment , or neglect ; yet on the whole a steady growth , once only , and for a brief period , checked by Indian warfare , and seldom warped or swayed by any influence from abroad ; a growth in wealth and power , in // refinement of manners and religious culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the purpose , fitful perhaps , but sincere , to maintain that freedom and enlarge that activity . There are not wanting elements of a romantic interest also ; and the Blackbeard of the Pamlico has as real an attraction as the Bluebeard of our childish reading . There is not a little , too , in the story of those early days , that may prepare the reader for the later scenes at Alamance , and the wild tramp to King 's Mountain . We shall look with interest for the volumes that are to come . The period of the royal government has a special charm and a superior value . The records are more copious ; the field of events is larger ; the results are more important ; and the War of the Regulation in North Carolina is a far richer chapter than similar ones , if such there be , in other States . The narrative of the Revolutionary struggle there will disclose an amount of patient endurance and self-imposed effort , of daring and suffering for the common cause , which may well bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonies ; while the domestic warfare along the Cape Fear and Deep Rivers , in 1*in80 - 81 , the bloody , unrelenting , and too often merciless conflicts of neighbors and friends , arrayed against one another as Whig and Tory , is a page in history which has hardly a parallel elsewhere . The history of a State in which flourished patriots and statesmen like Davie and Caswell , Johnston and looper , which can count among her soldiers such leaders as Nash and Davidson , and can point to men so wise and great as Macon and Stanley and Gaston of later times , as the native outgrowth of her institutions and culture , must be a history for strangers to read with pleasure , and of which her own children may well be proud .
