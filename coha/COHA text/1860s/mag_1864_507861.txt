txt THREE LIVES . " We meet at one*gate When all 's over . The ways they are many and wide , And seldom are two ways the same . Side by aide May we stand at the same little door , when all 's done ! The ways they are many , the end it is one . " " J N our course through life we shall meet the I people who are corning to meet us , from many strange places , and by many strange roads ; and what it is set to them to do to us , and what it is set to us to do to them , will all 6e done . " When I came upon this passage in the book I was reading I shut it up and fell to thinking . Somehow the words carried me back along the way of my own life  --  a rugged , commonplace highway enough , and yet not without some strange , sudden turnings in it , which made me understand what the old Greeks meant by Fate . Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided boats through mad seas , tossing white crests of defiance to a threatening sky ; I have not ministered in prisons , or nursed in hospitals . Yet is my quiet life not without its own lesson ; not without its temptations , its struggles , its hours of terrible anguish ; and I have thought it might be a good employment for the long , solitary days of summer , to set it all down ; that , perchance , sometime when the mould grows over my pulseless heart , and my faded eyes are closed forever , some other , tried and tempted as I was , may read and learn that the right has its sure rewards . If they are not always of the earth ; if the crown is eternal , and the flowers are such as never fade , are they therefore the less worth the winning ? How far off my youth seems , and yet I am but thirty-five ! and it is only because my life must be measured , not by years , but by the incidents which have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman , for whom it remains only to sit among the shadows and wait for the morning . Back across the years I look to the mornIngland of youth . I see a bright , happy home , kind parents , brothers and sisters , so many and so merry . Our life , in the pleasant country town where our home was , was not wanting in variety . We had society enough as we grew up , and the great hospitable house need to ring with gay laughter and cheery talk . In winter Yule fires burned in the wide-mouthed chimneys , for we were come of English stock , and liked to keep up good old customs ; the long tables bent under the weight of bounteous Christmas cheer , and of all the glad young faces on which the fire-light flashed none was more glad than mine . I did not know what trouble meant in those dayt . There was a strange fascination for me in reading in books about misery and heartache - a pleasant luxury , in the soft tears I wept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spoiled me a little because I was the beauty of the fitmily , and they were all proud of me . No one would guess it now , but in my youth , when these eyes , which so many tears have dimmed , were black and full of sparkling light , when roses flamed on these now pale cheeks , when my lips were coral red , and my long dark hair defied comb and band to curb its luxuriant growth , I was the belle of the country town  --  the centre of attraction at every fete and festival . The discipline of my life has cured me of vanity . It thrills my pulses now with no throb of the old pride to remember how I qucened it once ; to recall the perilous pleasure of being followed , and praised , and sought for ; the one without whom every company was incomplete . It is fashionable nowadays to make book heroines who are pale and reticent ; not handsome till some inspiration kindles their eyes and colors their cheeks , and then , all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . It was bright and positive . Of course I had many suitors ; hut I was not easy to win . I was reluctant to resign my proud dominion over the many to sit quietly down at one man 's fleeside . Yet I was no coquette ; I gave no encouragement , and if any were disappointed I did not bold myself to blame . I was nineteen , and had l*en for three years the centre of attraction in all the society the neighborhood of Kempton afforded , before I had ever allowed any one to approach me near enough to be my lover . I hardly know now what it was which mo* ? ed me when Fred Hartright came . He was my second cousin , but lIe was an orphan , and had passed most of his life away from Kempton-in school , or traveling , or at the house of his guardian in New York . When I was nineteen be came to Kempton for the summer ; and , of course , with the tie of relationship between us , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very handsome . I think it ran in the Harfright blood ; my mother , was a Hartright , and I took my beauty from her . The Hamiltons are all like my father-sturdy , and brave , and true , strong to work for God and man , but wanting a little the Hartright charm . I had never seen any one like Fred ; never , certainly , any one so graceful , so accomplished , so gifted with that rare fascination of manner which makes every Thing its possessor does and says seem at once thoroughly sincere , and the most subtle of compliments . Perhaps it was no wonder that we attracted each other , thrown together as we were in all the pleasant , dangerous // intimacy ofeountry life-riding , driving , boating , singing , and dreaming . When he asked me to marry him , however , I hardly knew what to say , for I had not been thinking of him in that light . Pleasant friend , gay companion he had been - nothing more . But when I listened to his passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleading ; above all , when I knew I must be all to him or nothing-that , if I said no to his suit , my gallant , tender friend would go away from Kempton forever , I began to think how sorely I should miss him , and to long to keep him by my side . There was something very fascinating , moreover , in his intense , earnest way of making love . No one had ever talked so to me before . I did not believe I had ever been half so dear to any'tne else , and I thought I should never be so beloved again . Before I fairly knew it we were engaged , and while I passed my days in a sort of charming , cooing bewilderment at Fred 's side , my mother and sisters were busily at work upon my wedding outfit . It was September when our bridal vows were plighted , and we were to be married at the Christmas tide , on my twentieth birthday . The three months intervening were long enough to show me Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I began to recognize in him a passionate temper , an undisciplined will , a jealousy cruel as the grave . Oh , if I had been warned in time . But no one seemed to mind ; only my grandmother Hamilton said to me one day-it was after we had quarreled and made up , when she was there on a visit " Remember , child , stormy wooing never ends in quiet wedding . " I answered her cheerfully : " Oh , there 'll be no trouble after we are married , grandma . It is only that Fred loves me so well now he ca n't bear any one else to look at me . After we have settled down into the quiet of wedded life , and our mutual trust is strengthened by time , it will all be different . We shall jog along just as other people do . " Grandmother shook her head . " If you'could build a great stone pyramid on the top of a volcano it might keep it under , perhaps-the thing would be to keep the volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she meant , She thought there would never be peace enough between us to give time for building up the quiet trust of which I had spoken . With my nineteen-years-old wisdom I smiled at her fears , and thought she knew neither Fred nor me , or our love for each other . And indeed there was soirfething fascinating about those very outbursts of temper . I am not sure that they did not make his hold on me stronger than a calmer lover 's would have been . *ot that I liked his anger or his injustice ; but the tender sweetness of making up seemed to atone for all . When I saw him at my feet , so humbled , so sorry , so fearful I would never forgive him , and so certain that all he needed to cure him forever was to have me all his own . and be sure that no one else would dare to think of me , is it strange that I was ready to pardon all ? I have wondered since , that my mother was not alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Hartright foibles , and thought all Fred 's passionate injustice sprang from the fervor of his love . So I went on . I remember the frosty pomp of my bridal morning . An early snow glittered on the treeboughs and whitened the road-side , and the bright December sun struck it all to diamond sparkles . Fred was ecstatic . Never had bridc been so lovely , or groom so blest . No doubt or misgiving troubled him-there was no little cloud in all the blue sky that arched smiling over his future . Did his rhapsodies chill me , or why was my heart so heavy ? At the very last a vague presentiment of evil , oppressed me . Still I felt no inclination to draw back . I thought what I experienced was but the natural , girlish tremor which overflows in some in bridal tears , but which turned me , instead , cold and still . I spoke my vows willingly , and with unfaltering lips-pledged myself of my own free-will , and surely the contract was binding . I could have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the uttermost farthing* When the ceremony was over the chill and gloom were uplifted from my mood . I was happy , as brothers and sisters and friends crowded round me with congratulations , and I turned proud eyes on my handsome , graceful husband . Many a time afterward the bitterness of thoughts which would have been harsh was softened by the memory of that hour-of the triumph in his eyes , the love-words on his lips , the tremulous joy of which my own heart was full . There was need enough , as time passed on , of tender and softening memories . My grandmother had been right . Stormy wooing does not end in quiet wedding . We lived together , in outward peace , more than three years . On the incidents of those miserable years I will not dwell . They are my secret-let the world speculate on them as it may . Both of us were wrong ; both suffered . He was unkind , exacting , causelessly jealous , needlessly cruel . I was defiant , unyielding . not ready enouyh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any child 's hand had been stretched out to draw us together , any baby lips had smiled for us , it might have saved us ; but God knew best , and He sent no *nch blessing . There are men and women , perhaps , who could go through a long lifetime together in outward harmony , when between their hearts was yawning a fathomless , bridgeless gulf of disunion and discordance . Such must have cooler , more controlled , more long-suffering temperaments than ours . // There came a time at last , after months of alienation-months during which not one word had been spoken between us that the necessities of life or of society did not exact-when Fred entered one afternoon the room where I was sitting . It was a June day . There was a scent of heliotropes in the air . I remember the way every article of furniture was placed-what music was open on the piano , what book I held in my hand , even a white shred on the carpet which tormented my eyes while he spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His tone was quiet , yet with a certain note of resolve which made it forceful . He had always called me Margery , even when we were most at variance ; but it seemed to me his voice lingered a little on the name now , with an inflection that made me think of old , happier times . I looked up expectantly , yet with a cold certainty at my heart that reunion was impossible ; a secret , bitter determination never again to forgive him , say what he would . But he had not come for prayers or entreaties . Looking at me searchingly , he said , " iDo you remember the address Charles Forsyth gave us in his last letter ? " Charles was our cousin-his as well as mine  --  and had been among the first to follow the goJd rumors to California . I began to guess at Fred 's intentions ; but I rose quietly , took the letter from a desk , and handed it to him . " I have made all my arrangements , " he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to California by the next steamer . I shall join Forsyth . I have no doubt he can put me in the way of establishing myself . I shall go in a week , unless " - here he came close to me , and looked steadily down into my eyes- " unless you ask me to stay , Margery . " What was my duty ? I could not tell . God forgive me if I judged wrongly . He had worn my love out , if indeed it had ever been worth calling love . It was dead utterly . It would be a relief to have him go  --  a blessed relief-if I could only creep away into some solitude , where the world would forget me , and find rest . Yet I was not without a conscience . If I had thought any reconciliation could be permanent , remembering my marriage-vows I would have said , stay . But I was so weary of such trials ! They had been made so often and so vainly ! What was the use , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those miserable scenes after all ? So I just said  --  and I know my voice was cold , for I felt as if I was turning to stone " I shall neither say go nor stay . To talk of any influence of mine over you is an absurdity . Do as you choose . " He put his hand on my shoulder , and , bending down a little , looked into my eyes with a curious expression ; hardly tender , yet certainly not harsh ; expectant , perhaps . I wondered if he thought there was still any magnetism for tue in his touch , any spell in his eyes . I did not speak . " I wait , Margery , for *your jAdding . Remember you are deciding the whole future for us both . " " Did you not understand me ? I will take no such responsibility . . If you go , you go . If you stay , you stay . I will have nothing to do with the matter . " He looked at me for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he read there a resolve sterner than his own . He drew a long breath at last , and announced his determination . " I go , Margery . I shall trouble you no more . See to it that you can quiet your conscience as easily in the days when our vows and the way we have kept them are brought up before us in judgment as you can quiet my voice now . " . 4 I was silent . I might have upbraided him with his own offenses against our mutual compact ; but I said nothing , and I thought my silence magnanimous . And yet a few words , even of reproach , would have kept him ; for a softened heart looked out of his lingering eyes . A few words then might have saved us perhaps from so much that came after , and I did not speak them . Was it fate ? When he had gone out of the room , and I knew the matter was all settled , I felt no regret . I think I had suffered so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frozen creature , with only one emoti*n  --  a blind , vague sense of relief that I should be put upon the rack no more , should hear no more bitter words , be subjected to no more upbraidings . I could go away-it was all I craved  --  and rest . During the week that yet remained before he left I think a few words from me would at any time have changed all his plans . I think , now that he was about to leave me , his heart yearned over me with a sorrowful , longing tenderness . He was more passionate than I-in a certain sense more cruel  --  but he was at the same time more forgiving . Besides , his nature was not so hard-did not retain impressions as mine did . Our three years and over of perpetual , miserable bickering had not so worn into his soul as they had into mine . It would have been possible for him to forget  --  to me the very tenacity of my memory was a curse . I did not then realize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoping for some small sign of concession from me . If I had , I think I should have yielded , out of duty , not love . But it was not till afterward that the truth came home to me-when I remembered the long looks that sought my face with a speechless entreaty , the slight errands into the room where I was sitting , the little cares for my comfort . All in vain . I responded to none of them . Silent and still , cold and impassive , as if frozen to stone , I sat through the long June days , with a bit of work in my fingers for a pretense , or some book which I never read . At last-it was the day before he was to gohe spoke to me directly . // " I have spared you all the trouble I could , Margery ; done as far as I could without consulting you ; but it is necessary that you should tell me your wishes about some things . Will you stay here after I am gone ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have invested money enough in your name to make you independent ; so you can choose your own course . " It seemed to me then that I would have died before I would have remained after he went away in his house . I thought food bought with his money would choke me if I *hould be starving . I waited a moment till I could speak quietly . " Thank you , " I said , as I would have answered a stranger . " I shall not care to stay here . My plans for the future are all made . I should wish to get away from Kempton , and I shall go to my grandmother Hamilton . She will be glad of my company . I should prefer that you would withdraw the investments you mention . I shall never use them . The money my father settled on me at my marriage will suffice for all my necessities . I think it might be well to leave your attorney the care of letting this house , furnished . It would be an easy manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal effects as soon as you are gone . While you staid I thought it but right to continue my superintendence of the housekeeping , that you might not be uncomfortable . " I looked back to my book for a sign that the conversation was ended , but still he stood there and looked at me . " Who are you ? " he cried , after a moment , in a raised , passionate tone . " You are not Margery Hamilton , the impulsive , thoughtless , gay Margery I loved and won  --  the Margery that used to love me ! " " No , I am not Margery Hamilton . There is a difference between her and Mrs. Hartright . You should know me , for I am what you have made me . He went out , muttering between his teeth something which I did not hear . The next day he went away . I thir*k , at the very last , it took all his pride to sustain him , and make him go . After all , he was better than I-his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold when he touched it . My eyes looked stonily into his . I manifested no trace of emotion , because I felt none . The very fountains of my being seemed frozen up . Else , surely , the despairing tenderness that looked so wistfully out of his eyes would have moved me to some throb of pity . I think until the very last the hope had not quite failed him that I would relent , and ask him to stay . When he saw no softening in the cold resolve of my face he spoke his farewell . " Good-by , Margery , wife . We shall never meet again , perhaps . May God forgive us both ! " " Amen ! " I said , solemnly , for in that prayer at least my whole heart joined . Then he went . The long , sad experiment was over . I was a wife , and yet no wife . That was morning . Before noon every thing which I wished to remove was packed and sent to the railroad station . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew any thing of Fred 's departure . They surely had heard nothing from me ; and I cc*uld not have borne to see them just then . I thought it would he time enough after I was settled with my Grandmother Hamilton at Woodstock . I discharged my two servants , locked my house , and sent the key to my husband 's man of business . Then I turned my back on Kempton . It was sunset when I stood before my grandmother 's door . I had not shed a single tear when I parted with the man whom I had vowed to love and cherish till death came between usnot one when I went out from that home to which I had gone , with such bright hopes , a bride ; but when the door opened , and I saw my grandmother 's kind face , with the look of surprise blending with her welcome , I remembered how helpless and loiiely I was , and I burst into tears . " Will you take me in ? " I asked , amidst my sobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say a word . She just led me in silently and up stairs to a pleasant room . She untied my bonnet , took off my shawl , brushed my hair away from my face , and bathed my eyes very gently . Then , in the twilight , she sat down by me with her " Now , child ! " and I knew she was ready for my story . I kept back nothing . To her , at least , if she was to give me comfort and shelter , the whole truth was due . I told her the whole sad history . She held my hand in hers all the time , and when I was through she did not reproach me . She only said , " Poor Margery ! Poor Fred ! How I pity you both ! Perhaps your coldness was as much to blame as his passion . I think the most love was on his side . He could have gone on forever getting angry and making up ; and never , perhaps , have loved you a whit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the breach widened . Two natures that to all human judgment never ought to have come together . How often we see such things in this world ! And yet , God knows . Some day we may see how it was all for the best . " " Do you think I ought to have said stay , ' grandma ? " I asked this question longing yet fearing to know her verdict . She thought a while before she answered me . " I ca n't say , child . As we grow older we form our opinions more cautiously ; and there are some cases where it is hard to lay down the rule of right and wrong for another soul . I think he wanted you to ask him to stay ; and that he would have staid if you had . But whether it would have been any better , whether there would have been any thing hut the old , miserable scenes over again , a good deal more suffering , and then separation after all , I do n't know . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your side , and want of love . It is too late to change any thing now , unless he should come hack and ask you to live with him . If he should I should have no two minds about your duty . If we vow a vow unto the Lord we must keep it , even though it be to our hurt . " I shivered inwardly . I thought I had escaped from the fetters of my rash vow . I could not bear to feel that they had yet a possible hold on me . Perhaps , grandmother read my thoughts . I did not express them . I only drew closer to her , and whispered , through the gathering night gloom , " Will you keep me ? May I stay with you ? " " Did you think I would ever send you away ? " And then , when her soft , kind arms took me into their shelter , I cried again for joy that my . rest was won . The next day I wrote to my father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and begging them to come over to Woodstock for all farther explanations . When they came grandmother saw them first . She yielded to my entreaties , and spared me the pain of telling my own story by telling it all iu my stead . When they saw me they were most kind . I had always been their darling , and I know their hearts yearned over me in my desolation . They urged me not a little to come home ; but at last I made them understand bow trying it would be for me in Kempton , among all the old scenes and the old faces , with my changed prospects and blighted life . I think my mother , with a woman s sensitiveness to public opinion , sympathized fully with my feelings . If my father did not , he at least ceased to oppose my determination . So my life with my grandmother began . What a quiet life it was ! For a year I never even went home . The only changes that came to me were the occasional visits of father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always came into my presence with hushed tread and carefully-modulated voices , as one approaches a person on whom a great sorrow has fallen . I had received a letter soon after I came to Woodstock from my husband 's attorney , telling me that , by Mr. Hartright 's directions , the house I had vacated would not be let , but remain always ready for my occupancy . Also he informed me that be held property in trust for me to an amount which I knew covered more than half poor Fred 's fortune . This letter touched me profoundly . Fred had been so generous to me in spite of my coldness . Of course I should never occupy the house nor use the money , but it moved me to the heart to see what his care had been for me to the last . After a year had passed my mother was taken suddenly ill . Then , for a few weeks , I went home , and came back again in mourning clothes , with a new sorrow , an added sense of desolation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful my grandmother was . I found rest and strength leaning on her great strong heart . For her sake I struggled for cheerfulness , and learned still to find some interest in life . When Fred had been gone two years a letter came from Charley Forsyth , the cousin he had joined in California , to tell me of his death . They had been up into the Indian region , Charley , and Fred , and two others , on a business expedition . They had been attacked by a party of hostile Indians of more than twice their own number . For a while they tried to resist and defend their property ; but being overpowered at length , Forsyth and one of his companions had escaped , leaving dead upon the field Fred and the other . By the tone of the letter , the pity , the tender sympathy it breathed for me , I knew that Fred had kept our secrets , and that Charley never dreamed that his going to California had been brought about by any alienation from me. lie had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had loved me , and he was gone . Now , indeed , my heart smote me . Now I would have given worlds to have recalled the obstinacy of that last miserable week . Now if I could but have gone to his side and whispered , " Stay . " But he would never wait again for word of mine . Those thirsty , far-off sands had drank his blood . Savage eyes had glared into his dying face ; no friend , not one , had whispered a prayer on which his parting soul could rise toward heaven . It was not love I felt for him even then , not the surging , passionate overflow of a woman 's heart that I could have given him ; but I was melted with a sorrow* so intense , a pity so profound , that I would have laid down all the rest of my life only to have spoken one tender word which he could hear . Day and night , without sleep or rest , I mourned for him , sorrowed over the pitiable , irremediable past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he loved me as no one would ever love me again ; and I blamed the poor requital I had made him for all the pain there had been in our lives . In this passion of self-reproachful sorrow my grandmother strove after a while to comfort me . She let me grieve unreproved at first , for she knew that wild rush of misery must have its way . Then she tried to persuade me to see God 's hand in all , to believe that He knew how it would be from the foundation of the world ; that it was His will , and in some way , in the midst of sorrow and darkness , I-us work was going on , making our souls ready for the eternal morning . Perhaps Fred had drawn nearer to Him in loneliness and sorrow than he would ever have done in joy ; and if human love and human help were far from him in his hour of peril the Divine arm had held him up . How was it that , wise and tender as her words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so empty to my longing ? They seemed not to touch me . I listened in my dumb sorrow as one who heard not . Of course my bereavement was generally known . The estrangement between me and // qwq divorces were wicked ? Were they wrong for others , and right for you and me His face grew pale . He looked at me helplessly-almost hopelessly . " I do n't know , Margery . I have said divorces , save for the one cause God 's law mentions , were a sin . But I may have judged wrongly . It seems tdme now that I did . I can not think any other wrong so great as for a man and a woman voluntarily to give up the pure joy which is every soul 's birth-right-blight their lives-their power of being good or happy . God help me , Margery ! I do n't know where I am . " " Go home , " I said ; " go now , and ask Heaven for counsel . Come to me in the morning , and tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover , you are also my minister-God 's messenger ; and that you will have to answer before Him for the way you guide any soul which lays its life in your hands . " Without another word he turned away . I listened to his footsteps going slowly and sadly back over the path along which they had come with such eager joy . Then I went in , and kneeling by my grandmother 's side I told her my story . When I had told all , I said , " Grandmother , must I give up Hugh ? What is right ? " " For the woman which hath an husband is houtid by the law to her husband so long as he liveth . ' " Solemnly through the twilight shadows fell her voice , saying slowly those words from the book which to her was sole authority in all vexed questions , all doubtful issues . I was answered . I only sobbed , half unconsciously , from the depths of my desolation , " Itis so hard ! " And then I felt on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drew me close into her pitying arms she whispered , " It is the Lord 's doing , and He doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men . " With the morning came Hugh . When I saw his pale , resolved fitee I knew what that night 's vigil had taught him . I told him the question I had asked grandmother , and the words of authority in which she had answered He looked at me with eyes full of an unfathomable misery . " She is right , Margery . Since Frederick lLrtright lives he is your husband . I have no right to urge you to set aside your marriage vow . I will never dare again to say what is wrong fpr another ; but for us , let us choose the safe side . Better to be parted here than *o buy this world 's happiness with the sacrifice of God 's peace. ** How could I describe our parting-we who had so nearly been made one flesh ? What last words we spoke ; what hopes shone , star-like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly , where the broken threads of this imperfect life shall be woven again into brightness ; and , through it all , how he upheld me , strengthened my soul for the conflict-it is all written upon my heart , where only the pitying eyes of the merciful Father can ever read . Let me pass briefly over the agony of that hour . In two weeks Hugh had resigned his parish and left Woodstock . His reasons no one knew ; but , reluctant as were his people to part with him , they found his resolution unalterable . He went , and even I knew nothing of his destination . We felt it right to separate utterly , to bridge the gulf between us with no knowledge . I never expected to hear from him again . I knew I should not die . I expected to live , and I knew my one duty was to forget . For him , he had his work in life , and I believed he would do it . He might live till he was old and gray , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that I should know him , despite all the scars and changes of his life , when we should meet in the far " Silent Land-  --  the boundless regions of all perfection . " I was unutterably thankful when he was gone . It seemed to me that I could not have borne my fate if he had staid where I must see him , hear his voice , breathe the same air . He being gone , there was more hope . I could bury the two years I had known him in my heart ; and in time kind Heaven might lend me aid to set a watch upon memory , and roll a stone to the door of my sepulchre . Charley Forsyth did not come back . Some business call hurried him away to California , and no one in Woodstock , save my grandmother , kuew the secret he had told me-knew that my husband was alive in this world . On Christmas there came . to me a letter . Eight years ago that day I had spoken my bridal vows . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very day . I knew the moment I looked at the cover that it was from Fred . My heart beat suffocatingly . My hand trembled so I could hardly break the seal ; but somehow I had strength to read its contents . It almost broke my heart , it was so touching , so penitent . I had been as much to blame in the past as he , but he took all the blame to himself . He told me how well he had loved me , and how hard he had tried , for the sake of my peace , to live away from me . He had been silent , he said , until it seemed to him the burden of his misery was greater than he could bear . Perhaps he should still have kept silence , for my sake , if he had not known that I would hear from Forsyth that he was 0 alive . He was hungry and thirsty for my love ; it was the only hope earth held for him . Still , until he heard from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I had thought him dead ; perhaps , so thinking , I had formed some new tie . If so , I need not write to tell him . Not hearing from me , he would know his fate , and bear it in silence . But if I was still his wife-if I could give him any hope-write , and he would come to try anamake what amends he could for the errors of years ago . How doubly thankful I was when I had read that letter that Hugh was gone-that Charley Forsyth had saved me from the sin I had been // so near unconsciously committing . A love entered into my soul for Fred , deep and tender beyond words ; not such a love as I could have given Hugh Walden , but a tenderness pure and passionless , heightened by remorse , intensified by pity . I wrote him only these words : " Eight years ago to-day I became your wife . I am your wife stilL Come . " When I showed my grandmother his letter and my answer she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You have done right , child . ' That is your work in. life . God will help and strengthen you to make Fred happy . " With the spring he came . His wounds and exposures , his desolate , uncared-for life , had told on him fearfully . His face reta*ined few traces of its once fascinating charm . ' A worn , prematurely old man he came back to me , and I gave him welcome . I had resolved , in the strength of God , that no coldness of mine should ever chill him : he should never be disappointed in me . Whatever pain my life held I would bear alone ; and the remnant of his years I would make happy . There was something strangely touching in the change which had been wrought in him . The passionate temper , the haughty , indomitable will , where were they ? Sometimes I longed to see him assert himself with a little of the old domineering sway ; but it never came . When I expressed my desire to continue to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Kempton , which had remained unoccupied ever since he went away . An 'd so we lived on together quietly for two years , we three . I think I did make Fred 's life happy . I do not think he missed any thing from my love . Do you ask if my own lot was *vretched ? I think nothing but willful sin can utterly darken my life . There was one fountain in my nature , the purest and sweetest perhaps , sealed up . Never more would its bright waters leap and sparkle in the sunshine . But there was much left to enjoy . It is impossible to be quite miserable while one works unselfishly for others . My grandmother was growing feeble , and I found occupation enough in nursing her and attending to Fred . I had no time for profitless musings . There came a night at last when I was summoned by a sharp , sudden cry of pain . It broke through the stillness of my first slumbers , and I sprang up and hurried to my grandmother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill , and dispatched Fred for a physician . A few days followed of intense suffering , borne with saintly patience . Just at the last she was a little easier . I sat by her side , and she beckoned me to place my ear to her lips . Faintly she whispered , " You have done right . Be good to Fred , and God will be good to you . " Those were her last words , her benediction , her farewell . The long-suffering soul was at peace . The willing hands would do no more work for God or man . The kindly heart had throbbed with its last impulse of human charity . She could rest now . I think Fred mourned for her almost as sincerely as I did . At any rate he sympathized most tenderly with my sorrow . I redoubled my devotion to him , now that I had no one else to care for . And there was need of it ; for month by month I saw that he was wasting away . His desolate years had done their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pangs of remorse I watched him ! How gladly I would have-laid down my life to save his ! I never could forget that I had refused to ask him to stay when he had waited for my bidding , and I knew how much that obstinacy had cost us both . Sometimes , at his expressions of affection , I felt such a torturing sense of unworthiness as I could hardly bear . Through all he had been faithful to me-had loved me entirely . Sometimes it seemed to me that the only . ease for my heart must he to pour it out at his feetas if I must tell kim all that I had felt or die . Then it seemed to me that would be but another form of selfishness . To tell him that I had loved another would.be to put it out of my power to make him happy . For the sake of easing my own heart I had no right to lay its burden on him . The least I could do was to leave him the happiness of believing in my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I was able to comfort him to the last . All through the months of his slow decline I watched ' by his side . It was pitiful to see how he clung to me . It seemed to be the one agony , which nothing could soothe away , that he must leave me . Looking into my face with those great , mournful eyes , full of unutterable meaning , he would break the silence with his longing cry : " Oh , if you could only go with me , Margery ! How shall I live again without you ? I have known what that is . " I tried to lead him to the higher love that could never fail him ; but still he clung to me until the very last hour of his life . Did he see in that final hour some strange , soul-subduing glimpse of the heavenly glory ? Who can tell ? I only know that with a new light breaking sealike and radiant into his eyes he cried : " Margery , I am going from you to Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fullness of joy . Margery , wife , darling , His hands are outstretched-I have no fear . Kiss me now . Let me carry your kiss where I am going . " I bent over him , and pressed my lips to his in a passion of love and woe . Just then how dear he was ! It seemed to me I could not give him up . I would have held him back from death in my arms , or died for him . But God took him . Even then , with my kiss thrilling on his lips , my arms clinging to him , his soul went out-into the infinite spaces . A strange peace came to me as he lay there dead . I felt as certain as of my own existence that he knew all now-held the secret I had kept from him for his own sake only , and had forgiven me . The smile , that last sweetest smile // of all , frozen upon his dead lips , calmed me and comforted me , almost as if I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read my heart now , he must have known with what late tenderness it was swelling . He was my hushand . He had loved me well and faithfully , and he was dead . Did not every claim he had upon my love assert itself ? Did I fail to re* member his generosity when he left me-his changeless constancy through all those years of separation , his patient tenderness since ? On his grave I planted roses and violets . To me it was a shrine . I went there for my holiest communings with the world where he was . Six months after he left me there came a packet directed in an unfamiliar hand . It was postmarked at a Western city . I broke it open , and saw a letter directed to me in Hugh Walden 's writing , and with it a notice of his death , and a few lines in the stranger hand tellitig me bow he died . In his ministrations among the sick he had taken a malignant fever , and in three days after first sending for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his papers , with a request that it should be sent to me . A few more lines there werea tribute to his usefulness and self-sacrificing devotion , a lament for his loss . Then I opened his letter . It was as of his soul spoke again to mine when I read it : " Margery , I should not write you these words did I not know that your husband is dead , and that your hearing from me once more can give pain to no mortaL You have never heard from me in the long silent years which have fallen betwixt us ; but I have found means to inform myself , from time to time , of your welfare . I know that you have done your duty in God 's fear . " When I heard that you were free , a fond sweet hope stole into my heart-Heaven forgive me if it was sin-of some day standing once more by your side , looking again into your eyes , hea'ing again your well-loved voice . I know the sad years have changed yen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is silver in your hair . I think you would not have been less beautiful to me if I had lived to come to you . But God knew best . I was doing His work when I breathed in this fever that is killing me . There is no hope . When I have finished this letter I shall send for a physician . I would not send for one before lest he should forbid these last words to you . But I kuowl shall never get well . I pray only for strength to write a few lines more . " I am not sorry to be called home . God judges right . 1 dare not , if I could , choose even the joy of life with you before the blessedness of His rest . And yet , Margery , my heart clings to you . With this fever burning in my veins , swimming in my head , I can not say what I would . Only this , darling , in this hour of uttermost peril , when very soon my soul will stand before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a little life , this one of toil and waiting  --  the life comes after that will never end . Since I left you I have striven to do God 's work among the sick and needy-His poor children . You have done it too , in your way ; and now for me is the end , the rest-fot ' you , waiting . But not for long , not long . Soon for you , too , will the light break over the eternal mountains . It grows dark-my sight is dim Margery , my sours Margery , good-by " The last lines were written in a cramped , irregular hand , as by one who could not see . Do you think I can tell you how I felt as I read them ? Is there any language which translates heart-beats ? I recognized God 's hand , and I was content that so that beloved life should end . In this world I could never see him again . Hand to hand , lip to lip , we should never meet more . I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me the promise of his last words . For me , too , should break the dawn-light over the eternal nlountains . A blessedness not of earth , and which the world could not take away , was in the thought that I had not sold my birthright for a bess of pottage . I had yet a right to look upward . They are both dead ! One here , with the roses and violets on his grave , and tender tears to quicken them into beauty . The other far away , in a resting-place fashioned by stranger hands , where my steps can never go , or my tears fall . Both dead ! and I sit among the shadows and wait for my ihorning ; but my hope is sure .
