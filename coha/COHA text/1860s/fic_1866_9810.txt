BUT that Solomon is out of fashion I should quote him , here and now , to the effect that there is a time for all things ; but Solomon is obsolete , and never , no , never , will I dare to quote a dead language , " for raisons I have , " as the exiles of Erin say . Yet , in spite of Solomon and Horace , I may express my own less concise opinion , that even in hard times , and dull times , and war times , there is yet a little time to laugh , a brief hour to smile and love and pity , just as through this dreary easterly storm , bringing clouds and rain , sobbing against casement and door with the inarticulate wail of tempests , there comes now and then the soft shine of a sun behind it all , a fleeting glitter , an evanescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a story that is nowise tragic , nor fitted to " the fashion of these times , " possibly somebody will say at its end that I should also have apologized for its subject , since it is as easy for an author to treat his readers to high themes as vulgar ones , and velvet can be thrown into a portrait as cheaply as calico ; but of this apology I wash my hands . I believe nothing in place or circumstance makes romance . I have the same quick sympathy for Biddy 's sorrows with Patrick that I have for the Empress of France and her august , but rather grim lord and master . I think words are often no harder to bear than " a blue bating , " and I have a reverence for poor old maids as great as for the nine Muses . Commonplace people are only commonplace from character , and no position affects that . So forgive me once more , patient reader , if I offer to you no tragedy in high life , no sentimental history of fashion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could not be a heroine . Miss Lucinda Jane Ann Manners was a lady of unknown age , who lived in a place I call Dalton , in a State of these Disuniting States , which I do not mention for good cause . I have already had so many unconscious personalities visited on my devoted head , that but for lucidity I should never mention persons or places , inconvenient as it would be . However , Miss Lucinda did live , and lived by the aid of " means , " which , in the vernacular , is money . Not a great deal , it is true ,  --  five thousand dollars at lawful interest , and a little wooden house , do not imply many luxuries even to a single-woman ; and it is also true that a little fine sewing taken in helped Miss Manners to provide herself with a few small indulgences otherwise beyond her reach . She had one or two idiosyncrasies , as they are politely called , that were her delight . Plenty of dish-towels were necessary to her peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy ; and Tricopherous was essential to her well-being : indeed , she often said she would rather give up coffee than Tricopherous , for her hair was black and wiry and curly , and caps she abhorred , so that of a winter 's day her head presented the most irrelevant and volatile aspect , each particular hair taking a twist on its own responsibility , and improvising a wild halo about her unsaintly face , unless subdued into propriety by the aforesaid fluid . I said Miss Lucinda 's face was unsaintly ,  --  I mean un like ancient saints as depicted by contemporary artists : modern and private saints are after another fashion . I met one yesterday , whose green eyes , great nose , thick lips , and sallow wrinkles , under a bonnet of fifteen years ' standing , further clothed upon by a scant merino cloak and cat-skin tippet , would have cut a sorry figure in the gallery of the Vatican or the Louvre , and put the tranquil Madonna of San Sisto into a state of stunning antithesis ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my saint , I am glad of it ! No , there was nothing sublime and dolorous about Miss Manners ; her face was round , cheery , and slightly puckered , with two little black eyes sparking and shining under dark brows , a nose she unblushingly called pug , and a big mouth with eminently white and regular teeth , which she said were such a comfort , for they never ached , and never would to the end of time . Add to this physiognomy a small and rather spare figure , dressed in the cleanest of calicoes , always made in one style , and rigidly scorning hoops ,  --  without a symptom of a collar , in whose place ( or it may be over which ) she wore a white cambric handkerchief , knotted about her throat , and the two ends brought into subjection by means of a little angular-headed gold pin , her sole ornament , and a relic of her old father 's days of widowhood , when buttons were precarious tenures . So much for her aspect . Her character was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman , one of the old school , the last whose breeches and knee-buckles adorned the profession , who never " outlived his usefulness , " nor lost his godly simplicity . Parson Manners held rule over an obscure and quiet village in the wilds of Vermont , where hard-handed farmers wrestled with rocks and forests for their daily bread , and looked forward to heaven as a land of green pastures and still waters , where agriculture should be a pastime , and winter impossible . Heavy freshets from the mountains that swelled their rushing brooks into annual torrents , and snow-drifts that covered five-rail fences a foot above the posts and blocked up the turnpike-road for weeks , caused this congregation fully to appreciate Parson Manners 's favorite hymns ,  --  " There is a land of pure delight , " and  --  " On Jordan 's stormy banks I stand . " Indeed , one irreverent , but " pretty smart feller , " who lived on the top of a hill known as Drift Hill , where certain adventurous farmers dwelt for the sake of its smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon by Parson Manners about the seven-times heated furnaces of judgment reserved for the wicked , that " Parson had n't better try to skeer Drift-Hillers with a hot place ; ' t would n't more ' n jest warm ' em through down there , after a real snappin ' winter . " In this out-of-the-way nook was Lucinda Jane Ann born and bred . Her mother was like her in many things ,  --  just such a cheery , round-faced little body , but with no more mind than found ample scope for itself in superintending the affairs of house and farm , and vigorously " seeing to " her husband and child . So , while Mrs. Manners baked , and washed , and ironed , and sewed , and knit , and set the sweetest example of quiet goodness and industry to all her flock , without knowing she could set an example , or be followed as one , the Parson amused himself , between sermons of powerful doctrine and parochial duties of a more human interest , with educating Lucinda , whose intellect was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training it was for a young girl ,  --  mathematics , metaphysics , Latin , theology of the driest sort ; and after an utter failure at Greek and Hebrew , though she had toiled patiently through seven books of the " neid , " Parson Manners mildly sniffed at the inferiority of the female mind , and betook himself to teaching her French , which she learned rapidly , and spoke with a pure American accent , perhaps as pleasing to a Parisian ear as the hiss of Piedmont or the gutturals of Switzerland . Moreover , the minister had been brought up , himself , in the most scrupulous refinement of manner ; his mother was a widow , the last of an " old family , " and her dainty , delicate observances were inbred , as it were , in her only son . This sort of elegance is perhaps the most delicate test of training and descent , and all these things Lucinda was taught from the grateful recollection of a son who never forgot his mother , through all the solitary labors and studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , after her mother died , Lucinda grew more and more like her father , and , as she became a woman , these rare refinements separated her more and more from those about her , and made her necessarily solitary . As for marriage , the possibility of such a thing never crossed her mind ; there was not a man in the parish who did not offend her sense of propriety and shock her taste , whenever she met one ; and though her warm , kind heart made her a blessing to the poor and sick , her mother was yet bitterly regretted at quiltings and tea-drinkings , where she had been so " sociable-like . " It is rather unfortunate for such a position as Lucinda 's , that , as Deacon Stowell one day remarked to her father , " Natur ' will be Natur ' as much on Drift Hill as down to Bosting " ; and when she began to feel that " strong necessity of loving " that sooner or later assails every woman 's heart , there was nothing for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share . Now Lucinda loved the Parson most devoutly . Ever since the time when she could just remember watching through the dusk his white stockings , as they glimmered across the road to evening-meeting , and looked like a supernatural pair of legs taking a walk on their own responsibility , twilight concealing the black breeches and coat from mortal view , Lucinda had regarded her father with a certain pleasing awe . His long abstractions , his profound knowledge , his grave , benign manners , and the thousand daily refinements of speech and act that seemed to put him far above the sphere of his pastorate ,  --  all these things inspired as much reverence as affection ; and when she wished with all her heart and soul she had a sister or a brother to tend and kiss and pet , it never once occurred to her that any of those tender familiarities could be expended on her father : she would as soon have thought of caressing any of the goodly angels whose stout legs , flowing curls , and impossible draperies sprawled among the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much by their garments as their turkey-wings and brandishing arms . So she betook herself to pets , and growing up to the old-maidenhood of thirty-five before her father fell asleep , was by that time the centre of a little world of her own ,  --  hens , chickens , squirrels , cats , dogs , lambs , and sundry transient guests of stranger kind ; so that , when she left her old home , and removed to the little house in Dalton that had been left her by her mother 's aunt , and had found her small property safely invested by means of an old friend of her father 's , Miss Manners made one more journey to Vermont to bring in safety to their future dwelling a cat and three kittens , an old blind crow , a yellow dog of the true cur breed , and a rooster with three hens , " real creepers , " as she often said , " none of your long-legged , screaming creatures . " Lucinda missed her father , and mourned him as constantly and faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cheerful and buoyant than his , and when once she was quietly settled in her little house , her garden and her pets gave her such full occupation that she sometimes blamed herself for not feeling more lonely and unhappy . A little longer life or a little more experience would have taught her better : power to be happy is the last thing to regret . Besides , it would have been hard to be cheerless in that sunny little house , with its queer old furniture of three-legged tables , high-backed chairs , and chintz curtains where red mandarins winked at blue pagodas on a deep-yellow ground , and birds of insane ornithology pecked at insects that never could have been hatched , or perched themselves on blossoms totally unknown to any mortal flora . Old engravings of Bartolozzi , from the stiff elegances of Angelica Kaufman and the mythologies of Reynolds , adorned the shelf ; and the carpet in the parlor was of veritable English make , older than Lucinda herself , but as bright in its fading and as firm in its usefulness as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white dimity , and rush-bottomed chairs stood in each window , with a strip of the same old carpet by either bedside ; and in the kitchen the blue settle that had stood by the Vermont fireside now defended this lesser hearth from the draught of the door , and held under the seat thereof sundry ironing-sheets , the blanket belonging to them , and good store of ticking and worsted holders . A half-gone set of egg-shell china stood in the parlor-closet ,  --  cups , and teapot , and sugar-bowl , rimmed with brown and gold in a square pattern , and a shield without blazon on the side ; the quaint tea-caddy with its stopper stood over against the pursy little cream-pot , and held up in its lumps of sparkling sugar the oddest sugar-tongs , also a family relic ;  --  beside this , six small spoons , three large ones , and a little silver porringer comprised all the " plate " belonging to Miss Manners , so that no fear of burglars haunted her , and but for her pets she would have lived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast exception ; in her life her pets were the great item now ;  --  her cat had its own chair in the parlor and kitchen ; her dog , a rug and a basket never to be meddled with by man or beast ; her old crow , its special nest of flannel and cotton , where it feebly croaked as soon as Miss Lucinda began to spread the little table for her meals ; and the three kittens had their own playthings and their own saucer as punctiliously as if they had been children . In fact , Miss Manners had a greater share of kindness for beasts than for mankind . A strange compound of learning and unworldliness , of queer simplicity , native penetration , and common sense , she had read enough books to despise human nature as it develops itself in history and theology , and she had not known enough people to love it in its personal development . She had a general idea that all men were liars , and that she must be on her guard against their propensity to cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the truth , in her good father 's over-anxiety to defend her from the snares of evil men after his death , his teachings had given her opinion this bias , and he had forgotten to tell her how kindly and how true he had found many of his own parishioners , how few inclined to harm or pain him . So Miss Lucinda made her entrance into life at Dalton , distrustful , but not suspicious ; and after a few attempts on the part of the women who were her neighbors to be friendly or intimate , they gave her up as impracticable : not because she was impolite or unkind : they did not themselves know why they failed , though she could have told them ; for , old maid as she was , poor and plain and queer , she could not bring herself to associate familiarly with people who put their teaspoons into the sugar-bowl , helped themselves with their own knives and forks , gathered up bits of uneaten butter and returned them to the plate for next time , or replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the knives they had just introduced into their mouths . Miss Lucinda 's code of minor morals would have forbidden her to drink from the same cup with a queen , and have considered a pitchfork as suitable as a knife to eat with , nor would she have offered to a servant the least thing she had touched with her own lips or her own implements of eating ; and she was too delicately bred to look on in comfort where such things were practised . Of course these women were not ladies ; and though many of them had kind hearts and warm impulses of goodness , yet that did not make up to her for their social misdemeanors , and she drew herself more into her own little shell , and cared more for her garden and her chickens , her cats and her dog , than for all the humanity of Dalton put together . Miss Manners held her flowers next dearest to her pets , and treated them accordingly . Her garden was the most brilliant bit of ground possible . It was big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a solitary egg-plum ; while under these fruitful boughs bloomed mossroses in profusion , of the dear old-fashioned kind , every deep pink bud with its clinging garment of green breathing out the richest odor ; close by , the real white rose , which fashion has banished to country towns , unfolded its cups of pearl flushed with yellow sunrise to the heart ; and by its side its damask sister waved long sprays of bloom and perfume . Tulips , dark-purple and cream-color , burning scarlet and deep-maroon , held their gay chalices up to catch the dew ; hyacinths , blue , white , and pink , hung heavy bells beneath them ; spiced carnations of rose and garnet crowded their bed in July and August , heart's-ease fringed the walks , May honeysuckles clambered over the board-fence , and monthly honeysuckles overgrew the porch at the back-door , making perpetual fragrance from their moth-like horns of crimson and ivory . Nothing inhabited those beds that was not sweet and fair and old-fashioned . Gray-lavender-bushes sent up purple spikes in the middle of the garden and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender plants admitted , and they pleaded their own cause in the breath of the linen-press and the bureau-drawers that held Miss Lucinda 's clothes . Beyond the flowers , utility blossomed in a row of bean-poles , a hedge of currant-bushes against the farther fence , carefully tended cauliflowers , and onions enough to tell of their use as sparing as their number ; a few deep-red beets and golden carrots were all the vegetables beside : Miss Lucinda never ate potatoes or pork . Her housekeeping , but for her pets , would have been the proper housewifery for a fairy . Out of her fruit she annually conserved miracles of flavor and transparence ,  --  great plums like those in Aladdin 's garden , of shining topaz ,  --  peaches tinged with the odorous bitter of their pits , and clear as amber ,  --  crimson crabs floating in their own ruby sirup , or transmuted into jelly crystal clear , yet breaking with a grain ,  --  and jelly from the acid currants to garnish her dinner-table or refresh the fevered lips of a sick neighbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all these " lucent sirops " stood in tempting array ,  --  where spices , and sugar , and tea , in their small jars , flanked the sweetmeats , and a jar of glass showed its store of whitest honey , and another stood filled with crisp cakes . Here always a loaf or two of home-made bread lay rolled in a snowy cloth , and another was spread over a dish of butter ; pies were not in favor here ,  --  nor milk , save for the cats ; salt fish Miss Manners never could abide ,  --  her savory taste allowed only a bit of rich old cheese , or thin scraps of hung beef , with her bread and butter ; sauces and spices were few in her repertory , but she cooked as only a lady can cook , and might have asked Soyer himself to dinner . For , verily , after much meditation and experience , I have divined that it takes as much sense and refinement and talent to cook a dinner , wash and wipe a dish , make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room as it should be dusted , as goes to the writing of a novel or shining in high society . But because Miss Lucinda Manners was reserved and " unsociable , " as the neighbors pronounced her , I did not , therefore , mean to imply that she was inhuman . No neighbor of hers , local or Scriptural , fell ill , without an immediate offer of aid from her : she made the best gruel known to Dalton invalids , sent the ripest fruit and the sweetest flowers : and if she could not watch with the sick , because it interfered with her duties at home in an unpleasant and inconvenient way , she would sit with them hour after hour in the day-time , and wait on all their caprices with the patient tenderness of a mother . Children she always eyed with strange wistfulness , as if she longed to kiss them , but did n't know how ; yet no child was ever invited across her threshold , for the yellow cur hated to be played with , and children always torment kittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the middle ages . One after another of her pets passed away and was replaced , the yellow cur barked his last currish signal , the cat died and her kittens came to various ends of time or casualty , the crow fell away to dust and was too old to stuff , and the garden bloomed and faded ten times over , before Miss Manners found herself to be forty-six years old , which she heroically acknowledged one fine day to the census-taker . But it was not this consciousness , nor its confession , that drew the dark brows so low over Miss Lucinda 's eyes that day ; it was quite another trouble , and one that wore heavily on her mind , as we shall proceed to explain . For Miss Manners , being , like all the rest of her sex , quite unable to do without some masculine help , had employed , for some seven years , an old man by the name of Israel Slater , to do her " chores , " as the vernacular hath it . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots of Women 's Rights terribly sharp blows , but I must even own it , that one might as well try to live without one 's bread-and-butter as without the aid of the dominant sex . When I see women split wood , unload coal-carts , move wash-tubs , and roll barrels of flour and apples handily down cellar-ways or up into carts , then I shall believe in the sublime theories of the strong-minded sisters ; but as long as I see before me my own forlorn little hands , and sit down on the top stair to recover breath , and try in vain to lift the water-pitcher at table , just so long I shall be glad and thankful that there are men in the world , and that half a dozen of them are my kindest and best friends . It was rather an affliction to Miss Lucinda to feel this innate dependence , and at first she resolved to employ only small boys , and never any one of them more than a week or two . She had an unshaped theory that an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man would cheat and domineer over her . Experience sadly put to flight these notions ; for a succession of boys in this cabinet-ministry for the first three years of her stay in Dalton would have driven her into a Presbyterian convent , had there been one at hand . Boy Number One caught the yellow cur out of bounds one day , and shaved his plumy tail to a bare stick , and Miss Lucinda fairly shed tears of grief and rage when Pink appeared at the door with the denuded appendage tucked between his little legs , and his funny yellow eyes casting sidelong looks of apprehension at his mistress . Boy Number One was despatched directly . Number Two did pretty well for a month , but his integrity and his appetite conflicted , and Miss Lucinda found him one moonlight night perched in her plum-tree devouring the half-ripe fruit . She shook him down with as little ceremony as if he had been an apple ; and though he lay at Death 's door for a week with resulting cholera-morbus , she relented not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties that numbered in it fatal accidents to three kittens , two hens and a rooster , and at last Pink himself , who was sent into a decline by repeated drenchings from the watering-pot , put an end to her forbearance , and she instituted in her viziership the old man who had now kept his office so long ,  --  a queer , withered , slow , humorous old creature , who did " chores " for some six or seven other households , and got a living by sundry " jobs " of wood-sawing , hoeing corn , and other like works of labor , if not of skill . Israel was a great comfort to Miss Lucinda : he was efficient counsel in the maladies of all her pets , had a sovereign cure for the gapes in chickens , and could stop a cat 's fit with the greatest ease ; he kept the tiny garden in perfect order , and was very honest , and Miss Manners favored him accordingly . She compounded liniment for his rheumatism , herb-sirup for his colds , presented him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comforter ; so that Israel expressed himself strongly in favor of " Miss Lucindy , " and she said to herself he really was " quite good for a man . " But just now , in her forty-seventh year , Miss Lucinda had come to grief , and all on account of Israel and his attempts to please her . About six months before this census-taking era , the old man had stepped into Miss Manners 's kitchen with an unusual radiance on his wrinkles and in his eyes , and began without his usual morning greeting ,  --  " I ' ve got so'thin ' for you naow , Miss Lucindy . You ' re a master-hand for pets , but I ' ll bet a red cent you ha' n't an idee what I ' ve got for ye naow ! " " I ' m sure I ca n't tell , Israel , " said she ; " you ' ll have to let me see it . " " Well , " said he , lifting up his coat and looking carefully behind him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitten or chicken should preoccupy the bench , " you see I was down to Orrin 's abaout a week back , and he hed a litter o ' pigs ,  --  eleven on ' em . Well , he could n't raise the hull on ' em ,  --  ' t a' n't good to raise more ' n nine ,  --  an ' so he said , ef I ' d ' a ' had a place o ' my own , I could ' a ' had one on ' em , but , as ' t was , he guessed he ' d hev to send one to market for a roaster . I went daown to the barn to see ' em , an ' there was one , the cutest little critter I ever sot eyes on , and I ' ve seen more ' n four pigs in my day ,  --  ' t was a little black-spotted one , as spry as an ant , and the dreffullest knowin ' look out of its eyes ! I fellowshipped it right off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' ll let me hev that ' ere little spotted feller , I ' ll git a place for him , for I do take to him consarnedly . ' So he said I could , and I fetched him hum , and Miss Slater and me we kinder fed him up for a few days back , till he got sorter wonted , and I ' m a-goin ' to fetch him to you . " " But , Israel , I have n't any place to put him in . " " Well , that a' n't nothin ' to hender . I ' ll jest fetch out them old boards out of the wood-shed , and knock up a little sty right off , daown by the end o ' the shed , and you ken keep your swill that I ' ve hed before , and it ' ll come handy . " " But pigs are so dirty ! " " I do n't know as they be ; they ha' n't no great conveniences for washin ' ginerally ; but I never heerd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run wild . An ' beside , that a' n't goin ' to hender , nuther ; I calculate to make it one o ' the chores to take keer of him ; ' t wo n't cost no more to you ; and I ha' n't no great opportunities to do things for folks that ' s allers a-doin ' for me ; so ' t you need n't be afeard , Miss Lucindy : I love to . " Miss Lucinda 's heart got the better of her judgment . A nature that could feel so tenderly for its inferiors in the scale could not be deaf to the tiny voices of humanity , when they reached her solitude ; and she thanked Israel for the pig so heartily that the old man 's face brightened still more , and his voice softened from its cracked harshness , as he said , clicking up and down the latch of the back-door ,  --  " Well , I ' m sure you ' re as welcome as you are obleeged , and I ' ll knock up that ' ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  that ' s a fact . " Strange to say ,  --  yet perhaps it might have been expected from her proclivities ,  --  Miss Lucinda took an astonishing fancy to the pig . Very few people know how intelligent an animal a pig is ; but when one is regarded merely as pork and hams , one 's intellect is apt to fall into neglect : a moral sentiment which applies out of Pigdom . This creature would not have passed muster at a county fair ; no Suffolk blood compacted and rounded him ; he belonged to the " racers , " and skipped about his pen with the alacrity of a large flea , wiggling his curly tail as expressively as a dog 's , and " all but speakin ' , " as Israel said . He was always glad to see Miss Lucinda , and established a firm friendship with her dog Fun , a pretty , sentimental , German spaniel . Besides , he kept tolerably clean by dint of Israel 's care , and thrust his long nose between the rails of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beet-tops , with a knowing look out of his deep-set eyes that was never to be resisted by the soft-hearted spinster . Indeed , Miss Lucinda enjoyed the possession of one pet who could not tyrannize over her . Pink 's place was more than filled by Fun , who was so oppressively affectionate that he never could leave his mistress alone . If she lay down on her bed , he leaped up and unlatched the door , and stretched himself on the white counterpane beside her with a grunt of satisfaction ; if she sat down to knit or sew , he laid his head and shoulders across her lap , or curled himself up on her knees ; if she was cooking , he whined and coaxed round her till she hardly knew whether she fried or broiled her steak ; and if she turned him out and buttoned the door , his cries were so pitiful she could never be resolute enough to keep him in exile five minutes ,  --  for it was a prominent article in her creed , that animals have feelings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with men , only incapable of expression . Indeed , Miss Lucinda considered it the duty of human beings to atone to animals for the Lord 's injustice in making them dumb and four-legged . She would have been rather startled at such an enunciation of her practice , but she was devoted to it as a practice : she would give her own chair to the cat and sit on the settle herself ; get up at midnight , if a mew or a bark called her , though the thermometer was below zero ; the tenderloin of her steak or the liver of her chicken was saved for a pining kitten or an ancient and toothless cat ; and no disease or wound daunted her faithful nursing , or disgusted her devoted tenderness . It was rather hard on humanity , and rather reversive of Providence , that all this care and pains should be lavished on cats and dogs , while little morsels of flesh and blood , ragged , hungry , and immortal , wandered up and down the streets . Perhaps that they were immortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped that her " other-worldliness " accepted that fact as enough to outweigh present pangs , if she had not openly declared , to Israel Slater 's immense amusement and astonishment , that she believed creatures had souls ,  --  little ones perhaps , but souls after all , and she did expect to see Pink again some time or other . " Well , I hope he ' s got his tail feathered out ag'in , " said Israel , dryly . " I do'no ' but what hair ' d grow as well as feathers in a speretooal state , and I never see a pictur ' of an angel but what hed consider'ble many feathers . " Miss Lucinda looked rather confounded . But humanity had one little revenge on her in the shape of her cat , a beautiful Maltese , with great yellow eyes , fur as soft as velvet , and silvery paws as lovely to look at as they were thistly to touch . Toby certainly pleaded hard for Miss Lucinda 's theory of a soul ; but his was no good one : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of intellect , and he used it to the entire subjugation of Miss Lucinda . When he was hungry , he was as well-mannered and as amiable as a good child ,  --  he would coax , and purr , and lick her fingers with his pretty red tongue , like a " perfect love " ; but when he had his fill , and needed no more , then came Miss Lucinda 's time of torment . If she attempted to caress him , he bit and scratched like a young tiger , he sprang at her from the floor and fastened on her arm with real fury ; if he cried at the window and was not directly let in , as soon as he had achieved entrance his first manoeuvre was to dash at her ankles and bite them , if he could , as punishment for her tardiness . This skirmishing was his favorite mode of attack ; if he was turned out of the closet , or off the pillow up stairs , he retreated under the bed and made frantic sallies at her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was in the room made a flying leap as far as she could to her bed , to escape those keen claws . Indeed , old Israel found her more than once sitting in the middle of the kitchen-floor with Toby crouched for a spring under the table , his poor mistress afraid to move , for fear of her unlucky ankles . And this literally cat-ridden woman was hazed about and ruled over by her feline tyrant to that extent that he occupied the easiest chair , the softest cushion , the middle of the bed , and the front of the fire , not only undisturbed , but caressed . This is a veritable history , beloved reader , and I offer it as a warning and an example : if you will be an old maid , or if you ca n't help it , take to petting children , or donkeys , or even a respectable cow , but beware of domestic tyranny in any shape but man 's ! No wonder Miss Lucinda took kindly to the pig , who had a house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the avoidance of all trouble on her part ,  --  the pig who capered for joy when she or Fun approached , and had so much expression in his physiognomy that one almost expected to see him smile . Many a sympathizing conference Miss Lucinda held with Israel over the perfections of Piggy , as he leaned against the sty and looked over at his favorite after this last chore was accomplished . " I say for ' t , " exclaimed the old man , one day , " I b'lieve that cre'tur ' knows enough to be professor in a college . Why , he talks ! he re'lly does : a leetle through his nose , maybe , but no more ' n Dr. Colton allers does ,  --  ' n ' I declare he appears to have abaout as much sense . I never see the equal of him . I thought he ' d ' a ' larfed right out yesterday , when I gin him that mess o ' corn : he got up onto his forelegs on the trough , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' waggled his tail , an ' then he set off an ' capered round till he come bunt up ag'inst the boards . I tell you ,  --  that sorter sobered him ; he gin a growlin ' grunt , an ' shook his ears , an ' looked sideways at me , and then he put to and eet up that corn as sober as a judge . I swan ! he does beat the Dutch ! " But there was one calculation forgotten both by Miss Lucinda and Israel : the pig would grow ,  --  and in consequence , as I said before , Miss Lucinda came to grief ; for when the census-taker tinkled her sharp little door-bell , it called her from a laborious occupation at the sty ,  --  no more and no less than trying to nail up a board that Piggy had torn down in struggling to get out of his durance . He had grown so large that Miss Lucinda was afraid of him ; his long legs and their vivacious motion added to the shrewd intelligence of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little woman as the tusk of a rhinoceros : but what should she do with him ? One might as well have proposed to her to kill and cut up Israel as to consign Piggy to the " fate of race . " She could not turn him into the street to starve , for she loved him ; and the old maid suffered from a constancy that might have made some good man happy , but only embarrassed her with the pig . She could not keep him forever ,  --  that was evident ; she knew enough to be aware that time would increase his disabilities as a pet , and he was an expensive one now ,  --  for the corn-swallowing capacities of a pig , one of the " racer " breed , are almost incredible , and nothing about Miss Lucinda wanted for food even to fatness . Besides , he was getting too big for his pen , and so " cute " an animal could not be debarred from all out-door pleasures , and tantalized by the sight of a green and growing garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partake of its delights . So , when Miss Lucinda indued herself with her brown linen sack and sun-bonnet to go and weed her carrot-patch , she was arrested on the way by a loud grunting and scrambling in Piggy 's quarter , and found to her distress that he had contrived to knock off the upper board from his pen . She had no hammer at hand ; so she seized a large stone that lay near by and pounded at the board till the twice-tinkling bell recalled her to the house , and as soon as she had made confession to the census-taker she went back ,  --  alas , too late ! Piggy had redoubled his efforts , another board had yielded , and he was free ! What a thing freedom is ! how objectionable in practice , how splendid in theory ! More people than Miss Lucinda have been put to their wits ' end when " Hoggie " burst his bonds and became rampant instead of couchant . But he enjoyed it ; he made the tour of the garden on a delightful canter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mistress at once , and regarding her with his small bright eyes as if he would before long taste her and see if she was as crisp as she looked . She retreated forthwith to the shed and caught up a broom with which she courageously charged upon Piggy , and was routed entirely ; for , being no way alarmed by her demonstration , the creature capered directly at her , knocked her down , knocked the broom out of her hand , and capered away again to the young carrot-patch . " O dear ! " said Miss Manners , gathering herself up from the ground ,  --  " if there only was a man here ! " Suddenly she betook herself to her heels ,  --  for the animal looked at her , and stopped eating : that was enough to drive Miss Lucinda off the field . And now , quite desperate , she rushed through the house and out of the frontdoor , actually in search of a man ! Just down the street she saw one . Had she been composed , she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd cap that crowned his iron-gray locks , and the peculiar manner of his walk ; for our little old maid had stumbled upon no less a person than Monsieur Jean Leclerc , the dancing-master of Dalton . Not that this accomplishment was much in vogue in the embryo city ; but still there were a few who liked to fit themselves for firemen 's balls and sleighing-party frolics , and quite a large class of children were learning betimes such graces as children in New England receive more easily than their elders . Monsieur Leclerc had just enough scholars to keep his coat threadbare and restrict him to necessities ; but he lived , and was independent . All this Miss Lucinda was ignorant of ; she only saw a man , and , with the instinct of the sex in trouble or danger , she appealed to him at once . " O , sir ! wo n't you step in and help me ? My pig has got out , and I ca n't catch him , and he is ruining my garden ! " " Madame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assuming the first position . So Monsieur Leclerc followed Miss Manners , and supplied himself with a mop that was hanging in the shed as his best weapon . Dire was the battle between the pig and the Frenchman . They skipped past each other and back again as if they were practising for a cotillon . Piggy had four legs , which gave him a certain advantage ; but the Frenchman had most brain , and in the long run brain gets the better of legs . A weary dance they led each other , but after a while the pet was hemmed in a corner , and Miss Lucinda had run for a rope to tie him , when , just as she returned , the beast made a desperate charge , upset his opponent , and , giving a leap in the wrong direction , to his manifest astonishment , landed in his own sty ! Miss Lucinda 's courage rose ; she forgot her prostrate friend in need , and , running to the pen , caught up hammer and nailbox on her way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger than ever , and then bethought herself to thank the stranger . But there he lay quite still and pale . " Dear me ! " said Miss Manners , " I hope you have n't hurt yourself , sir ? " " I have fear that I am hurt , Madame , " said he , trying to smile . " I can not to move but it pains me . " " Where is it ? Is it your leg or your arm ? Try and move one at a time , " said Miss Lucinda , promptly . The left leg was helpless , it could not answer to the effort , and the stranger lay back on the ground pale with the pain . Miss Lucinda took her lavender-bottle out of her pocket and softly bathed his head and face ; then she took off her sack and folded it up under his head , and put the lavender beside him . She was good at an emergency , and she showed it . " You must lie quite still , " said she ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with help , or your leg will be hurt more . " With that she went away , and presently returned with two strong men and the long shutter of a shop-window . To this extempore litter she carefully moved the Frenchman , and then her neighbors lifted him and carried him into the parlor , where Miss Lucinda 's chintz lounge was already spread with a tight-pinned sheet to receive the poor man , and while her helpers put him to bed she put on her bonnet and ran for the doctor . Doctor Colton did his best for his patient , but pronounced it an impossibility to remove him till the bone should be joined firmly , as a thorough cure was all-essential to his professional prospects . And now , indeed , Miss Lucinda had her hands full . A nurse could not be afforded , but Monsieur Leclerc was added to the list of old Israel 's " chores , " and what other nursing he needed Miss Lucinda was glad to do ; for her kind heart was full of self-reproaches to think it was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mop-handle that had twisted itself across and under his leg , and aided , if not caused , its breakage . So Israel came in four or five times a day to do what he could , and Miss Lucinda played nurse at other times to the best of her ability . Such flavorous gruels and porridges as she concocted ! such tisanes after her guest 's instructions ! such dainty soups , and sweetbreads , and cutlets , served with such neatness ! After his experience of a second-rate boarding-house , Monsieur Leclerc thought himself in a gastronomic paradise . Moreover , these tiny meals were garnished with flowers , which his French taste for color and decoration appreciated : two or three stems of lilies-of-the-valley in their folded green leaves , cool and fragrant ; a moss-rosebud and a spire of purple-gray lavender bound together with ribbon-grass ; or three carnations set in glittering myrtle-sprays , the last acquisition of the garden . Miss Lucinda enjoyed nursing thoroughly , and a kindlier patient no woman ever had . Her bright needle flew faster than ever through the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned , while he told her , in his odd idioms , stories of his life in France , and the curious customs both of society and cuisinerie , with which last he showed a surprising acquaintance . Truth to tell , when Monsieur Leclerc said he had been a member of the Duc de Montmorenci 's household , he withheld the other half of this truth ,  --  that he had been his valet-de-chambre : but it was an hereditary service , and seemed to him as different a thing from common servitude as a peer 's office in the bedchamber differs from a lackey 's . Indeed , Monsieur Leclerc was a gentleman in his own way ,  --  not of blood , but of breeding ; and while he had faithfully served the " aristocrats , " as his father had done before him , he did not limit that service to their prosperity , but in their greatest need descended to menial offices , and forgot that he could dance and ride and fence almost as well as his young master . But a bullet from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hated utterly the democratic rule that had overturned for him both past and future , so he escaped , and came to America , the grand resort of refugees , where he had labored , as he best knew how , for his own support , and kept to himself his disgust at the manners and customs of the barbarians . Now , for the first time , he was at home and happy . Miss Lucinda 's delicate fashions suited him exactly ; he adored her taste for the beautiful , which she was unconscious of ; he enjoyed her cookery , and though he groaned within himself at the amount of debt he was incurring , yet he took courage from her kindness to believe she would not be a hard creditor , and , being naturally cheerful , put aside his anxieties and amused himself as well as her with his stories , his quavering songs , his recipes for pot-au-feu , tisane , and pts , at once economical and savory . Never had a leg of lamb or a piece of roast beef gone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outlive its usefulness , or the gay dances he played on his beloved violin , as soon as he could sit up enough to manage it . Moreover ,  --  I should say mostover , if the word were admissible ,  --  Monsieur Leclerc lifted a great weight before long from Miss Lucinda 's mind . He began by subduing Fun to his proper place by a mild determination that completely won the dog 's heart . " Women and spaniels , " the world knows , " like kicking " ; and though kicks were no part of the good man 's Rareyfaction of Fun , he certainly used a certain amount of coercion , and the dog 's lawful owner admired the skill of the teacher and enjoyed the better manners of the pupil thoroughly ; she could do twice as much sewing now , and never were her nights disturbed by a bark , for the dog crouched by his new friend 's bed in the parlor and lay quiet there . Toby was next undertaken , and proved less amenable to discipline ; he stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but still continued to sally out at Miss Lucinda 's feet , to spring at her caressing hand when he felt ill-humored , and to claw Fun 's patient nose and his approaching paws when his misplaced sentimentality led him to caress the cat ; but after a while a few well-timed slaps administered with vigor cured Toby of his worst tricks , though every blow made Miss Lucinda wince , and almost shook her good opinion of Monsieur Leclerc : for in these long weeks he had wrought out a good opinion of himself in her mind , much to her own surprise ; she could not have believed a man could be so polite , so gentle , so patient , and above all so capable of ruling without tyranny . Miss Lucinda was puzzled . One day , as Monsieur Leclerc was getting better , just able to go about on crutches , Israel came into the kitchen , and Miss Manners went out to see him . She left the door open , and along with the odor of a pot of raspberry-jam scalding over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little house , there came in also the following conversation . " Israel , " said Miss Lucinda , in a hesitating and rather forlorn tone , " I have been thinking ,  --  I do n't know what to do with Piggy . He is quite too big for me to keep . I ' m afraid of him , if he gets out ; and he eats up the garden . " " Well , that is a consider'ble swaller for a pig , Miss Lucindy ; but I b'lieve you ' re abaout right abaout keepin ' on him . He is too big ,  --  that ' s a fact ; but he ' s so like a human cre'tur ' , I ' d jest abaout as lieves slarter Orrin . I declare , I do n't know no more ' n a taown-haouse goose what to do with him ! " " If I gave him away , I suppose he would be fatted and killed , of course ? " " I guess he ' d be killed , likely ; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon undertake to fatten a salt codfish . He ' s one o ' the racers , an ' they ' re as holler as hogsheads : you can fill ' em up to their noses , ef you ' re a mind to spend your corn , and they ' ll caper it all off their bones in twenty-four haours . I b'lieve , ef they was tied neck an ' heels an ' stuffed , they ' d wiggle thin betwixt feedin ' - times . Why , Orrin , he raised nine on ' em , and every darned critter ' s as poor as Job 's turkey , to-day : they a' n't no good . I ' d as lieves ha ' had nine chestnut rails ,  --  an ' a little lieveser , ' cause they do n't eat nothin ' . " " You do n't know of any poor person who ' d like to have a pig , do you ? " said Miss Lucinda , wistfully . " Well , the poorer they was , the quicker they ' d eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat such a razor-back . " " O , I do n't like to think of his being eaten ! I wish he could be got rid of some other way . Do n't you think he might be killed in his sleep , Israel ? " This was a little too much for Israel . An irresistible flicker of laughter twitched his wrinkles and bubbled in his throat . " I think it ' s likely ' t would wake him up , " said he , demurely . " Killin ' ' s killin ' , and a cre'tur ' ca n't sleep over it ' s though ' t was the stomach-ache . I guess he ' d kick some , ef he was asleep ,  --  and screech some , too ! " " Dear me ! " said Miss Lucinda , horrified at the idea . " I wish he could be sent out to run in the woods . Are there any good woods near here , Israel ? " " I do n't know but what he ' d as lieves be slartered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the lots . Besides , there a' n't nobody as I knows of would like a hog to be a-rootin ' round amongst their turnips and young wheat . " " Well , what I shall do with him I do n't know ! " despairingly exclaimed Miss Lucinda . " He was such a dear little thing when you brought him , Israel ! Do you remember how pink his pretty little nose was ,  --  just like a rose-bud ,  --  and how bright his eyes looked , and his cunning legs ? And now he ' s grown so big and fierce ! But I ca n't help liking him , either . " " He ' s a cute critter , that ' s sartain ; but he does too much rootin ' to have a pink nose now , I expect ;  --  there ' s consider'ble on ' t , so I guess it looks as well to have it gray . But I do n't know no more ' n you do what to do abaout it . " " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him ! " exclaimed Miss Lucinda , squeezing her fore-finger with great earnestness , and looking both puzzled and pained . " If Mees Lucinda would pairmit ? " said a voice behind her . She turned round to see Monsieur Leclerc on his crutches , just in the parlor-door . " I shall , Mees , myself dispose of Piggee , if it please . I can . I shall have no sound ; he shall to go away like a silent snow , to trouble you no more , never ! " " O , sir ! if you could ! But I do n't see how ! " " If Mees was to see , it would not be to save her pain . I shall have him to go by magique to fiery land . " Fairy-land , probably ! But Miss Lucinda did not perceive the quivoque . " Nor yet shall I trouble Meester Israyel . I shall have the aid of myself and one good friend that I have ; and some night when you rise of the morning , he shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief . " I am greatly obliged ,  --  I shall be , I mean , " said she . " Well , I ' m glad enough to wash my hands on ' t , " said Israel . " I shall hanker after the critter some , but he ' s a-gettin ' too big to be handy ; ' n ' it ' s one comfort abaout critters , you ken get rid on ' em somehaow when they ' re more plague than profit . But folks has got to be let alone , excep ' the Lord takes ' em ; an ' He do n't allers see fit . " What added point and weight to these final remarks of old Israel was the well-known fact that he suffered at home from the most pecking and worrying of wives , and had been heard to say in some moment of unusual frankness that he " did n't see how ' t could be sinful to wish Miss Slater was in heaven , for she ' d be lots better off , and other folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig one fine September night ; she did not even guess that a visit paid to Monsieur by one of his pupils , a farmer 's daughter just out of Dalton , had anything to do with this enlvement ; she was sound asleep in her bed up stairs , when her guest shod his crutches with old gloves , and limped out to the garden-gate by dawn , where he and the farmer tolled the animal out of his sty and far down the street by tempting red apples , and then Farmer Steele took possession of him , and he was seen no more . No , the first thing Miss Lucinda knew of her riddance was when Israel put his head into the back-door that same morning , some four hours afterward , and said , with a significant nod ,  --  " He ' s gone ! " After all his other chores were done , Israel had a conference with Monsieur Leclerc , and the two sallied into the garden , and in an hour had dismantled the low dwelling , cleared away the wreck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously provided himself with an Isabella-grape-vine , planted it on this forsaken spot , and trained it carefully against the end of the shed : strange to say , though it was against all precedent to transplant a grape in September , it lived and flourished . Miss Lucinda 's gratitude to Monsieur Leclerc was altogether disproportioned , as he thought , to his slight service . He could not understand fully her devotion to her pets , but he respected it , and aided it whenever he could , though he never surmised the motive that adorned Miss Lucinda 's table with such delicate superabundance after the late departure , and laid bundles of lavender-flowers in his tiny portmanteau till the very leather seemed to gather fragrance . Before long , Monsieur Leclerc was well enough to resume his classes , and return to his boarding-house ; but the latter was filled , and only offered a prospect of vacancy in some three weeks after his application ; so he returned home somewhat dejected , and as he sat by the little parlorfire after tea , he said to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucinda , you have been of the kindest to the poor alien . I have it in my mind to relieve you of this care very rapidly , but it is not in the Fates that I do . I have gone to my house of lodgings , and they can not to give me a chamber as yet . I have fear that I must yet rely me on your goodness for some time more , if you can to entertain me so much more of time ? " " Why , I shall like to , sir , " replied the kindly , simplehearted old maid . " I ' m sure you are not a mite of trouble , and I never can forget what you did for my pig . " A smile flitted across the Frenchman 's thin , dark face , and he watched her glittering needles a few minutes in silence before he spoke again . " But I have other things to say of the most unpleasant to me , Mees Lucinda . I have a great debt for the goodness and care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good God we must submit to be debtors , but there are also of mortal obligations . I have lodged in your mansion for more of ten weeks , and to you I pay yet no silver , but it is that I have it not at present . I must ask of your goodness to wait . " The old maid 's shining black eyes grew soft as she looked at him . " Why ! " said she , " I do n't think you owe me much of anything , Mr. Leclerc . I never knew things last as they have since you came . I really think you brought a blessing . I wish you would please to think you do n't owe me anything . " The Frenchman 's great brown eyes shone with suspicious dew . " I can not to forget that I owe to you far more than any silver of man repays ; but I should not think to forget that I also owe to you silver , or I should not be worthy of a man 's name . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not let a woman most solitary spend for me her good self . " " Well , " said Miss Lucinda , " if you will be uneasy till you pay me , I would rather have another kind of pay than money . I should like to know how to dance . I never did learn , when I was a girl , and I think it would be good exercise . " Miss Lucinda supported this pious fiction through with a simplicity that quite deceived the Frenchman . He did not think it so incongruous as it was . He had seen women of sixty , rouged , and jewelled , and furbelowed , foot it deftly in the halls of the Faubourg St. Germain in his earliest youth ; and this cheery , healthy woman , with lingering blooms on either cheek , and uncapped head of curly black hair but slightly strewn with silver , seemed quite as fit a subject for the accomplishment . Besides , he was poor ,  --  and this offered so easy a way of paying the debt he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of the poor is their poverty ! " For whose moral sense , delicate sensitiveness , generous longings , will not sometimes give way to the stringent need of food and clothing , the gall of indebtedness , and the sinking consciousness of an empty purse and threatening possibilities ? Monsieur Leclerc 's face brightened . " Ah ! with what grand pleasure shall I teach you the dance ! " But it fell dark again as he proceeded ,  --  " Though not one , nor two , nor three , nor four quarters shall be of value sufficient to achieve my payment . " " Then , if that troubles you , why , I should like to take some French lessons in the evening , when you do n't have classes . I learned French when I was quite a girl , but not to speak it very easily ; and if I could get some practice and the right way to speak , I should be glad . " " And I shall give you the real Parisien tone , Mees Lucinda ! " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more an exile when I repeat my tongue to you ! " And so it was settled . Why Miss Lucinda should learn French any more than dancing was not a question in Monsieur Leclerc 's mind . It is true , that Chaldaic would , in all probability , be as useful to our friend as French ; and the flying over poles and hanging by toes and fingers , so eloquently described by the Apostle of the Body in these " Atlantic " pages , would have been as well adapted to her style and capacity as dancing ;  --  but his own language , and his own profession ! what man would not have regarded these as indispensable to improvement , particularly when they paid his board ? During the latter three weeks of Monsieur Leclerc 's stay with Miss Lucinda he made himself surprisingly useful . He listed the doors against approaching winter breezes ,  --  he weeded in the garden ,  --  trimmed , tied , trained , wherever either good office was needed ,  --  mended china with an infallible cement , and rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard or dirty work he did , he always presented himself at table in a state of scrupulous neatness : his long brown hands showed no trace of labor ; his iron-gray hair was reduced to smoothest order ; his coat speckless , if threadbare ; and he ate like a gentleman , an accomplishment not always to be found in the " best society , " as the phrase goes ,  --  whether the best in fact ever lacks it is another thing . Miss Lucinda appreciated these traits ,  --  they set her at ease ; and a pleasanter home-life could scarce be painted than now enlivened the little wooden house . But three weeks pass away rapidly ; and when the rusty portmanteau was gone from her spare chamber , and the well-worn boots from the kitchen-corner , and the hat from its nail , Miss Lucinda began to find herself wonderfully lonely . She missed the armfuls of wood in her wood-box , that she had to fill laboriously , two sticks at a time ; she missed the other plate at her tiny round table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , thin , sensitive face , with its rare and sweet smile ; she wanted her story-teller , her yarn-winder , her protector , back again . Good gracious ! to think of an old lady of forty-seven entertaining such sentiments for a man ! Presently the dancing-lessons commenced . It was thought advisable that Miss Manners should enter a class , and , in the fervency of her good intentions , she did not demur . But gratitude and respect had to strangle with persistent hands the little serpents of the ridiculous in Monsieur Leclerc 's soul , when he beheld his pupil 's first appearance . What reason was it , O rose of seventeen , adorning thyself with cloudy films of lace and sparks of jewelry before the mirror that reflects youth and beauty , that made Miss Lucinda array herself in a brand-new dress of yellow muslinde-laine strewed with round green spots , and displace her customary handkerchief for a huge tamboured collar , on this eventful occasion ? Why , O why did she tie up the roots of her black hair with an unconcealable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dress so short , her slipperstrings so big and broad , her thick slippers so shapeless by reason of the corns and bunions that pertained to the feet within ? The " instantaneous rush of several guardian angels " that once stood dear old Hepzibah Pynchon in good stead was wanting here ,  --  or perhaps they stood by all-invisible , their calm eyes softened with love deeper than tears , at this spectacle so ludicrous to man , beholding in the grotesque dress and adornments only the budding of life 's divinest blossom , and in the strange skips and hops of her first attempts at dancing only the buoyancy of those inner wings that goodness and generosity and pure self-devotion were shaping for a future strong and stately flight upward . However , men , women , and children do not see with angelic eyes , and the titterings of her fellow-pupils were irrepressible : one bouncing girl nearly choked herself with her handkerchief trying not to laugh , and two or three did not even try . Monsieur Leclerc could not blame them ,  --  at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of remorse smote him , as he saw how unconscious and earnest the little woman was , and remembered how often those knotty hands and knobbed feet had waited on his need or his comfort . Presently he tapped on his violin for a few moments ' respite , and approached Miss Lucinda as respectfully as if she had been a queen . " You are ver ' tired , Mees Lucinda ? " said he . " I am a little , sir , " said she , out of breath . " I am not used to dancing ; it ' s quite an exertion . " " It is that truly . If you are too much tired , is it better to wait ? I shall finish for you the lesson till I come to-night for a French conversation ? " " I guess I will go home , " said the simple little lady . " I am some afraid of getting rheumatism ; but use makes perfect , and I shall stay through next time , no doubt . " " So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Miss Lucinda departed and went home , pondering all the way what special delicacy she should provide for tea . " My dear young friends , " said Monsieur Leclerc , pausing with the uplifted bow in his hand , before he recommenced his lesson , " I have observe that my new pupil does make you much to laugh . I am not so surprise , for you do not know all , and the good God does not robe all angels in one manner ; but she have taken me to her mansion with a leg broken , and have nursed me like a saint of the blessd , nor with any pay of silver except that I teach her the dance and the French . They are pay for the meat and the drink , but she will have no more for her good patience and care . I like to teach you the dance , but she could teach you the saints ' ways which are better . I think you will no more to laugh . " " No ! I guess we wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the color rose over more than one young face . After that day Miss Lucinda received many a kind smile and hearty welcome , and never did anybody venture even a grimace at her expense . But it must be acknowledged that her dancing was at least peculiar . With a sanitary view of the matter , she meant to make it exercise , and fearful was the skipping that ensued . She chassd on tiptoe , and balancd with an indescribable hopping twirl , that made one think of a chickadee pursuing its quest of food on new-ploughed ground ; and some late-awakened feminine instinct of dress , restrained , too , by due economy , indued her with the oddest decorations that woman ever devised . The French lessons went on more smoothly . If Monsieur Leclerc 's Parisian ear was tortured by the barbarous accent of Vermont , at least he bore it with heroism , since there was nobody else to hear ; and very pleasant , both to our little lady and her master , were these long winter evenings , when they diligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden periods of Chateaubriand . The pets fared badly for petting in these days ; they were fed and waited on , but not with the old devotion ; it began to dawn on Miss Lucinda 's mind that something to talk to was preferable , as a companion , even to Fun , and that there might be a stranger sweetness in receiving care and protection than in giving it . Spring came at last . Its softer skies were as blue over Dalton as in the wide fields without , and its footsteps as bloom-bringing in Miss Lucinda 's garden as in mead or forest . Now Monsieur Leclerc came to her aid again at odd minutes , and set her flower-beds with mignonette borders , and her vegetable-garden with salad herbs of new and flourishing kinds . Yet not even the sweet season seemed to hurry the catastrophe that we hope , dearest reader , thy tender eyes have long seen impending . No , for this quaint alliance a quainter Cupid waited ,  --  the chubby little fellow with a big head and a little arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted here . Lucinda 's God of Love wore a lank , hard-featured , grizzly shape , no less than that of Israel Slater , who marched into the garden one fine June morning , earlier than usual , to find Monsieur in his blouse , hard at work weeding the cauliflower-bed . " Good mornin ' , sir ! good mornin ' ! " said Israel , in answer to the Frenchman 's greeting . " This is a real slick little garden-spot as ever I see , and a pooty house , and a real clever woman too . I ' ll be skwitched , ef it a' n't a fust-rate consarn , the hull on ' t . Be you ever a-goin ' back to France , Mister ? " " No , my goot friend . I have nobody there .

Well , I do n't understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here , I do n't see why you do n't hitch hosses with Miss Lucindy . " Monsieur Leclerc looked up astonished . " Horses , my friend ?

I wish ' t he ' d use one kind o ' figgurin ' a leetle more ; he ' d pay me for that wood-sawin ' . I did n't mean nothin ' about horses . I sot out fur to say , Why do n't ye marry Miss Lucindy ?

I guess ' t would be jest as much for her good as yourn . " " Hush , good Is-ray-el ! it is good to stop there . She would not to marry after such years of goodness : she is a saint of the blessd . " " Well , I guess saints sometimes fellerships with sinners ; I ' ve heerd tell they did ; and ef I was you , I ' d make trial for ' t . Nothin ' ventur ' , nothin ' have . " Whereupon Israel walked off , whistling . Monsieur Leclerc 's soul was perturbed within him by these suggestions ; he pulled up two young cauliflowers and reset their places with pigweeds ; he hoed the nicely-sloped border of the bed flat to the path , and then flung the hoe across the walk , and went off to his daily occupation with a new idea in his head . Nor was it an unpleasant one . The idea of a transition from his squalid and pinching boarding-house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of so kind and good a wife to care for his hitherto dreaded future ,  --  all this was pleasant . I can not honestly say he was in love with our friend ; I must even confess that whatever element of that nature existed between the two was now all on Miss Lucinda 's side , little as she knew it . Certain it is , that , when she appeared that day at the dancing-class in a new green calico flowered with purple , and bows on her slippers big enough for a bonnet , it occurred to Monsieur Leclerc , that , if they were married , she would take no more lessons ! However , let us not blame him ; he was a man , and a poor one ; one must not expect too much from men , or from poverty ; if they are tolerably good , let us canonize them even , it is so hard for the poor creatures ! And to do Monsieur Leclerc justice , he had a very thorough respect and admiration for Miss Lucinda . Years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of soft-fringed eyes that looked into his as none would ever look again ,  --  and they murdered her , those mad wild beasts of Paris , in the chapel where she knelt at her pure prayers ,  --  murdered her because she knelt beside an aristocrat , her best friend , the Duchess of Montmorenci , who had taken the pretty peasant from her own estate to bring her up for her maid . Jean Leclerc had lifted that pale shape from the pavement and buried it himself ; what else he buried with it was invisible ; but now he recalled the hour with a long , shuddering sigh , and , hiding his face in his hands , said softly , " The violet is dead ,  --  there is no spring for her . I will have now an amaranth ,  --  it is good for the tomb . " Whether Miss Lucinda 's winter dress suggested this floral metaphor let us not inquire . Sacred be sentiment , when there is even a shadow of reality about it !  --  when it becomes a profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is  --  " bosh , " as the Turkeys say . So that very evening Monsieur Leclerc arrayed himself in his best , to give another lesson to Miss Lucinda . But , somehow or other , the lesson was long in beginning ; the little parlor looked so home-like and so pleasant , with its bright lamp and gay bunch of roses on the table , that it was irresistible temptation to lounge and linger . Miss Lucinda had the volume of Florian in her hands , and was wondering why he did not begin , when the book was drawn away , and a hand laid on both of hers . " Lucinda ! " he began , " I give you no lesson to-night . I have to ask . Dear Mees , will you to marry your poor slave ? " " O dear ! " said Miss Lucinda . Do n't laugh at her , Miss Tender-eyes ! You will feel just so yourself some day , when Alexander Augustus says , " Will you be mine , loveliest of your sex ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you are young , and love is Nature to youth , but it is a heavenly surprise to age . Monsieur Leclerc said nothing . He had a heart after all , and it was touched now by the deep emotion that flushed Miss Lucinda 's face , and made her tremble so violently ,  --  but presently he spoke . " Do not ! " said he . " I am wrong . I presume . Forgive the stranger ! " " O dear ! " said poor Lucinda again ,  --  " O , you know it is n't that ! but how can you like me ? " There , Mademoiselle ! there ' s humility for you ! you will never say that to Alexander Augustus ! Monsieur Leclerc soothed this frightened , happy , incredulous little woman into quiet before very long ; and if he really began to feel a true affection for her from the moment he perceived her humble and entire devotion to him , who shall blame him ? Not I. If we were all heroes , who would be valet-de-chambre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? He was very good as far as he went ; and if you expect the chivalries of grace out of Nature , you " may expect , " as old Fuller saith . So it was peacefully settled that they should be married , with a due amount of tears and smiles on Lucinda 's part , and a great deal of tender sincerity on Monsieur 's . She missed her dancing-lesson next day , and when Monsieur Leclerc came in the evening he found a shade on her happy face . " O dear ! " said she , as he entered . " O dear ! " was Lucinda 's favorite aspiration . Had she thought of it as an Anglicizing of " O Dieu ! " perhaps she would have dropped it ; but this time she went on headlong , with a valorous despair ,  --  " I have thought of something ! I ' m afraid I ca n't ! Monsieur , are n't you a Romanist ? " " What is that ? " said he , surprised . " A Papist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , sighing , " once I was bon Catholique ,  --  once in my gone youth ; after then I was nothing but the poor man who bats for his life ; now I am of the religion that shelters the stranger and binds up the broken poor . " Monsieur was a diplomatist . This melted Miss Lucinda 's orthodoxy right down ; she only said ,  --  " Then you will go to church with me ? " " And to the skies above , I pray , " said Monsieur , kissing her knotty hand like a lover . So in the earliest autumn they were married , Monsieur having previously presented Miss Lucinda with a delicate plaided gray silk for her wedding attire , in which she looked almost young ; and old Israel was present at the ceremony , which was briefly performed by Parson Hyde in Miss Manners 's parlor . They did not go to Niagara , nor to Newport ; but that afternoon Monsieur Leclerc brought a hired rockaway to the door , and took his bride a drive into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur hitched his horse , and , taking Lucinda by the hand , led her into Farmer Steele 's orchard , to the foot of his biggest apple-tree . There she beheld a little mound , at the head and foot of which stood a daily rose-bush shedding its latest wreaths of bloom , and upon the mound itself was laid a board on which she read ,  --  " Here lie the bones of poor Piggy . " Mrs. Lucinda burst into tears , and Monsieur , picking a bud from the bush , placed it in her hand , and led her tenderly back to the rockaway . That evening Mrs. Lucinda was telling the affair to old Israel with so much feeling that she did not perceive at all the odd commotion in his face , till , as she repeated the epitaph to him , he burst out with ,  --  " He did n't say what became o ' the flesh , did he ? "  --  and therewith fled through the kitchen-door . For years afterward Israel would entertain a few favored auditors with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his cheeks ,  --  " That was the beateree of all the weddin ' - towers I ever heerd tell on . Goodness ! it ' s enough to make the Wanderin ' Jew die o ' larfin ' ! " Back matter
