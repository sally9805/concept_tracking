txt THE EDUCATION TO BE . II . A RIGHT intellectual education presupposes three essential features : the selection of the most suitable subjects for study ; the proper presentation of these , in the order of their dependence , and in view of the gradual growth of the pupil 's powers of comprehension ; and , not less important than either of these , the finding out and following of the best method and order of presenting the truths belonging to each subject to be studied . These are the problems with which , as something apart from Metaphysics or Logic , the possible but yet unachieved pedagogical science has to deal . To the first of these questions , What shall we teach ? or , as he phrases it , What knowledge is of most worth ? ' Mr. Spencer ( presuming the child already supplied with his bare implements , reading , spelling , and penmanship ) is led , after a long discussion , to conclude that the uniform reply is , Science . ' The counts ' on which he bases this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining of a livelihood ; the due discharge of parental functions ; qualification for political responsibilities ; the production and enjoyment of art ; and discipline , whether intellectual , moral , or religious . Taken at his own showing , Mr. Spencer seems to contemplate , as his model of an educated man , a prodigiously capable and efficient mute . But can he deny that the ability to express what one may know , and in speech , as well as in production , is at once the final proof and in a very real sense the indispensable consummation of such knowing ? Langucige is the counterpart and complement of Science . The two are but two * // sides , and either separately an incomplete one , of one thing ; that one thing we may name definite and practical knowledge ; and it is the only sort of knowledge that has real value . Language is yet larger than all the sciences proper which it embodies , namely , those clustering about Philology , Grammar , and Rhetoric . Of these , all deal with words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms they deal , in reality , with the objective world as perceived or apprehended by us , and as named and uttered in accordance with subjective aptitudes and laws . In language , then , there stands revealed , in the degree in which we can ascend to it , all that is yet known of the external world , and all that has yet evolved itself of the human mind . Can we decry the study of that which , whether as articulate breath , or through a symbolism of visible forms , mirrors to us at once all of nature and all of humanity ? But if we yield this claim in behalf of language , noting meanwhile that the mathematics are already well represented in our courses of instruction , then much of Mr. Spencer 's eloquent appeal is simply wasted by misdirection . All that he had really to claim is , that a disproportionate time is now surrendered to the studies of the gymbols , as such , and too often to characteristics of them not yet brought in any way into scientific coi5rdination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Mr. Spencer had insisted on a more just division of the school studies between the mathematical , physical , biological , and linguistic sciences , he would have struck a chord yielding no uncertain sound , and one finding response in a multitude of advanced and liberal minds . If he had gone yet deeper , and disclosed to his readers the fact that the fundamental need is , not that we study what in the more restricted sense is known as Science , but that we begin to study all proper and profitable subjects , as we now do hardly any of them , in the true 8cientific spirit and method , he would not merely seem to have said , but would have succeeded in saying , something of the deepest and most pressing import to all educators . The volume of republished papers from Mr. Barnard 's able Journal of Education - the first of a series of five under the general title of Papers for the Teacher ' - will afford to those desirous of investigating the second of the problems above proposed , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think , of the first series of articles , by Mr. William Russell , on the Cultivation of the Perceptive , Expressive , and Reflective Faculties ; ' and of the second , by Rev. Dr. Hill , now President of Antioch College , upon the True Order of Studies . ' In the outset of his first essay , ( which appeared in March , 1859 , ) Dr. Hill takes it for granted postulating , we think , a pretty large ground , and one that analysis and proof would better have befitted that there is a rational order of development in the course of the sciences , and that it ought to be followed in common education . ' The order he finds is that of five great studies , Mathesis , inathematics ; Physics , or Natural History ; History ; Psychology ; and Theology . We also take it for granted , ' he continues , that there is a natural order of development in the human powers , and that studies should be so arranged as to develop the powers in this order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hierarchy of the sciences , and the analysis of the intellect - and though we seem to find in the elucidation of the subject traces of that harmony of results of the two lines of inquiry , ' on which the author relies as one source of confirmation of the results themselves , yet we can not admit that the solutions given us remove all , nor even all the main difficulties of the case . While we regard the mathematics , physics , psychology , and theology as quite well individualized and distinct lines of scientific research , we can not help feeling that the day has hardly come for embracingphysiology under either phys // ic* or psychology ; the forming of the bile and the growing and waste of brain are yet , to our apprehension , too far removed from the gravitation of planets or the oxidation of phosphorus , on the one hand , as they are from the scintillations of wit or the severe march of reason on the other , for ready affiliation with either . We question decidedly whether Theology proper can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject ; and quite as decidedly whether the heterogeneous matters grouped under History , namely , Agriculture , Trade , Manufactures , the Fine Arts , Language , Education , Politics , and Political Economy , are or can be shown to be linked by any principle of essential unity . Most of these have their historical side ; but their unhistorical and scientific side most interests the great body of learners . And this latter aspect of some of them , Education and Politics especially , belongs after , not before Psychology . Then , the great fact of expression - Language - has not adequate justice done it by the position it is here placed in . Want of space is the least among our reasons for forbearing to attempt here a classification of the sciences - a work which Ramus , D'Alembert , Stewart , Bentham , and Amp*re successively essayed and left unfinished . But the principle that the faculties in their order are called out by the branches named in their order , is quite given up as the writer proceeds , and distinctly so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In actual life , usually the first set teaching the infant receives is in language ; and even though it previously is and should be getting its ideas of forms , colors , and other qualities , in the concrete , yet it remains far from true that we should pay our earliest attention to the development of the child 's power to grasp the truths of space and time . ' Dr. Hill has , however , taken in these papers a step in a needful direction ; and perhaps the best we could at first expect , are hints and an approxiination toward a much desired result . We may fairly assume that Mr. NV illson 's answer to the question , What to teach ? is in some good degree embodied in his elaborate series of School and Family Readers , ' of which the first six of the eight contemplated volumes have already appeared . These Readers aim to replace in a good degree the more purely literary materials of most of their predecessors , with a somewhat systematic and complete view of the more generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child is sure to be interested , with studies of animals , illustrated with good and often spirited drawings , and proceed through Physiology , Botany , Architecture , Physical Geography , Chemistry , etc. , up at last , as is promised , to Mental and Moral Philosophy , Natural Theology , Rhetoric , Criticism , Logic , the Fine Arts , including that one of those arts , as we presume we may class it , with which pupils of the rural schools will have best cause to become acquainted , namely , Gardening ! Readers on this plan have long been known in the schools of Prussia and Holland , and are even lately well received in England , in the form of Mr. Constable 's popular series ; though apparently , when finished , the American series will be more full and complete in topics and treatment of them than any preceding one . Of course , restricted space , and the range of maturity of talents addressed , compel the presentation in simplified form of scarcely more than a little learning* under the several heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to give a full exposition of any theme , but rather , to present a pie sing introduetiom to science . ' We may grant , in the outset , that most pupils will really comprehend , in and through the reading of it , but a modicum of all the high and large fields of knowledge here intimated to them ; but who that can now look on his school-days as in the past , does not remember how many grandiose sentences he was then called on to utter in cadence duly swelling or pathetic , but of the meaning of which he had not the most distant approach to a true compre // hension ? It was ours once to be of a class whose enunciative powers were disciplined by repeated goings through ' of the Old English Reader , ' and well do we remember how the accidental omission of the full pause after shows ' in the quotation ending the piece entitled Excellency of the Holy Scriptures , ' caused a certain teacher to understand ( ! ) and direct us to read the whole sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other moral and theological wisdom Loses , discountenanced , and like folly shows ' BEATTIE . ' Now , it is true , the whole sentence , in its best state , would have shown to our green understandings like enough to folly , ' if we had once made the effort to find meaning of any sort in it ; nor can it be considered the most profitable use of school time , thus to like folly show ' to unknit juvenile brains the abstract and high thought of . mature and great minds , who uttered them with no foolishness or frivolity in their intentions ! We see reasons to expect substantial advantages from Mr. Willson 's books ; and we believe teachers will appreciate and use them . We could wish they had not gone so far to mechanicalize the pupil 's enunciation ; by too freely introducing throughout the points of inflection ; but it is safe to predict that most pupils will take up with interest the simplified readings in science ; that they will comprehend and remember a useful portion of what they read ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of suggeslion from which the mind can profitably be led out to other knowledge and its connections ; and that they who go through the series can at least leave school with some more distinct ideas as to what the fields of human knowledge are , and what they embrace , than was ever possible under the ri*qime of merely fine writing , of pathetic , poetic , and generally miscellaneous selections . The educational interest that grew up in our country between the years 1810 and 1828 , about the year 1835 gave place to a stagnation that has marked nearly the whole of the period intervening between the last-named and the present date . In the year 1858 , the New- York Teacher was made the first medium of some thoughts in substance agreeing with those set forth in the earlier part of this paper , claiming the indispensableness to true education of a more true and liberal ioork on the part of the learner 's intellectual faculties , and of a more true and logical consecutiom than has yet been attained , and one corresponding to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lessons through which the usual school studies are to be mastered . Make - said the first of the articles setting forth this thought - the form of the facts and principles of any branch of stud*v as simple as you choose , and unless the order of their presentation be natural - be that order , from observation to laws and causes , in which the mind naturally moves , whenever it moves surely and successfully - the child , except in the rare case of prodigies that find a pleas- ure in unraveling complexity , will still turn from the book with loathing . He will do so because he must . It is not in his nature to violate his nature for the sake of acquiring knowledge , however great the incentives or threatenings attending the process . ' The child 's mind . . . with reference to all unacquired knowledge . . . stands in precisely the attitude of the experimenters and discoverers of riper years . It is to come to results not only previously unknown , but not even conceived of . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intellectual action must be the same . ' Study is research . ' In subsequent articles , it was claimed that the law here indicated is for intellectual education , the one true and comprehensive law ; and it was expressed more fully in the words : All true study is investigation ; all true learning is discovery . ' We say , now , that when the first of these articles appeared , the leading thought it contained , namely , that our pupils can and should learn by a process // of re-discovery , in the subjects they pursue , had not in distinct nor in substantial statement in any way appeared in the educational treatises or journals ; and further , that it was not , so far as their uttered or published expressions show , previously occupying the attention of teachers or of educational writers , nor was it the subject or substance of remarks , speeches , or debates , in the meetings of Teachers ' Associations . We say further , and because history and justice require it , that in our country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the several national associations of educators , a marked change and revolution in the course of much of the thought and discussion touching matters of education has , since the year 1858 , become apparent , and that to the most casual participant or observer , and in the precise direction in which the thought above referred to points . The essential issue itself- the practicability and desirableness of casting our studies into the form of courses of re-discovery is somewhat distantly and delicately approached , incorporated into speeches by an allusion or in the way of apercz2 , or thrown out as a suggestion of a partial or auxiliary method with the younger learners , all which is of a fashion highly patronizing to the thought , spite of the scruples about confessing who was the suggester of it . But other questions , which spring up in the train of this , which by themselves had received attention long since , but had been mainly dropped and unheard of among us during the past twenty-five years , have come again into full and unconcealed prominence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faculties in childhood , as to what are the elementary faculties of the mind , as to the adaptation of the kinds and order of studies to these , etc . And thus , all at once , is disclosed that Education itself ; which many had thought quite a finished* thing , well and happily disposed of ; or at least so far perfected as to leave no work further save upon the veriest outskirts of details , is in truth a giant superstructure with foundations in sand , or so almost visibly lacking underneath it , that it threatens to fall . For , in the name of the simplest of all common sense , how are we to educate to the best , not yet knowing - and that is now acknowledged - what are the FACULTIES of the very minds we are dealing with , nor what are the ruoczsszs by which those minds begin and keep up their advance in knowledge ? So , also , those who in the most charitable mood could see in education only something too hum-drum and narrow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a new and large field for intellectual effort , full of interesting problems , and fraught with realizations as yet undreamed of . It may be said , that the young mind had always learned what it did learn , by discoveries ; we answer , our methods and our books have not in any sufficient degree recognized the fact , provided for it , nor taken advantage of it . It may be said , that writers had previously acknowledged th#it the mind learns wellsome of them even , that it learns bestwhen it discovers : we answer , that nevertheless , no one had recorded it as a well-grounded , universal conclusion and positive law , that the mind only can learn , in all strictly scientific matters , as it discovers , and that hence , the canons of the method of discovery become rules for directing , in studies of this character , the education of the young . Aristotle and Bacon have recognized and enforced upon the adult mind its two master methods of advance by reasoning . But our children have their knowing also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic of proof ; on occasions , to employ . Shall we lavish all the treasures of method on those who have passed the formative stage of mind , and acquired the bent of its activities ? Rather , we think , the true intellectual method - combining both Baconian induction and Aristotelian deduction - yet waits to realize some of the best of the application and work for 666 // which its joint originators and their coworkers have been preparing it ; and that perhaps one of the highest consummations of this one method of thought may yet appear in the carrying forward , with more of certainty , pleasure , and success in their attaining of knowledge , the lisping philosophers of our schoolrooms and our firesides . From one source , disconnected latterly from those to which I have thus far called attention , there has arisen a decidedly progressive movement in the direction of right teaching , and one that , at least in geographical studies , promises soon to result in a consummation of great importance . Though Pestalozzianism , as further developed by the Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inductive and consecutive character here contended for , it has been tending in a degree toward such a result ; and this is perhaps seen in the most marked way in the method of teaching geography developed by Humboldt and Hitter , and represented in this country by their distinguished pupil , Professor Guyot . This method subordinates political to physical geography , proceeding from facts to laws , and by setting out with the grand natural features of the globe , leads the learner to comprehend not only the existence , boundaries , capitals , and strength of nations , but the reasons why these have come to be what they are . As tending in the same true direction , we should not fail to mention also the Th.ithfully-executed series of raised or embossed maps of the late Mr. Schroeter , presenting not only the profile but the comparative elevations of the land-surfaces or continents and islands , and , in detail , of the several political divisions of the globe , thus at once making the ocular study of geography real , and not as formerly , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided imagination . Among the decisive and important steps marking the revival of educational interest among us , is that looking to the introduction into our primary schools of the simple lessons for what is called the education of the senses , ' and what is in fact the solicitation of the perceptive faculties , and the storing of them , with their proper ideas , through the avenues of sense . When employed about observing or finding and naming the parts or qualities and uses of objects , as glass , leather , milk , wood , a tree , the human lody , etc. , this sort of teaching takes the name of Object Lessons ; ' when it rises to philosophizing in the more obvious and easy stages about natural phenomena , as rain , snow , etc. , or about parts of the system of nature , as oceans , mountains , stars , etc. , it is sometimes termed Lessons in Common Things . ' In the year 1860 , Mr. E. A. Sheldon , the enterprising superintendent of the schools of that city , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of teaching into the primary schools of Oswego . In March , 1861 , under thi leadership also , as we infer , of their superintendent , Mr. William H. Wells , the Educatioial Board of the city of Chicago adopted a still more minutely systematized and more extensive course of instruction of this sort , arranged in ten successive grades , and intended to advance from the simple study of objects , forms , colors , etc. , gradually to the prosecution of the regular and higher studies . The greater naturalness , life-likeness , and interest of this kind of mental occupation for young learner* , over the old plan of restricting them mainly to the bare alphabet , with barren spelling , reading , definitisns , and so on , is at once obvious in principle and confirmed by the facts ; and for the younger classes - a star , C of the utmost delicacy and importance to the future habits of the learner - the fruits must appear in increased readiness of thought and fullness of ideas , *and in a preparation for more true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; provided , we must add , that these also , when reached , be taught by a method best suited to , their subject-matter and to the higher range *f mental activity required to deal with 667 // it . Whether , now , the object-lesson system and plan is the one competent to carry on the learner through those later studies , is another and larger question , and one to which we shall presently recur . Under the recall of the minds of educators among us to fundamental principles of methods and tendencies in teaching , which we have pointed out , it was but natural to expect attempts to be made toward remedying the defects and supplying the needs that could not fail to be detected in our teaching processes . Naturally , too , such attempts would result in the bringing forward , sooner or later , of novelties in the topics and form of the school-books . What the pen - which , in- the outset , proposed the necessity of molding the school-work into a course of re-discoveries of the scientific truths - should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it had indicated ; or what it may , in the interim , have actually accomplished toward furnisling the working implements requisite to realizing in practice the possible results foreshadowed by the best educational theories , it may be neither in place nor needful that we should here intimate . Sometimes , indeed , there is in our social movements evidence of a singular sort of intellectual catalysis ; and a mute fact , so it 1e a fact , and even under enforced continuance of muteness , through influence of t*mporary and extraneous circumstances , may yet , like the innocent platinum in a mixture of certain gases , or the equally innocent yeast-plant vegetating in the lumpy of dough , take effect in a variety of ways , as if by mere presence . We shall remember how even Virgil had to write : Hos ego versiculos scripsi : tulit alter lionores I ' And the veriest bumpkin knows the force of the adage about one 's shaking the tree , for another to gather up the fruit . But Virgil was patient , and did well at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many pears ever came to the teeth of him that did the treeshaking . At all events , it is satisfying to know that time spins a long yarn , and comes to the end of it leisurely and at his own wise motion ! The English object-lesson system being now fairly and successfully domesticated among us , and to such an extent as to call for the invitation and temporary residence among us , in the city of Oswego , of a distinguished lady-teacher from the English Training Schools , it is again but natural that the system should call forth books adapted to its purposes ; and it was scarcely possible , under the circumstances we have now shown to exist , that such books should come forth without presenting a more conscious aim toward embodying something of the principle and order of discovery than has marked even their English prototypes . These anticipations we find exactly realized in the first book of the new pattern that has yet made its appearance-the Primary Object-Lessons ' of Mr. Calkins . Of this book , issued June , 1861 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to contribute something toward a general radical change in the system of primary education in this country - a change from the plan of exercising the memory chiefly to that of developing the observing powers - a change from an artificial to a natural plan , one in accordance with the philosophy of mind and its laws of development , the author commenced the following pages . ' Acknowledging his indebtedness to the manuals of Wilderspin , Stow , Currie , the Home and Colonial School Society , and other sources , the author tells us that the plan of developing the lessons corresponds more nearly to that given in Miss Mayo 's works than to either of the other systems ; ' and we understand him to claim ( and the feature is a valuable one ) that in this book , which is not a text-book , but one of suggestive or pattern lessons for teachers , he directs the teacher to proceed less by telling the child what is before it and to be seen , and more by requiring the child to 6*8 // find for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the purpose of the book does not terminate in describing right processesof teaching , but on the contrary , in telling what ought to be done , it proceeds to show how to do it by illustrative examples , ' ( sic . ) Now , spite of some liberties with the President 's English , which may properly be screened by the author 's proviso that he does not seek to produce a faultless composition , ' so much as to afford simple and clear examples for the teacher 's use , we are compelled to inquire , especially as this is matter addressed to mature and not to immature minds , which it is the author really meant us to understand ; that is , whether , in fact , the book proceeds to show how to do it by illustrative examples ; ' or whether , in reality , it does not aim to show by illustrative examples how to do it- that , namely , which ought to be done . If we still find Mr. Calkins 's philosophy somewhat more faultless than his practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all human effort ; and we can say with sincerity that , in some of its features , we believe this a book better adapted to its intended uses - the age it is designed to meet being that of the lov* est classes in the primary schools , or say from four to seven or eight years - than any of its predecessors . It will not , we hope , therefore , be understood as in a captious spirit , that we take exception to certain details . The author is clearly right in his principle that The chief object of primary education is the development of the faculties ; * though doubtless it would have been better to say , to begin the development of the faculties ; but then , he recognizes , as the faculties specially active in children , those of sensation , perception , observation , and simple memory , ' adding , for mature years , those of abstraction , the higher powers of reason , imagination , philosophical memory , generalization , ' etc . But that any one of all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save , it may be , in the single instance of imag ination - we shall decidedly question ; and Mr. Calkins will see by the intent of his very lessons , that he does not contemplate any such thing as sensation ' or observation , ' as being a faculty ; but , on the other hand , that he is so regarding certain individual powers of mind , by which we know in nature Color and Form and Number and Change and so on . We must question whether in the natural order of the development of the human faculties , the mind of the child takes cognizance first of the forms of objects . ' Form is a result of particular exte ions : evidently , extension must be known before form can be . But again , visibly , form is revealed through kinds and degrees of light and shade ; in one word , through color . Evidently , then , color also must be appreciated before visible form can be . But this natural order of the development of the human faculties , ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in idea , impressively philosophicaL It would be well if this book , while cautiously applying developing processes to the little learner , were to dogmatize less to the teacher . But when the developmentidea is carried into the titles of the sections , it becomes , we think , yet more questionable . Thus , a section is headed , To develop the idea of straight lines . ' First , would not the idea of a straight line come nearer to the thing actually had in view ? Again , To develop the idea of right , acute , and obtuse angles . ' The idea , ' taking in all these things , must be most mixed and multifarious ; it could not be clear , though that is a quality mainly to be sought . Is not the intention rather , to develop ideas of the right , the acute , and the obtuse angle ? Instances of this sort , which we can not understand otherwise than as showing a loose way of thinking , are numerous . But then , again , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Far otherwise , in fact . In many instances , of course , a sharper , better idea of the object or quality discussed will be elicited in the 669 // course of the lesson . This is , at best , only a sort of quasi-development , individualizing an idea by turning it on all sides , comparing with others , and sweeping away the rubbish that partly obscured it . In others of the topics , the learner has the ideas before we begin our developing operations . But the great misfortune of the usage of the term here is , that develop properly implies to unroll , uncover , or disclose something that is infolded , complicate , or hidden away ; but mark , something that is always THERE before the developing begins , and that by it is only brought into light , freedom , or activity ! Thus , we may develop faculties , for they were there before we began ; but we simply can not develop objective ideas ; such as this book deals with , but must impart them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . First , then , this term thus employed is needlessly pretentious ; secondly , it is totally misapplied . Would it not help both teacher and pupil , then , if we were to leave this stilfed form of expression , and set forth the actual thing the lessons undertake , by using such caption as for for example , To give the idea of a triangle , or to insure , or to furnish the idea of a curve ? We think the misnomer yet greater and worse , when we come to such captions as To develop the idea of God , as a kind Father ; ' especially when the amount of the development is this : Now , children , listen very attentively to what I say , and I will tell you about a Friend that you all have , one who is kind to all of you , one who loves you better than your father or your mother does , ' and so on . All this , and what precedes and follows , is telling , ' as the author acknowledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How is the child here made to find and know that it has such a Friend ? - that this Friend is kind to all ? - that this Friend loves it better than do parents , or , in fact , at all ? This is the way the nursery develops this and kindred ideas , and if the child be yet too young for its own comprehension of the most obvious truths of Natural Theology , then better defer the subject , or at least cease to call the nursery method by too swelling a name ! As to arrangement of topics , though the geographical lessons properly come late , as they stand , the idea of place , as well as those of weight and size , all belong earlier than the positions they are found in ; and number , later . Such mental anachronisms as talking of solids before the attempt has been made to impart or insure the idea of a 4solid , should , where practicable , be avoided ; and more notably , such as bringing a subsequent and complex idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of the elementary ideas it involves , such as measure , standard , or even length , or size , is presented . As to the substance of the teaching , we will indicate a few points that raise a question on perusal of them . What will the little learner gain , if the teacher follows the book in this instance ? Where is the skin of the apple ? On its surface . ' ' This is in the lesson for developing the idea ' of surface . When , by and by , the young mathematician gets the true idea of a surface , as extension in two dimensions only , hence , without thickness , then will follow this surprising result , that the whole thickness of the apple-skin is on-outsidethe apple 's surface , and hence , is nowhere : a singular converse of the teaching of those smart gentlemen who waste reams of good paper in establishing , to their own satisfaction , that even the mathematical surface itself has thickness ! In the lesson on perpendicular and horizontal , ' the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and after , unfortunately confounds the perpend:icular with the vertical - a bad way toward future accuracy of thought , or toward making scientific ideas , as they should be , definite as well as practically useful . If we judge by the brevity and incompleteness of the lesson on IDevelopin* ideas of Drawing ' ( ! ) , ideas of that particular stripe ' must be scarce . The Object // Lessons at the close of the book we find generally very good models of such exercises , clear and to the purpose . Once in a while there is a icepsus , as in this : The criterion of a liquid is presented as being in the circumstances that it does not hold together ' when poured from a vessel , but forms drops . ' Now , since it forms drops , it has cohesion , and the criterion is wrongly taken ; in fact , the same thing appears in that the liquid , even in pouring out , does hold together in a stream , and a stream that experiments with liquid jets show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Calkins 's book , in the hands of discerning and skillful teachers , can be made the instrument of a great deal of right and valuable discipline for primary classes ; but without some guarding and help from the teacher 's own thought , it will not always do the best work , nor in the best way . It is an approach to a good book for early mental development ; but it is not the consummation to be desired . Many of its suggestions and patterns of lessons are excellent ; but there is too large a lack of true consecution of topics , of accuracy of expression , and of really natural method of handling the subjects . We say this with no unkindly feeling toward the attempt or the author , but because , though no matter by how fortuitous circumstances , it comes to us as in this country the first effort toward a certain new style of books and subjects , and certain more rational teaching ; and we hold it , as being the privilege of teachers whose time may be too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less our right and duty , and that of every independent man , to recognize and point out wherein this new venture meets , or fails to meet , the new and positive demand of the pupils and the teachers in our time . If , in a degree , the working out shows defects such as we have named , is it not yet a question , whether we have in the book an illustration how this system of training may be applied to the entire course of common school education ' - to say nothing now of the question whether , even in its best form , it is a system that ought to be so applied . After the author of a book for young learners is sure of the comprehensibility of his subjects , and the accuracy of his ideas and expressions of them , the hi * est need - and one the lack of which is fatal to true educative value - is that of a natural and true synthesis and consecution of the successive steps of fact and principle that are to be presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every act of voluntary thinking must thus be consecutive : to say this , would be to confine the mind to one study , and to make us dread even relaxation , lest it break the precious and fragile chain of thought . Our growth in knowledge is not after that narrow pattern . We take food at one time , work at another , and sleep at a third : and so , the mind too has its variatiods of employment , and best grows by a like periodicity in them . This is our point - that it is a peculiarity and law of mind , growing out of the very nature of mind and of its knowings , that no truth or knowledge which is in its nature a consequent on some other truths or knowledge , can by any possibility be in reality att*iined by any mind until after that mind has first secured and rightly appreciated those antecedent truths or knowings . No later or more complex knowledge is ever comprehensible or acquirable , until after the elements of knowledge constitutin* or involved in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely like supposing a vigorously flourishing foliage and head of a tree with neither roots nor stem under it ; it is to suppose a majestic river , that had neither sufficient springs nor tributaries . Now , for the pupil , the text-book maker , the educator , no truth is more positive or profoundly important than this . He who fails of it , by just so much as he does so , fails to educate . Let the pupil , as he must , alternately study and not study - go 671 // even on the same day from one study to a second , though seldom to more than a third or fourth . By all this he need lose nothing ; and he will tax and rest certain faculties in turn . But then , insist that each subject shall recur frequently enough to perpetuate a healthy activity and growth of the faculties it exercises , usually , daily for five days in a week , or every other day at farthest ; that each shall recur at a stated period , so that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round with the sun may be formed ; and that in and along the material of every subject pursued , whether it be arithmetic , or grammar , or chemistry , or an ancient or modern language , the mind shall so be enabled to advance consecutively , clearly and firmly from step to step - from observation to law , from law to application , from analysis to broader generalization , and its application , and so on - that every new step shall just have been prepared for by the conceptions , the mental susceptibility and fibre , gotten during the preceding ones , and that thus , every new step shall be one forward upon new and yet sure ground , a source of intellectual delight , and a further intellectual gain and triumph . Need we say , this is the ideal ? Practice must fall somewhat short of it ; but Practice must first aim at it ; and as yet she has scarcely conceived about the thing , or begun to attempt it . In truth , Practice is very busy , dashing on without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young minds noble rivers of knowledge without their fountains ; and building up therein grand trees of science , of which either the roots are wanting , or all parts come together too much in confusion . First , then , we are not to make the presentation of any topic or lesson , even to the youngest learner , needlessly inconsecutive ; but with the more advanced learners - with those in the academic and collegiate courses - we should insist on the display , and in so doing best insure the increase of the true robur of the intellect , by positive requirement that all the topics shall be developed logically ; that sufficient facts shall come before all conclusions ; and rigid , sharp , and satisfactory analysis before every generalization or other synthesis . So , the more advanced mind would learn induction , and logic , and method , by use of them upon all topics ; it would know by experience their possibilities , requirements , and special advantages ; and it would be able to recognize their principles , when formally studied , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a mind , we may safely say , would be educated . But secondly , the foregoing considerati6ns show that we are not unnecessarily to jumble together the topics and lessons ; to vacillate from one line of study to another ; to wander , truant-like , among all sorts of good things - exploiting , now , a color ; then mule ; then in due time gratitude and the pyramids ; then leather , ( for , though there 's nothing like leather , ' it may be wisest to keep it in its place ; ) then sponge , and duty to parents , lying , the points of compass , etc. ! And here , for all a , es above nine or ten years , is a real drawback , or at the least , a positive danger , of the Object-Lesson and Common-Things teaching . Just here is shadowed forth a real peril that threatens the brains of the men and women of the - we may say , rising* generation , through this fresh accession of the object - lesson interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; and yet , even objects can be run into the ground . ' We had put the essential thought here insisted on into words , before object-lessons had acquired the impetus of the last and current year . The object lessons ' of Pestalozzi and his numerous followers , had , in a good degree , one needed element - they required woux of the pupil 's own mind , not mere recipiency . But they have almost wholly lacked another element , just as important that of couszcurxou in the steps and results dealt with . In most of the schools in our country-in a degree , in all of them-these , two fundamental elements of all right edu like Education to be . // 673 cation , namely , true work of the learner 's in life , where a quick and right taking mind , and a natural and true consecution in to the work at the hand is desirable , not only the processes of each day or lesson , and any thing higher is commonly but of one day on another , and of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our schools ; and that , subsequently to the completion of the more purely sensuous and percipient phase of the mind , and to the acquirement of the store of simpler ideas and information , and the degree of capacity , that ought to be secured during that period - hence , from an age not later than eleven , or according as circumstances may determine , thirteen yearsall the true and desirable ends of editcation , whether they be right mental habits and tastes , discipline and power of the faculties , or a large information and practical command of the acquisitions made - all these ends , we say , are thenceforward most certainly secured by the systematic prosecution , in a proper method , of the usually recognized distinct branches or departments of scientific knowledge . Let , then , common things , ' et id genus omne , early enough give place to thorough - going study of the elements of Geometry , of Geography , Arithmetic , Language , ( including Grammar , ) of Natural Philosophy , Chemistry , Botany , Physiology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools produce a race not of mere curious gazers , but of conscious and purposive investigators ; not a generation of intellectual truants and vagabonds , but one of definitely skilled cultivators of definite domains in handicraft , art , or science . We are compelled to take issue , therefore , with Mr. Spencer 's recommendation , indorsed in the Chicago Report , to the effect that object-lessons should , after a different fashion , ' he extended to a range of things far wider , and continued to a period far later than now . ' Not so : after any possible fashion . But let us , as early as the child 's capacity and preparation will allow , have the individualized , consecutive studies , and the very manner of studying which shall be made to do for the higher and the lower intellectual faculties together , what well- conducted objectlessons can and now do perform mainlyfor the lower . Of all school-method , this we conceive to be the true end and consummation . This would be the ultimate fruitage of the Baconian philosophy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the whole is greater than any part - in the schoollife and work of every boy and girl admitted to the benefits of our courses of instruction . Thus we have endeavored , with some particularity of examination and detail , to find and state not only what are , but what should , be , the tendencies of educational thought and effort in our country and times . And we seem to find that those tendencies are , in spite of a stand - still conservatism or perplexed doubt in some quarters , , and of a conflict of views and practices in others , largely in the direction in which the ends to be sought show that they should be . The Education to be , as far as the intellectual being is concerned , when time and study shall better have determined the conditions , and furnished the working instrumentalities , is to be , not name merely , but in fact , an education by simply natural employment and development of all the perceiving , reasoning , originative , and productive faculties of the mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on proceeding , after proper age , and then upon every suitable topic , by observation and investigation , and so , by discovery of the principles and results the mind is desired to attain ; because it will be an education by rigidly consecutive , comprehended and firm lines of advance , employing processes analytic and synthetic , inductive and deductive , each in its requisite plnce and in accordance with the nature and stage of the topics under investigation . For the like rea sons , it will have become , what we have long foreseen and desired that education should be , rightly progressive in form , and in character such as must develop , strengthen , and store the mind ; such as must best fit , so far as the merely scholastic education can do this , for practical expression and use of what is learned , showing all our acquired know-674 // ledge in the light of its actual and various relationships , and conferring true serviceableness and the largest value , whether for enjoyment or execution . Such an education would be real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have fairly entered upon the era in which education must be , and , spite of any temporary recoil of timorous despotisms , must continue to be , popular and universal . But many are too apt to forget that , upon our planet , this thing of popular and universal education is comparatively a new and untried experience ; that , so far as its mode and substance are concerned , it is , in truth , still in course of experiment . There is at present a very general and but too just complaint of the popular education , as tending to inflate rather than to inform ; as prompting large numbers of young men especially to aim at scaling to positions above those in which the school found them , a thing that would be well enough were it not inevitable that , in the general scramble , the positions aspired to are at the same time too frequently those above their capabilities , and quite too full without them : as , in few words , inspiring youth with a disrelish for those less responsible pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than with a desire to qualify themselves for their proper work . The tendency is admitted ; and it has become , in overcrowded professions and commercial pursuits , the fruitful source of superficiality , of charlatanry , of poverty at once of pocket and of honor , of empty speculations , and of the worst crimes . But , appreciating the unquestionable fact that universal education is to be henceforth the rule in the most advanced nations , and that , in spite of its apparent consequences or our fears , and remembering also that the experience is , for the world , a new one , is there not some hope left us in the thought that possibly the alarmists have been attributing to the fact of popular education itself what in truth is only a temporary consequence of a false , an abnormallyeducating method and procedure on the part of our schools ? Nay , more ; does not the latter afford the true solution of the evil ? We believe it has been shown that our teaching methods not only fail in great part , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and front* of this failure and non-developing appears in the want of bringing into just prominence the discriminating and the applicative powers of the mind , the judgment , and reason ; in a word , the thinking as distinguished from the merely receptive and retentive powers . Now , what are we to expect from a people too many of whom are put in possession of stores of fact quite beyond the degree in which their capacities to discriminate clearly , to judge wisely , and to draw conclusions rationally have been strengthened and furnished with the requisite guiding principles ? What but a shallow shrewdness that should run into all the evils we have above named ? But discipline all to think and reason more and more justly and assuredly upon their facts , and to men so educated , the very thought of an inordinate crowding of the so-called genteeler avocations , to the neglect of the more substantial , becomes appreciated in its true light , as absurd and unfortunate in every way , and in all its bearings upon the individual as well as the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucation ; and let a due proportion of fIt minds enter the professions , the posts of office , and commercial pursuits ; let a few even live by mere work of thought ; but let all enjoy the luxury of a degree of thought and rationality that shall forbid their richest blessing turning to their rankest curse . That such must be the result of a true education , our faith in a wise Providence forbids us to doubt . Such an education being real , and appealing to all the faculties , does not eventuate in vain aspirings ; but fits each for his place and work- fits for making that great and happy discovery , that the best talents and the most complete cultivation of them can not only 675 // find in every employment scope for real exercise , but in the commonest and simplest occupations will be more expert and successful than uncultured ignorance can possibly be . In this view , the true education tends not to level but to utilize , to make the most of every man 's special aptitudes for his special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and relictive tendencies have already , indeed , **31;395;TOOLONG ed the once pattern school-system of Prussia , while they are believed to threaten a like step in England . But the idea of such an education as we have striven to portray , harmonizes with the spirit and objects of a commonwealth , and if we mistake not , to the perpetuity and perfection of free institutions it may yet be found the condition precedent .
