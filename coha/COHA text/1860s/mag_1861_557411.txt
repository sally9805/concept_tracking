BY EDWARD A. FREEMAN , LL . D. , D. C. L. , REGIUS PROFESSOJ OF MODERN HISTORY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD . THE English universities are , of all English institutions . those which foreigners find the greatest difficulty in understanding . And the difficulty is by no means confined to foreigners strictly so called . It extends to those who are nearest in blood to the people of England , and nearest in geographical position to the land itself . For the English universities are English in the narrowest local sense of that word . Their constitution , and much in them besides their constitution , is puzzling , not only to the stranger from the European continent , but to the Scottish and Irish subjects of the same crown and to the men of English blood and speech in the lands beyond the ocean . An English university is so different from a Continental , a Scottish , or an American university that those who are used only to the one find it hard to understand the nature of the other . Yet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of piercing through the mystery . A visitor from Switzerland , from Canada , from the United States , ought soon to see his way through everything , if lie is once put on the right tack . The main peculiarity of the English university system , that which those who are not used to it find the main cause of puzzledom , is the existence of many colleges in one university . If I were to say that this is absolutely peculiar to Oxford and Cambridge , I might be met with the answer that more than one French and German university formerly contained several colleges , and that there still are two or more colleges in the Scottish University of Saint Andrew 's . But if the Continental instances were really at all like Oxford and Cambridge , they exist no longer to be compared with them , and the colleges at Saint Andrew 's differ altogether from the colleges in the English universities . // Practically Oxford and Cambridge stand by themselves ; they are institutions singularly like one another in their main outlines , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world . Each is an university containing many colleges . On the European continent we hear , as a rule , only of nniversities , not of colleges . In France the word coilige is often heard , but it means what we should call a school . In America " college " and " university " mean the same kind of institution ; only " university " is thought to be the more dignified name . And what either " cob lege " or " university " means is , allowing for difference of circumstances , what an English university would be if colleges had never been founded in it , or if all its colleges should be supI ) ressed . How puzzling the English system is to all who are not used to it is revealed to those who are by not a few signs . I constantly receive foreign-sometimes English - letters addressed to " the university . " I have been asked in Europe whether I lived " in the university . " The university is supposed to be , as it commonly is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in a single large building . But the oddest confusion of all was that of an American professor who , in his book of travels in England , ended a fairly accurate description of the several colleges at Cambridge with this remark " The formal style of Cambridge College is The Chancellor , Masters , and Scholars of the University of Cambridge . ' But with either an American or a Swiss visitor , with any visitor , in short , who comes from a country with a federal constitution , the way to give him a clearer notion of things is not hard . Tell him that in an English university the university answers to the Union and the colleges to the States , and he at once begins to understand . Tell him that there are certain things which each college can do for itself , and certain other things which only the whole university can do . Tell him that each college , like each State , manages its own affairs and its own property , that each exercises its own discipline over its own members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own range and its own discipline also . rrell him that a single college can no more grant a degree than a single State can coin money or declare war . Let him well take in all this , and lie will , in King Harry 's phrase , have got the sow by the right ear . Only a warning will be necessary . He must be further told that this // illustration , though practically as near as any illustration is likely to be , is historically false . That is to say , the practical , every-day relation of the university and the colleges is very like that of the Union and the States ; but no one must think that , as the Union is an aggregate of States , so the university is an aggregate of colleges . The university was in being before the colleges , and it would go on , nntouched in any material respect , though every college in it were suppressed . The colleges in all things presuppose the university ; they have no object or meaning apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning ; the colleges were founded in order that certain persons might receive the advantages of the university and its teachings who otherwise might not have attained to them . The university grew up ; the colleges were founded . That is a point very necessary to notice . The universities of Oxford and Cambridge may , with the most literal truth , say , like Topsy : " Nobody made me ; spects I growed . " And in truth it is a matter of suspicion . We suspect that the first small beginnings of the growth of the University of Oxford happened in the reign of Henry the First ; bat we do not do much more than suspect . We have no certain records . We had a certain Robert Puleyn lecturiug in divinity , and a little later we find a more fatuous Vacarius lecturing in civil law . We naturally suspect that we have here the beginning of two of the great faculties of the university . Before the end of the twelfth century these germs , or some others , had certainly " growed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the twelfth century bountiful men began to found colleges in those universities which had thus come into being of themselves . But no man , king or bishop or private person , founded either of the universities . Still less did anybody endow them . Masters began to teach ; scholars came to hear ; and the thing grew up . The whole body of such masters and scholars , like the whole body of any other class of people , was called its " universitas . " In the noble Latin nines of the thirteenth century , which so well set forth the whole doctrine of popular government , we read " Igitur cominunitas regal consulatur , Et quid universitas sentiat sciatur . " Here the " universitas " means the same as the " communitas " - that is , it means nothing short of the whole people of England* // Thus the " university " - that is , simply the whole body-of the masters and scholars of Oxford or Cambridge gradually grew up . We have popular errors to strive against at every step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is the very common belief that the towns of Oxford and Cambridge are something secondary to the universities , and grew up around them . No one is likely to make this mistake about either a German or an American university ; but in England it is really very common . How common it is is shown in both houses of Parliament whenever there is any debate about university matters . People see that the town is  --  or at least was-something quite subordinate to the university , and they fancy that it is something newer than the university , something that grew up because the university was there . They think , if they think at all , that Oxford and Cambridge are like those towns which grew up round some castle or great church , commonly some great abbey . Of such there are many in England , though but few among the greater towns . But the city of Oxford and borough of Cambridge had been in being long before the universities began . Both figure in the wars of the tenth and eleventh centuries , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities before the twelfth . Oxford , above all , was one of the most important posts in England . As long as any trace or memory lasted of the old independence of Mercia and Wessex , Oxford , the chief town on the upper course of the boundary stream of Thames , was one of the greatest military and political centres in England . Before the Norman conquest , and long after , Oxford was the chosen place for great national gatherings . And Cambridge , though not of the same historical importance as Oxford , was a strong military post , and a considerable town according to the standard of the time . The universities , then , arose by masters and scholars settling in existing towns . They did not , as monks sometimes did , sit down under a green tree , and see a town grow round them . The universities grew till they became independent of the towns , and even superior to the towns ; but the town and its jurisdiction were the older . And Oxford and Cambridge were towns which were well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universities . Oxford , a great place for holding national councils , an occasional dwelling-place of kings , was not , like many other towns , under // the immediate power or influence of any great lord , temporal or spiritual . One great object with the rising university was to be independent of the diocesan bishop , and Oxford was in the vast diocese of Lincoln , whose bishop was far away . At Cambridge the Bishop of Ely was much nearer ; still the masters and scholars were not actually at his gate . The universities gradually obtained privileges from kings and popes which made them independent of all ordinary jurisdiction , spiritual and temporal . They became great and powerful bodies ; but they never became wealthy bodies . It is a common notion that the English universities are very rich . In truth , the universities , as corporations , have , to this day , very little property . They hold a good deal in trust for various purposes in the universities . They draw an income from various payments made by their members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits of the university press . But of actual property of its own the university itself , the corporation of the chancellor , masters , and scholars , holds very little . Nor had the universities for many ages any great public buildings . At Oxford the university held its meetings in Saint Mary 's Church and buildings attached to it . There is no important university building in Oxford older than the latter part of the fifteenth century . The element of property and of the influence which follows property , and the element of buildings also , came in with the colleges . The word college , in its original meaning , has nothing to do with learning or education . It simply means a company of men of any kiud , associated for some common purpose and usually holding common property . In the universities a college means a foundation for the maintenance of masters or scholars in the university , living together according to such rules as its founder lays down . They have a house to live in , and property , land , or tithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universities lived where they could and how they could ; they had no houses and no endowments . Gradually the scholars began to live together in small societies , in houses called halls , which at first might be the property of anybody . A hall might belong to a citizen who let his house for scholars to live in , or it might belong to a monastery which kept it for the use of its own members who went to study in the university . Gradually the halls were brought under some kind // of university discipline , as lodging-houses are now . Scholars lived in a hall , with a master as its principal . Bat at Oxford the halls never became corporate bodies holding property . Anything given for their benefit was held for them in trust by the university . At Cambridge the case is seemingly different , but only seemingly . That is to say , when endowed societies began to be founded , some of those at Cambridge were called halls and some colleges . The name does not matter . If by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college is simply an endowed and incorporated hall . Only at Oxford some of the older unendowed halls lived on alongside of the endowed colleges , while at Cambridge hall and college mean the same thing . The system of colleges began in the reign of Henry the Third , in the year 1274 , when Walter of Merton , Bishop of Rochester , removed to Oxford a body of scholars which he had already begun to found at Merton , in Surrey . His example was followed in 1280 by Hugh of Balsham , Bishop of Ely , who founded Saint Peter 's College , commonly called Peterhouse , in Cambridge . This oldest college at Cambridge grew , like many others , out of the system of halls . The founder had already given two halls for the reception of scholars . He afterwards gave them the full form and endowment of a college . These two , Merton and Peterhouse , are the oldest foundations at Oxford and Cambridge respectively . Two others at Oxford , University and Balliol , claim an older date , but untruly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Merton , but not benefactions which took the shape of a college . They did not take the form of colleges till long after . It is a puzzling thing to strangers that one of the colleges in the University of Oxford should be specially called University College . Are they not all university colleges ? So in a sense they are . But University College had something specially to do with the university . Its proper name was the Great Hall of the University . That is , it grew out of a hall which was the property of the university itself . That it , or anything else at Oxford , unless possibly military works , was founded by Alfred , King of the West Saxons , in the ninth century , is pure fiction . From the thirteenth century , then , till the nineteenth , colleges-endowed foundations for the residence and maintenance of students-have been at various times founded in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge . In several cases , as at Peterhouse , // as in the last foundation of a college , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college grew out of an older hall . That is , the hail supplied the site and buildings for the new foundation . A college is not in itself a place of education . It is a house for men to dwell in who come to profit by the education and other advantages given by the university . Subject to any later changes made by the law of the land , each college holds such property as its founder gave it ; it is governed by such statutes as its founder made for it ; it is under such visitation as the founder decreed for it , the King , a bishop , the heir or representative of the founder , or any other . With the property of any college , with its internal management , the university has nothing to do ; each college is subject to later benefactions and to changes made by the authority of the state , whatever its founder chose to make it . The founder made his endowment for such fellows or scholars as he thought good , under a head with whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by later henefactions ; some have not . Their connection with the university consisted mainly in this the founder required the members of his college to be students in the university , and to take such and such degrees , and the only way of getting those degrees was by going through such examinations or other exercises as the university required . The constitutions of the colleges follow one general pattern , but most colleges have some peculiarities of their own . That some foundations are richer than others , that some consist of more members than others , is only the common course of human affairs . But there are all manner of differences between college and college . Some foundations had only one class of members , called indifferently fellows and scholars . In others the fellows are an older , the scholars a younger , class . In some the choice of the fellows and scholars was perfectly open ; in others they had to be chosen from particular schools or counties . In some the scholars had a claim to the fellowships or a preference for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound sooner or later to take holy orders ; in others some or all might remain laymen . In some it was necessary or advantageous to take the higher degrees in divinity , law , or medicine ; in others degrees in arts were enongh . But all colleges agreed in one point . As the very essence of a college was that it should be a body of students living together // in common , the fellows and scholars were necessarily unmarried . This had nothing to do with the celibacy of the clergy ; it was implied in the very uature of a college , and applied to lay and clerical fellows equally . Above all , no one must fancy that the colleges in the universities are , or ever were , as they are sometimes foolishly called , " monastic " bodies . Save in one or two cases , where a hall belonging to a monastery had grown into a college , there was nothing monastic about them . From the foundation of Merton onwards , any man who " entered religion , " that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place in the college . A college , then , was , in its beginnings , simply an endowed house for the residence and maintenance of students in the university . Its members had no kind of formal advantage over other members of the university who did not belong to any college . But it was gradually found that the life of a college had many practical advantages . It offered many attractions even to those who were not members of the foundation . Most colleges , therefore , besides their own fellows and scholars , took in other members of the university , who lived in college at their own cost . Gradually the practice of living in colleges became all but universal ; the only exception was that some still lived in the few halls which survived . At last in the seventeenth century , by the statutes of Archbishop Laud , every member of the University of Oxford was bound to be a member of some college or hall . This rule has been abolished in our own times , and it is now again possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . As for the halls , they seem to be dying out . All , save one or two , have been either merged into some college or have themselves grown into colleges . On the other hand , the new body called Keble College , having no foundation , is not a real college , but only a very large hall . The constitution of the university , in its original state , had , of course , nothing to do with the colleges . Looking at the university as a corporation , its constitution is highly democratic . Every qualified citizen of the commonwealth-that is , every member who has taken a complete degree in any faculty , and who keeps his name on the books and makes the needful paymentshas a vote in the general assembly of the university . This is called convocation at Oxford and senate at Cambridge . The head // of the university is the chancellor , freely elected by the senate or convocation . The chancellor and convocation have power to make statutes , to make decrees for particular cases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Oxford to a smaller body , the congregation , now known as the ancient house , to distinguish it from a later body of the same name . But this old democratic constitution has been in many ways modified , and also in some respects restored , in quite modern times . In the original constitution of the university college distinctions naturally went for nothing . The head of a college was , in the university , simply whatever his degree made him , master of arts or doctor of one of the higher faculties . He had no rights or place whatever beyond any other doctor or master . But the position was an influential one in itself , and one which could not fail to grow in importance as the colleges grew , and gradually came to take in all the members of the university . The chancellor was at first a resident member of the university , standing to the whole university much as the head of each college did to his own college . But as the university grew in importance , its headship grew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not resident , noblemen or ministers of state , were chosen chancellors . The active duties of the office fell to a vice-chancellor , and the vice-chancellor came , not unnaturally , to be appointed from among the heads of colleges . At last , by Archbishop Laud 's statutes , the general discipline of the university , and specially the proposal of statutes and other measures to convocation , was placed in a body consisting of the vice-chancellor , the heads of colleges and halls , and the proctors . These last are the chief ministers of discipline in the university . They are chosen yearly . Anciently they were chosen by the whole body of convocation . By one of Laud 's statutes the choice was transferred to the colleges in turn according to a certain cycle . Strictly , the choice was not in the college as such , but in those members of convocation who belonged to the college . Still in all these ways the colleges encroached on the university and undermined its constitution . To go back to our federal analogy , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the Union were vested in a meeting of the governors of the several States . At Cambridge the heads of colleges got in some things more power than at Oxford ; in others less . At Oxford all election8 by convocation re* // mained free . At Cambridge the heads of colleges came at all elections by the senate to nominate two candidates , and the senate could choose only one of those two . On the other hand , the power of proposing measures to the senate was in another body representing the several faculties . In all this we have said nothing about professors , tutors , or teachers of any kind . In the old theory of the university , every man who had taken a complete degree   any faculty was supposed to be able and willing to act as a teacher in that faculty . The words doctor , master , professor , all meant the same thingone who had taken a complete degree of some kind . To this day every doctor in divinity is called , in Latin , " sacr*e theologhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some confusion . One has seen it said over and over again that John Wickliffe was " professor of divinity " at Oxford , meaning that he was the holder of a special and endowed office , like a professor now . But in Wickliffe 's day there were no special and endowed professors of particular subjects . Wickliffe was professor only as every doctor in divinity was professor . But in his day the doctor 's degree itself was still reckoned a great honor . The notion of every doctor and master being a teacher has died out in several ways . It has died out before the growth of endowed professors in the university and of tutors and lecturers in the several colleges . And it has died out still more by the lowering of the standard of degrees in all the faculties . Till quite lately the degrees in the superior faculties had become quite nominal ; they proved nothing . Now degrees in law and medicine have again come to have a meaning ; but the degree in divinity is still little more than a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree is very low , and that for the master 's degree is no higher . There is , to be sure , an elaborate system of class lists , in which various shades of honor are bestowed on the candidates for the bachelor 's degree . But it is the class which is valued ; the degree itself is a small matter . The supposed necessity of marking by special honors those whose work is really creditable , the further development of having wholly distinct examinations for those who seek for honors and for those who do not , show how low the mere degree has fallen . And , besides this , the master 's degree is given , as a matter of course , to every bachelor of the required standing ; without further examina // tion or other exercise . This , at least , is not as it should be . In any university the degree alone should be worth something ; it should be worth a good deal . The lower degree should mark something , and the higher degree should mark more . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's degree should be honorable . To explain the exact position of an Oxford professor and an Oxford tutor to one who is not familiar with the system is even harder than to explain the relations between the university and the colleges . The professor , as I have just said , is an endowed university teacher . in an university which has no colleges the professors will naturally be the immediate teachers of the undergraduates . In an university which has colleges that work will more naturally fall to the college tutors . In such a case the professor is , or ought to be , a master of his own subject , the representative of that subject in the university , ready to lecture and teach in every shape within the higher ranges of that subject . He is not calkA upon to give the ordinary teaching needed for the degree . Of course no teaching ought to have the degree as its immediate object ; all such teaching is to be eschewed as cram . But there is clearly room for two classes of teachers-those who give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who teach either subjects which are not required for the degree or the higher branches of those that are . The latter is the work of the professor  --  the master of his own subject , whatever that subject is . The former is the work of somebody else , most obviously of the college tutor . The tutor , as well as the professor , is a development , a very natural development , of the ancient doctor or master , qualified to teach as doctor or master . He is in his origin an university officer no less than the professor , and in his origin he had not necessarily anything to do with teaching . The word ttttor means , as Scottish lawyers , at all events , know , not a teacher , but a guardian . Every undergraduate was put under the care of a master as his tutor ; and , as the college grew up , the tutor was naturally a member , commonly a fellow , of his own college . Gradually the chief work of teaching came to the tutors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , if proper relations existed between tutors and professors . Each has his separate work , and the two could very well work in // harmony . Perhaps there has been no time when both did work in harmony ; perhaps there has been no time when both have worked at all . But in a healthy state of things , the tutor would take the lower and the professor the higher branches of university teaching . The tutor would be the immediate teacher of the men of his own college , to whom he stands in a personal relation . The professor would be a representative of the special branch of learning in the university generally , standing in no personal relation to any one , having nothing to - do with examinations , but standing ready to give the higher instruction to any that need it-pupils , tutors , examiners , or any other . The ideal has perhaps never been carried out ; it is certainly not carried out now . But it does seem to be one which it would not be impossible to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by the coexistence of the university and its several colleges . It might even be thought that it was one of the advantages of the coexistence of the university and the colleges that such a division of the work of teaching is possible . The causes which have hindered the carrying-out of such an ideal state of things are many and of many kinds . Some are old ; some are new . Some it might be easy to get rid of ; with some the work of improvement would be harder . But this sketch of the way in which the English university grew up in its main features may possibly be of some interest to those who are better used to other systems . It may even have interest enough to make some wish to hear a little more of the changes made during the present century , and of the practical working of things at the present moment .
