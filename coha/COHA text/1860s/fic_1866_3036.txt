GYPSY 'S COUSIN JOY By Elizabeth Stuart Phelps New York Dodd , Mead and Company Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1866 , by GRAVES &; YOUNG , in the Clerk 's Office for the District Court of Massachusetts Copyright , 1895 , by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward . **72;3145;TOOLONG PREFACE . Having been asked to write a preface to the new edition of the Gypsy books , I am not a little perplexed . I was hardly more than a girl myself , when I recorded the history of this young person ; and I find it hard , at this distance , to photograph her as she looks , or ought to look to-day . She does not sit still long enough to be " taken . " I see a lively girl in pretty short dresses and very long stockings ,  - -  quite a Tom-boy , if I remember rightly . She paddles a raft , she climbs a tree , she skates and tramps and coasts , she is usually very muddy , and a little torn . There is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sure to be a laugh in her eyes . Wherever there is mischief , there is Gypsy . Yet , wherever there is fun , and health , and hope , and happiness ,  - -  and I think , wherever there is truthfulness and generosity ,  - -  there is Gypsy , too . And now , the publishers tell me that Gypsy is thirty years old , and that girls who were not so much as born when I knew the little lady , are her readers and her friends to-day . Thirty years old ? Indeed , it is more than that ! For is it not thirty years since the publication of her memoirs ? And was she , at that time , possibly sixteen ? Forty-six years ? Incredible ! How in the world did Gypsy " grow up ? " For that was before toboggans and telephones , before bicycles and electric cars , before bangs and puffed sleeves , before girls studied Greek , and golf-capes came in . Did she go to college ? For the Annex , and Smith , and Wellesley were not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did she edit a Quarterly Review , or sing a baby to sleep ? Did she write poetry , or make pies ? Did she practice medicine , or matrimony ? Who knows ? Not even the author of her being . Only one thing I do know : Gypsy never grew up to be " timid , " or silly , or mean , or lazy ; but a sensible woman , true and strong ; asking little help of other people , but giving much ; an honor to her brave and loving sex , and a safe comrade to the girls who kept step with her into middle life ; and I trust that I may bespeak from their daughters and their scholars a kindly welcome to an old story , told again .

Miss Cardrew sent Delia Guest to open it . " It 's a -- ha , ha ! letter -- he , he ! for you , " said Delia , coming up to the desk . Exactly wherein lay the joke , in the fact that Miss Cardrew should have a letter , nobody but Delia was capable of seeing ; but Delia was given to seeing jokes on all occasions , under all circumstances . Go wherever you might , from a prayer-meeting to the playground , you were sure to hear her little giggle . " A letter for you , " repeated Delia Guest . " He , he ! " Miss Cardrew laid down her arithmetic , opened the letter , and read it . " Gypsy Breynton . " Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great lull in the schoolroom . " Why I never ! " giggled Delia . Gypsy , all in a flutter at having her name read right out in school , and divided between her horror lest the kitten she had tied to a spool of thread at recess , had been discovered , and an awful suspicion that Mr. Jonathan Jones saw her run across his plowed field after chestnuts , went slowly up to the desk . " Your mother has sent for you to come directly home , " said Miss Cardrew , in a low tone . Gypsy looked a little frightened . " Go home ! Is anybody sick , Miss Cardrew ? " " She does n't say -- she gives no reasons . You 'd better not stop to talk , Gypsy . " Gypsy went to her desk , and began to gather up her books as fast as she could . " I should n't wonder a bit if the house 'd caught afire , " whispered Agnes Gaylord . " I had an uncle once , and his house caught afire -- in the chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had now , true 's you live . " " Maybe your father 's dead , " condoled Sarah Rowe . " Or Winnie . " " Or Tom . " " Just think of it ! " " What do you s'pose it is ? " " If I were you , I guess I 'd be frightened ! " " Order ! " said Miss Cardrew , in a loud voice . The girls stopped whispering , and Gypsy , in nowise reassured by their sympathy , hurried out to put on her things . With her hat thrown on one side of her head , the strings hanging down into her eyes , her sack rolled up in a bundle under her arm , and her rubbers in her pocket , she started for home on the full run . Yorkbury was pretty well used to Gypsy , but everybody stopped and stared at her that morning ; what with her burning cheeks , and those rubbers sticking out of her pocket , and the hat-strings flying , and the brambles catching her dress , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder . " Miss Gypsy ! " called old Mr. Simms , the clerk , as she flew by the door of her father 's book-store . " Miss Gypsy , my dear ! " But on ran Gypsy without so much as giving him a look , across the road in front of a carriage , around a load of hay , and away like a bird down the street . Out ran Gypsy 's pet aversion , Mrs. Surly , from a shop-door somewhere --  " Gypsy Breynton , what a sight you be ! I believe you 've gone clear crazy -- Gypsy ! " " Ca n't stop ! " shouted Gypsy , " it 's a fire or something somewhere . " Eight small boys at the word " fire " appeared on the instant from nobody knew where , and ran after her with hoarse yells of " fire ! fire ! Where 's the engine ? Vi --  -- ir-r- ! " By this time , too , three dogs and a nanny-goat were chasing her ; the dogs were barking , and the nanny-goat was baaing or braying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she swept up to the house in a unique , triumphal procession . Winnie came out to meet her as she came in at the gate panting and scarlet-faced . Fifty years instead of five might Winnie have been at that moment , and all the cares of Church and State on the shoulders of his pinafore , to judge from the pucker in his chin . There was always a pucker in Winnie 's chin , when he felt -- as the boys call it --  " big . " " What do s'pose , Gypsy ?  - -  do n't you wish you knew ? " " What ? " " Oh , no matter . I know . " " Winnie Breynton ! " " Well , " said Winnie , with the air of a Grand Mogul feeding a chicken , " I do n't care if I tell you . We 've had a temmygral . " " A telegram ! " " I just guess we have ; you 'd oughter seen the man . He 'd lost his nose , and --  --  " " A telegram ! Is there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It came from Bosting , " said Winnie , with a superior smile . " I s'posed you knew that ! It 's sumfin about Aunt Miranda , I should n't wonder . " " Aunt Miranda ! Is anybody sick ? Is anybody dead , or anything ? " " I do n't know , " said Winnie , cheerfully . " But I guess you wish you 'd seen the envelope . It had the funniest little letters punched through on top -- it did now , really . " Gypsy ran into the house at that , and left Winnie to his meditations . Her mother called her from over the banisters , and she ran upstairs . A small trunk stood open by the bed , and the room was filled with the confusion of packing . " Your Aunt Miranda is sick , " said Mrs. Breynton . " What are you packing up for ? You 're not going off ! " exclaimed Gypsy , incapable of taking in a greater calamity than that , and quite forgetting Aunt Miranda . " Yes . Your uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very sick , Gypsy . " " Oh ! " said Gypsy , penitently ; " dangerous ? " " Yes . " Gypsy looked sober because her mother did , and she thought she ought to . " Your father and I are going in this noon train , " proceeded Mrs. Breynton , rolling up a pair of slippers , and folding a wrapper away in the trunk . " I think I am needed . The fever is very severe ; possibly -- contagious , " said Mrs. Breynton , quietly . Mrs. Breynton made it a rule to have very few concealments from her children . All family plans which could be , were openly and frankly discussed . She believed that it did the children good to feel that they had a share in them ; that it did them good to be trusted . She never kept bad tidings from them simply because they were bad . The mysteries and prevarications necessary to keep an unimportant secret , were , she reasoned , worse for them than a little anxiety . Gypsy must know some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it from her mother 's lips , see for herself the reasons for this sudden departure and risk , if risk there were , and be woman enough to understand them . Gypsy looked sober now in earnest . " Why , mother ! How can you ? What if you catch it ? " " There is very little chance of that , one possibility in a hundred , perhaps . Help me fold up this dress , Gypsy -- no , on the bed -- so . " " But if you should get sick ! I do n't see why you need go . She is n't your own sister anyway , and she never did anything for us , nor cared anything for us . " " Your uncle wants me , and that is enough . I want to be to her a sister if I can -- poor thing , she has no sister of her own , and no mother , nobody but the hired nurses with her ; and she may die , Gypsy . If I can be of any help , I am glad to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , with which Gypsy knew there was no arguing . She helped her fold her dresses and lock her trunk , very silently , for Gypsy , and then ran away to busy herself with Patty in getting the travelers ' luncheon . When Gypsy felt badly , she always hunted up something to do ; in this she showed the very best of her good sense . And let me tell you , girls , as a little secret -- in the worst fits of the " blues " you ever have , if you are guilty of having any , do you go straight into the nursery and build a block house for the baby , or upstairs and help your mother baste for the machine , or into the dining-room to help Bridget set the table , or into the corner where some diminutive brother is crying over his sums which a very few words from you would straighten , or into the parlor where your father sits shading his eyes from the lamplight , with no one to read him the paper ; and before you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't believe it ? Try and see . Gypsy drowned her sorrow at her mother 's departure , in broiling her mutton-chops and cutting her pie , and by the time the coach drove to the door , and the travelers stood in the entry with bag and baggage , all ready to start , the smiles had come back to her lips , and the twinkle to her eyes . " Good-bye , father ! O-oh , mother Breynton , give me another kiss . There ! one more . Now , if you do n't write just as soon as you get there ! " " Be a good girl , and take nice care of Winnie , " called her mother from the coach-window . And then they were driven rapidly away , and the house seemed to grow still and dark all at once , and a great many clouds to be in the warm , autumn sky . The three children stood a moment in the entry looking forlornly at each other . I beg Tom 's pardon -- I suppose I should have said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never again in his life will Tom feel quite as old as he felt in that sixteenth year . Gypsy was the first to break the dismal silence . " How horrid it 's going to be ! You go upstairs and she wo n't be there , and there 'll be nobody coming home from the store at night , and , then -- you go round , and it 's so still , and nobody but me to keep house , and Patty has just what she likes for breakfast , for all me , and I think Aunt Miranda need n't have gone and been sick , anyway . " " A most sensible and sympathizing niece , " observed Tom , in his patronizing way . " Well , you see , I suppose I do n't care very much about Aunt Miranda , " said Gypsy , confidentially . " I 'm sorry she 's sick , but I did n't have a bit nice time in Boston last vacation , and she scolded me dreadfully when I blew out the gas . What is it , Patty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say , " remarked Winnie , at the rather doleful dinner-table , " look here , Gypsy . " " What ? " Illustration " S'posin ' when they 'd got Aunt Miranda all nailed into her coffin -- tight in -- she should be un-deaded , and open her eyes , and begin -- begin to squeal , you know . S'pose they 'd let her out ? " Just four days from the morning Mrs. Breynton left , Tom came up from the office with a very sober face and a letter . Gypsy ran out to meet him , and put out her hand , in a great hurry to read it . " I 'll read it to you , " said Tom ; " it 's to me . Come into the parlor . " They went in , and Tom read : " My Dear Son : " I write in great haste , just to let you know that your Aunt Miranda is gone . She died last night at nine o'clock , in great distress . I was with her at the last . I am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ; she was so lonely and deserted . The funeral is day after to-morrow , and we shall stay of course . We hope to be home on Monday . There has been no time yet to make any plans ; I ca n't tell what the family will do . Poor Joy can not bear to be left alone a minute . She follows me round like a frightened child . The tears come into my eyes every time I look at her , for the thoughts of three dear , distant faces that might be left just so , but for God 's mercy to them and to me . She is just about Gypsy 's age and height , you know . The disease proved not to be contagious , so you need feel no anxiety . A kiss to both the children . Your father sends much love . We shall be glad to get home and see you again . " Very lovingly , " Mother . " Inside the note was a slip for Gypsy , with this written on it : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little thing your aunt said the day before she died . She had been speaking of Joy in her weak , troubled way -- of some points wherein she hoped she would be a different woman from her mother , and had then lain still a while , her eyes closed , something -- as you used to say when you were a little girl -- very sorry about her mouth , when suddenly she turned and said , ' I wish I 'd made Gypsy 's visit here a little pleasanter . Tell her she must think as well as she can of her auntie , for Joy 's sake , now . ' " Gypsy folded up the paper , and sat silent a moment , thinking her own thoughts , as Tom saw , and not wishing to be spoken to . Those of you who have read " Gypsy Breynton " will understand what these thoughts might be . Those who have not , need only know that Gypsy 's aunt had been rather a gay , careless lady , well dressed and jeweled , and fond enough of dresses and jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long ago , she had been far from thoughtful of her country niece 's comfort . And this was how it had ended . Poor Aunt Miranda ! " Well , " said Gypsy , at last , with something dim in her eyes , " I dare say I was green and awkward , and it was half my fault . I never could understand how people could just turn round when anybody dies , and say they were good and perfect , when it was n't any such a thing , and I ca n't say I think she was , for it would be a lie . But I wo n't say anything more against her . Poor Joy , poor Joy ! Not to have any mother , Tom , just think ! Oh , just think ! " CHAPTER II SHE SHALL COME ? Supper was ready . It had been ready now for ten minutes . The cool , white cloth , bright glass , glittering silver , and delicate china painted with a primrose and an ivy-leaf -- the best china , and very extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion deserved it -- were all laid in their places upon the table . The tea was steeped to precisely the right point ; the rich , mellow flavor had just escaped the clover taste on one side , and the bitterness of too much boiling on the other ; the delicately sugared apples were floating in their amber juices in the round glass preserve-dish , the smoked halibut was done to the most delightful brown crispness , the puffy , golden drop-cakes were smoking from the oven , and Patty was growling as nobody but Patty could growl , for fear they would " slump down intirely an ' be gittin ' as heavy as lead , " before they could be eaten . There was a bright fire in the dining-room grate ; the golden light was dancing a jig all over the walls , hiding behind the curtains , coquetting with the silver , and touching the primroses on the plates to a perfect sunbeam ; for father and mother were coming . Tom and Gypsy and Winnie were all three running to the windows and the door every two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for father and mother were coming . Tom had laughed well at this plan of dressing up -- Gypsy 's notion , of course , and ridiculous enough , said Tom ; fit for babies like Winnie , and girls . ( I wish I could give you in print the peculiar emphasis with which Tom was wont to dwell on this word . ) But for all that , when Gypsy came down in her new Scotch plaid dress , with her cheeks so red , and her hair so smooth and black ; and Winnie strutted across the room counting the buttons on his best jacket , Tom slipped away to his room , and came down with his purple necktie on . It made a pretty , homelike picture -- the bright table and the firelight , and the eager faces at the window , and the gay dresses . Any father and mother might have been glad to call it all their own , and come into it out of the cold and the dark , after a weary day 's journey . These cozy , comfortable touches about it -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes -- were just like Gypsy . Since she was glad to see her father and mother , it was imperatively necessary that she should show it ; there was no danger but what her joy would have been sufficiently evident -- where everything else was -- in her eyes ; but according to Gypsy 's view of matters , it must express itself in some sort of celebration . Whether her mother would n't have been quite as well pleased if her delicate , expensive porcelain had been kept safely in the closet ; whether , indeed , it was exactly right for her to take it out without leave , Gypsy never stopped to consider . When she wanted to do a thing , she could never see any reasons why it should n't be done , like a few other girls I have heard of in New England . However , just such a mother as Gypsy had was quite likely to pardon such a little carelessness as this , for the love in it , and the welcoming thoughts . " They 're comin ' , comin ' , comin ' , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exuberance of his spirits , he was trying very hard to stand on his head , and making a most remarkable failure --  " they 're comin ' lickitycut , and I 'm five years old , ' n ' I 've got on my best jacket , ' n ' they 're comin ' slam bang ! " " Coming , coming , coming ! " echoed Gypsy , about as wild as Winnie himself , and flying past him down to the gate , leaving Tom to follow in Tom 's own dignified way . Such a kissing , and laughing , and talking , and delightful confusion as there was then ! Such a shouldering of bags and valises and shawls , such hurrying of mother in out of the cold ; such a pulling of father 's whiskers , such peeping into mysterious bundles , and pulling off of wrappers , and hurrying Patty with the tea-things ; and questions and answers , and everybody talking at once -- one might have supposed the travelers had been gone a month instead of a week . " My kitty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could find . " And there are some letters for father , " from Tom . " Patty has a new beau , " interrupted Gypsy . " It was an awfully fit , " put in Winnie , undiscouraged ; " she rolled under the stove , ' n ' tell you she squealed , and --  --  " " How is uncle ? " asked Tom , and it was the first time any one had thought to ask . " Then she jumped -- splash ! into the hogshead , " continued Winnie , determined to finish . " He is not very well , " said Mr. Breynton , gravely , and then they sat down to supper , talking the while about him . Winnie subsided in great disgust , and devoted himself , body , mind , and heart , to the drop-cakes . " Ah , the best china , I see , " said Mrs. Breynton , presently , with one of her pleasantest smiles , and as Mrs. Breynton 's smiles were always pleasant , this was saying a great deal . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How pleasant it all seems ! and how glad I am to be at home again . " Gypsy looked radiant -- very much , in fact , like a little sun dropped down from the sky , or a jewel all ablaze . Some mothers would have reproved her for the use of the china ; some who had not quite the heart to reprove would have said they were sorry she had taken it out . Mrs. Breynton would rather have had her handsome plates broken to atoms than to chill , by so much as a look , the glow of the child 's face just then . There was decidedly more talking than eating done at supper , and they lingered long at the table , in the pleasant firelight and lamplight . " It seems exactly like the resurrection day for all the world , " said Gypsy . " The resurrection day ? " " Why , yes . When you went off I kept thinking everybody was dead and buried , all that morning , and it was real horrid -- Oh , you do n't know ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while after supper , when Winnie had gone to bed , and Tom and his father were casting accounts by the fire , " I want to see you a few minutes . " Gypsy , wondering , followed her into the parlor . Mrs. Breynton shut the door , and they sat down together on the sofa . " I want to have a talk with you , Gypsy , about something that we 'd better talk over alone . " " Yes 'm , " said Gypsy , quite bewildered by her mother 's grave manner , and thinking up all the wrong things she had done for a week . Whether it was the time she got so provoked at Patty for having dinner late , or scolded Winnie for trying to paint with the starch ( and if ever any child deserved it , he did ) , or got kept after school for whispering , or brought down the nice company quince marmalade to eat with the blanc mange , or whether --  --  " You have n't asked about your cousin , Joy , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  how is she ? " said Gypsy , looking somewhat ashamed . " I am sorry for the child , " said Mrs. Breynton , musingly . " What 's going to become of her ? Who 's going to take care of her ? " " That is just what I came in here to talk about . " " Why , I do n't see what I have to do with it ! " said Gypsy , astonished . " Her father thinks of going abroad , and so there would be no one to leave her with . He finds himself quite worn out by your aunt 's sickness , the care and anxiety and trouble . His business also requires some member of the firm to go to France this fall , and he has almost decided to go . The only thing that makes him hesitate is Joy . " " I see what you mean now , mother -- I see it in your eyes . You want Joy to come here . " Gypsy spoke in a slow , uncomfortable way , as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Mrs. Breynton , " that is it . " Gypsy 's bright face fell . " Well ? " she said , at last . " I told your uncle , " said her mother , " that I could not decide on the spot , but would let him know next week . The question of Joy 's coming here will affect you more than any member of the family , and I thought it only fair to you that we should talk it over frankly before it is settled . " Gypsy had a vague notion that all mothers would not have been so thoughtful , but she said nothing . " I do not wish , " proceeded Mrs. Breynton , " to make any arrangement in which you can not be happy ; but I have great faith in your kind heart , Gypsy . " " I do n't like Joy , " said Gypsy , bluntly . " I know that , and I am sorry it is so , " said her mother . " I understand just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has not been trained just as you have , Gypsy . She was never taught and helped to be a generous gentle child , as you have been taught and helped . Your uncle and aunt felt differently about these things ; but it is no matter about that now -- you will understand it better when you are older . It is enough for you to know that Joy has great excuse for her faults . Even if they were twice as great as they are , one would n't think much about them now ; the poor child is in great trouble , lonely and frightened and motherless . Think , if God took away your mother , Gypsy . " " But Joy did n't care much about her mother , " said honest Gypsy . " She used to scold her , Joy told me so herself . Besides , I heard her , ever so many times . " " Peace be with the dead , Gypsy ; let all that go . She was all the mother Joy had , and if you had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , you would n't say she did n't love her . " " What was it ? " asked Gypsy . " Your auntie was lying all alone , upstairs . I went in softly , to do one or two little things about the room , thinking no one was there . " One faint gaslight was burning , and in the dimness I saw that the sheet was turned down from the face , and a poor little quivering figure was crouched beside it on the bed . It was Joy . She was sobbing as if her heart would break , and such sobs -- it would have made you cry to hear them , Gypsy . She did n't hear me come in , and she began to talk to the dead face as if it could hear her . Do you want to know what she said ? " Gypsy was looking very hard the other way . She nodded , but did not speak , gulping down something in her throat . " This was what she said -- softly , in Joy 's frightened way , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said she . ' All the other girls have got mothers , and now I wo n't ever have any , any more . I did used to bother you and be cross about my practising , and not do as you told me , and I wish I had n't , and --  " Oh -- hum , look here -- mother , " interrupted Gypsy , jumping up and winking very fast , " is n't there a train up from Boston early Monday morning ? She might come in that , you know . " Mrs. Breynton smiled . " Then she may come , may she ? " " I rather think she may , " said Gypsy , with an emphasis . " I 'll write her a letter and tell her so . " " That will be a good plan , Gypsy . But you are quite sure ? I do n't want you to decide this matter in too much of a hurry . " " She 'll sleep in the front room , of course ? " suggested Gypsy . " No ; if she comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only one servant , I could hardly keep up the extra work that would cause for six months or a year . " " Six months or a year ! In my room ! " Gypsy walked back and forth across the room two or three times , her merry forehead all wrinkled into a knot . " Well , " at last , " I 've said it , and I 'll stick to it , and I 'll try to make her have a good time , anyway . " " Come here , Gypsy . " Gypsy came , and one of those rare , soft kisses -- very different from the ordinary , everyday kisses -- that her mother gave her when she had n't just the words to say how pleased she was , fell on her forehead , and smoothed out the knot before you could say " Jack Robinson . " That very afternoon Gypsy wrote her note to Joy : " Dear Joy : " I 'm real sorry your mother died . You 'd better come right up here next week , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you it 's splendid climbing up . If you 're very careful , you need n't tear your dress very badly . Then there 's the raft , and you might play baseball , too . I 'll teach you . " You see if you do n't have a nice time . I ca n't think of anything more to say . " Your affectionate cousin , " Gypsy . " CHAPTER III ONE EVENING So it was settled , and Joy came . There was no especial day appointed for the journey . Her father was to come up with her as soon as he had arranged his affairs so that he could do so , and then to go directly back to Boston and sail at once . Gypsy found plenty to do , in getting ready for her cousin . This having a roommate for the first time in her life was by no means an unimportant event to her . Her room had always been her own especial private property . Here in a quiet nook on the broad window-sill she had curled herself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked herself in to learn her lessons , and keep her doll 's dressmaking out of Winnie 's way ; here she had gone away alone to have all her " good cries ; " here she sometimes spent a part of her Sabbath evenings with her most earnest and sober thoughts . Here was the mantel-shelf , covered with her little knick-knacks that no one was ever allowed to touch but herself -- pictures framed in pine cones , boxes of shell-work , baskets of wafer-work , cologne-bottles , watchcases , ivy-shoots and minerals , on which the dust accumulated at its own sweet will , and the characteristic variety and arrangement whereof none ever disputed with her . What if Joy should bring a trunkful of ornaments ? There in the wardrobe were her treasures covering six shelves -- her kites and balls of twine , fishlines and doll 's bonnets , scraps of gay silk and jackknives , old compositions and portfolios , colored paper and dried moss , pieces of chalk and horse-chestnuts , broken jewelry and marbles . It was a curious collection . One would suppose it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girl , in which the boy decidedly predominated . Illustration Into this wardrobe Gypsy looked regretfully . Three of those shelves -- those precious shelves -- must be Joy 's now . And what should be done with the things ? Then there were the bureau drawers . What sorcerer 's charms , to say nothing of the somewhat unwilling fingers of a not very enthusiastic little girl , could cram the contents of four ( and those so full that they were overflowing through the cracks ) into two ? Moreover , as any one acquainted with certain chapters in Gypsy 's past history will remember , her premises were not always celebrated for the utmost tidiness . And here was Joy , used to her elegant carpets and marble-covered bureaus , and gas-fixtures and Cochituate , with servants to pick up her things for her ever since she was a baby ! How shocked she would be at the dust , and the ubiquitous slippers , and the slips and shreds on the carpet ; and how should she have the least idea what it was to have to do things yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and emptied the bureau drawers , and squeezed away the treasures into three shelves , and did her best to make the room look pleasant and inviting to the little stranger . In fact , before she was through with the work she became really very much interested in it . She had put a clean white quilt upon the bed , and looped up the curtain with a handsome crimson ribbon , taken from the stock in the wardrobe . She had swept and dusted every corner and crevice ; she had displayed all her ornaments to the best advantage , and put fresh cologne in the bottles . She had even brought from some sanctum , where it was folded away in the dark , a very choice silk flag about four inches long , that she had made when the war began , and was keeping very tenderly to wear when Richmond was taken , and pinned it up over her looking-glass . On the table , too , stood her Parian vase filled with golden and blood-red maple-leaves , and the flaming berries of the burning-bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , and Gypsy was quite proud of it . Joy came Thursday night . They were all in the parlor when the coach stopped , and Gypsy ran out to meet her . A pale , sickly , tired-looking child , draped from head to foot in black , came up the steps clinging to her father 's hand , and fretting over something or other about the baggage . Gypsy was springing forward to meet her , but stopped short . The last time she had seen Joy , she was in gay Stuart-plaid silk and corals . She had forgotten all about the mourning . How thin and tall it made Joy look ! Gypsy remembered herself in a minute and threw her arms warmly around Joy 's neck . But Joy did not return the embrace , and gave her only one cold kiss . She had inferred from Gypsy 's momentary hesitation that she was not glad to see her . Gypsy , on her part , thought Joy was proud and disagreeable . Thus the two girls misunderstood each other at the very beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gypsy . " I thought we never should get here ! " said Joy , petulantly . " The cars were so dusty , and your coach jolts terribly . I should n't think the town would use such an old thing . " Gypsy 's face fell , and her welcome grew faint . Joy had but little to say at supper . She sat by her father and ate her muffins like a very hungry , tired child -- like a very cross child , Gypsy thought . Joy 's face was always pale and fretful ; in the bright lamplight now , after the exhaustion of the long journey , it had a pinched , unpleasant look . " Hem , " coughed Tom , over his teacup . Gypsy looked up and their eyes met . That look said unutterable things . Illustration If it had not been for Mrs. Breynton , that supper would have been a dismal affair . But she had such a cozy , comfortable way about her , that nobody could help being cozy and comfortable if they tried hard for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone away into the library for a talk by themselves , and Joy began to feel somewhat rested , she brightened up wonderfully , and became really quite entertaining in her account of her journey . She thought Vermont looked cold and stupid , however , and did n't remember having noticed much about the mountains , for which Gypsy thought she should never forgive her . But there was at least one thing Gypsy found out that evening to like about Joy . She loved her father dearly . One could not help noticing how restless she was while he was out of the room , and how she watched the door for him to come back ; how , when he did come , she stole away from her aunt and sat down by him , slipping her hand softly into his . As he had been all her life the most indulgent and patient of fathers , and was going , early to-morrow morning , thousands of miles away from her into thousands of unknown dangers , it was no wonder . While it was still quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , and besides , she wanted to unpack a few of her things . So Gypsy lighted the lamp and went up with her . " So I am to sleep with you , " said Joy , as they opened the door , in by no means the happiest of tones , though they were polite enough . " Yes . Mother thought it was better . See , is n't my room pretty ? " said Gypsy , eagerly , thinking how pleased Joy would be with the little welcome of its fresh adornments . " Oh , is this it ? " Gypsy stopped short , the hot color rushing all over her face . " Of course , it is n't like yours . We ca n't afford marble bureaus and Brussels carpets , but I thought you 'd like the maple-leaves , and I brought out the flag on purpose because you were coming . " " Flag ! Where ? Oh , yes . I have one ten times as big as that at home , " said Joy , and then she too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . Astonished and puzzled , wondering what she had done , Joy turned away to unpack , when her eye fell on the vase with its gorgeous leaves and berries , and she cried out in real delight : " O -- oh , how pretty ! Why , we do n't have anything like this in Boston . " But Gypsy was only half comforted . Joy unlocked her trunk then , and for a few minutes they chatted merrily over the unpacking . Where is the girl that does n't like to look at pretty clothes ? and where is the girl that does n't like to show them if they happen to be her own ? Joy 's linen was all of the prettiest pattern , with wonderful trimmings and embroideries such as Gypsy had seldom seen : her collars and undersleeves were of the latest fashion , and fluted with choice laces ; her tiny slippers were tufted with velvet bows , and of her nets and hair-ribbons there was no end . Gypsy looked on without a single pang of envy , contrasting them with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad , in Gypsy 's own generous fashion , that Joy had them . " I had pretty enough things when you were in Boston , " said Joy , unfolding her heavy black dresses with their plain folds of bombazine and crape . " Now I ca n't wear anything but this ugly black . Then there are all my corals and malachites just good for nothing . Madame St. Denis -- she 's the dressmaker -- said I could n't wear a single thing but jet , and jet makes me look dreadfully brown . " Gypsy hung up the dress that was in her hand and walked over to the window . She felt very much as if somebody had been drawing a file across her front teeth . She could not have explained what was the matter . Somehow she seemed to see a quick picture of her own mother dying and dead , and herself in the sad , dark dresses . And how Joy could speak so -- how she could ! " Oh -- only two bureau drawers ! Why did n't you give me the two upper ones ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away her collars and boxes . " Because my things were in there , " said Gypsy . " But your things were in the lower ones just as much . " " I like the upper drawers best , " said Gypsy , shortly . " So do I , " retorted Joy . The hot color rushed over Gypsy 's face for the second time , but now it was a somewhat angry color . " It was n't very pleasant to have to give up any , and there are all those wardrobe shelves I had to take my things off from too , and I do n't think you 've any right to make a fuss . " " That 's polite ! " said Joy , with a laugh . Gypsy knew it was n't , but for that very reason she would n't say so . One more subject of dispute came up almost before this was forgotten . When they were all ready to go to bed , Joy wanted the front side . " But that 's where I always sleep , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back side and I ca n't breathe , " said Joy . " Neither can I , " said Gypsy . " I never can get to sleep if I do n't have the place I 'm used to , " said Joy . " You can just as well as I can , " said Gypsy . " Besides , it 's my bed . " This last argument appeared to be unanswerable , and Gypsy had it her way . She thought it over before she went to sleep , which was not very soon ; for Joy was restless , and tossed on her pillow , and talked in her dreams . Of course the front side and the upper drawers belonged to her -- yes , of course . She had only taken her rights . She would be obliged to anybody to show her where she was to blame . Joy went to sleep without any thoughts , and therein lay just the difference . CHAPTER IV CHESTNUTS Something woke Gypsy very early the next morning . She started up , and saw Joy standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed and shivering with the cold . " Well , I never ! " said Gypsy . " What 's the matter ? " " What on earth have you got your dress on in the middle of the night for ? " " It is n't night ; it 's morning . " " Morning ! it is n't any such a thing . " " ' T is , too . I heard the clock strike five ever so long ago . " Gypsy had fallen back on the pillow , almost asleep again . She roused herself with a little jump . " See here ! " " Ow ! how you frightened me , " said Joy , with another jump . Illustration " Did I ? Oh , well "  - -  silence . " I do n't see "  - -  another silence --  " what you wear my rubber -- rubber boots for . " " Your rubber boots ! Gypsy Breynton , you 're sound asleep . " " Asleep ! " said Gypsy , sitting up with a jerk , and rubbing both fists into her eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , why , you 're dressed ! " " Just found that out ? " Joy broke into a laugh , and Gypsy , now quite awake , joined in it merrily . For the first time a vague notion came to her that she was rather glad Joy came . It might be some fun , after all , to have somebody round all the time to -- in that untranslatable girls ' phrase --  " carry on with . " " But I do n't see what 's up , " said Gypsy , winking and blinking like an owl to keep her eyes open . " Why , I was afraid father 'd get off before I was awake , so I was determined he should n't . I guess I kept waking up pretty much all night to see if it was n't time . " " I wish he did n't have to go , " said Gypsy . She felt sorry for Joy just then , seeing this best side of her that she liked . For about a minute she wished she had let her have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very early train , and it was still hardly light when he sat down to his hurried breakfast , with Joy close by him , that pale , pinched look on her face , and so utterly silent that Gypsy was astonished . She would have thought she cared nothing about her father 's going , if she had not seen her standing in the gray light upstairs . " Joyce , my child , you have n't eaten a mouthful , " said her father . " I ca n't . " " Come , dear , do , just a little , to please father . " Joy put a spoonful of tea to her lips , and put it down . Presently there was a great rumbling of wheels outside , and the coachman rang the door-bell . " Well , Joy . " Joy stood up , but did not speak . Her father , holding her close in his arms , drew her out with him into the entry . Mrs. Breynton turned away ; so did Gypsy and the rest . In a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and then her father called out to them with his cheerful good-byes , and then he was in the coach , and the door was shut . Gypsy stole into the parlor . Joy was standing there alone by the window . " Why do n't you cry ? " said Gypsy ; " I would . " " I do n't want to , " said Joy , moving away . Her sorrow at parting with her father made her fretful that morning . This was Joy 's way . She had inherited her mother 's fashion of taking trouble . Gypsy did not understand it , and her sympathy cooled a little . Still she really wanted to do something to make her happy , and so she set about it in the only ways she knew . " See here , Joy , " she called , merrily , after breakfast , " let 's come out and have a good time . I have lots and lots to show you out in the barn and round . Then there is all Yorkbury besides , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chickens or walk out on the ridge-pole ? " " On the what ? " " On the ridge-pole ; that 's the top of the roof , you know , over the kitchen . Tom and I go out there ever so much . " " Oh , I 'd rather see the chickens . I should think you 'd kill yourself walking on roofs . Wait till I get my gloves . " " Oh , you do n't want gloves in Yorkbury , " said Gypsy , with a very superior air . " That 's nothing but a Boston fashion . Slip on your hat and sack in a jiff , and come along . " " I shall tan my hands , " said Joy , reluctantly , as they went out . " Besides , I do n't know what a jiff is . " " A jiff is -- why , it 's short for jiffy , I suppose . " " But what 's a jiffy ? " persisted Joy . " Could n't tell you , " said Gypsy , with a bubbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a terrible hurry . Tom says it ever so much . " " I should n't think your mother would let you use boys ' talk , " said Joy . Gypsy sometimes stood in need of some such hint as this , but she did not relish it from Joy . By way of reply she climbed up the post of the clothesline . Joy thought the chickens were pretty , but they had such long legs , and such a silly way of squealing when you took them up , as if you were going to murder them . Besides she was afraid she should step on them . So they went into the barn , and Gypsy exhibited Billy and Bess and Clover with the talent of a Barnum and the pride of a queen . Billy was the old horse who had pulled the family to church through the sand every Sunday since the children were babies , and Bess and Clover were white-starred , gentle-eyed cows , who let Gypsy pull their horns and tickle them with hay , and make pencil-marks on their white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy 's strange face with great musing beautiful brown eyes . But Joy was afraid they would hook her , and she did n't like to be in a barn . " What ! not tumble on the hay ! " cried Gypsy , half way up the ladder into the loft . " Just see what a quantity there is of it . Did you ever know such a quantity ? Father lets me jump on it ' cause I do n't hurt the hay -- very much . " No . Joy could n't possibly climb up the ladder . Well , Gypsy would help her then . By a little maneuvering she persuaded Joy to step up three rounds , and she herself stood behind her and began to walk up . Joy screamed and stood still . " Go ahead -- you ca n't stop now . I 'll keep hold of you , " said Gypsy , choking with laughter , and walking on . There was nothing for Joy to do but climb , unless she chose to be walked over , so up they went , she screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do is just to get up on the beams and jump off , " said Gypsy , up there , and peering down from among the cobwebs , and flying through the air , almost before the words were off from her lips . But Joy would n't hear of getting into such a dusty place . She took two or three dainty little rolls on the hay , but the dried clover got into her hair and mouth and eyes , and she was perfectly sure there was a spider down her neck ; so Gypsy was glad at last to get her safely down the ladder and out doors . After that they tried the raft . Gypsy 's raft was on a swamp below the orchard , and it was one of her favorite amusements to push herself about over the shallow water . But Joy was afraid of wetting her feet , or getting drowned , or something -- she did n't exactly know what , so they gave that up . Then Gypsy proposed a game of marbles on the garden path . She played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Joy was shocked at the idea . That was a boy 's play ! " What will you do , then ? " said Gypsy , a little crossly . Joy replied in the tone of a martyr , that she was sure she did not know . Gypsy coughed , and walked up and down on the garden fence in significant silence . Joy was not to go to school till Monday . Meantime she amused herself at home with her aunt , and Gypsy went as usual without her . Saturday afternoon was the perfect pattern of an autumn afternoon . A creamy haze softened the sharp outline of the mountains , and lay cloudlike on the fields . The sunlight fell through it like sifted gold , the sky hung motionless and blue -- that glowless , deepening blue that always made Gypsy feel , she said , " as if she must drink it right up "  - -  and away over miles of field and mountain slope the maples crimsoned and flamed . Gypsy came home at noon with her hat hanging down her neck , her cheeks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of breath ; rushing up the steps , tearing open the door , and slamming into the parlor . " Look here !  -- everybody -- where are you ? What do you think ? Joy ! Mother ! There 's going to be a great chestnutting . " " A what ? " asked Joy , dropping her embroidery . " A chestnutting , up at Mr. Jonathan Jones 's trees , this afternoon at two o'clock . Did you ever hear anything so perfectly mag ? "  - -  mag being " Gypsy " for magnificent . " Who are to make the party ? " asked her mother . " Oh , I and Sarah Rowe and Delia Guest and -- and Sarah Rowe and I , " said Gypsy , talking very fast . " And Joy , " said Mrs. Breynton , gently . " Joy , of course . That 's what I came in to say . " " Oh , I do n't care to go if you do n't want me , " said Joy , with a slighted look . " But I do want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Joy , somewhat mollified , " I 'll go if there are n't any spiders . " The two girls equipped themselves with tin pails , thick boots and a lunch-basket , and started off in high spirits at precisely half-past one . Joy had a remarkably vague idea of what she was going to do , but she felt unusually good-natured , as who could help feeling , with such a sunlight as that and such distant glories of the maple-trees , and such shadows melting on the mountains ! " I want to go chestnotting , too-o-o ! " called Winnie , disconsolate , in the doorway . " No , Winnie , you could n't , possibly , " said Gypsy , pleasantly , sorry to disappoint him ; but she was quite too well acquainted with Winnie to undertake a nutting party in his company . " Oh , yes , do let 's take him ; he 's so cunning , " said Joy . Joy was totally unused to children , having never had brothers and sisters of her own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop in any of his characteristic methods . Moreover , he had speedily discovered that Joy laughed at everything he said ; even his most ordinary efforts in the line of wit ; and that she gave him lumps of sugar when she thought of it ; and therefore he had been on his best behavior whenever she was about . " He 's so terribly cunning , " repeated Joy ; " I guess he wo n't do any hurt . " " I wo n't do any hurt , " put in Winnie ; " I 'm real cunnin ' , Gypsy . " " You may do as you like , of course , " said Gypsy . " I know he will make trouble and spoil all the party , and the girls would scold me ' cause I brought him . I 've tried it times enough . If you 're a mind to take care of him , I suppose you can ; but you see if you do n't repent your bargain . " Gypsy was perfectly right ; she was not apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tramp as this was not at all suited to his capacities of feet or temper , and if his mother had been there she would have managed to make him happy in staying home . But Winnie had received quite too much encouragement ; he had no thought of giving up his bargain now . " Gypsy Breynton , you just need n't talk . I 'm goin ' chestnotting . I 'm five years old . I 'm goin ' with cousin Joy , and I 'll eat just as many chestnots as you or anybody else , now ! " Gypsy had not the slightest doubt of that , and the three started off together . They met Sarah Rowe and Delia on the way , and Gypsy introduced them . " This is my cousin Joy , and this is Sarah . That one in the shaker bonnet is Delia Guest . Oh , I forgot . Joy 's last name is Breynton , and Sarah is Sarah Rowe . " Joy bowed in her prim , cityish way , and Sarah and Delia were so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Delia stared rudely at her black dress . There was an awkward silence . " Why do n't you talk , somebody ? " broke out Gypsy , getting desperate . " Anybody 'd think we were three mummies in a museum . " " I do n't think you 're very perlite , " put in Winnie , with a virtuous frown ; " if you do n't let me be a dummy , too , I 'll tell mother , and that would make four . " This broke the ice , and Sarah and Delia began to talk very fast about Monday 's grammar lesson , and Miss Cardrew , and how Agnes Gaylord put a green snake in Phoebe Hunt 's lunch-basket , and had to stay after school for it , and how it was confidently reported in mysterious whispers , at recess , that George Castles told Mr. Guernsey he was a regular old fogy , and Mr. Guernsey had sent home a letter to his father -- not Mr. Guernsey 's father , but George 's ; he had now , true 's you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this was very interesting , for she had not been into the schoolroom yet , and did n't know George Castles and Agnes Gaylord from Adam ; and somehow or other it never occurred to Gypsy to introduce some subject in which they could all take part ; and so somehow it came about that Joy fell behind with Winnie , and the three girls went on together all the way to Mr. Jones 's grove . " Is n't it splendid ? " called Gypsy , turning around . " I 'm having a real nice time . " " Ye -- es , " said Joy , dolefully ; " I guess I shall like it better when we get to the chestnuts . " Nothing particular happened on the way , except that when they were crossing Mr. Jonathan 's plowed field , Winnie stuck in the mud tight , and when he was pulled out he left his shoes behind him ; that he repeated this pleasing little incident six consecutive times within five minutes , varying it by lifting up his voice to weep , in Winnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying him in her arms the whole way . Be it here recorded that Joy 's ideal of " cherubic childhood , " Winnie standing as representative cherub , underwent then and there several modifications . " Here we are ! " cried Gypsy at last , clearing a low fence with a bound . " Just see the leaves and the sky . Is n't it just -- oh ! " It was , indeed " just , " and there it stopped ; there did n't seem to be any more words to say about it . The chestnut-trees were clustered on a small , rocky knoll , their golden-brown leaves fluttering in the sunlight , their great , rich , bursting green burs bending down the boughs and dropping to the ground . Around them and among them a belt of maples stood up like blazing torches sharp against the sky -- yellow , scarlet , russet , maroon , and crimson veined with blood , all netted and laced together , and floating down upon the wind like shattered jewels . Beyond , the purple mountains , and the creamy haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make younger and older than these four girls stand still with deepening eyes . For about a half minute nobody spoke , and I venture to say the four different kinds of thoughts they had just then would make a pretty bit of a poem . Whatever they were , a fearfully unromantic and utterly indescribable howl from Winnie put an unceremonious end to them . " O-oh ! ugh ! ah ! Gypsy ! Joy ! I 've got catched onto my buttons . My head 's tippin ' over the wrong way . Boo-hoo-hoo ! Gypsy ! " The girls turned , and stood transfixed , and screamed till they lost their breath , and laughed till they cried . Winnie , not being of a sentimental turn of mind , had regarded unmoved the flaming glories of the maple-leaves , and being influenced by the more earthly attractions of the chestnuts , had conceived the idea of seizing advantage of the girls ' unpractical rapture to be the first on the field , and take entire and lawful possession thereof . Therefore had he made all manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he stuck fast between two bars , balanced like a see-saw , his head going up and his feet going down , his feet going up and his head going down . Gypsy pulled him out as well as she could between her spasms of laughter . " I do n't see anythin ' to laugh at , " said Winnie , severely . " If you do n't stop laughin ' I 'll go way off into the woods and be a Injun and never come home any more , and build me a house with a chimney to it , ' n ' have baked beans for supper ' n ' lots of chestnots , and a gun and a pistol , and I wo n't give you any ! Goin ' to stop laughin ' ? " It did not take long to pick up the nuts that the wind and the frost had already strewn upon the ground , and everybody enjoyed it but Joy . She pricked her unaccustomed fingers on the sharp burs , and did n't like the nuts when she had tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnuts we have in Boston , " she said ; " ours are soft like potatoes . " " Oh dear , oh dear , she thought they grew boiled ! " and there was a great laugh . Joy colored , and did not relish it very much . Gypsy was too busy pulling off her burs to notice this . Presently the ground was quite cleared . " Now we must climb , " said Gypsy . Gypsy was always the leader in their plays ; always made all their plans . Sarah Rowe was her particular friend , and thought everything Gypsy did about right , and seldom opposed her . Delia never opposed anybody . " Oh , I do n't know how to climb , " said Joy , shrinking and shocked . " But I 'll show you . This is n't anything ; these branches are just as low as they can be . Here , I 'll go first and help you , and Sarah can come next . " So up went Gypsy , nimble as a squirrel , over the low-hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy ! I ca n't wait . " Joy trembled and screamed , and came . She crawled a little ways up the lowest of the branches , and stopped , frightened by the motion . " Catch hold of the upper bough and stand up ; then you can walk it , " called Gypsy , half out of sight now among the thick leaves . Joy did as she was told -- her feet slipped , the lower branch swung away from under her , and there she hung by both hands in mid-air . She was not more than four feet from the ground , and could have jumped down without the slightest difficulty , but that she was altogether too frightened to do . So she swung back and forth like a lantern , screaming as loud as she could scream . Gypsy was peculiarly sensitive to anything funny , and she quite forgot that Joy was really frightened ; indeed , used as she was to the science of tree-climbing all her life , that a girl could hang within four feet of the ground , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jump , Joy , jump ! " she called , between her shouts of laughter . " No , no , do n't , you might break your arm , " cried Delia Guest , who had n't the slightest scruple about telling a falsehood if she were going to have something to laugh at by the means . Poor Joy was between Scylla and Charybdis . ( If you do n't know what that means , go and ask your big brothers ; make them leave their chess and their newspapers on the spot , and read you what Mr. Virgil has to say about it . ) If she hung on she would wrench her arms ; if she jumped , she should break them . She hung , screaming , as long as she could , and dropped when she could hang no longer , looking about in an astonishment that was irresistibly funny , at finding herself alive and unhurt on the soft moss . The girls were still laughing too hard to talk . Joy stood up with a very red face and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you goin ? " called Gypsy from the branches . " Home , " said Joy . " Oh , do n't ; come , we wo n't laugh any mote . Come back , and you need n't climb . You can stay underneath and pick up while we throw down . " " No ; I 've had enough of it . I do n't like chestnutting , and I do n't like to be laughed at , either . I sha n't stay any longer . " " I 'm real sorry , " said Gypsy . " I could n't help laughing at you , you did look so terribly funny . Oh , dear , you ought to have seen yourself ! I wish you would n't go . If you do , you can find the way alone , I suppose . " " I suppose so , " said Joy , doubtfully . " Well , you 'd better take Winnie ; you know you brought him , and I ca n't keep him here . It would spoil everything . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . " Winnie ! Win -- nie ! " There was a great splash somewhere , and a curious bubbling sound , but where it came from nobody could tell . All at once Delia broke into something between a laugh and a scream . " O -- oh , I see ! Look there -- down in that ditch beyond the elder-bushes -- quick ! " Rising up into the air out of the muddy ground , without any visible support whatever , were a pair of feet -- Winnie 's feet , unmistakably , because of their copper toes and tagless shoestrings -- and kicking frantically back and forth . " Only that and nothing more . " " Why , where 's the -- rest of him ? " said Joy , blankly . At this instant Gypsy darted past her with a sudden movement , flew down the knoll , and began to pull at the mysterious feet as if for dear life . " Why , what is she doing ? " cried all the girls in a breath . As they spoke , up came Winnie entire into the air , head down , dripping , drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy shook him and pounded him on the back till his breath came , and when she found there was no harm done , she set him down on a stone , wiped the mud off from his face , and threw herself down on the grass as if she could n't stand up another minute . " Crying ? Why , no ; she 's laughing . Did you ever ? " And down ran the girls to see what was the matter . At the foot of the knoll was a ditch of black mud . In the middle of this ditch was a round hole two feet deep , which had been dug at some time to collect water for the cattle pasturing in the field to drink . Into this hole , Winnie , in the course of some scientific investigations as to the depth of the water , had fallen , unfortunately , the wrong end foremost , and there he certainly would have drowned if Gypsy had not seen him just when she did . But he was not drowned ; on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and what might have been a tragedy , and a very sad one , had become , as Gypsy said , " too funny for anything . " Winnie , however , " did n't see it , " and began to cry lustily to go home . " It 's fortunate you were just going , " said Gypsy . " I 'll just fill my pail , and then I 'll come along and very likely overtake you . " Probably Joy did n't fancy this arrangement any too well , but she remembered that it was her own plan to take the child ; therefore she said nothing , and she and Winnie started off forlornly enough . About five o'clock Gypsy walked slowly up the yard with her pail full of nuts , her hat in her hand , and a gay wreath of maple-leaves on her head . With her bright cheeks and twinkling eyes , and the broad leaves casting their gorgeous shadows of crimson and gold upon her forehead , she made a pretty picture -- almost too pretty to scold . Tom met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy , and you could see in his eyes just then what he thought of her . " What a little --  --  " he began , all ready for a frolic , and stopped , and grew suddenly grave . " Where are Joy and Winnie ? " " Have n't they come ? " " No . " CHAPTER V GYPSY MAKES A DISCOVERY Gypsy turned very pale . " Where are they ? " persisted Tom . And just then her mother came out from the parlor . " Why , Gypsy , where are the children ? " " I 'm afraid Joy did n't know the way , " said Gypsy , slowly . " Did you let her come home alone ? " " Yes 'm . She was tired of the chestnuts , and Winnie fell into the ditch . Oh , mother ! " Mrs. Breynton did not say one word . She began to put on her things very fast , and Tom hurried up to the store for his father . They hunted everywhere , through the fields and in the village ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one had seen a girl in black , with a little boy . There were plenty of girls , and an abundance of little boys to be found at a great variety of places , but most of the girls wore green-checked dresses , and the boys were in ragged jackets . Gypsy retraced every step of the way carefully from the roadside to the chestnut-trees . Mr. Jonathan Jones , delighted that he had actually caught somebody on his plowed land , came running down with a terrible scolding on his lips . But when he saw Gypsy 's utterly wretched face and heard her story , he helped her instead to search the chestnut grove and the surrounding fields all over . But there was not a flutter of Joy 's black dress , not an echo of Winnie 's cry . The sunset was fading fast in the west , long shadows were slanting down the valley , and the blaze of the maples was growing faint . On the mountains it was quite blotted out by the gathering darkness . " What shall I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her heart , how cold the nights were now , and how early it grew quite dark . " Hev you been ' long that ere cross-road ' t opens aout through the woods onto the three-mile square ? " asked Mr. Jonathan . " I 've been a thinkin ' o n't as heow the young uns might ha took that ere ef they was flustered beout knowin ' the way neow mos ' likely . " " Oh , what a splendid , good man you are ! " said Gypsy , jumping up and down , and clapping her hands with delight . " Nobody thought of that , and I 'll never run over your plowed-up land again as long as ever I live , and I 'm going right to tell father , and you see if I do ! " Her father wondered that they had not thought of it , and old Billy was harnessed in a hurry , and they started for the three-mile cross-roads . Gypsy went with them . Nobody spoke to her except to ask questions now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they started for home . Gypsy leaned back in the carriage , peering out into the gloom on either side , calling Joy 's name now and then , or Winnie 's , and busy with her own wretched thoughts . Whatever they were , she did not very soon forget them . It was very dark now , and very cold ; the crisp frost glistened on the grass , and an ugly-looking red moon peered over the mountain . It seemed to Gypsy like a great , glaring eye , that was singling her out and following her , and asking , " Where are Joy and Winnie ? " over and over . " Gypsy Breynton , Gypsy Breynton , where are Joy and Winnie ? " She turned around with her back to it , so as not to see it . Once they passed an old woman on the road hobbling along with a stick . Mr. Breynton reined up and asked if she had seen anything of two children . " Haow ? " said the old woman . " Have you seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , I do n't have none this time o ' year , an ' I do n't know what business it is o ' yourn , nuther . " " Children ! " shouted Mr. Breynton ; " two children , a boy and a girl . " " Speak a little louder , ca n't you ? I 'm deaf , " said the old woman . " Have you -- seen **30;3341;TOOLONG little boy , and a girl in black ? " " Chickens ? black chickens ? " said the old woman , with an angry shake of the head ; " no , I hai n't got no chickens for yer . My pullet 's white , and I set a heap o n't an ' would n't sell it to nobody as come askin ' oncivil questions of a lone , lorn widdy . Besides , the cat eat it up las ' week , feathers ' n ' all . " Mr. Breynton concluded there was not much information to be had in that quarter , and drove on . A little way farther they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Breynton stopped again and repeated his questions . " How many of ' em ? " asked the boy , with a thoughtful look . " Two , a boy and a girl . " " Two ? " " Yes . " " A boy and a girl ? " " Yes . " " You said one was a boy and t' other was a girl ? " repeated the small boy , looking very bright . " Yes . The boy was quite small , and the girl wore a black dress . They 're lost , and we 're trying to find them . " " Be you , now , really ! " said the small boy , apparently struck with sudden and overwhelming admiration . " That is terribly good in you . Seems to me now I reckon I see two young uns ' long here somewhars , did n't I ? Le ' me see . " " Oh , where , where ? " cried Gypsy . " Oh , I 'm so glad ! Did the little boy have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waal , now , seems as ef ' t was somethin ' like that . " " And the girl wore a hat and a long veil ? " pursued Gypsy , eagerly . " Was she about the height of this girl here , and whereabouts did you see her ? " asked Tom . " Waal , could n't tell exactly ; somewhars between here an ' the village , I reckon . Seems to me she did have a veil or suthin ' . " " And she was real pale ? " cried Gypsy , " and the boy was dreadfully muddy ? " " Could n't say as to that "  - -  the small boy began to hesitate and look very wise --  " do n't seem to remember the mud , and on the whole , I ai n't partiklar sure ' bout the veil . Oh , come to think o n't , it was n't a gal ; it was a deaf old woman , an ' there war n't no boy noways . " Well was it for the small boy that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out of the reach of Tom 's whip-lash . It grew darker and colder , and the red moon rode on silently in the sky . They had come now to the opening of the cross-road , but there were no signs of the children -- only the still road and the shadows under the trees . " Hark ! what 's that ? " said Mr. Breynton , suddenly . He stopped the carriage , and they all listened . A faint , sobbing sound broke the silence . Gypsy leaned over the side of the carriage , peering in among the trees where the shadow was blackest . " Father , may I get out a minute ? " She sprang over the wheel , ran into the cross-road , into a clump of bushes , pushed them aside , screamed for joy . " Here they are , here they are -- quick , quick ! Oh , Winnie Breynton , do just wake up and let me look at you ! Oh , Joy , I am so glad ! " And there on the ground , true enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnie sound asleep in her lap . " I did n't know the way , and Winnie kept telling me wrong , and , oh , I was so tired , and I sat down to rest , and it is so dark , and -- and oh , I thought nobody 'd ever come ! " And poor Joy sprang into her uncle 's arms , and cried as hard as she could cry . Joy was thoroughly tired and chilled ; it seemed that she had had to carry Winnie in her arms a large part of the way , and the child was by no means a light weight . Evidently , Master Winnie had taken matters pretty comfortably throughout , having had , Joy said , the utmost confidence in his own piloting , declaring " it was just the next house , right around the corner , Joy ; how stupid in her not to know ! he knew all the whole of it just as well as anything , " and was none the worse for the adventure . Gypsy tried to wake him up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted her with the characteristic reply , " Naughty ! " and that was all that was to be had from him . So he was rolled up warmly on the carriage floor ; they drove home as fast as Billy would go , and the two children , after a hot supper and a great many kisses , were put snugly to bed . After Joy was asleep , Mrs. Breynton said she would like to see Gypsy a few moments downstairs . " Yes 'm , " said Gypsy , and came slowly down . They sat down in the dining-room alone . Mrs. Breynton drew up her rocking-chair by the fire , and Gypsy took the cricket . There was a silence . Gypsy had an uncomfortable feeling that her mother was waiting for her to speak first . She kicked off her slipper , and put it on ; she rattled the tongs , and pounded the hearth with the poker ; she smoothed her hair out of her eyes , and folded up her handkerchief six times ; she looked up sideways at her mother ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out --  " I suppose you want me to say I 'm sorry . Well , I am . But I do n't see why I 'm to blame , I 'm sure . " " I have n't said you were to blame , " said her mother , quietly . " You know I have had no time yet to hear what happened this afternoon , and I thought you would like to tell me . " " Well , " said Gypsy , " I 'd just as lief ; " and Gypsy looked a little , a very little , as if she had n't just as lief at all . " You see , ' in the first place and commencing , ' as Winnie says , Joy wanted to take him . Now , she does n't know anything about that child , not a thing , and if she 'd taken him to places as much as I have , and had to lug him home screaming all the way , I guess she would have stopped wanting to , pretty quick , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother ; and then Joy would n't talk going over , either . " " Whom did she walk with ? " interrupted Mrs. Breynton . " Why , with Winnie , I believe . Of course she might have come on with Sarah and Delia and me if she 'd wanted to , but -- I do n't know --  --  " " Very well , " said Mrs. Breynton , " go on . " " Then , you see , Joy did n't like chestnuts , and could n't climb , and -- oh , Winnie kept losing his shoes , and got stuck in the fence , and you never saw anything so funny ! And then Joy could n't climb , and she just hung there swinging ; and now , mother , I could n't help laughing to save me , it was so exactly like a great pendulum with hoops on . Well , Joy was mad ' cause we laughed and all , and so she said she 'd go home . Then -- let me see -- oh , it was after that , Winnie tumbled into the ditch , splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought I should go off to see him . " " But what about Joy ? " " Oh , well , Joy took Winnie -- he was so funny and muddy , you do n't know -- 'cause she brought him , you know , and so they came home , and I thought she knew the way as much as could be , and I guess that 's all . " " Well , " said her mother , after a pause , " what do you think about it ? " " About what ? " " Do you think you have done just right , Gypsy ? " " I do n't see why not , " said Gypsy , uneasily . " It was perfectly fair Joy should take Winnie , and of course I was n't bound to give up my nutting party and come home , just for her . " " I 'm not speaking of what is fair , Gypsy . Strictly speaking , Joy had her rights , and you had yours , and the arrangement might have been called fair enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little selfish ? " Gypsy opened her eyes wide . Honestly she might have said she did n't know . She was by nature a generous child , and the charge of selfishness was seldom brought against her . Plenty of faults she had , but they were faults of quick temper and carelessness . Of deliberate selfishness it had scarcely ever occurred to her that anybody could think her capable . So she echoed --  " Selfish ! " in simple surprise . " Just look at it , " said her mother , gently ; " Joy was your visitor , a stranger , feeling awkward and unhappy , most probably , with the girls whom you knew so well , and not knowing anything about the matters which you talked over . You might , might you not , have by a little effort made her soon feel at home and happy ? Instead of that , you went off with the girls , and let her fall behind , with nobody but Winnie to talk to . " Gypsy 's face turned to a sudden crimson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy , and with the care of Winnie and all , it is no wonder she did not find it very pleasant , and she had never climbed a tree in her life . This was her first Saturday afternoon in Yorkbury , and she was , no doubt , feeling lonely and homesick , and it made her none the happier to be laughed at for not doing something she had not the slightest idea how to do . Was it quite generous to let her start off alone , over a strange road , with the care of a crying --  --  " " And muddy , " put in Gypsy , with twinkling eyes , " from head to foot , black as a shoe . " " And muddy child ? " finished Mrs. Breynton , smiling in spite of herself . " But Joy wanted to take him , and I told her so . It was her own bargain . " Illustration " I know that . But we are not speaking of bargains , Gypsy ; we are speaking of what is kind and generous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It strikes me , " said Gypsy , in her honest way , after a moment 's pause --  " it strikes me that I 'm a horrid selfish old thing , and I 've lived twelve years and just found it out ; there now ! " Just as Gypsy was going to bed she turned around with the lamp in her hand , her great eyes dreaming away in the brownest of brown studies . " Mother , is it selfish to have upper drawers , and front sides , and things ? " " What are you talking about , Gypsy ? " " Why , do n't my upper drawers , and the front side of the bed , and all that , belong to me , and must I give them up to Joy ? " " It is not necessary , " said her mother , laughing . But Gypsy fancied there was a slight emphasis on the last word . Joy was sound asleep , and dreaming that Winnie was a rattlesnake and Gypsy a prairie-dog , when somebody gave her a little pinch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Joy . " Look here , you might just as well have the upper bureau drawers , you know , and I do n't care anything about the front side of the bed . Besides , I wish I had n't let you come home alone this afternoon . " " Well , you are the funniest ! " said Joy . CHAPTER VI WHO PUT IT IN ? On Monday Joy went to school . Gypsy had been somewhat astonished , a little hurt , and a little angry , at hearing her say , one day , that she " did n't think it was a fit place for her to go -- a high school where all the poor people went . " But , fit or not , it was the only school to be had , and Joy must go . Perhaps , on some accounts , Mrs. Breynton would have preferred sending the children to a private school ; but the only one in town , and the one which Gypsy had attended until this term , was broken up by the marriage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys at the high school were , some of them , rude , but the girls for the most part were quiet , well-behaved , and lady-like , and the instruction was undoubtedly vastly superior to that of a smaller school . As Gypsy said , " you had to put into it and study like everything , or else she gave you a horrid old black mark , and then you felt nice when it was read aloud at examination , did n't you ? " " I would n't care , " said Joy . " Why , Joyce Miranda Breynton ! " said Gypsy . But Joy declared she would n't , and it was very soon evident that she did n't . She had not the slightest fancy for her studies ; neither had Gypsy , for that matter ; but Gypsy had been brought up to believe it was a disgrace to get bad marks . Joy had not . She hurried through her lessons in the quickest possible fashion , anyhow , so as to get through , and out to play ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once Gypsy saw -- and she was thoroughly shocked to see -- Joy peep into the leaves of her grammar when Miss Cardrew 's eyes were turned the other way . Altogether , matters did not go on very comfortably . Joy 's faults were for the most part those from which Gypsy was entirely free , and to which she had a special and inborn aversion . On the other hand , many of Gypsy 's failings were not natural to Joy . Gypsy was always forgetting things she ought to remember . Joy seldom did . Gypsy was thoughtless , impulsive , always into mischief , out of it , sorry for it , and in again . Joy did wrong deliberately , as she did everything else , and did not become penitent in a hurry . Gypsy 's temper was like a flash of lightning , hot and fierce and melting right away in the softest of summer rains . When Joy was angry she sulked . Joy was precise and neat about everything . Gypsy was not . Then Joy kept still , and Gypsy talked ; Joy told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some foolish notions about money and dresses and jewelry , on which Gypsy looked with the most supreme contempt -- not on the dresses , but the notions . Therefore there was plenty of material for rubs and jars , and of all sad things to creep into a happy house , these rubs and jars are the saddest . One day both the girls woke full of mischief . It was a bracing November day , cool as an ice-cream and clear as a whistle . The air sparkled like a fountain of golden sands , and was as full of oxygen as it could hold ; and oxygen , you must know , is at the bottom of a great deal of the happiness and misery , goodness and badness , of this world . Illustration " I tell you if I do n't feel like cutting up ! " said Gypsy , on the way to school . Gypsy did n't look unlike " cutting up " either , walking along there with her satchel swung over her left shoulder , her turban set all askew on her bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fences and running of races that had been going on since she left the house , and that saucy twinkle in her eyes . Joy was always somewhat more demure , but she looked , too , that morning , as if she were quite as ready to have a good time as any other girl . " Do you know , " said Gypsy , confidentially , as they went up the schoolhouse steps , " I feel precisely as if I should make Miss Cardrew a great deal of trouble to-day ; do n't you ? " " What does she do to you if you do ? " " Oh , sometimes she keeps you after school , and then again she tells Mr. Guernsey , and then there are the bad marks . Miss Melville -- she 's my old teacher that married Mr. Hallam , she was just silly enough !  - -  well , she used to just look at you , and never open her lips , and I guess you wished you had n't pretty quick . " It was very early yet , but quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashion on cool mornings . The boys were stamping noisily over the desks , and grouped about the stove in No. 1 . No. 1 . was the large room where the whole school gathered for prayer . A few of the girls were there -- girls who laughed rudely and talked loudly , none of them Gypsy 's friends . Tom never liked to have Gypsy linger about in No. 1 , before or after school hours ; he said it was not the place for her , and Tom was there that morning , knotting his handsome brows up into a very decided frown , when he saw her in the doorway , with Joy peeping over her shoulder . So Gypsy -- somewhat reluctantly , it must be confessed , for the boys seemed to be having a good time , and with boys ' good times she had a most unconquerable sympathy -- went up with Joy into Miss Cardrew 's recitation room . Nobody was there . A great , empty schoolroom , with its rows of silent seats and closed desks , with power to roam whithersoever you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girls ran over the desks , and looked into the desks , jumped over the settees , and knocked down the settees , put out the fire and built it up again , from the pure luxury of doing what they wanted to , in a place where they usually had to do what they did n't want to . They sat in Miss Cardrew 's chair , and peeped into her desk ; they ate apples and snapped peanut shells on the very platform where sat the spectacled and ogre-eyed committee on examination days ; they drew all manner of pictures of funny old women without any head , and old men without any feet , on the awful blackboard , and played " tag " round the globes . Then they stopped for want of breath . " I wish there were something to do , " sighed Gypsy ; " something real splendid and funny . " " I knew a girl once , and she drew a picture of the teacher on the board in green chalk , " suggested Joy ; " only she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That would n't do . Besides , pictures are too common ; everybody does those . Boys put pins in the seats , and cut off the legs of the teacher 's chair , and all that . I do n't know as I care to tumble Miss Cardrew over -- would n't she look funny , though !  - -  'cause mother would n't like it . Could n't we make the stove smoke , or put pepper in the desks , or -- let me see . " " Dress up something somehow , " said Joy ; " there 's the poker . " Gypsy shook her head . " Delia Guest did that last term , ' n ' the old thing -- I mean the poker , not Delia -- went flat down in the corner behind the stove -- flat , just as Miss Melville was coming in , and lay there in the wood-pile , and nobody knew there was a single sign of a thing going on . I guess you better believe Delia felt cheap !  - -  hark ! what 's that ? " It was a faint miaow down in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A kitten ! " " The very thing ! " " I 'm going right down to get her . " Down they ran , both of them , in a great hurry , and brought the creature up . The poor thing was chilled , and hungry , and frightened . They took her up to the stove , and Gypsy warmed her in her apron , and Joy fed her with cookies from her lunch-basket , till she curled her head under her paws with a merry purr , all ready for a nap , and evidently without the slightest suspicion that Gypsy 's lap was not foreordained , and created for her especial habitation as long as she might choose to remain there . " Joy , " said Gypsy , suddenly , " I 've thought of something . " " So have I. " " To dress her --  --  " " Up in a handkerchief . " " And things . " " I know it . " " And put her --  --  " " Yes ! into Miss Cardrew 's desk ! " " Wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " They " hurried up " in good earnest , choking down their laughter so that nobody downstairs might hear it . Joy took her pretty , purple-bordered handkerchief and tied it over the poor kitten 's head like a nightcap , so tight that , pull and scratch as she might , pussy could not get it off . Gypsy 's black silk apron was tied about her , like a long baby-dress , a pair of mittens were fastened on her arms , and a pink silk scarf around her throat . When all was done , Gypsy held her up , and trotted her on her knee . Anybody who has ever dressed up a cat like a baby , knows how indescribably funny a sight it is . It seemed as if the girls could never stop laughing -- it does not take much to make girls laugh . At last there was a commotion in the entry below . " It 's the girls ! quick , quick ! " Gypsy , trying to get up , tripped on her dress and fell , and away flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the door as fast as an energetic kitten could go . " She 'll be downstairs , and maybe Miss Cardrew 's there ! Oh ! " Joy sprang after the creature , caught her by the very tip end of her tail just as she was preparing to pounce down the stairs , and ran with her to Miss Cardrew 's desk . " Put her in -- quick , quick ! " " O-oh , she wo n't lie still ! " " Where 's the lunch-basket ? Give me some biscuit -- there ! I hear them on the stairs ! " The kitten began to mew piteously , struggling to get out with all her might . Down went the desk-cover on her paws . " There now , lie still ! Oh , hear her mew ! What shall we do ? " Quick footsteps were on the stairs -- halfway up ; merry laughter , and a dozen voices . " Here 's the biscuit . Here , kitty , kitty , poor kit-ty , do please to lie still and eat it ! Oh , Joy Breynton , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Shut the desk -- hurry ! " When the girls came in , Joy and Gypsy were in their seats , looking over the arithmetic lesson . Joy 's book was upside down , and Gypsy was intensely interested in the preface . Miss Cardrew came in shortly after , and stood warming her fingers at the stove , nodding and smiling at the girls . All was still so far in the desk . Miss Cardrew went up and laid down her gloves and pushed back her chair . Joy coughed under her breath , and Gypsy looked up out of the corners of her eyes . " Mr. Guernsey is not well to-day , " began Miss Cardrew , standing by the desk , " and we shall not be able to meet as usual in No. 1 for prayers . It has been thought best that each department should attend devotions in its own room . You can get out your Bibles . " Gypsy looked at Joy , and Joy looked at Gypsy . Miss Cardrew sat down . It was very still . A muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up carelessly , as if to see where it came from ; it stopped . " She 'll open her desk now , " whispered Joy , stooping to pick up a book . " See here , Joy , I almost wish we hadn't --  --  " " We will read the fourteenth chapter of John , " spoke up Miss Cardrew , with her Bible in her hand . No , she had n't opened her desk . The Bible lay upon the outside of it . " Oh , if that biscuit 'll only last till she gets through praying ! " " Hush-sh ! She 's looking this way . " Miss Cardrew began to read . She had read just four verses , when --  " Miaow ! " Gypsy and Joy were trying very hard to find the place . Miss Cardrew looked up and around the room . It was quite still . She read two verses more . " Mi-aow ! mi-aow-aow ! " Miss Cardrew looked up again , round the room , over the platform , under the desk , everywhere but in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound ? " Nobody had . Miss Cardrew began to read again . All at once Joy pulled Gypsy 's sleeve . " Just look there ! " " Where ? " " Trickling down the outside of the desk ! " " You do n't suppose she 's upset the --  --  " " Ink-bottle -- yes . " Miss Cardrew was in the tenth verse , and the room was very still . Right into the stillness there broke again a distinct , prolonged , dolorous --  " Mi-aow-aow ! " And this time Miss Cardrew laid down her Bible and lifted the desk-cover . It is reported in school to this day that Miss Cardrew jumped . Out flew the kitten , like popped corn from a shovel , glared over the desk in the nightcap and black apron , leaped down , and flew , all dripping with ink , down the aisle , out of the door , and bouncing downstairs like an India-rubber ball . Delia Guest and one or two of the other girls screamed . Miss Cardrew flung out some books and papers from the desk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and black . The teacher quietly wiped some spots of ink from her pretty blue merino , and there was an awful silence . " Girls , " said Miss Cardrew then , in her grave , stern way , " who did this ? " Nobody answered . " Who put that cat in my desk ? " repeated Miss Cardrew . It was perfectly still . Gypsy 's cheeks were scarlet . Joy was looking carelessly about the room , scanning the faces of the girls , as if she were trying to find out who was the guilty one . " It is highly probable that the cat tied herself into an apron , opened the desk and shut the cover down on herself , " said Miss Cardrew ; " we will look into this matter . Delia Guest , did you put her in ? " " No'm -- he , he ! I guess I -- ha , ha !  - -  did n't , " said Delia . " Next ! "  - -  and down the first row went Miss Cardrew , asking the same question of every girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the end of the fourth settee . " Gypsy Breynton , did you put the kitten in my desk ? " " No 'm , I did n't , " said Gypsy ; which was true enough . It was Joy who did that part of it . " Did you have anything to do with the matter , Gypsy ? " Perhaps Miss Cardrew remembered that Gypsy had had something to do with a few other similar matters since she had been in school . " Yes 'm , " said honest Gypsy , with crimson face and hanging head , " I did . " " What did you do ? " " I put on the apron and the tippet , and -- I gave her the biscuit . I -- thought she 'd keep still till prayers were over , " said Gypsy , faintly . " But you did not put her in the desk ? " " No 'm . " " And you know who did ? " " Yes 'm . " Miss Cardrew never asked her scholars to tell of each other 's wrong-doings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to Gypsy . She had shut up her lips tight and not another word would she have said for anybody . She had told the truth about herself , but she was under no obligations to bring Joy into trouble . Joy might do as she liked . " Gypsy Breynton will lose her recesses for a week and stay an hour after school tonight , " said Miss Cardrew . " Joy , did you put the kitten in my desk ? " " No , ma'am , " said Joy , boldly . " Nor have anything to do with it ? " " No , ma'am , " said Joy , without the slightest change of color . " Next !  - -  Sarah Rowe . " Of course Sarah had not , nor anybody else . Miss Cardrew let the matter drop there and went on with her reading . Gypsy sat silent and sorry , her eyes on her Testament . Joy tried to whisper something to her once , but Gypsy turned away with a gesture of impatience and disgust . This thing Joy had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not bear the sight of her face or touch of her hand . Never since she was a very little child had Gypsy been known to say what was not true . All her words were like her eyes -- clear as sunbeams . At dinner Joy did all the talking . Mrs. Breynton asked Gypsy what was the matter , but Gypsy said " Nothing . " If Joy did not choose to tell of the matter , she would not . " What makes you so cross ? " said Joy in the afternoon ; " nobody can get a word out of you , and you do n't look at me any more than if I were n't here . " " I do n't see how you can ask such a question ! " exploded Gypsy , with flashing eyes . " You know what you 've done as well as I do . " " No , I do n't , " grumbled Joy ; " just ' cause I did n't tell Miss Cardrew about that horrid old cat -- I wish we 'd let the ugly thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as if I 'd been murdering somebody and were going to be hung for it . Besides , I said ' Over the left ' to myself just after I 'd told her , and I did n't want to lose my recess if you did . " Gypsy shut up her pink lips tight , and made no answer . Joy went out to play at recess , and Gypsy stayed in alone and studied . Joy went home with the girls in a great frolic after school , and Gypsy stayed shut up in the lonely schoolroom for an hour , disgraced and miserable . But I have the very best of reasons for thinking that she was n't nearly as miserable as Joy . Just before supper the two girls were sitting drearily together in the dining-room , when the door-bell rang . " It 's Miss Cardrew ! " said Joy , looking out of the window ; " what do you suppose she wants ? " Gypsy looked up carelessly ; she did n't very much care . She had told Miss Cardrew all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother , she would have gone to her with the whole story that noon , if it had n't been for Joy 's part in it . " What is that she has in her hand , I wonder ? " said Joy uneasily , peeping through a crack in the door as Miss Cardrew passed through the entry ; " why , I declare ! if it is n't a handkerchief , as true as you live -- all -- inky ! " When Miss Cardrew had gone , Mrs. Breynton came out of the parlor with a very grave face , a purple-bordered handkerchief in her hand ; it was all spotted with ink , and the initials J. M. B. were embroidered on it . " Joy . " Joy came out of the corner slowly . " Come here a minute . " Joy went and the door was shut . Just what happened that next half hour Gypsy never knew . Joy came upstairs at the end of it , red-eyed and crying , and gentle . Gypsy was standing by the window . " Gypsy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I do . " " Of course , " said Gypsy ; " everybody does . " " I had n't the least idea it was so wicked -- not the least idea . Mother used to --  --  " But Joy broke off suddenly , with quivering , crimson lips . What that mother used to do Gypsy never asked ; Joy never told her -- either then , or at any other time . CHAPTER VII PEACE MAYTHORNE 'S ROOM " T is , too . " " It is n't , either . " " I know just as well as you . " " No you do n't any such a thing . You 've lived up here in this old country place all your life , and you do n't know any more about the fashions than Mrs. Surly . " " But I know it 's perfectly ridiculous to rig up in white chenille and silver pins , when anybody 's in such deep mourning as you . I would n't do it for anything . " " I 'll take care of myself , if you please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " You do ? A whole thing ? " " Yes , I do . I know you 're just as proud as you can be , and I 've heard more'n one person say so . All the girls think you 're dreadfully stuck up about your dresses and things -- so there ! " " I do n't care what the girls think , or you either . I guess I 'll be glad when father comes home and I get out of this house ! " Joy fastened the gaudy silver pins with a jerk into the heavy white chenille that she was tying about her throat and hair , turned herself about before the glass with a last complacent look , and walked , in her deliberate , cool , provoking way , from the room . Gypsy got up , and -- slammed the door on her . Very dignified proceedings , certainly , for girls twelve and thirteen years old . An unspeakably important matter to quarrel about -- a piece of white chenille ! Angry people , be it remembered , are not given to over-much dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yet the things these two girls found to dispute , and get angry , and get miserable , and make the whole family miserable over , were so ridiculously petty that I hardly expect to be believed in telling of them . The front side of the bed , the upper drawer in the bureau , a hair-ribbon , who should be helped first at the table , who was the best scholar , which was the more stylish color , drab or green , and whether Vermont was n't a better State than Massachusetts -- such matters might very appropriately be the subjects of the dissensions of young ladies in pinafores and pantalettes . Yet I think you will bear me witness , girls , some of you -- ah , I know you by the sudden pink in your cheeks -- who have gone to live with a cousin , or had a cousin live with you , or whose mother has adopted an orphan , or taken charge of a missionary 's daughter , or in some way or other have been brought for the first time in your life into daily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbending as yours -- ca n't you bear me witness that , in these little contests between Joy and Gypsy , I am telling no " made-up stories , " but sad , simple fact ? If you ca n't , I am very glad of it . No , as I said before , matters were not going on at all comfortably ; and every week seemed to make them worse . Wherein lay the trouble , and how to prevent it , neither of the girls had as yet exerted themselves to think . A week or two after the adventures that befell that unfortunate kitten , something happened which threatened to make the breach between Gypsy and Joy of a very serious nature . It began , as a great many other serious things begin , in a very small and rather funny affair . Illustration Mrs. Surly , who has been spoken of as Gypsy 's particular aversion , was a queer old lady with green glasses , who lived opposite Mr. Breynton 's , who felt herself particularly responsible for Gypsy 's training , and gave her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One morning it chanced that Gypsy was playing " stick-knife " with Tom out in the front yard , and that Mrs. Surly beheld her from her parlor window , and that Mrs. Surly was shocked . She threw up her window and called in an awful voice --  " Jemima Breynton ! " Now you might about as well challenge Gypsy to a duel as call her Jemima ; so --  " What do you want ? " she said , none too respectfully . " I have something to say to you , Jemima Breynton . " " Say ahead , " said Gypsy , under her breath , and did not stir an inch . Distance certainly lent enchantment to the view when Mrs. Surly was in the case . " Does your ma allow you to be so bold as to play boys ' games with boys , right out in sight of folks ? " vociferated Mrs. Surly . " Certainly , " nodded Gypsy . " It 's your turn , Tom . " " Well , it 's my opinion , Gypsy Breynton , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if I was your ma --  --  " Tom dropped his knife just then , stood up and looked at Mrs. Surly . For reasons best known to herself , Mrs. Surly shut the window and contented herself with glaring through the glass . Now , Joy had stood in the doorway and been witness to the scene , and moreover , having been reproved by her aunt for something or other that morning , she felt ill-humored , and very ready to find fault in her turn . " I think it 's just so , anyway , " she said . " I would n't be seen playing stick-knife for a good deal . " " And I would n't be seen telling lies ! " retorted Gypsy , sorry for it the minute she had said it . Then there followed a highly interesting dialogue of about five minutes ' length , and of such a character that Tom speedily took his departure . Now it came about that Gypsy , as usual , was the first ready to " make up , " and she turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant she could do for Joy . At last , as the greatest treat she could think of to offer her , she said : " I 'll tell you what ! Let 's go down to Peace Maythorne 's . I do believe I have n't taken you there since you 've been in Yorkbury . " " Who 's Peace Maythorne ? " asked Joy , sulkily . " Well , she 's the person I love just about best of anybody . " " Best of anybody ! " " Oh , mother , of course , and Tom , and Winnie , and father , and all those . Relations do n't count . But I do love her as well as anybody but mother -- and Tom , and -- well , anyway , I love her dreadfully . " " What is she , a woman , or a girl , or what ? " " She 's an angel , " said Gypsy . " What a goose you are ! " " Very likely ; but whether I 'm a goose or not , she 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her . She has the sweetest little way of keeping ' em folded up , and you 're always on the jump , thinking you see ' em . " " How you talk ! I 've a good mind to go and see her . " " All right . " So away they went , as pleasant as a summer 's day , merrily chatting . " But I do n't think angels are very nice , generally , " said Joy , doubtingly . " They preach . Does Peace Maythorne preach ? I sha n't like her if she does . " " Peace preach ! Not like her ! You 'd better know what you 're talking about , if you 're going to talk , " said Gypsy , with heightened color . " Dear me , you take a body 's head off . Well , if she should preach , I shall come right home . " They had come now to the village , where were the stores and the post-office , the bank , and some handsome dwelling-houses . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people did their promenading after school in the afternoon . Joy always fancied coming here , gay in her white chenille and white ribbons , and dainty parasol lined with white silk . There is nothing so showy as showy mourning , and Joy made the most of it . " Why , where are you going ? " she exclaimed at last . Gypsy had turned away from the fashionable street , and the handsome houses , and the paved sidewalk . " To Peace Maythorne 's . " " This way ? " " This way . " The street into which Gypsy had turned was narrow and not over clean ; the houses unpainted and low . As they walked on it grew narrower and dirtier , and the houses became tenement houses only . " Do , for pity 's sake , hurry and get out of here , " said Joy , daintily holding up her dress . Gypsy walked on and said nothing . Red-faced women in ragged dresses began to cluster on the steps ; muddy-faced children screamed and quarreled in the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neater than the rest , but miserable enough , Gypsy stopped . " What are you stopping for ? " said Joy . " This is where she lives . " " Here ? " " I just guess she does , " put in a voice from behind ; it was Winnie , who had followed them on tiptoe , unknown to them , all the way . " She 's got a funny quirk in her back , ' n ' she lies down pretty much . That 's her room up there to the top of the house . It 's a real nice place , I tell you . They have onions mos ' every day . Besides , I saw a little boy here one time when I was comin ' ' long with mother , ' n ' he was smokin ' some tobaccer . He said he 'd give it to me for two napples , and mother just would n't let me . " " Here -- a cripple ! " exclaimed Joy . " Here , and a cripple , " said Gypsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! " broke out Joy , " playing such a trick on me . Do you suppose I 'm going into such a place as this , to see an old beggar -- a hunch-backed beggar ? " Gypsy turned perfectly white . When she was very angry , too angry to speak , she always turned white . It was some seconds before she could find her voice . " A hunch-backed beggar ! Peace ? How dare you say such things of Peace Maythorne ? Joy Breynton , I 'll never forgive you for this as long as I live -- never ! " The two girls looked at each other . Just at that moment I am afraid there was something in their hearts answering to that forbidden word , that terrible word -- hate . Ah , we feel so safe from it in our gentle , happy , untempted lives , just as safe as they felt once . Remember this , girls : when Love goes out , Hate comes in . In your heart there stands an angel , watching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose hands are patient , kindly deeds , whose eyes see " good in everything , " something to love where love is hardest , some generous , gentle way to show that love when ways seem closed . In your heart , too , away down in its darkest corner , all forgotten , perhaps , by you , crouches something with face too black to look upon , something that likewise watches and waits with horrible patience , if perhaps the angel , with folded wing and drooping head , may be driven out . It is never empty , this curious , fickle heart . One or the other must stand there , king of it . One or the other -- and in the twinkling of an eye the change is made , from angel to fiend , from fiend to angel ; just which you choose . Joy broke away from her cousin in a passion . Gypsy flew into the door of the miserable house , up the stairs two steps at a time , to the door of a low room in the second story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maythorne ! " The cripple lying on the bed turned her pale face to the door , her large , quiet eyes blue with wonder . " Why , Gypsy ! What is the matter ? " Gypsy 's face was white still , very white . She shut the door loudly , and sat down on the bed with a jar that shook it all over . A faint expression of pain crossed the face of Peace . " Oh , I did n't mean to -- it was cruel in me ! How could I ? Have I hurt you very badly , Peace ? " Gypsy slipped down upon the floor , the color coming into her face now , from shame and sorrow . Peace gently motioned her back to her place upon the bed , smiling . " Oh , no . It was nothing . Sit up here ; I like to have you . Now , what is it , Gypsy ? " The tone of this " What is it , Gypsy ? " told a great deal . It told that it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her troubles and her joys , her sins and her well-doings , her plans and hopes and fears , all the little stories of the fresh , young life from which the cripple was forever shut out . It told , too , what Gypsy found in this quiet room , and took away from it -- all the help and the comfort , and the sweet , sad lessons . It told , besides , much of what Peace and Gypsy were to each other , that only they two should ever exactly understand . It was a tone that always softened Gypsy , in her gayest frolics , in her wildest moods . For the first time since she had known Peace , it failed to soften her now . She began in her impetuous way , her face angry and flushed , her voice trembling yet :  --  " I ca n't tell you what it is , and that 's the thing of it ! It 's about that horrid old Joy . " " Gypsy ! " " I ca n't help it -- I hate her ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle word . " Well , I felt just as if I did , down there on the steps , anyway . You do n't know what Joy said . It 's something about you , and that 's what makes me so mad . If she ever says it again ! " " About me ? " interrupted Peace . " Yes , " said Gypsy , with great , flashing eyes . " I would n't tell it to you for all the world ; it 's so bad as that , Peace . How she dared to call you a beg --  --  " Gypsy stopped short . But she had let the cat out of the bag . Peace smiled again . " A beggar ! Well , it does n't hurt me any , does it ? Joy has never seen me , does n't know me , you must remember , Gypsy . Besides , nobody else thinks as much of me as you do . " " I did n't mean to say that ; I 'm always saying the wrong thing ! Anyway , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should strike her when she said it . I ca n't bear Joy . You do n't know what she is , Peace . She grows worse and worse . She does things I would n't do for anything , and I wish she 'd never come here ! " " Is Joy always wrong ? " asked Peace , gently . Peace rarely gave to any one as much of a reproof as that . Gypsy felt it . " No , " said she , honestly , " she is n't . I 'm real horrid and wicked , and do ugly things . But I ca n't help it ; Joy makes me -- she acts so . " " I know what 's the matter with you and Joy , I guess , " said Peace . " The matter ? Well , I do n't ; I wish I did . We 're always fight -- fighting , day in and day out , and I 'm tired to death of it . I 'm just crazy for the time for Joy to go home , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace . " Gypsy drew down her merry , red lips , and looked very serious . To tell the truth , however , do the best she would , she could not look altogether as if her heart were breaking from the amount of " unhappiness " that fell to her lot . A little smile quivered around the lips of Peace . " Well , " said Gypsy , laughing in spite of herself , " I am . I never can make anybody believe it , though . What is the matter with Joy and me ? You did n't say . " " You 've forgotten something , I think . " " Forgotten something ? " " Yes -- something you read me once out of an old Book . " " Book ? Oh ! " said Gypsy , beginning to understand . " In honor preferring one another , " said Peace , softly . Gypsy did not say anything . Peace took up her Bible that lay on the bed beside her -- it always lay on the bed -- and turned the leaves , and laid her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . Then she said slowly : " Why , Peace Maythorne . I -- never could -- in this world -- never . " Just then there came a knock at the door . Gypsy went to open it , and stood struck dumb for amazement . It was Joy . " Auntie said it was supper-time , and you were to come home , " began Joy , somewhat embarrassed . " She was going to send Winnie , but I thought I 'd come . " " Why , I never ! " said Gypsy , still standing with the door-knob in her hand . " Is this your cousin ? " spoke up Peace . " Oh , yes , I forgot . This is Peace Maythorne , Joy . " " I am glad to see you , " said Peace in her pleasant way ; " wo n't you come in ? " " Well , perhaps I will , a minute , " said Joy , awkwardly , taking a chair by the window , and wondering if Gypsy had told Peace what she said . But Peace was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so kind , that she concluded she knew nothing about it , and soon felt quite at her ease . Everybody was at ease with Peace Maythorne . " How pleasant it is here ! " said Joy , looking about the room in unfeigned astonishment . And indeed it was . The furniture was poor enough , but everything was as neat as fresh wax , and the sunlight , that somehow or other always sought that room the earliest , and left it the latest -- the warm , shimmering sunlight that Peace so loved -- was yellow on the old , faded carpet , on the paperless , pictureless wall , on the bed where the hands of Peace lay , patient and folded . " It is pleasant , " said Peace , heartily . " You do n't know how thankful it makes me . Aunt came very near taking a room on the north side . Sometimes I really do n't know what I should have done . But then I guess I should have found something else to like . " I should have found something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dim , childish way -- a thought they could by no means have explained ; they wondered if in those few words did not lie the key to Peace Maythorne 's beautiful , sorrowful life . They would not have expressed it so , but that was what they meant . " See here , " broke out Gypsy all at once , " Peace Maythorne wants you and me to make up , Joy . " " Your cousin will think I 'm interfering with what 's none of my business , " said Peace , laughing . " I did n't say exactly that , you know ; I was only talking to you . " " Oh , I 'd just as lief make up now , but I would n't this morning , " wondering for the second time if Peace could know what she said , and be so gentle and good to her ; " I will if Gypsy will . " " And I will if Joy will , " said Gypsy , " so it 's a bargain . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they rose to go , with real sympathy in her puzzled eyes . " Oh , yes ; but then I get along . " " Peace Maythorne ! " put in Gypsy just then , " is that all the dinner you ate ? " Gypsy was standing by the table on which was a plate containing a cold potato , a broken piece of bread , and a bit of beefsteak . Evidently from the looks of the food , only a few mouthfuls had been eaten . " I did n't feel hungry , " said Peace , evasively . " But you like meat , for you told me so . " " I did n't care about this , " said Peace , looking somewhat restless . Gypsy looked at her sharply , then stooped and whispered a few words in her ear . " No , " said Peace , her white cheek flushing crimson . " Oh , no , she never told me not to . She means to be very kind . I cost her a great deal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't eat much , and that was the reason you did n't , " exclaimed Gypsy , angrily . " I think it 's abominable ! " " Hush ! please Gypsy . " Gypsy hushed . Just then the door opened and Miss Jane Maythorne , Peace 's aunt , came in . She was a tall , thin , sallow-faced woman , with angular shoulders and a sharp chin . She looked like a New England woman who had worked hard all her life and had much trouble , so much that she thought of little else now but work and trouble ; who had a heart somewhere , but was apt to forget all about it except on great occasions . " I 've been talking to Peace about not eating more , " said Gypsy , when she had introduced Joy , and said good-afternoon . " She 'll die if she does n't eat more than that , " pointing to the plate . " She can eat all she wants , as far as I know , " said Aunt Jane , rather shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing very fine in the way of victuals I can get her , working as I work for two , and most beat out every night . La ! Peace , you have n't eaten your meat , have you ? Well , I 'll warm it over to-morrow , and it 'll be as good as new . " Illustration " The old dragon ! " exclaimed Gypsy , under her breath , as the girls went out . " She is a dragon , nothing more nor less -- a dragon that does n't scold particularly , but a dragon that looks . I 'd rather be scolded to death than looked at and looked at every mouthful I eat . I do n't wonder Peace does n't eat . She 'll starve to death some day . " " But why do n't you send her down things ? " asked Joy . Gypsy shook her head . " You do n't understand Peace . She would n't like it . Mother does send her a quantity of books and flowers and things , and dinner just as often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace would n't like ' em every day . " " She 's real different from what I thought , " said Joy --  " real . What pretty eyes she has . I did n't seem to remember she was poor , a bit . " " What made you come down ? " " ' Cause , " said Joy . This excellent reason was all that was ever to be had out of her . But that first time was by no means the last she went to Peace Maythorne 's room . The girls were in good spirits that night , well pleased with each other , themselves , and everybody else , as is usually the case when one is just over a fit of ill-temper . When they were alone in bed , Gypsy told Joy about the verse of which Peace spoke . Joy listened in silence . Awhile after , Gypsy woke from a dream , and saw a light burning on the table . Joy was sitting up in her white night-dress , turning the leaves of a book as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIGHT November , with its bright , bleak skies , sere leaves tossing , sad winds sobbing , and rains that wept for days and nights together , on dead flowers and dying grasses , moaned itself away at last , and December swept into its place with a good rousing snow-storm , merry sleigh-bells , and bright promises of coming Christmas . The girls coasted and skated , and made snow-men and snowballs and snow-forts . Joy learned to slide down a moderate hill at a mild rate without screaming , and to get along somehow on her skates alone -- for the very good reason that Tom would n't help her . Gypsy initiated her into the mysteries of " cannon-firing " from the great icy forts , and taught her how to roll the huge balls of snow . Altogether they had a very good time . Not as good as they might have had , by any means ; the old rubs and jars were there still , though of late they had been somewhat softened . Partly on account of their talk with Peace ; partly because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own good sense , the girls had tacitly made up their minds at least to make an effort to live together more happily . In some degree they succeeded , but they were like people walking over a volcano ; the trouble was not quenched ; it lay always smoldering out of sight , ready at a moment 's notice to flare up into angry flame . The fault lay perhaps no more with one than another . Gypsy had never had a sister , and her brothers were neither of them near enough to her own age to interfere very much with her wishes and privileges . Moreover , a brother , though he may be the greatest tease in existence , is apt to be easier to get along with than a sister about one 's own age . His pleasures and ambitions run in different directions from the girls ; there is less clashing of interests . Besides this , Gypsy 's playmates in Yorkbury , as has been said , had not chanced to be girls of very strong wills . Quite to her surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she found out that she -- Gypsy -- had been pretty well used to having her own way , and that other people sometimes liked to have theirs . As for Joy , she had always been an only child , and that tells a history . Of the two perhaps she had the more to learn . The simple fact that she was brought wisely and kindly , but thoroughly , under Mrs. Breynton 's control , was decidedly a revelation to her . At her own home , it had always been said , from the time she was a baby , that her mother could not manage her , and her father would not . She rebelled a little at first against her aunt 's authority , but she was fast learning to love her , and when we love , obedience ceases to be obedience , and becomes an offering freely given . A little thing happened one day , showing that sadder and better side of Joy 's heart that always seemed to touch Gypsy . They had been having some little trouble about the lessons at school ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they had treated each other pleasantly after it . At night Joy was sitting upstairs writing a letter to her father , when a gust of wind took the sheet and blew it to Gypsy 's feet . Gypsy picked it up to carry it to her , and in doing so , her eyes fell accidentally on some large , legible words at the bottom of the page . She had not the slightest intention of reading them , but their meaning came to her against her will , in that curious way we see things in a flash sometimes . This was what she saw : " I like auntie ever so much , and Tom . Gypsy was cross this morning . She --  --  " and then followed Joy 's own version of the morning 's dispute . Gypsy was vexed . She liked her uncle , and she did not like to have him hear such one-sided stories of her , and judge her as he would . She walked over to Joy with very red cheeks . " Here 's your letter . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that about me . I do n't think you 've any business to tell him about me unless you can tell the truth . " Of course Joy resented such a remark as this , and high words followed . They went down to supper sulkily , and said nothing to one another for an hour . After tea , Joy crept up moodily into the corner , and Gypsy sat down on the cricket for one of her merry talks with her mother . After she had told her how many times she missed at school that day , what a funny tumble Sarah Rowe had on the ice , and laughed over " Winnie 's latest " till she was laughed out and talked out too , she sprang into her lap , in one of Gypsy 's sudden outbursts of affection , throwing her arms around her neck , and kissing her on cheeks , forehead , lips and chin . " O-oh , what a blessed little mother you are ! What should I do without you ? " " Mother 's darling daughter ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softly . But not softly enough . Gypsy looked up suddenly and saw a pale face peering out at them from behind the curtain , its great eyes swimming in tears , its lips quivering . The next minute Joy left the room . There was something dim in Gypsy 's eyes as she hurried after her . She found her crouched upstairs in the dark and cold , sobbing as if her heart would break . Gypsy put her arm around her . Illustration " Kiss me , Joy . " Joy kissed her , and that was all that was said . But it ended in Gypsy 's bringing her triumphantly downstairs , where were the lights and the fire , and the pleasant room , and another cricket waiting at Mrs. Breynton 's feet . They were very busy after this with the coming Christmas . Joy confidently expected a five-dollar bill from her father , and Gypsy cherished faint aspirations after a portfolio with purple roses on it . But most of their thoughts , and all their energies , were occupied with the little gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . Joy 's father always supplied her bountifully with spending money ; Gypsy 's stock was small . When Joy wanted to make a present , she had only to ask for a few extra dollars , and she had them . Gypsy always felt as if a present given in that way were no present ; unless a thing cost her some self-denial , or some labor , she reasoned , it had nothing to do with her . If given directly out of her father 's pocket , it was his gift , not hers . But then , how much handsomer Joy 's things would be . Thus Gypsy was thinking in her secret heart , over and over . How could she help it ? And Joy , perhaps -- possibly -- Joy was thinking the same thing , with a spice of pleasure in the thought . It was about her mother that Gypsy was chiefly troubled . Tom had condescendingly informed her , about six months ago , that he 'd just as lief she would make him a watch-case if she wanted to very much . Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such nonsense . Be sure she did it up in style , with gold and silver tape , and some of your blue alpaca . ( Tom 's conceptions of the feminine race , their apparel , occupations and implements , were bounded by tape and alpaca . ) So Tom was provided for ; the watch-case was nearly made , and bade fair to be quite as pretty as anything Joy could buy . Winnie was easily suited , and her father would be as contented with a shaving-case as with a velvet dressing-gown ; indeed he 'd hardly know the difference . Joy should have a pretty white velvet hair-ribbon . But what for mother ? She lay awake a whole half hour one night , perplexing herself over the question , and at last decided rather falteringly on a photograph frame of shell-work . Gypsy 's shell-work was always pretty , and her mother had a peculiar fancy for it . " I shall give her Whittier 's poems , " said Joy , in -- perhaps unconsciously , perhaps not -- a rather triumphant tone . " I heard her say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to get the best copy I can find , with gold edges . If uncle has n't a nice one in his store , I 'll send to Boston . Mr. Ticknor 'll pick me out the best one he has , I know , ' cause he knows father real well , and we buy lots of things there . " Gypsy said nothing . She was rather abashed to hear Joy talk in such familiar terms of Mr. Ticknor . She was more uneasy that Joy should give so handsome a present . She sat looking at her silently , and while she looked , a curious , dull , sickening pain crept into her heart . It frightened her , and she ran away downstairs to get rid of it . Illustration A few days after , she was sitting alone working on the photograph case . It was rather pretty work , though not over-clean . She had cut a well-shaped frame out of pasteboard , with a long , narrow piece bent back to serve as support . The frame was covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were of different sizes , shapes , and colors , and she was laying them on in a pretty pattern of stars and crescents . She had just stopped to look at her work , her red lips shut together with the air of a connoisseur , and her head on one side , like a canary , when Joy came in . " Just look here ! " and she held up before her astonished eyes a handsome volume of blue and gold -- Whittier 's poems , and written on the fly-leaf , in Joy 's very best copy-book hand , " For Auntie , with a Merry Christmas , from Joy . " " Uncle sent to Boston for me , and got it , and he promised on his word ' n ' honor , certain true , black and blue , he would n't let Auntie know a single sign of a thing about it . Is n't it splendid ? " " Ye-es , " said Gypsy , slowly . " Well ! I do n't think you seem to care much . " Gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second time that dull , curious pain had crept into her heart . What did it mean ? Was it possible that she was envious of Joy ? Was it possible ? The hot crimson rushed to Gypsy 's cheeks for shame at the thought . But the thought was there . She chanced to be in Peace Maythorne 's room one day when the bustle of preparation for the holidays was busiest . Peace hid something under the counterpane as she came in , flushing a little . Gypsy sat down in her favorite place on the bed , just where she could see the cripple 's great quiet eyes -- she always liked to watch Peace Maythorne 's eyes -- and in doing so disturbed the bedclothes . A piece of work fell out : plain , fine sewing , in which the needle lay with a stitch partially taken . " Peace Maythorne ! " said Gypsy , " you 've been doing it again ! " " A little , just to help aunt , you know . A little does n't hurt me , Gypsy . " " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know you never sew a stitch but you lie awake half the night after it with the pain . " Peace did not contradict her . She could not . " Help your aunt ! " Gypsy went on vehemently ; " she ought n't to let you touch it . She has n't any more feeling than a stone wall , nor half as much , I say ! " " Hush , Gypsy ! Do n't say that . Indeed I 'd rather have the pain , and help her a little , once in a while , when my best days come and I can ; I had , really , Gypsy . You do n't know how it hurts me -- a great deal more than this other hurt in my back -- to lie here and let her support me , and I not do a thing . O Gypsy , you do n't know ! " Something in Peace Maythorne 's tone just then made Gypsy feel worse than she felt to see her sew . She was silent a minute , turning away her face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 'd as lief have a stone wall for an aunt ; no , I will say it , Peace , and you need n't look at me . " Peace looked , notwithstanding , and Gypsy stopped saying it . " Sometimes I 've thought , " said Peace , after a pause , " I might earn a little crocheting . Once , long ago , I made a mat out of ends of worsted I found , and it did n't hurt me hardly any ; on my good days it would n't honestly hurt me at all . It 's pretty work , crocheting , is n't it ? " " Why do n't you crochet , then , " said Gypsy , " if you must do anything ? It 's ten thousand times easier than this sewing you 're killing yourself over . " " I 've no worsteds , you know , " said Peace , coloring ; and changed the subject at once . Gypsy looked thoughtful . Very soon after she bade Peace good-bye , and went home . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Peace had said . " Now , mother , I 've thought out an idea . " " Well ? " " You must n't say no , if I tell you . " " I 'll try not to ; if it is a sensible idea . " " Do I ever have an idea that is n't sensible ? " said Gypsy , demurely . " I prefer not to be slandered , if you please , Mrs. Breynton . " " Well , but what 's the idea ? " " It 's just this . Miss Jane Maythorne is a heathen . " " Is that all ? " " No . But Miss Jane Maythorne is a heathen , and ought to cut off her head before she lets Peace sew . But you see she does n't know she 's a heathen , and Peace will sew . " " Well , what then ? " " If she will do something , and wo n't be happy without , then I ca n't help it , you see . But I can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make little mats and things , and you can buy them . Now , mother , is n't that nice ? " " Yes , " said Mrs. Breynton , after a moment 's thought . " It is a very good plan . I think Joy would like to join you . Together , you can make quite a handsome present out of it . " " I do n't want Joy to know a thing about it , " said Gypsy , with a decision in her voice that amounted almost to anger . " Why , Gypsy ! " " No , not a thing . She just takes her father 's money , and gives lots of splendid presents , and makes me ashamed of all mine , and she 's glad of it , too . If I 'm going to give anything to Peace , I do n't want her to . " " I think Joy has taken a great fancy to Peace . She would enjoy giving her something very much , " said Mrs. Breynton , gravely . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would spoil it all to have Joy have anything to do with it . " " Worsted are very expensive now , " said her mother ; " you alone can not give Peace enough to amount to much . " " I do n't care , " said Gypsy , resolutely , " I want to do one thing Joy does n't . " Mrs. Breynton said nothing , and Gypsy went slowly from the room . " I wish we could give Peace Maythorne something , " said Joy , an hour after , when they were all sitting together . Mrs. Breynton raised her eyes from her work , but Gypsy was looking out of the window . When the girls went up to bed , Gypsy was very silent . Joy tried to laugh and plague and scold her into talking , but it was of no use . Just before they went to sleep , she spoke up suddenly : " Joy , do you want to give something to Peace Maythorne ? " " Splendid ! " cried Joy , jumping up in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her then all the plan , a little slowly ; it was rather hard . Perhaps Joy detected the hesitation in her tone . Joy was not given to detecting things with remarkable quickness , but it was so plain that she could not very well help it . " I do n't believe you want me to give any of it . " " Oh , yes , " said Gypsy , trying to speak cordially , " yes , it will be better . " It certainly was better she felt . She went to sleep , glad it was settled so . When the girls came to make their purchases , they found that Gypsy 's contribution of money would just about buy the crochet-needles and patterns . The worsteds cost about treble what she could give . So it was settled that they should be Joy 's gift . Gypsy was very pleasant about it , but Joy could not help seeing that she was disappointed . So then there came a little generous impulse to Joy too , and she came one day and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things off so , for Peace . It makes my part the largest . Besides , the worsteds look the prettiest . Let 's just give them together and have it all one . " There is a rare pleasure in making a gift one 's self , without being hampered by this " all-together " notion , is n't there ?  - -  especially if the gift be a handsome one , and is going where it is very much needed . So as Joy sat fingering the pile of elegant worsteds , twining the brilliant , soft folds of orange , and crimson , and royal purple , and soft , wood-browns about her hands , it cost her a bit of a struggle to say this . It seems rather a small thing to write about ? Ah , they are these bits of struggles in which we learn to fight the great ones ; perhaps these bits of struggles , more than the great ones , make up life . " You 're real good , " said Gypsy , surprised ; " I think I 'd rather not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't want to say so . But it 's just as good in you . " At that moment , though neither of them knew it was so , one thought was in the heart of both . It was a sudden thought that came and went , and left a great happiness in its place ( for great happiness springs out of very little battles and victories ) ,  - -  a memory of Peace Maythorne 's verse . The good Christmas time would have been a golden time to them , if it taught them in ever so small , imperfect ways , to prefer one another " in honor . " One day before it came a sudden notion seemed to strike Gypsy , and she rushed out of the house in her characteristic style , as if she were running for her life , and down to Peace Maythorne 's , and flew into the quiet room like a tempest . " Peace Maythorne , what 's your favorite verse ? " " Why , what a hurry you 're in ! Sit down and rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . I just want to know what your favorite verse is , as quick as ever you can be . " " Did you come down just for that ? How queer ! Well , let me see . " Peace stopped a minute , her quiet eyes looking off through the window , but seeming to see nothing -- away somewhere , Gypsy , even in her hurry stopped to wonder where . " I think -- it is n't one you 'd care much about , perhaps -- I think I like this . Yes , I think I ca n't help liking it best of all . " Peace touched her finger to a page of her Bible that lay open . Gypsy , bending over , read : " And the inhabitants shall not say I am sick . " When she had read , she stooped and kissed Peace with a sudden kiss . From that time until Christmas Gypsy was very busy in her own room with her paint box , all the spare time she could find . On Christmas Eve she went down just after dusk to Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry . " This is for Peace , and I made it . I do n't want her to see a thing about it till she wakes up in the morning . Could you please to fasten it up on the wall just opposite the bed where the sun shines in ? sometime after she 's gone to sleep , you know . " Miss Jane , somewhat bewildered , took the thing that Gypsy held out to her , and held it up in the light that fell from a neighbor 's half-open door . It was a large illuminated text , painted on Bristol board of a soft gray shade , and very well done for a non-professional artist . The letters were of that exquisite shade known by the artists as smalt blue , edged heavily with gold , and round them a border of yellow , delicate sprays of wheat . Miss Jane spelled out in German text : " And the Inhabitants shall not say I am Sick . " " Well , thank you . I 'll put it up . Peace never gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with work to lie awake waitin ' till she is . But then , if you want to surprise her -- I s'pose she will be dreadful tickled -- I guess I 'll manage it someways . " Perhaps Miss Jane was softened into being obliging by her coming holiday ; or perhaps the mournful , longing words touched something in her that nothing touched very often . Gypsy and Joy were not so old but that Christmas Eve with its little plans for the morrow held yet a certain shade of that delightful suspense and mystery which perhaps never hangs about the greater and graver joys of life . I fancy we drink it to the full , in the hanging up of stockings , the peering out into the dark to see Santa Claus come down the chimney ( perfectly conscious that that gentleman is the most transparent of hoaxes , but with a sort of faith in him all the while ; we may see him if we can lie awake long enough -- who knows ? ) the falling asleep before we know it , and much against our will , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pattering about barefoot to " catch " the dreaming and defenseless family . " I 'm going to lie awake all night , " Gypsy announced , as she stood brushing out her bright , black hair ; " then I 'll catch you , you see if I do n't . " " But I 'm going to lie awake , too , " said Joy . " I was going to last Christmas , only -- I did n't . " " Sit up and see the sun dance , like Patty . " " Well , let 's . I never was awake all night in my whole life . " " Nor I , " said Gypsy . " I came pretty near it once , but I somehow went to sleep along at the end . " " When was that ? " " Why , one time I had a dream , and went clear over to the Kleiner Berg Basin , in my sleep , and got into the boat . " " You did ! " " I guess I did . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so I floated off , and there I had to stay till Tom came in the morning . " " Why , I should have been scared out of my seventeen senses , " said Joy , creeping into bed . " Did n't you scream ? " " No . That would n't have done any good . See here , Joy , if you find me going to sleep , pinch me , will you ? " " Oh , yes , " said Joy , with alacrity . " I shall be awake , I know . " There was a silence . Gypsy broke it by turning her head over on the pillow with a whisk , and opening her eyes savagely , quite indignant to find them shut . " Joy . " No answer . " Joy , you 're going --  --  " Joy 's head turned over with another whisk . " No , I 'm not . I 'm just as wide awake as ever I was . " Another silence . " Gypsy ! " Gypsy jumped . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing , " said Gypsy , sitting up and rubbing her eyes . " I wonder if it is n't most morning , " said Joy , in a tone of cheerful indifference . " Most morning ! Mother 'd say we 'd been in bed just ten minutes , I suppose . " Joy stifled a groan , and by dint of great exertions turned it into a laugh . " All the longer to lie awake . It 's nice , is n't it ? " " Ye-es . Let 's talk . People that sit up all night talk , I guess . " " Well , I guess it would be a good plan . You begin . " " I do n't know anything to say . " " Well , I 'm sure I do n't . " Silence again . " Joy Breynton . " " We-ell ? " " I guess I 'll keep awake just as well if I -- shut up -- my eyes . Do n't you --  " That was the end of Gypsy 's sentence , and Joy never asked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half after , Gypsy heard a noise , and was somewhat surprised to see Joy standing up with her head in the washbowl . " What are you doing ? " " Oh , just dipping my head into the water . They say it helps keep people awake . " " Oh -- well . See here ; we have n't talked much lately , have we ? " " No . I thought I would n't disturb you . " Gypsy made a ghastly attempt to answer , but could n't quite do it . At the end of another indefinite period Joy opened her eyes under the remarkable impression that Oliver Cromwell was carrying her to the guillotine in a cocoa-nut shell ; it was really a very remarkable impression , considering that she had been broad awake ever since she came to bed . As soon as her eyes were opened she opened her mouth likewise -- to gasp out a little scream . For something very tall and white was sitting on the bedpost with folded arms . " Why , Gypsy Breynton ! " " What ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so 's to keep awake . It 's real fun . " " Why , how your teeth chatter . Is n't it cold up there ? " " Ra-ther . I do n't know but I might as well come down . " " I wonder , " muttered Gypsy , drowsily , just as Joy had begun in very thrilling words to request Oliver Cromwell to have mercy on her , and was about preparing to jump out of the cocoa-nut shell into Niagara Falls , " I wonder what makes people think it 's a joke to lie awake . " " I do n't believe they do , " said Joy , with a tinge in her voice of something that , to say the least , was not hilarious . " Yes they do , " persisted Gypsy ; " all the girls in novels lie awake all night and cry when their lovers go to Europe , and they have a real nice time . Only it 's most always moonlight , and they talk out loud . I always thought when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Joy dropped into another dream , and , though not of interest to the public , it was a very charming dream , and she felt decidedly cross , when , at the end of another unknown period Gypsy woke her up with a pinch . " Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas ! " " What are you merry Christmassing for ? That 's no fair . It is n't morning yet . Let me alone . " " Yes , it is morning too . I heard the clock strike six ever so long ago . Get up and build the fire . " " I do n't believe it 's morning . You can build it yourself . " " No , it 's your week . Besides , you made me do it twice for you your last turn , and I sha n't touch it . Besides , it is morning . " Joy rose with a groan , and began to fumble for the matches . All at once Gypsy heard a very fervent exclamation . " What 's the matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match ! " Gypsy began to laugh . " It 's nothing to laugh at , " chattered Joy ; " I 'm frozen almost to death , and this horrid old fire wo n't do a thing but smoke . " Gypsy , curled up in the warm bed , smothered her laugh as best she could , to see Joy crouched shivering before the stove-door , blowing away frantically at the fire , her cheeks puffed out , her hands blue as indigo . " There ! " said Joy , at last ; " I sha n't work any more over it . It may go out if it wants to , and if it do n't it need n't . " She came back to bed , and the fire muttered and sputtered a while , and died out , and shot up again , and at last made up its mind to burn , and burned like a small volcano . " What a noise that fire makes ! I hope it wo n't wake up mother . Joy , do n't it strike you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . " " Get up and look at the entry clock ; you 're on the front side . " Poor Joy jumped out shivering into the cold again , opened the door softly , and ran out . She came back in somewhat of a hurry , and shut the door with a bang . " Gypsy Breynton ! " " What ? " " If I ever forgive you ! " " What is the matter ? " " It 's just twenty-five minutes past eleven ! " Illustration Gypsy broke into a ringing laugh . Joy could never bear to be laughed at . " I do n't see anything so terrible funny , and I guess you would n't if you 'd made that old --  " " Fire ; I know it . Just to think !  - -  and you shivering and blowing away at it . I never heard anything so funny ! " " I think it was real mean in you to wake me up , any way . " " Why , I thought I heard it strike six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , dear ! " Joy could n't see the joke . But the story of that memorable night was not yet finished . The faint , gray morning really came at last , and the girls awoke in good earnest , ready and glad to get up . " I feel as if I 'd been pulled through a knothole , " said Joy . " I slept with one eye open all the time I did sleep , " said Gypsy , drearily . " I know one thing . I 'll never try to lie awake as long as I live . " " Not when you have a lover go to Europe ? " " Not if I have a dozen lovers go to Europe . How is that fire going to be built , I 'd like to know ?  - -  every stick of wood burned out last night . " There was no way but to go down into the wood-shed and get some . It was yet early , and quite dark . " Go the back stairs , " said Gypsy , " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and jumped , with a scream that echoed through the silent entry . " Hush-sh ! What is the matter ? " " A -- a -- it 's a ghost ! " " A ghost ! Nonsense ! " Gypsy pushed by trembling Joy and ran out . She , too , came back with a jump , and , though she did not scream , she did not say nonsense . " What can it be ? " It certainly did look amazingly like a ghost . Something tall and white and ghastly , with awful arm extended . The entry was very dark . Joy sprang into bed and covered up her face in the clothes . Gypsy stood still and winked fast for about a minute . Then Joy heard a fall and a bubbling laugh . " That old Tom ! It 's nothing but a broom-handle and a sheet . Oh , Joy , just come and see ! " After that , Joy declared she would n't go to the wood-shed alone , if she dressed without a fire the rest of her life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tiptoe , holding their very breath in their efforts to be still , the stairs creeking at every step . Did you ever particularly want stairs to keep still , that they did n't creak like thunder-claps ? The girls managed to get into the wood-shed , fill their basket , and steal back into the kitchen without mishap . Then came the somewhat dubious undertaking of crawling upstairs in darkness that might be felt , with a heavy and decidedly uncertain load of wood . " I 'll go first and carry the basket , " said Gypsy . " One can do it easier than two . " So she began to feel her way slowly up . " It 's black as Egypt ! Joy , why do n't you come ? " " I 'm caught on something -- oh ! " Down fell something with an awful crash that echoed and reechoed , and resounded through the sleeping house . It was succeeded by an utter silence . " What is it ? " breathed Gypsy , faintly . " The clothes-horse , and every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from Joy 's lips , when Gypsy , sitting down on the stairs to laugh , tipped over her basket , and every solitary stick of that wood clattered down the uncarpeted stairs , thumped through the banisters , bounced on the floor , rolled into the corners , thundered against the cellar door . I do n't believe you ever heard such a noise in all your life . Mr. and Mrs. Breynton ran from one direction , Tom from another , Winnie from a third , and Patty , screaming , in fearful dishabille , from the attic , and the congress that assembled in that entry where sat Gypsy speechless on one stair , and Joy on another , the power fails me to describe . But this was the end of that Christmas night . It should be recorded that the five-dollar bill and the portfolio with purple roses on it were both forthcoming that day , and that Gypsy entirely forgot any difference between her own little gifts and Joy 's . This was partly because she had somehow learned to be glad in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain look in her mother 's eyes when she saw the picture-frame . Such a look made Gypsy happy for days together . That Christmas was as merry as Christmas can be , but the best part of it all was the sight of Peace Maythorne 's face as she lay twining the gorgeous worsteds over her thin fingers , the happy sunlight touching their colors of crimson , and royal purple , and orange , and woodland brown , just as kindly as it was touching the new Christmas jewels over which many another young girl in many another home sat laughing that morning . But Gypsy long remembered -- she remembers now with dim eyes and quivering smile -- how Peace drew her face down softly on the pillow , pointing to the blue and golden words upon the wall , and said in a whisper that nobody else heard : " That is best of all . Oh , Gypsy , when I woke up in the morning and found it ! " CHAPTER IX UP RATTLESNAKE " I should think we might , I 'm sure , " said Joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork , just midway between her plate and her lips . " You need n't shake your head so , Mother Breynton , " said Gypsy , her great brown eyes pleading over her teacup with their very most irresistible twinkle . " Now it is n't the slightest trouble to say yes , and you can just as well say it now as any other time , you know . " " But it really seems to me a little dangerous , Gypsy ,  - -  up over those mountain roads on livery-stable horses . " " But Tom says it is n't a bit dangerous , and Tom 's been up it forty times . Rattlesnake has the best roads of any of the mountains round here , and there are fences by all the precipices , Tom said , did n't you , Tom ? " " No , " said Tom , coolly . " There is n't a fence . There are logs in some places , and in some there are n't . " " Oh , what a bother you are ! Well , any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit afraid of stable horses . I can manage any of them , from Mr. Burt 's iron-gray colt down , " which was true enough . Gypsy was used to riding , and perfectly fearless . " But Joy has n't ridden much , and I should never forgive myself if any accident happened to her while her father is gone . " " Joy can ride Billy . There is n't a cow in Yorkbury safer . " Mrs. Breynton sipped her tea and thought about it . " I want to go horsebacking , too , " put in Winnie , glaring savagely at Gypsy over his bread and milk . " I 'm five years old . " " And jerked six whole buttons off your jacket this very day , " said Gypsy , eyeing certain gaps of which there were always more or less to be seen in Winnie 's attire in spite of his mother 's care . " A boy who jerks buttons like that could n't go ' horsebacking . ' You would n't have one left by the time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk over . You tipped it over times enough this morning for one day . " " You will have your milk over ; do n't stand the mug up on the napkin-ring , no , nor on that crust of bread , either , " repeated his mother , and everybody looked up anxiously , and edged away a little from Winnie 's immediate vicinity . This young gentleman had a pleasing little custom of deluging the united family at meal-time , at least once regularly every day , with milk and bread-crumbs ; maternal and paternal injunctions , threats , and punishments notwithstanding , he contrived every day some perfectly novel , ingenious , and totally unexpected method of accomplishing the same ; uniting , in his efforts , the strategy of a Napoleon , with the unruffled composure of a Grant . " I do n't know but what I 'll see what father thinks about it , " Mrs. Breynton went on , thoughtfully . " If he should be willing --  " " Good , good ! " cried Gypsy , clapping her hands . " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask him if we ca n't go up Rattlesnake . " " Well , " said Winnie , " when I just get through eatin ' . I 'm goin ' to make him let me horseback as much as you or anybody else . " Winnie finished his toast with imperturbable deliberation , pushed back his chair , and jumped up . Illustration Splash ! went a shower of milk all over him , his mother , the table , and the carpet . Everybody jumped . Winnie gasped and stood dripping . " Oh-oh ! how did he do it ? Why , Winnie Breynton ! " For there hung the mug from his waist , empty , upside down , tied to his bib . " In a hard knot , if you 'll believe it ! I never saw such a child in all my life ! Why , Winnie ! " The utter blankness of astonishment that crept over Winnie 's face when he looked down and saw the mug hanging , Mr. Darley might have made a small fortune out of ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be one of those cases when " the heart feels most though the lips move not . " " What did you do such a thing for ? What could possess you ? " " Oh , " said Winnie , very red in the face , " it 's there , is it ? I was a steamboat , and the mug was my stove-pipe , ' n ' then I forgot . I want a clean apron . I do n't want any milk to-morrer . " This was in the early summer . The holidays had come and gone , and the winter and the spring . Coasting , skating , and snowballing had given place to driving hoop , picking flowers , boating , and dignified promenades on the fashionable pavement down town ; furs and bright woolen hoods , tippets , mittens , and rubber-boots were exchanged for calico dresses , comfortable , brown , bare hands , and jaunty straw hats with feathers on them . On the whole , it had been a pleasant winter : times there had been when Gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished she were at home ; certain little jealousies there had been , selfish thoughts , unkind acts , angry words ; but many penitent hours as well , some confessions , the one to the other , that nobody else heard , and a certain faint , growing interest in each other . Strictly speaking , they did not very much love each other yet , but they were not far from it . " I am getting used to Joy , " said Gypsy . " I like Gypsy ever so much better than I did once , " Joy wrote to her father . One thing they had learned that winter . Every generous deed , every thoughtful word , narrowed the distance between them ; each one wiped out the ugly memory of some past impatience , some past unkindness . And now something was about to happen that should bring them nearer to each other than anything had done yet . That June night on which they sat at the tea-table discussing the excursion up Rattlesnake was the beginning of it . When Winnie was sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any safety to the carpets , he was dispatched to the library on the errand to his father . What with various wire-pullings of Gypsy 's , and arguments from Tom , the result was that Mr. Breynton gave his consent to the plan , on condition that the young people would submit to his accompanying them . " That 's perfectly splend , " cried Gypsy ; " all the better for having you . Only , my best beloved of fathers , you must n't keep saying , ' Gypsy , Gypsy , be careful , ' you know , every time my horse jumps , because if you should , I 'm very much afraid . " Illustration " Afraid of what ? " " That Gypsy would n't be careful , " said the young lady , folding her hands demurely . Her father attempted to call her a sauce-box but Gypsy jumped upon his knee , and pulled his whiskers till he cried out for mercy , and gave her a kiss instead . There was an undercurrent of reality in the fun , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it -- his children were perfectly conscious of ; children are apt to be the first to discover their parents ' faults and weaknesses . Gypsy loved her father dearly , but she somehow always felt as if he must be managed . So it came about that on a certain royal June day , a merry party started for a horseback ride up Rattlesnake mountain . " I 've a good mind to take my waterproof , " said Joy , as they were starting ; " we may not be back till late , and you know how cold it grows by the river after dark . " " Nonsense ! " laughed Gypsy ; " why , the thermometer 's 80 deg. already . " Nevertheless , Joy went back and got the waterproof . She afterwards had occasion to be very glad of it . The party consisted of Mr. Breynton , Tom , Joy , Gypsy , Mr. and Mrs. Hallam ( this was the Mrs. Hallam who had once been Gypsy 's teacher ) , Sarah Rowe , and her brother Francis , who was home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom always coughed and arched his eyebrows in a very peculiar way when this was mentioned , but Gypsy could never find out what he did it for . The day , as I said , was royal . The sky , the river , the delicate golden green of the young leaves and grass , the lights and shadows on the distant mountains , all were mellowed in together like one of Church 's pictures , and there was one of those spicy winds that Gypsy always described by saying that " the angels had been showering great bottles of fresh cologne-water into them . " The young people felt these things in a sort of dreamy , unconscious way , but they were too busy and too merry to notice them in detail . Joy was mounted safely on demure Billy , and Gypsy rode -- not Mr. Burt 's iron-gray , for Tom claimed that -- but a free , though manageable pony , with just the arch of the neck , toss of the mane , and coquettish lifting of the feet that she particularly fancied . The rest were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had just bought , and the like of which was not to be seen in Yorkbury . Up -- up , winding on and away , through odors of fragrant pines and unseen flowers , under the soft , green shadows , through the yellow lights . How beautiful -- how beautiful it was ! " Who 'll race with me ? " inquired Mr. Francis Rowe suddenly . " I call it an uncommon bore , this doing nothing but looking at the trees . I say , Breynton , the slope 's easy here for a quarter of a mile ; come ahead . " " No , thank you ; I do n't approve of racing up mountains . " Tom might have said he did n't approve of being beaten ; the iron-gray was no match for the colt , and he knew it . " Who 'll race ? " persisted Mr. Francis , impatiently ; " is n't there anybody ? " " I will , " said Gypsy , seriously enough . " You ! " said Tom ; " why , the colt would leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Robinson . " " Oh , I do n't expect to beat . Of course that 's out of the question . But I should like the run ; where 's the goal , Francis ? " " That turn in the road where the tall fir-tree is , with those dead limbs ; you see ? " " Yes . We 'll trot , of course . All ready . " " Be very careful , Gypsy , " called her father , nervously ; " I 'm really almost afraid to have you go . You might come to the precipice sooner , than you expect , and then the horse may shy . " " I 'll be careful father ; come , Nelly , gently -- whe-ee ! " Suddenly reflecting that it was not supposed to be lady-like to whistle , Gypsy drew her lips into a demure pucker , touched Nelly with the tassel of her whip , and flew away up the hill on a brisk trot . Mr. Francis condescendingly checked the full speed of the colt , and they rode on pretty nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to my horse , I must really come in first , " began Mr. Francis , loosening his rein as they neared the fir-tree . " Oh , of course , " said Gypsy , with a twinkle in her eyes ; " I did n't undertake to beat . " Now Nelly had a trick with which Gypsy was perfectly familiar , of breaking into a run at an instant 's notice , if she were pinched in a certain spot on her neck . Suddenly , while the colt was springing on in his fleet trot , and Mr. Francis supposed Gypsy was a full eight feet behind , he was utterly confounded to see her flying past him on a bounding gallop , her hair tossing in the wind , her cheeks scarlet , her eyes triumphant . But right in the middle of the road , between them and the fir-tree , was something neither of them had seen ;  - -  a huge tree just fallen , with its high , prickly branches on . " Jerusalem ! " said Mr. Francis , under his breath as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good ! here 's a jump , " cried Gypsy , and over it she went at a bound . The colt reared and shied , and planting his dainty forefeet firmly on the ground , refused to stir an inch . Gypsy whirled around and stood triumphant under the fir-tree , her eyes snapping merrily . " Why , how did this ever happen ? " cried the rest , as they came laughing up . " I say , there 's some witchcraft about this business , " remarked Mr. Francis , quite bewildered ; " wait till I 've cleared off these branches , and we 'll try that over again . " " Very well , " said Gypsy , in a perfect whirl of excitement and delight , as she always was , with anything in the shape of reins in her hand . But just then she looked back and saw Joy toiling on slowly behind the others ; Billy with his head hanging and his spirits quite gone . Gypsy stopped a moment as if in thought , and then rode slowly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Joy disconsolately , as she came up ; " Billy is as stupid as a mule , and wo n't go . " " I 'm real sorry , " said Gypsy , slowly ; " you might have Nelly . We 'll change awhile . " " No , " said Joy , " I 'm afraid of Nelly . Besides , you would n't like Billy any better than I do . It 's dreadfully stupid back here alone , though . I wish I had n't come . " " Francis , " called Gypsy , " I guess I wo n't race , I 'm going to ride with Joy awhile . " " Why , you need n't do that ! " said Joy , rather ashamed of her complaining . But Gypsy did do it ; and though her face had clouded for the moment , a sunbeam broke over it then that lasted the rest of the day . The day passed very much like other picnics . They stopped in a broad , level place on the summit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , tufted wood-grass , unpacked the dinner baskets , and devoted themselves to biscuit and cold tongue , tarts , lemonade and current wine , through the lazy , golden nooning . It was voted that they should not attempt the long , hot ride down the mountain-side until the blaze of the afternoon sun should be somewhat cooled . So , after dinner they went their several ways , finding amusement for the sultry hours . Mr. Breynton and Tom went off on a hunt after a good place to water the horses ; Francis Rowe betook himself to a cigar ; Sarah curled herself up on the soft moss with her sack for a pillow , and went to sleep ; Mr. and Mrs. Hallam sat under the trees and read Tennyson to each other . " How terribly stupid that must be , " said Gypsy , looking on in supreme disgust ; " let 's you and I go off . I know a place where there used to be some splendid foxberry blossoms , lot 's of ' em , real pretty ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pair of sharp scissors . " " I would n't go out of sight of us all , " called Mr. Breynton , as the two girls roamed away together among the trees . " But you are most out of sight now , " said Joy , presently . " Oh , he did n't say we must n't , " answered Gypsy . " He did n't mean we must n't , either . Father always worries so . " It would have been well for Gypsy if her father 's wish had been to her what her mother 's was -- as binding as a command . " Just think , " observed Gypsy , as they strolled on through the fallen leaves and redcup mosses , " just think of their sitting still and reading poetry on a picnic ! I ca n't get over it . Miss Melville did n't used to do such stupid things . It 's just ' cause she 's married . " " How do you know but you 'll do just the same some day ? " " Catch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not going to be married ! Why , I am , and I 'm going to have a white velvet dress too . " " Well , you may . But I would n't for a whole trunkful of white velvet dresses -- no , I would n't for two dozen trunkfuls . I 'm not going to stay home and keep house , and look sober , with my hair done up behind . I 'd rather be an old maid , and have a pony and run round in the woods . " " Why , I never saw such a girl ! " exclaimed Joy , opening her small eyes wide ; " I would n't be an old maid for anything . I 'm going to be married in St. Paul 's , and I 'm going to have my dress all caught up with orange buds , and spangles on my veil . Therese and I , we planned it all out one night -- Therese used to be my French nurse , you know . " For answer , Gypsy threw herself down suddenly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hazy sky , showing in patches through a lace work of thousands of leaves . " Joy , " she said , breaking a silence , and speaking in a curious , earnest tone Gypsy seldom used , " I do really , though , sometimes go off alone where there are some trees , and wonder . " " Wonder what ? " " What in this world I was ever made for . I suppose there 's got to be a reason . " " A reason ! " said Joy , blankly . " There 's got to be something done , for all I see . God does n't make people live on and on and die , for nothing . One ca n't be a little girl all one 's life , climbing trees and making snowballs , " said Gypsy , half dreamily , half impatiently , jumping up and walking on . Illustration So they wandered away and away , deeper into the heart of the forest , through moss and tufted grasses , and tangles of mountain flowers , chatting as girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then a flash of graver thought like this of Gypsy 's . " You 're sure you know the way back , " said Joy , presently . " Oh , yes ; I 've been over it forty times . We 've turned about a good many times , but I do n't think we 've gone very far from the top of the mountain . " So , deeper , and further , and on , where the breath of the pines was sweet ; where hidden blossoms were folding their cups for the night , and the shadows in the thickets were growing gray . " Gypsy ! " said Joy , suddenly , " we 're certainly going down hill ! " " So we are , " said Gypsy , thoughtfully ; " it 's getting dark , too . They 'll be ready to start for home . I guess we 'll go back now . " They turned then , and began rapidly to retrace their steps , over brambles and stones and fallen trees ; through thickets , and up projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gypsy , half under her breath ; " why did n't we find it out before ? " " Gypsy , " said Joy , after a silence , " do you remember that knot of white birches ? I do n't . " Gypsy stopped and looked around . " N-no , I do n't know as I do . But I dare say we saw them and forgot . Let 's walk a little faster . " They walked a little faster . They walked quite as fast as they could go . " See that great pile of rock , " said Joy , presently , her voice trembling a little ; " I know we did n't come by that before . It looks as if there were a precipice off there . " Gypsy made no answer . She was looking keenly around , her eyes falling on every rock , stump , tree , and flower , in search of the tiny , trodden path by which they had left the summit of the mountain . But there was no path . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was now very dark . " I guess this is the way , " spoke up Gypsy , cheerfully --  " here . Take hold of my hand , Joy , and we 'll run . I think I know where the path is . We had turned off from it a little bit . " Joy took her hand , and they ran on together . It grew darker , and grew darker . They could scarcely see the sky now , and the brambles grew high and thick and strange . Suddenly Gypsy stopped , knee-deep in a jungle of blackberry bushes . " Joy , I'm -- afraid I don't -- know the -- way . " CHAPTER X WE ARE LOST The two girls , still clasping hands , looked into each other 's eyes . Gypsy was very pale . " Then we are lost ! " " Yes . " Joy broke into a sort of sobbing cry . Gypsy squeezed her hand very tightly , with quivering lips . " It 's all my fault . I thought I knew . Oh , Joy , I 'm so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrent of reproaches ; once it would have been so ; but for some reason , Joy did not say an angry word . She only sobbed away quietly , clutching at Gypsy 's hand as if she were very much frightened . She was frightened thoroughly . The scene was enough to terrify a far less timid child than Joy . It was now quite dark . Over in the west a faint , ghostly gleam of light still lingered , seen dimly through the trees ; but it only made the utter blackness of the great forest-shadows more horrible . The huge trunks of the pines and maples towered up , up -- they could scarcely see how far , grim , and gloomy and silent ; here and there a dead branch thrust itself out against the sky , in that hideous likeness to a fleshless hand which night and darkness always lend to them . Even Gypsy , though she had been in the woods many times at night before , shuddered as she stood looking up . A queer thought came to her , of an old fable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fable of some huge Titans , angry and fierce , who tried to climb into heaven ; there was just that look about the trees . It was very still . The birds were in their nests , their singing done . From far away in some distant swamp came the monotonous , mournful chant of the frogs -- a dreary sound enough , heard in a safe and warm and lighted home ; unspeakably ugly if one is lost in a desolate forest . Now and then a startled squirrel dropped from bough to bough ; or there was the stealthy , sickening rustle of an unseen snake among the fallen leaves . From somewhere , too , where precipices that they could not find dashed downwards into damp gullies , cold , clinging mists were rising . " To stay here all night ! " sobbed Joy , " Oh Gypsy , Gypsy ! " Gypsy was a brave , sensible girl , and after that first moment of horror when she stood looking up at the trees , her courage and her wits came back to her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , " speaking in a decided , womanly way , a little of the way her mother had in a difficulty . " They are all over the mountain hunting for us now . They 'll find us before long , I know . Besides , if they did n't , we could sit down in a dry place somewhere , and wait till morning ; there would n't anything hurt us . Oh , you brought your waterproof -- good ! Put it on and button it up tight . " Joy had the cloak folded over her arm . She did passively as Gypsy told her . When it was all buttoned , she suddenly remembered that Gypsy wore only her thin , nankeen sack , and she offered to share it with her . " No , " said Gypsy , " I do n't want it . Wrap it around your throat as warm as you can . I got you into this scrape , and now I 'm going to take care of you . Now let 's halloa . " And halloa they did , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frightened way , Gypsy in loud shouts , and strong , like a boy 's . But there was no answer . They called again and again ; they stopped after each cry , with breath held in , and head bent to listen . Nothing was to be heard but the frogs and the squirrels and the gliding snakes . Joy broke out into fresh sobs . " Well , it 's no use to stand here any longer , " said Gypsy ; " let 's run on . " " Run where ? You do n't know which way . What shall we do , what shall we do ? " " We 'll go this way -- we have n't tried it at all . I should n't wonder a bit if the path were right over there where it looks so black . Besides , we shall hear them calling for us . " Ah , if there had been anybody to tell them ! In precisely the other direction , the picnic party , roused and frightened , were searching every thicket , and shouting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sent them so much further away from help . While they were running on , still hand in hand , Joy heard the most remarkable sound . It was a laugh from Gypsy -- actually a soft , merry laugh , breaking out like music on the night air , in the dreary place . " Why , Gypsy Breynton ! What can you find to laugh at , I should like to know ? " said Joy , provoked enough to stop crying at very short notice . " Oh , dear , I really ca n't help it , " apologized Gypsy , choking down the offending mirth ; " but I was thinking -- I could n't help it , Joy , now , possibly -- how mad Francis Rowe will be to think he 's got to stop and help hunt us up ! " " I wonder what that black thing is ahead of us , " said Joy , presently . They were still running on together , but their hands were not joined just at that moment . Joy was a little in advance . " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intently . The words were scarcely off from her lips before she cried out with a loud cry , and sprang forward , clutching at Joy 's dress . She was too late . Joy tripped over a mass of briars , fell , rolled heavily -- not over upon the ground , but off . Off into horrible , utter darkness . Down , with outstretched hands and one long shriek . Gypsy stood as if someone had charmed her into a marble statue , her hands thrown above her head , her eyes peering into the blank darkness below . She stood so for one instant only ; then she did what only wild , impulsive Gypsy would have done . She went directly down after Joy , clinging with her hands and feet to the side of the cliff ; slipping , rolling , getting to her feet again , tearing her clothes , her hands , her arms -- down like a ball , bounding , bouncing , blinded , bewildered . If it had been four hundred feet , there is no doubt she would have gone just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she landed somewhere on a patch of soft grass , except for her scratches and a bruise or two , quite unhurt . Something lay here beside her , flat upon the ground . It was Joy . She lay perfectly still . A horrible fear came over Gypsy . She crept up on her hands and knees , trying to see her lace through the dark , and just then Joy moaned faintly . Gypsy 's heart gave a great thump . In that moment , in the moment of that horrible fear and that great relief , Gypsy knew for the first time that she loved Joy , and how much . " It 's my ankle , " moaned Joy ; " it must be broken -- I know it 's broken . " It was not broken , but very badly sprained . " Can you stand on it ? " asked Gypsy , her face almost as pale as Joy 's . Joy tried to get to her feet , but fell heavily , with a cry of pain . Gypsy looked around her with dismay . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gully towered a high , dark wall ; at each end , shelving stones were piled upon each other . They had fallen into a sort of unroofed cave ,  - -  a hollow , shut in completely and impassably . Impassably to Joy ; there could be no doubt about that . To leave her there alone was out of the question . There was but one thing to be done ; there was no alternative . " We must stay here all night , " said Gypsy , slowly . She had scarcely finished her sentence when she sprang up , her lips parted and white . " Joy , see , see ! what is that ? " " What ? Where ? " asked Joy between her sobs . " There ! is n't that smoke ? " A distinct , crackling sound answered her , as of something fiercely licking up the dead leaves and twigs ,  - -  a fearful sound to hear in a great forest . At the same instant a white cloud of smoke puffed down almost into their faces . Before they had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow flame shot up on the edge of the cliff , glared far into the shadow of the forest , lighted up the ravine with an awful brightness . The mountain was on fire . Gypsy sat for the instant without speaking or moving . She seemed to herself to have no words to say , no power of motion . She knew far better than Joy what those five words meant . A dim remembrance came to her -- and it was horrible that it should come to her just then -- of something she had seen when she was a very little girl , and never forgotten , and never would forget . A mountain burning for weeks , and a woman lost on it ; all the town turned out in an agony of search ; the fires out one day , and a slow procession winding down the blank , charred slope , bearing something closely covered , that no one looked upon . She sprang up in an agony of terror . " Oh , Joy , ca n't you walk ? We shall die here ! We shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch fell hissing into a little pool at the bottom of the gully . It passed so near them that it singed a lock of Gypsy 's hair . Joy crawled to her feet , fell , crawled up again , fell again . Gypsy seized her in both arms , and dragged her across the gully . Joy was taller than herself , and nearly as heavy . How she did it she never knew . Terror gave her a flash of that sort of strength which we sometimes find among the insane . She laid Joy down in a corner of the ravine the furthest removed from the fire ; she could not have carried her another inch . Above and all around towered and frowned the rocks ; there was not so much as a crevice opening between them ; there was not a spot that Joy could climb . Across , the great tongues of flame tossed themselves into the air , and glared awfully against the sky , which was dark with hurrying clouds . The underbrush was all on fire ; two huge pine trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then like rockets . When those trees fell they would fall into the ravine . Gypsy sat down and covered her face . Little did Mr. Francis Rowe think what he had done , when , strolling along by the ravine at twilight , he threw down his half-burnt cigar : threw it down and walked away whistling , and has probably never thought of it from that day to this . Gypsy sat there with her hands before her face , and she sat very still . She understood in that moment what was coming to her and to Joy . Yes , to her as well as to Joy ; for she would not leave Joy to die alone . It would be an easy thing for her to climb the cliffs ; she was agile , fearless , as used to the mountains as a young chamois , and the ascent , as I said , though steep , was not high . Once out of that gully where death was certain , she would have at least a chance of life . The fire if not checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that she could escape it she thought was probable , if not sure . And life was so sweet , so dear . And her mother -- poor mother , waiting at home , and looking and longing for her ! Gypsy gave a great gulp ; there was such a pain in her throat it seemed as if it would strangle her . But should she leave Joy , crippled and helpless , to die alone in this horrible place ? Should she do it ? No , it was through her careless fault that they had been brought into it . She would stay with Joy . " I do n't see as we can do anything , " she said , raising her head . " Shall we be burned to death ? " shrieked Joy . " Gypsy , Gypsy , shall we be burned to death ? " A huge , hot branch flew into the gully while she spoke , hissing as the other had done , into the pool . The glare shot deeper and redder into the forest , and the great trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls caught each other 's hands . To die -- to die so horribly ! One moment to be sitting there , well and strong , so full of warm , young life ; the next to lie buried in a hideous tangle of fallen , flaming trunks , their bodies consuming to a little heap of ashes that the wind would blow away to-morrow morning ; their souls -- where ? " I wish I 'd said my prayers every day , " sobbed Joy , weakly . " I wish I 'd been a good girl ! " " Let 's say them now , Joy . Let 's ask Him to stop the fire . If He ca n't , maybe He 'll let us go to heaven anyway . " So Gypsy knelt down on the rocks that were becoming hot now to the touch , and began the first words that came to her :  --  " Our Father which art in Heaven , " and faltered in them , sobbing , and began again , and went through somehow to the end . After that , they were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faintly , " I 've been real ugly to you since you 've been at our house . " " I 've scolded you , too , a lot , and made fun of your things . I wish I had n't . " " If we could only get out of here , I 'd never be cross to you as long as ever I live , and I wish you 'd please to forgive me . " " I will if -- if you 'll forgive me , you know . Oh , Gypsy , it 's growing so hot over here ! " " Kiss me , Joy . " They kissed each other through their sobs . " Mother 's in the parlor now , watching for us , and Tom and --  " Gypsy 's sentence was never finished . There was a great blazing and crackling , and one of the trees fell , swooping down with a crash . It fell across the ravine , lying there , a bridge of flame , and lighting the underbrush upon the opposite side . One tree stood yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the corner of the gully where the girls were crouched up against the rocks . And then Joy remembered what in her terror she had not thought of before . " Gypsy , you can climb ! do n't stay here with me . What are you staying for ? " " You need n't talk about that , " said Gypsy , with faltering voice ; " if it had n't been for me you would n't be here . I 'm not going to sneak off and leave you , not any such thing ! " Whether Gypsy would have kept this resolve -- and very like Gypsy it was , to make it -- when the flames were actually upon her ; whether , indeed , she ought to have kept it , are questions open to discussion . Something happened just then that saved the trouble of deciding . It was nothing but a clap of thunder , to be sure , but I wonder if you have any idea how it sounded to those two girls . It was a tremendous peal , and it was followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that the girls stretched out their arms to with a great cry , as if it had been an angel from heaven . A shower almost like the bursting of a cloud ,  - -  great , pelting drops , hissing down upon the flaming tree ; it seemed like a solid sheet of water ; as if the very flood-gates of heaven were open . The cruel fire hissed and sputtered , and shot up in angry jets , and died in puffs of sullen smoke ; the glaring bridge blackened slowly ; the pine-tree , swayed by the sudden winds , fell into the forest , and the ravine was safe . The flames , though not quenched , it might take hours to do that ,  - -  were thoroughly checked . And who was that with white , set face , and outstretched hands , springing over the smoking logs , leaping down into the ravine ? " Oh , Tom , Tom ! Oh , father , here we are ! " CHAPTER XI GRAND TIMES " To go to Washington ? " " Go to Washington ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See the President . " " And the White House and the soldiers . " " And the donkeys and all . " " I know it . " " Father Breynton , if you 're not just magnificent ! " This classical conversation took place on a certain Wednesday morning in that golden June which the picnic ushered in . And such a hurrying and scampering , and mending and making of dresses , such a trimming of summer hats and packing of trunks and valises , as there was the rest of that week ! " You 'd better believe we 're busy , " Gypsy observed , with a very superior air , to Mrs. Surly , who had " just dropped in to find out what that flyaway Gypsy had been screechin ' round the house so for , these two days past . " " You 'd better believe we have enough to do . Joy 's got two white skirts to have tucked in little bits of tucks , and she 's sent to Boston for a new veil . Mother 's made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've got a beautiful brown feather for my turban . Besides , we 're going to see the President , and what do you think ? Father says there are ever so many mules in Washington . Wo n't I sit at the windows and see ' em go by ! " Thursday , Friday , Saturday passed ; Sunday began and ended in a rain-storm ; Monday came like a dream , with warm , sweet winds , and dewdrops quivering in a blaze of unclouded light . Like a dream it seemed to the girls to be hurrying away at five o'clock , from an unfinished breakfast , from Mrs. Breynton 's gentle good-bye , Tom 's valuable patronage and advice , and Winnie 's reminder that he was five years old , and that to the candid mind it was perfectly clear that he ought " to go too-o-oo . " Very much like a dream was it , to be walking on the platform at the station , in the tucked skirts and new brown feather ; to watch the checking of the trunks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from all other checks and tickets ; to find how interesting the framed railway and steamboat guide for the Continent , on the walls of the little dingy ladies ' room , suddenly became ,  - -  at least until the pleasing discovery that it was printed in 1849 , and gave minute directions for reaching the Territory of California . More like a dream was it , to watch the people that lounged or worked about the depot ; the ticket-master , who had stood shut up there just so behind the little window for twenty years ; the baggage-master , who tossed about their trunks without ever thinking of the jewelry-boxes inside , and that cologne-bottle with the shaky cork ; the cross-eyed woman with her knitting-work , who sold sponge-cake and candy behind a very small counter ; the small boys in singularly airy jackets , who were putting pins and marbles on the track for the train to run over ; the old woman across the street , who was hanging out her clothes to dry in the back yard , just as if it had been nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington ;  - -  how strange it seemed that they could all be living on and on just as they did every day ! " Oh , just think ! " said Gypsy , with wide open eyes . " Did you ever ? Is n't it funny ? Oh , I wish they could go off and have a good time too . " Still like a dream did it seem , when the train shrieked up and shrieked them away , over and down the mountains , through sunlight and shadow , by forest and river , past village and town and city , away like an arrow , with Yorkbury out of sight , and out of mind , and only the wonderful , untried days that were coming , to think about , ah , who would think of anything else , that could have such days ? Gypsy made her entrance into Boston in a very distingue style . It chanced that just after they left Fitchburg , she espied the stone pier of an unfinished bridge , surmounted by a remarkable boy standing on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own head and one shoulder , the better to obtain a view of the phenomenon . " Look out , Gypsy , " said her father uneasily . " If another train should come along , that is very dangerous . " " Yes , sir , " said Gypsy , with a twinkle in her eye , " I am looking out . " Now , as Mr. Breynton had been on the continual worry about her ever since they left Yorkbury , afraid she would catch cold in the draft , lose her glove out of the window , go out on the platform , or fall in stepping from car to car , Gypsy did not pay the immediate heed to his warning that she ought to have done . Before he had time to speak again , puff ! came a sharp gust of wind and away went her pretty turban with its new brown feather ,  - -  over the bridge and down into the river . " There ! " said Joy . " Gypsy , my dear ! " said her father . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the utmost astonishment , " I can wear a handkerchief . " Illustration So into Boston she came with nothing but a handkerchief tied over her bright , tossing hair . You ought to have seen the hackmen laugh ! The girls made an agreement with Mrs. Breynton to keep a journal while they were gone ; send her what they could , and read the rest of it to her when they came home . She thought in this way they would remember what they saw more easily , and with much less confusion and mistake . These journals will give you a better account of their journey than I can do . They wrote first from New York . This is what Joy had to say :  --  New York , June 17 ,  - -  Tuesday Night . " Oh , I 'm so tired ! We 've been ' on the go ' all day . You see , we got into Boston last night , and took the boat , you know , just as we expected to . I 've been on so forty times with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he went on business ; so I was just as used to it , and went right to sleep ; but Gypsy , you know , she 's never been to New York any way , and never was on a steamer , and you ought to have seen her keep hopping up in her berth to look at things and listen to things ! I expected as much as could be she 'd fall down on me -- I had the under berth -- and I do n't believe she slept very much . I do n't care so much about New York as she does , either , because I 've seen it all . Uncle thought we 'd stay here a day so as to look about . He wanted Gypsy to see some pictures and things . To-morrow morning real early we go to Philadelphia . You do n't know what a lovely bonnet I saw up Fifth Avenue to-day . It was white crape , with the dearest little loves of forget-me-nots outside and in , and then a white veil . I 'm going to make father buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of mourning . " I expect this is n't very much like a journal , but I 'm terribly sleepy , and I guess I must go to bed . " GYPSY 'S JOURNAL . " Brevoort House , Tuesday Night . " Mother , Mother Breynton ! I never had such a good time in all my life ! Oh , I forgot to say I have n't any more idea how to write a journal than the man in the moon . I meant to put that at the beginning so you 'd know . " Well , we came on by boat , and you 've no idea how that machinery squeaked . I laughed and laughed , and I kept waking up and laughing . " Then -- oh , did Joy tell you about my hat ? I suppose you 'll be sorry , but I do n't believe you can help laughing possibly . I just lost it out of the car window , looking at a boy out in the river standing on its head . I mean the boy was on his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston tied up in a handkerchief . Father hurried off to get me a new hat , ' cause there was n't any time for me to go with him , and what do you suppose he bought ? I do n't think you 'd ever get over it , if you were to see it . It was a white turban with a black edge rolled up , and a great fringe of blue beads and a green feather ! He said he bought it at the first milliner 's he came to , and I should think he did . I guess you 'd better believe I felt nice going all the way to New York in it . This morning I ripped off the blue fringe the very first thing , and went into Broadway ( is n't it a big street ? and I never saw such tall policemen with so many whiskers and such a lot of ladies to be helped across ) and bought some black velvet ribbon with a white edge to match the straw ; the green feather was n't nice enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , and father paid five dollars for this horrid old thing , so I thought I would n't take it to a milliner . I just trimmed it up myself in a rosette , and it does n't look so badly after all . But oh , my pretty brown feather ! Is n't it a shame ? " Father took us to the Aspinwall picture-gallery to-day . Joy did n't care about it , but I liked it ever so much , only there were ever so many Virgin Marys up in the clouds , that looked as if they 'd been washed out and hung up to dry . Besides , I did n't understand what all the little angels were kicking at . Father said they were from the old masters , and there was a lady with a pink parasol , that screamed right out , and said they were sweet pretty . I suppose when I 'm grown up I shall have to think so too . I saw a picture of a little boy out in the woods , asleep , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so many other things , but I have n't half time to tell you about them all . " We 're at the Brevoort House , and I tell you I was frightened when I first came in , it 's so handsome . We take our rooms , and then just go down into the most splendid dining-hall , and sit down at little tables and order what we want , and do n't pay for anything but that . Father says it 's the European plan . Our rooms are beautiful . Do n't you tell anybody , but I 'm almost afraid of the waiters and chambermaids ; they look as if they felt so grand . But Joy , she just rings the bell and makes them bring her up some water , and orders them around like anything . Joy wanted to go to the Fifth Avenue Hotel , but father said it was too noisy . He says this is noisy enough , but he wanted us to see what a handsome hotel is like , and -- and -- why ! I 'm almost asleep . JOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He thought once of going to La Pierre , but gave it up . Father used to go to the Continental , I know , because I 've heard him say so . I 'm too tired to write any more . " GYPSY 'S JOURNAL .

" Saturday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , and it is really very nice . I did n't suppose I should like it so much ; but there is a great deal to be seen . We stopped over one train at Baltimore . It rained like everything , but uncle wanted us to see the city . So we took a hack and drove about , and saw Washington 's monument . I suppose I ought to describe it , but it was so rainy I did n't notice it very much . I think monuments look like big ghosts , and then I 'm always afraid they 'll tumble over on me . " Gypsy said she wondered whether George Washington ever looked down out of heaven to see the monuments , and cities , and towns , and all the things that are named after him , and what he thought about it . Was n't it queer in her ? " We stopped at a great cathedral there is in Baltimore , too . It was very handsome , only so dark . I saw some Irish women saying their prayers round in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water by the door , and they all dipped their fingers in it and crossed themselves as they went in and out . " We saw ever so many negroes in Baltimore , too . From the time you get to Philadelphia , on to Washington , there are ever so many ; it 's so different from New England . I never saw so many there in all my life as we have seen these few days . Gypsy doubled up her fist and looked real angry when she saw them sometimes , and said , ' Just to think ! perhaps that man is a slave , or that little girl ! ' But I never thought about it somehow . To-morrow I will write about Washington . Baltimore has taken up all my room . " GYPSY 'S JOURNAL . Willard 's Hotel , Saturday Night . " You ought to have seen the yellow omnibus we came up from the depot in ! Such a looking thing ! It was ever so long , something like a square stove-pipe , pulled out ; and it was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of them there waiting for the passengers . I should think they might have some decent , comfortable horse-cars , the way they do in other cities . I think it 's very nice at Philadelphia . They come to the depots at every train , and go down at every train . Father says the horse-car arrangements are better in Philadelphia than they are in Boston or New York . " It seems very funny here , to be in a city that is under military rule . There are a great many soldiers , and barracks where they sleep ; and a great many tents , too . There are forts , father says , all around the city , and Monday we can see some of them . While we were riding up from the depot I saw six soldiers marching along with a Rebel prisoner . Father says they found him hanging around the Capitol , and that he was a Rebel spy . He had on a ragged coat , and a great many black whiskers , and he was swearing terribly . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope they 'll hang him , or something ; but father says he does n't know . " We are at Willard 's Hotel . Father came here for the same reason he went to the Brevoort -- so we might see what it was like . It is very large , and so many stairs ! and such long dining-tables , and so many men eating at them . We did n't have as nice a supper as we did in New York . " It is late now , and the lamps are lighted in the streets . I can see from the window the people hurrying by , and some soldiers , and one funny little tired mule drawing a great wagon of something . " There ! he 's stopped and wo n't move an inch , and the man is whipping him awfully . The wicked old thing .... " I was just going to open the window and tell him to stop , but father says I must n't . " As we rode up from the depot , I saw a great round dim thing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Capitol . " GYPSY 'S JOURNAL . " After Sundown , Sunday Night . " Father says it is n't any harm to write a little about what we saw to-day , because we have n't been anywhere except to church . " The horrid old gong woke me up real early this morning . I should have thought it very late at home , but they do n't have breakfast in hotels till eight o'clock hardly ever , and you can get up all along till eleven , just as you like . This morning we were so tired that we did n't want to get up a bit . " There was a waiter at the table that tipped over a great plateful of beefsteak and gravy right on to a lady 's blue silk morning-dress . She was a Senator 's wife , and she jumped like anything . Joy said , ' What a shame ! ' but I think it 's real silly in people to wear blue silk morning-dresses , because then you ca n't wear anything any nicer , and you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I forgot ! this is n't Sunday ! " Well , we all went to church this morning to Dr. Gurley 's church . Dr. Gurley is a Presbyterian , father says . I do n't care anything about that , but I thought you might . That is the church President Lincoln goes to , and we went there so as to see him . " He sat clear up in front , and I could n't see anything all through the sermon but the back of his head . We sat ' most down by the door . Besides , there was a little boy in the pew next ours that kept his father 's umbrella right over the top of the pew , and made me laugh . He was just about as big as Winnie . Oh , they say slip here instead of pew , just as they do in Boston . I do n't see what 's the use . Joy does n't like it because I keep saying pew . She says it 's countrified . I think one is just as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just waited , and father looked at the minister , and Joy and I kept watching the President 's kid gloves . They were black because he 's in mourning for his little boy , and he kept putting his hand to his face a great deal . He moved round too , ever so much . I kept thinking how tired he was , working away all the week , taking care of those great armies , and being scolded when we got beaten , just as if it were all his fault . I think it is real good in him to come to church anyway . If I were President and had so much to do , and got so tired , I 'd stay at home Sundays and go to sleep , if you 'd let me . I think President Lincoln must be a very good man . I 'm sure he is , and I 'll tell you why . " After church we waited so as to see him . There were ever so many strangers sitting there together ,  - -  about fifty I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we all stood up , and he began to walk down the aisle with his wife , and I saw his face , and he is n't homely , but he looks real kind , and oh , mother ! so sober and sad ! and I know he 's a good man , and that 's why . " Mrs. Lincoln was dressed all in black , with a long crape veil . She kind of peeked out under it , but I could n't see her very well , and I did n't think much about her because I was looking at him . " Well , then , you see there were some people in front of me , and I could n't see very well , so I just stepped up on a cricket so 's to be tall , and what do you think ? When the President was opposite , just opposite , and looked round at us , that old cricket had to tip over , and down I went , flat , in the bottom of the pew ! " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up ; and the President saw me , and he looked right at me ,  - -  right into my eyes and laughed . He did now , really , and he looked as if he could n't help it , possibly . " When he laughs it looks like a little sunbeam or something , running all over his face . " Father says we sha n't probably see him again . They do n't have any receptions now at the White House , because they are in mourning . " We went to a Quaker meeting this afternoon , but there is n't any time to tell about it . " JOY 'S JOURNAL . " Monday , June 23 . " Oh dear me ! We 've seen so much to-day I ca n't remember half of it . I shall write what I can , and Gypsy may write the rest . " In the first place , we went to the Capitol . It 's built of white marble , and it 's very large . There are quantities of long steps on different sides of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , and pillars . I never could find my way out , in the world , alone . I wonder the Senators do n't get lost sometimes . " About the first place you come into is a round room , called the rotunda . Uncle says rotunda means round . There are some pictures there . One of them is Washington crossing the Delaware , with great cakes of ice beating up against the boat . One of the men has a flag in his hand . Gypsy and I liked it ever so much . " Oh !  - -  the dome of the Capitol is n't quite finished . There is scaffolding up there , and it does n't look very pretty . " Well , then we went upstairs , and I never saw such handsome stairs ! They are marble , and so wide ! and the banisters are the most elegant variegated marble ,  - -  a sort of dark brown , and they are so broad ! Why , I should think they were a foot and a half broad , but then I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two rooms that Gypsy and I both liked best of anything . One is called the Marble Room , and the other the Fresco Room . The Marble Room is all made of marble ,  - -  walls , floor , window-sills , everything but the furniture . The marble is of different colors and patterns , and just as beautiful ! The furniture is covered with drab damask . " The Fresco Room is all made of pictures . Frescoes are pictures painted on the ceilings , Uncle says . He says Michael Angelo , the great sculptor and artist , used to paint a great many , and that they are very beautiful . He says he had to lie flat on scaffoldings while he was painting the domes of great churches , and that , by looking up so , in that position , he hurt his eyes very much . This room I started to tell about is real pretty . I 've almost forgotten what the furniture is covered with . Seems to me it is yellow damask , or else it 's the Marble Room that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare ! We 've seen so much to-day , I 've got everything mixed up ! " Uncle has just been correcting our journals , and he says it is n't proper to say ' I 've got , ' but I ought to say ' I have . ' " Oh , I forgot to say that the Senators ' wives and daughters who are boarding here are very stylish people . When I grow up I mean to marry a Senator , and come to Washington , and give great parties . " I do n't see why I do n't hear from father . You know it 's nearly three weeks now since I had a letter . I thought I should have one last week , just as much as could be . " GYPSY 'S JOURNAL . " Eight o'clock , Monday Night . " Joy has told ever so much about the Capitol , and I do n't want to tell it all over again . If I forget it , I can look at her journal , you know . " But she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd come a little later we should n't have seen them at all ; and if it did n't happen to be a long session we should n't see them so late in the season . But then we did . I 'm very glad , only I thought it was rather stupid . " I liked the halls , anyway . They 're splendid , only there 's a great deal of yellow about them ; and then there are some places for pictures , and the pictures are n't put up yet . " There 's a gallery runs round , where visitors sit . The Senators and Representatives are down on the floor . We went into the Senate first . They sat in seats that curved round , and the President of the Senate -- that 's Vice-President Hamlin -- he sits in a sort of little pulpit , and looks after things . If anybody wants to speak , they have to ask him , and he says , ' The Senator from so-and-so has the floor . ' Then when they get into a fight , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great grown-up men to quarrel ? But they do , like everything . There was one man got real mad at Mr. Sumner to-day . " I did n't care about what they were talking about , but it was fun to look down and see all the desks and papers , and some of them were just as sleepy as could be . Then they kept whispering to each other while a man was speaking , and sometimes they talked right out loud . If I should do that at school , I guess Miss Cardrew would give it to me . But what I thought was queerest of all , they all talked right at the Vice-President , and kept saying , ' Mr. President , ' and ' Sir , ' just as if there were n't anybody else in the room . " Some of the Senators are handsome , and a good many more are n't . Joy stood up for Mr. Sumner because he came from Massachusetts . He is a nice-looking man , and I had to say so . He has a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , father says he has done a noble work for the country and the slaves , and the rest of New England ought to be just as proud of him as Massachusetts . " We went into the House of Representatives , too , and it was a great deal noisier there than it was in the Senate , there were so many more of them . I saw one man eating peanuts . Most all of them looked hungry . The man that sits up behind the desk and takes care of the House , is called the Speaker . I think it 's real funny , because he never makes a speech . As we came out of the Capitol , father turned round and looked back and said : ' Just think ! All the laws that govern this great country come out from there . ' He said some more about it , too , but there was the funniest little negro boy peeking through the fence , and I did n't hear . " We went to the White House next . Father says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomer . It 's white marble like the Capitol . We went up the steps , and a man let us right in . We saw two rooms . One is called the Red Room and one the Green Room . The Red Room is furnished in red damask and the Green is all green . They were very handsome , only all the furniture was ranged along the walls , and that made it seem so big and empty . Father says that 's because these rooms are used for receptions , and there is such a crowd . " There is a Blue Room , too , that visitors are sometimes let into . Father asked the doorkeeper ; but he said , ' The family were at breakfast in it . ' That was eleven o'clock ! I guess I 'd like to be a President 's daughter , and not have to get up . We did n't see anything more of President Lincoln . " We 've been going all day , and we 've been to the Patent Office and the Smithsonian Institute , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " GYPSY 'S JOURNAL . " Tuesday . " We 've been over to Alexandria -- that 's across the Potomac River -- in the funniest little steamboat you ever saw . When you went in or came out of the cabin , you have to crawl under a stove-pipe . It was n't high enough to walk straight . I do n't like Alexandria . It 's all mud and secessionists . People looked cross , and Joy was afraid they 'd shoot us . We saw the house where Col. Ellsworth was shot at the beginning of the war . The man was very polite , and showed us round . The plastering around the place where he fell , and all the stairs , had been cut away by people as relics . We saw the church where Gen. Washington used to go , too .

There is nothing on the tomb but the word Washington . His wife is buried by him , and it says on hers , Martha , Consort of Washington . All the gentlemen took off their hats while we stood there . To-morrow we are going to Manassas , if there is a boat . Uncle is going to see . I am having a splendid time . Wo n't it be nice telling father all about it when he comes home ? " Illustration Joy laid down her pen suddenly . She heard a strange noise in her uncle 's room where he and Gypsy were sitting . It was a sort of cry ,  - -  a low , smothered cry , as of some one in grief or pain . She shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper in his hand . Gypsy was looking over his shoulder , and her face was very pale . " What is it ? What 's the matter ? " Nobody answered . Mr. Breynton turned away his face . Gypsy broke out crying . " Why , what is the matter ? " said Joy , looking alarmed . " Joy , my poor child --  " began her uncle . But Gypsy sprang forward suddenly , and threw her arms around Joy 's neck . " Oh , Joy , Joy , your father ! " " Let me see that paper ! " Joy caught it before they could stop her , opened it , read it ,  - -  dropped it slowly . It was a telegram from Yorkbury :  --  " Boston papers say Joy 's father died in France two weeks ago . " CHAPTER XIII A SUNDAY NIGHT They were all together in the parlor at Yorkbury -- Joy very still , with her head in her auntie 's lap . It was two weeks now since that night when she sat writing in her journal at Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been taken . They had been able to learn little about her father 's death as yet . A Paris paper reported , and Boston papers copied , the statement that an American of his name , stopping at an obscure French town , was missing for two days , and found on the third , murdered , robbed , horribly disfigured . Mr. George Breynton had been traveling alone in the interior of the country , and had written home that he should be in this town -- St . Pierre -- at precisely the time given as the date of the American 's death . So his long silence was awfully explained to Joy . The fact that the branch of his firm with which he had frequent business correspondence , had not received the least intelligence of him for several weeks , left no doubt of the mournful truth . Something had gone wrong in the shipping of certain goods , which had required his immediate presence ; they had therefore written and telegraphed to him repeatedly , but there had been no reply . Day by day the ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had grown into certainty . Mr. Breynton had fought against conviction as long as he could , had clung to all possibilities and impossibilities of doubt , but even he had given up all hope . Dead -- dead , without a sign ; without one last word to the child waiting for him across the seas ; without one last kiss or blessing ; dead by ruffian hands , lying now in an unknown , lonely grave . It seemed to Joy as if her heart must break . She tried to fly from the horrible , haunting thought , to forget it in her dreams , to drown it in her books and play . But she could not leave it ; it would not leave her . It must be taken down into her heart and kept there ; she and it must be always alone together ; no one could come between them ; no one could help her . And so there was nothing to do but take that dreary journey home from Washington , come quietly back to Yorkbury , come back without father or mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one left her in all the wide world ; nothing to do but to live on , and never to see him any more , never to kiss him , never to creep up into his arms , or hear his brave , merry voice calling , " Joyce , Joyce , " as it used to call about the old home . No one called her Joyce but her father . No one should ever call her so again . Tom called her so one day , never thinking . " I do n't want to hear that -- not that name , " said Joy , flushing suddenly ; then paling and turning away . She was very still now . Since the first few days she seldom cried ; or if she did , it was when she was away alone in the dark , with no one to see her . She had grown strangely silent , strangely gentle and thoughtful for Joy . Sorrow was doing for her what it does for so many older and better ; and in her frightened , childish way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Gypsy knew just how much it was . The two girls had been drawn very near to each other these past few weeks . It seemed to Gypsy as if the grief were almost her own , she felt so sorry for Joy ; she had grown very gentle to her , very patient with her , very thoughtful for her comfort . They were little ways in which she could show this , but these little ways are better than any words . When she left her own merry play with the girls to hunt up Joy sitting somewhere alone and miserable , and coax her out into the sunlight , or sit beside her and tell funny stories till the smiles came wandering back against their will to Joy 's pale face ; when she slid her strawberry tarts into Joy 's desk at recess , or stole upstairs after her with a handful of peppermints bought with her own little weekly allowance , or threw her arms around her so each night with a single , silent kiss , or came up sometimes in the dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unmindful nor ungrateful . She noticed it all , everything ; out of her grief she thanked her with all her heart , and treasured up in her memory to love for all her life the Gypsy of these sad days . They were in the parlor together on this Sunday night , as I said ,  - -  all except Mr. Breynton , who had been for several days in Boston , settling his brother 's affairs , and making arrangements to sell the house for Joy ; it was her house now , that handsome place in Beacon Street , and that seemed so strange ,  - -  strange to Joy most of all . They were grouped around the room in the fading western light , Gypsy and Tom together by the window , Winnie perched demurely on the piano-stool , and Joy on the cricket at Mrs. Breynton 's feet . The faint light was touching her face , and her mournful dress with its heavy crape trimmings ,  - -  there were no white chenille and silver brooches now ; Joy had laid these things aside of her own wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , this mourning ; but in Joy 's case it mirrored her real grief very completely . The something which she had not felt when her mother died , she felt now , to the full . She had a sort of notion , an ignorant , childish notion , but very real to her ,  - -  that it was wicked to wear bows and hair-ribbons now . She had been sitting so for some time , with her head in her aunt 's lap , quite silent , her eyes looking off through the window . " Why not have a little singing ? " said Mrs. Breynton , in her pleasant , hushed voice ; it was always a little different somehow , Sunday nights ; a little more quiet . Gypsy went to the piano , and usurped Winnie 's throne on the stool , much to that young gentleman 's disgust . " What shall it be , mother ? " " Joy 's hymn , dear . " Gypsy began , without further explanation , to play a low , sweet prelude , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these few desolate weeks : " There is an eye that never sleeps Beneath the wing of night ; There is an ear that never shuts When sink the beams of light . " There is an arm that never tires When human strength gives way --  There is a love that never fails When earthly loves decay . " Joy tried to sing , but just there she broke down . Gypsy 's voice faltered a little , and Mrs. Breynton sang very softly to the end . After that they were all still ; Joy had hidden her face . Tom began to hum over the tune uneasily , in his deep bass . A sudden sob broke into it . Illustration " This is what makes it all so different . " " What , dear ? " " The singing , and the prayers , and the Sunday nights ; it 's been making me think about being a good girl , ever since I 've been here . We never had any at home . Father --  " But she did not finish . She rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , where no one could see her face . The light was dimming fast ; it was nearly dark now , and the crickets were chirping in the distant meadows . Tom coughed , and came very near trying to whistle . Gypsy screwed the piano-stool round with a sudden motion , and went over to where Joy stood . Tom and his mother began to talk in a low voice , and the two girls were as if alone . The first thing Gypsy did , was to put her arms round Joy 's neck and kiss her . Joy hid her face on her shoulder and cried softly . Then Gypsy choked a little , and for a while they cried together . " You see I am so sorry , " said Gypsy . " I know it ,  - -  I know it . Oh , Gypsy , if I could see him just one minute ! " Gypsy only gave her a little hug in answer . Then presently , as the best thing she could think of to say : " We 'll go strawberrying to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , I 've got a tart upstairs I 've been saving for you , and you can eat it when we go up to bed . I think things taste real nice in bed . Do n't you ? " " Look here , Gypsy , do you know I love you ever so much ? " " You do ! Well , is n't that funny ? I was just thinking how much I loved you . Besides , I 'm real glad you 're going to live here always . " " Why , I thought you 'd be sorry . " " I should have once , " said Gypsy honestly . " But that 's because I was ugly . I do n't think I could get along without you possibly -- no , not anyway in the world . Just think how long we 've slept together , and what ' gales ' we do get into when our lamp goes out and we ca n't find the matches ! You see I never had anybody to get into gales with before . " Somebody rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Joy , have you a mind to go ? " asked Mrs. Breynton . " Patty is out , this evening . " " Why ! whoever it is , they 've come right in , " said Joy , opening the door . A man was there in the entry ;  - -  a man with heavy whiskers and a valise . The rest of them sitting back there in the dark waited , wondering a little who it could be coming in Sunday night . And this is what they heard : " Joyce , little Joyce !  - -  why , do n't be frightened , child ; it 's nobody but father . " CHAPTER XIV GOOD BYE They were alone together in the quiet room -- Peace Maythorne and Joy . The thick yellow sunlight fell in , touching the old places ,  - -  the wall where Gypsy 's blue and golden text was hanging ,  - -  a little patch of the faded carpet , the bed , and the folded hands upon it , and the peaceful face . Joy had crept up somewhat timidly into Gypsy 's place close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half gladly , as if she hardly knew whether to laugh or cry . " You see , we 're going right off in this noon train , and I thought I must come over and say good-bye . " " I 'm real sorry to have you go -- real . " " Are you ? " said Joy , looking pleased . " Well , I did n't suppose you 'd care . I do believe you care for everybody , Peace . " " I try to , " said Peace , smiling . " You go in rather a hurry , do n't you Joy ? " " Yes . It 's just a week since father came . He wants to stay a while longer , dreadfully , but he says his business at home ca n't be put off , and of course I 'm going with him . Do you know , Peace , I ca n't bear to have him out of the room five minutes , I 'm so silly . It seems all the time as if I were dreaming a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful days would come back , and he 'd be dead again . I keep wanting to kiss him and feel of him all the time . " " You poor child ! " said Peace , her eyes dimming a little , " how strange it all has been . How good He 's been to you -- God . " " I know it . I know He has , Peace . Was n't it queer how it all came about ? Gypsy says nobody but God could have managed it so , and Auntie says He must have had some very good reason . " You see , father was sick all that time in a little out-of-the-way French town with not a single soul he knew , and nobody to talk English , and so sick he could n't write a word -- out of his head , he says , all the time . That 's why I did n't hear , nor the firm . Then was n't it so strange about that man who was murdered at St. Pierre ?  - -  the very same name -- George Breynton , only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't find out till afterwards . Poor man ! I wonder if he has anybody crying for him over here . Then you know , just as soon as ever father got well enough to travel , he started straight home . He said he 'd had enough of Europe , and if he ever lived to get home , he would n't go another time without somebody with him . It was n't so very pleasant , he said , to come so near dying with nobody round that you knew , and not to hear a word of your own language . Then , you know , he got into Boston Saturday , and he hurried straight up here ; but the train only went as far as Rutland , and stopped at midnight . Then , you see , he was so crazy to see me and let me know he was n't dead , he could n't possibly wait ; so he hired a carriage and drove all the way over Sunday . And oh , Peace , when I saw him out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers that night , " said Peace , smiling . " I rather guess I did ! And Peace , that makes me think "  - -  Joy grew suddenly very grave ; there was an earnest , thoughtful look in her eyes that Joy 's eyes did not have when she first came to Yorkbury ; a look that they had been slowly learning all this year ; that they had been very quickly learning these past few weeks --  " When I get home it 's going to be hard -- a good many things are going to be hard . " " Yes , I see , " said Peace , musingly . Peace always seemed to see just what other people were living and hoping and fearing , without any words from them to explain it . " It 's all so different from what it is here . I do n't want to forget what you 've told me and Auntie 's told me . Almost everybody I know at home does n't care for what you do up here in Yorkbury . I used to think about dancing-school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how many diamonds I 'd have when I was married , and all that , the whole of the time , Peace -- the whole of it ; then I got mad when my dresses did n't fit , and I used to strike Therese and Kate , if you 'll believe it -- when I was real angry that was . Now , up here , somehow I 'm ashamed when I miss at school ; then sometimes I help Auntie a little , and sometimes I do try not to be cross . Now , you see , I 'm going back , and father he thinks the world of me , and let 's me do everything I want to , and I 'm afraid "  - -  Joy stopped , puzzled to express herself --  " I 'm afraid I shall do everything I want to . " Peace smiled , and seemed to be thinking . " Then , you see . I shall grow up a cross , old selfish woman , " said Joy dolefully ; " Auntie says people grow selfish that have everything their own way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she wanted things just as much as I , so there 's been two ways , and that 's the thing of it . " " I do n't think you need to grow up selfish , " said Peace , slowly ; " no , I am sure you need n't . " " Well , I wish you 'd tell me how . " " Ask Him not to let you , " said Peace softly . Joy colored . " I know it ; I 've thought of that . But there 's another trouble . You see , father -- well , he does n't care about those things . He never has prayers nor anything , and he used to bring me novels to read Sundays . I read them then . I 've got all out of the way of it up here . I do n't think I should want to , now . " " Joy , " said Peace after a silence , " I think -- I guess , you must help your father a little . If he sees you doing right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by-and-by he will feel differently . " Joy made no answer . Her eyes looked off dreamily through the window ; her thoughts wandered away from Peace and the quiet room -- away into her future , which the young girl seemed to see just then , with grave , prophetic glance ; a future of difficulty , struggle , temptation ; of old habits and old teachings to be battled with ; of new ones to be formed ; of much to learn and unlearn , and try , and try again ; but perhaps -- she still seemed to see with the young girl 's earnest eyes that for the moment had quite outgrown the child -- a future faithfully lived and well ; not frittered away in beautiful playing only , but filled up with something ; more than that , a future which should be a long thank-offering to God for this great mercy He had shown her , this great blessing He had given her back from the grave ; a future in which , perhaps , they two who were so dear to each other , should seek Him together -- a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the look with which she turned at last , half sobbing , to kiss her good-bye . " I must go , it is very late . Thank you , Peace . Thank you as long as I live . " She looked back in closing the door , to see the quiet face that lay so patiently on the pillow , to see the stillness of the folded hands , to see the last , rare smile . She wondered , half guessing the truth , if she should ever see it again . She never did . They were all wondering what had become of her , when she came into the house . " We start in half an hour , Joyce , my dear , " said her father , catching her up in his arms for a kiss ;  - -  he almost always kissed her now when she had been fifteen minutes out of his sight ,  --  " We start in half an hour , and you wo n't have any more than time to eat your lunch . " Mrs. Breynton had spread one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Joy 's chair was ready and waiting for her , and everybody stood around , in that way people will stand , when a guest is going away , not knowing exactly what to do or what to say , but looking very sober . And very sober they felt ; they had all learned to love Joy in this year she had spent among them , and it was dreary enough to see her trunks packed and strapped in the entry , and her closet shelves upstairs empty , and all little traces of her about the house vanishing fast . " Come along , " said Gypsy in a savage undertone , " Come and eat , and let the rest stay out here . I 've hardly set eyes on you all the morning . I must have you all myself now . " " Oh hum ! " said Joy , attempting a currant tart , and throwing it down with one little semi-circular bite in it . " So I 'm really off , and this is the very last time I shall sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please ! " observed Gypsy , winking hard , " just eat your tart . " Joy cut off a delicate mouthful of the cold tongue , and then began to look around the room . " The last time I shall see Winnie 's blocks , and that little patch of sunshine on the machine , and the big Bible on the book-case !  - -  Oh , how I shall think about them all nights , when I 'm sitting down by the grate at home . " " Stop talking about your last times ! It 's bad enough to have you go anyway . I do n't know what I shall do without you . " " I do n't know what I shall do without you , I 'm sure , " said Joy , shaking her head mournfully , " but then , you know , we 're going to write to each other twice every single week . " " I know it ,  - -  every week as long as we live , remember . " " Oh , I sha n't forget . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelopes with Love stamped up in the corners , on purpose . " " Anyway , it 's a great deal worse for me , " said Gypsy , forlornly . " You 're going to Boston , and to open the house again and all , and have ever so much to think about . I 'm just going on and on , and you wo n't be upstairs when I go to bed , and your things wo n't ever be hanging out on the nails in the entry , and I 'll have to go to school alone , and -- O dear me ! " " Yes , I suppose you do have the worst of it , " said Joy , feeling a great spasm of magnanimity in bringing herself to say this ; " but it 's pretty bad for me , and I do n't believe you can feel worse than I do . Is n't it funny in us to love each other so much ? " " Real , " said Gypsy , trying to laugh , with two bright tears rolling down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy 's coming to Yorkbury . How strange that it should have been so hard for Gypsy ; that it had cost her a sacrifice to welcome her cousin ; how strange that they could ever have quarreled so ; how strange all those ugly , dark memories of the first few months they spent together -- the jealousy , the selfishness , the dislike of each other , the constant fretting and jarring , the longing for the time that should separate them . And now it had come , and here they sat looking at each other and crying -- quite sure their hearts were broken ! The two tears rolled down into Gypsy 's smile , and she swallowed them before she spoke : " I do believe it 's all owing to that verse ! " " What verse ? " " Why , Peace Maythorne 's . I suppose she and mother would say we 'd tried somehow or other to prefer one another in honor , you know , and that 's the thing of it . Because you see I know if I 'd always had everything my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , and I 'd have been real glad when you went off . " " Joyce , Joyce ! " called her father from the entry , " Here 's the coach . It 's time to be getting ready to cry and kiss all around . " " Oh -- hum ! " said Gypsy . " I know it , " said Joy , not very clear as to what she was talking about . " Where 's my bag ? Oh , yes . And my parasol ? Oh there 's Winnie riding horseback on it . Well , Gypsy , go -- od --  " " Bye , " finished Gypsy , with a great sob . And oh , such a hugging and kissing as there was then ! Illustration Then Joy was caught in her Auntie 's arms , and Tom 's and Winnie 's all at once , it seemed to her , for the coachman was in a very great hurry , and by the time she was in the coach seated by her father , she found she had quite spoiled her new kid gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waving one of Winnie 's old jackets , under the impression that it was a handkerchief . " Twice every week ! " " Yes -- sure : on pink paper , remember . " " Yes , and envelopes . Good-bye . Good-bye ! " So the last nodding and smiling was over , and the coach rattled away , and the house with the figures on the steps grew dim and faded from sight , and the train whirled Joy on over the mountains -- away into that future of which she sat thinking in Peace Maythorne 's room , of which she sat thinking now , with earnest eyes , looking off through the car-window , with many brave young hopes , and little fear . " You 'd just better come into the dining-room , " said Winnie to Gypsy , who was standing out in the yard , remarkably interested in the lilac-bush , and under the very curious impression that people thought she was n't crying . " I think it 's real nice Joy 's gone , ' cause she did n't eat up her luncheon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . There were tarts with squince-jelly in ' em too , but they -- well , they ai n't there now , someways or nuther . " THE END .
