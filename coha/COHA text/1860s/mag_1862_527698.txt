txt JAMES FENIMORE COOPER . THE publication , now brought to a close , of a new edition of the novels of Cooper * gives us a fair occasion for dischar , ing a duty which Maga has too long neglected , and saying something upon the genius of this great writer , and , incidentally , upon the character of a man who would have been a noticeable , not to say remarkable person , had he never written a line . These novels stand before us in thirty-two goodly duodecimo volumes , well printed , gracefully illustrated , and , in all external aspects , worthy of generous commendation . With strong propriety , the publishers dedicate this edition of the " first American novelist " to " the American People . " No one of our great writers is more thoroughly American than Cooper ; no one has caught and reproduced more broadly and accurately the spirit of our institutions , the character of our people , and even the aspects of Nature in this our Western world . He was a patriot to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fervid , but not an undiscerning love it was an intelligent , vigilant , discriniinating affection that bound his heart to his native land ; and thus , while no man defended his country more vigorously when it was in the right , no one reproved its faults more courageously , or gave warning and advice more unreservedly , where he felt that they were needed . This may be one reason why Cooper has more admirers , or at least fewer disparagers , abroad than at home . On the Continent of Europe his novels are everywhere read , with an eager , unquestioning delight . His popularity is at least equal to that of Scott ; and we think a considerable amount of testimony could be collected to prove that it is even greater . But the fact we have above stated is not the only explanation of this . * We refer to the new edition of the novels of Cooper by Messrs . W. A. Townsend &amp; Co. , with illustrations by Darley . He was the first writer who made foreign nations acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his delineations of Indian manners and traits were greatly superior in freshness and power , if not in truth , to any which had preceded them . His novels opened a new and unwrought vein of interest , and were a revelation of humanity under aspects and influences hitherto unobserved by the ripe civilization of Europe . The taste which had become cloyed with endless imitations of the feudal and medieval pictures of Scott turned with fresh delight to such original figures - so full of sylvan power and wildwood grace - as Natty Bumppo and Uncas . European readers , too , received these sketches with an unqualified , because an ignorant admiration . We , who had better knowledge , were more critical , and could see that the drawing was sometimes faulty , and the colors more brilliant than those of life . The acute observer can detect a parallel between the relation of Cooper to America and that of Scott to Scotland . Scott was as hearty a Scotchman as Cooper an American : but Scott was a Tory in politics and an Episcopalian in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and Presbyterians in religion . In Scott , as in Cooper , the elements of passion and sympathy were so strong that he could not be neutral or silent on the great questions of his time and place . Thus , while the Scotch are proud of Scott , as they well may be , while he has among his own people most intense and enthusiastic admirers , - the proportion of those who yield to his genius a cold and reluctant homage is probably greater in Scotland than in any other country in Christendom . " The rest of mankind recognize the essential truth of his delineations , and his loyalty to all the primal instincts and sympathies of humanity " ; but the Scotch can not forget January , // that he opposed the Reform Bill , painted the Coverianters with an Episcopalian pencil , and made a graceful and heroic image of the detested Claverhouse . The novels of Cooper , in the dates of their publication , cover a period of thirty years : beginning with " Precaution , " in 1820 , and ending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The production of thirty-two volumes in thirty years is honorable to his creative energy , as well as to the systematic industry of his habits . But even these do not constitute the whole of his literary labors during these twentynine years . We must add five volumes of naval history and biography , ten volumes of travels and sketches in Europe , and a large amount of occasional and controversial writings , most of which is now hidden away in that huge wallet wherein Time puts his alms for Oblivion . His literary productions other than his novels would alone he enough to save him from the reproach of idleness . In estimating a writer 's claims to honor and remembrance , the quantity as well as the quality of his work should surely be taken into account ; and in summing up the ease of our great novelist to the jury of posterity , this point should he strongly put . Cooper 's first novel , " Precaution , " was published when he was in his thirty-first year . It owed its existence to an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to the best of his subsequent works as Byron 's " Hours of Idleness " to " Childe Harold . " It was a languid and colorless copy of exotic forms : a mere scale picked from the surface of the writer 's mind , with neither beauty nor vital warmth to commend it . We speak from the vague impressions which many long years have been busy in effacing ; and we confess that it would require the combined forces of a long voyage and a scanty library to constrain us to the task of reading it anew . And yet , such as it was , it made a certain impression at the time of its appearance . The standard by which it was tried was very unlike that which would now be applied to it : there was all the difference between the two that there is between strawberries in December and strawberries in June . American literature was then just beginiiing to " glint forth " like Burns 's mountain daisy , and rear its tender form above the parent earth . The time had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet venerable ; affirms he can well remember - when school - boys and collegians , zealous for the honor of indigenous literature , were obliged to cite , by way of illustration , such works as Morse 's Geography and Hannah Adams 's " History of the Jews " ; but it was only a faint , crepuscular light , that streaked the east , and gave promise of the coming day . Irving had just completed his " SketchBook , " which was basking in the full sunshine of unqualified popularity . Dana , in the thoughtful and meditative beauty of " The Idle Man , " was addressing a more limited public . Percival had just before published a small volume of poems ; Halleck 's " Fanny " had recently appeared ; and so had a small duodecimo volume by Bryant , containing " The Ages , " and half a dozen smaller poems . Miss Sedgwick 's " New England Tale " was published about the same time . But a large proportion of those who are now regarded as our ablest writers were as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were . Dr. Channing was already distinguished as an eloquent and powerful preacher , but the general public had not yet recognized in him that remarkable combination of loftiness of thought with magic charm of style , which was soon to be revealed in his essays on Milton and Napoleon Bonaparte . Ticknor and Everett were professors in Harvard College , giving a new impulse to the minds of the students by their admirable lectures ; and the latter was also conducting the " North American Review . " Neither had as yet attained to anything more than a local reputation . Prescott , a gay and light-hearted young man , - gay and light-hearted , in spite of partial blindness ,  --  the darling of society and the idol of his home , was silently // 54 fames Fenimore Cooper . and resolutely preparing himself for his chosen function by a wide and thorough course of patient study . Bancroft was in Germany , and working like a German . Emerson was a Junior in College . Hawthorne , Longfellow , Holmes , Whittier , and Poe were school-boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the nursery , and Motley and the younger Dana had not long been out of it . " Precaution , " though an indifferent novel , was yet a novel ; of the orthodox length , with plot , characters , and incidents ; and here and there a touch of genuine power , as in the forty-first chapter , where the scene is on board a manof-war bringing her prizes into port . It found many readers , and excited a good deal of curiosity as to who the author might be . " Precaution " was published on the 25th of August , 1820 , and " The Spy " on the 17th of September , 1821 . The second novel was a great improvement upon the first , and fairly took the public by storm . We are old enough to remember its first appearance ; the cager curiosity and keen discussion which it awakened ; the criticism which it called forth ; and , above all , the animated delight with which it was received by all who were young or not critical . Distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we hung over its pages , in those happy days when the mind 's appetite for books was as ravenous as the body 's for bread-and-butter , and a novel , with plenty of fighting in it , was all we asked at a writer 's hands . In order to qualify ourselves for the task which we have undertaken in this article , we have read " The Spy " a second time ; and melancholy in ( leed was the contrast between the recollections of the boy and the impressions of the man . It was the difference between the theatre by gas-light and the theatre by day-light : the gold was pinchbeck , the gems were glass , the flowers were cambric and colored paper , the goblets were gilded pasteboard . Painfully did the ideal light fade away , and the well-remembered scene stand revealed in disenchanting day . With incredulous surprise , with a constant struggle between past images and present revelations , were we forced to acknowledge the improbability of the story* , the clumsiness of the style , the awkwardness of the dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absurdity of many of the incidents , and the painfulness of some of the scenes . But with all this , a candid , though critical judgment could not but admit that these grave defects were attended by striking merits , which pleaded in mitigation of literary sentence . It was stamped with a truth , earnestness , and vital power , of which its predecessor gave no promise . Though the story was improbable , it seized upon the attention with a powerful grasp from the very start , and the hold was not relaxed till the end . Whatever criticism it might challenge , no one could call it dull : the only offence in a book which neither gods nor men nor counters can pardon . If the narrative flowed languidly at times , there were moments in which the incidents flashed along with such vivid rapidity that the susceptible reader held his breath over the page . The character of Washington was an elaborate failure , and the author , in his later years , regretted that he had introduced this august form into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch , happily conceived , and , in the main , well sustained . his mysterious figure was recognized as a new accession to the repertory of the novelist , and not a mere modification of a prei*xisting type . And , above all , " The Spy " had the charm of reality ; it tasted of the soil ; it was the first successful attempt to throw an imaginative light over American history , and to do for our country what the author of " Waverley " had done for Scotland . Many of the officers and solders of the Revolutionary War were still living , receiving the reward of their early perils and privations in the grateful reverence which was paid to them by the contemporaries of their chil // dren and grandchildren . Innumerable traditionary anecdotes of those dark days of suffering and struggle , unrecorded in print , yet lingered in the memories of the people , and were told in the nights of winter around the farm-house fire ; and of no part of the country was this more true than of the region in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm with which it was there read was the best tribute to the substantial fidelity of its delineations . All over the country , it enlisted in its behalf the powerful sentiment of patriotism ; and whatever the critics might say , the author bad the satisfaction of feeling that the heart of the people was with him . Ahroad , " The Spy " was received with equal favor . It was soon translated into most of the languages of Europe ; and even the " gorgeous East " opened for it its rarely moving portals . In 1847 , a Persian version was published in Ispahan ; and by this time it may have crossed the Chinese wall , and be delighting the pig-tailed critics aud narrow-eyed beauties of Pekin . The success of " The Spy " unquestionably determined Cooper 's vocation , and made him a man of letters . But he had not yet found where his true strength lay . his training and education had not been such as would seem to be a good preparation for a literary career . His reading had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition had not been formed in early life . Indeed , in mere style , in the handling of the tools of his craft , Cooper never attained a master 's ease and power . In his first two novels the want of technical skill and literary accomplishment was obvious ; and the scenery , subjects , and characters of these novels did not furnish him with the opportunity of turning to account the peculiar advantages which had come to him from the events of his childhood and youth . In his infancy he was taken to Cooperstown , a spot which his father had just begun to reclaim from the dominion of the wilderness . Here his first impressions of the external world , as well as of life and manners , were received . At the age of sixteen he became a midshipman in the United States navy , and remained in the service for six years . A father who , in training up his son for the l ) rofession of letters , should send him into the wilderness in his infancy and to sea at sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark ; but in this , as in so many things , there is a divinity that shapes our rough-hewn ends . Had Cooper enjoyed the best scholastic advantages which the schools and colleges of Europe could have furnished , they could not have fitted him for the work he was destined to do so well as the apparently untoward elements we have above adverted to ; for Natty Bumppo was the fruit of his woodland experience , and Long Tom Coffin of his sea-faring life . " The Pioneers " and " The Pilot " were both published in 1823 ; " Lionel Lincoln " in 1825 ; and " The Last of the Mohicans " in 1826 . We may put " Lionel Lincoln " aside , as one of his least successful productions ; but the three others were never surpassed , and rarely equalled , by any of his numerous subsequent works . All the powerful , and nearly all the attractive , qualities of his gen* ius were displayed in these three novels , in their highest degree and most ample measure . Had he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many interesting narratives , admirable pictures , and vigorously drawn characters ,  --  we are not sure that his fame would not have been as great as it is now . From these , and " The Spy , " full materials may be drawn for forming a correct estimate of his merits and his defects . In these , his strength and weakness , his gifts and deficiencies , are amply shown . Here , then , we may pause , an ( l , without pursuing his literary biography any farther , proceed to set down our estimate of his claims as a writer . Any critic who dips his pen in ink and not in gall would rather praise than blame ; therefore we will dispose of the least gracious part of our task first , and begin with his blemishes and defects . // A skilful construction of the story is a merit which the public taste no longer demands , and it is consequently fast becoming one of the lost arts . The practice of publishing novels in successive numbers , so that one portion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . But English and American readers have not been accustomed to this excellence in the works of their best writers of fiction ; and therefore they are not sensitive to the want of it . This is certainly not one of Scott 's strong points . Fielding 's " Tom Jones " is , in this respect , superior to any of the " Waverley Novels , " and without an equal , so far as we know , in English literature . But , in sitting in judgment upon a writer of novels , we can not waive an inquiry into his merits on this point . Are his stories , simply as stories , well told ? Are his plots symmetrically constructed and harmoniously evolved ? Are his incidents probable ? and do they all help on the catastrophe ? Does he reject all episodical matter which would clog the current of the narrative ? Do his novels have unity of action ? or are they merely a series of sketches , strung together without any relation of cause and effect ? Cooper , tried by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not carefully or skilfully constructed . His incidents are not probable in themselves , nor do they succeed each other in a natural and dependent progression . His characters get into scrapes from which the reasonable exercise of common faculties should have saved them ; and they are rescued by incredible means and impossible instruments . The needed man appears as unaccountably and mysteriously as if he had dropped from the clouds , or emerged from the sea , or crept up through a fissure in the earth . The winding up of his stories is often effected by devices nearly as improbable as a violation of the laws of Nature . His personages act without adequate motives ; they rush into needless dangers ; they trust their fate , with unsuspecting simplicity , to treacherous hands . In works of fiction the skill of the writer is most conspicuously shown when the progress of the story is secured by natural and probable occurrences . Many events take place in history and in common life which good taste rejects as inadmissible in a work of imagination . Sudden death by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life but it can not be used in a novel to clear up a tangled web of circumstance , without betraying something of a poverty of invention in the writer . He is the best artist who makes least use of incidents which lie out of the beaten path of observation and experience . In constructive skill Cooper 's rank is not high ; for all his novels are more or less open to the criticism that too frequent use is made in them of events very unlikely to have happened . He leads his characters into such formidable perils that the chances are a million to one against their being rescued . Such a run is made upon our credulity that the fund is soon exhausted , and the bank stops payment . For illustration of the above strictures we will refer to a single novel , " The Last of the Mohicans , " which everybody will admit to be one of the most interesting of his works , - full of rapid movement , brilliant descriptions , hair-breadth escapes , thrilling adventures , - which young persons probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives . In the opening chapter we find at Fort Edward , on the head-waters of the Hudson , the two daughters of Colonel Munro , the commander of Fort William Henry , on the shores of Lake George though why they were at the former post , under the protection of a stranger , and not with their father , does not appear . Information is brought of the approach of Montcalm , with a hostile army of Indians and Frenchmen , from the North ; and the young ladies are straightway hurried off to the more advanced , and consequently more dangerous post , when prudence and affection would have dictated just the opposite course . Nor is th ; s all . General Webb , the commander of Fort // 57 Edward , at the urgent request of Colonel Munro , sends him a reinforcement of fifteen hundred men , who march off through the woods , by the military road , with drums beating and colors flying ; and yet , strange to say , the young ladies do not accompany the troops , but set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attended by no other escort than Major Heyward , and guided by an Indian whose fidelity is supposed to be assured by his having been flogged for drunkenness by the orders of Colonel Munro . The reason assigned for conduct so absurd that in real life it would have gone far to prove the parties having a hand in it not to be possessed of that sound and disposing mind and memory which the law requires as a condition precedent to making a will is , that hostile Indians , in search of chance scalps , would be hovering about the column of troops , and so leave the by-path unmolested . But the servants of the party follow the route of the column : a measure , we are told , dictated by the saga city of the Indian guide , in order to diminish the marks of their trail , if , hap .. ly , the Canadian savages should be prowling about so far in advance of their army ! Certainly , all the sagacity of the fort would seem to have been concentrated in the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been avoided , if the action had been reversed , and the young ladies , in view of the gathering cloud of war , had been sent from the more exposed and less strongly guarded point of Fort William Henry to the safe fortress of Fort Edward ! Then the smallness of the escort and the risks of the journey would have been explained and excused by the necessity of the case ; and the subsequent events of the novel might have been easily accommodated to the change we have indicated . One of the best of Cooper 's novels - as a work of art perhaps the very best - is " The Bravo . " But the character of Jacopo Frontoni is a sort of moral impossibility , and the clearing up of the mystery which hangs over his life and conduct , which is skilfully reserved to the last moment , is consequently unsatisfactory . He is represented as a young man of the finest qualities and powers , who , in the hope of rescuing a fatber who had been falsely imprisoned by the Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a public bravo , or assassin , though entirely innocent . This false position gives rise to many most effective scenes and incidents , and the character is in many respects admirably drawn . But when the end comcs , we lay down the book and say ,  --  " This could never have been : a virtuous and noble young man could not for years have been believed to be the most hateful of mankind ; the laws of Nature and the laws of the human mind forbid it : so vast a web of falsehood could not have been woven without a flaw : we can credit much of the organized and pitiless despotism of Venice , but could it work miracles ? " Further illustrations of this same defect might easily be cited , if the task were not ungracious . Neither books , nor pictures , nor men arid women should be judged by their defects . It is enough to say that Cooper never wrote a novel in regard to which the reader must not lay aside his critical judgment upon the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let himself be borne along by the rapid flow of the narrative , without questioning too curiously as to the nature of the means and instruments employed to give movement to the stream . In the delineation of character , Cooper may claim great , but not unqualified praise . This is a vague statement and to draw a sharper line of discrimination , we should say that he is generally successful - sometimes admirably so - in drawing personages in whom strong primitive traits have not been effaced by the attritions of artificial life , and generally unsuccessful when he deals with those in whom the original characteristics are less marked , or who have been smoothed by education and polished by society . It is // but putting this criticism in another form to say that his best characters are persons of humble social position . He wields his brush with a vigorous hand , but the brush itself has not a fine point . Of all the children of his brain , Natty Bumppo is the most universal favorite ,  --  and herein the popular judgment is assuredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more happily conceived than skilfully executed . It was a hazardous undertaking to present the character backwards , and let us see the closing scenes of his life first , - like a Hebrew Bible , of which the beginning is at the end ; but the author 's genius has triumphed over the perils of the task , and given us a delineation as consistent and symmetrical as it is striking and vigorous . Ignorant of books , simple , and credulous , guileless himself , an ( l suspecting no evil in others , with moderate intellectual powers , he commands our admiration and respect by his courage , his love of Nature , his skill in woodland lore , his unerring moral sense , his strong affections , and the veins of poetry that run through his rugged nature like seams of gold in quartz . Long Tom Coffin may be described as Leatherstocking suffered a sea-change , - with a harpoon instead of a rifle , and a pea-jacket instead of a hunting-shirt . In both the same primitive elements may be discerned the same limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same generous affections and unerring moral instincts ; the same religious feeling , taking the form at times of fatalism or superstition . Long Tom 's love of the sea is like Leatherstocking 's love of the woods ; the former 's dislike of the land is like the latter 's dislike of the clearings . Cooper himself , as we are told by his daughter , was less satisfied , in his last years , with Long Tom Coffin than most of his readers , - and , of the two characters , considered that of Boltrope the better piece of workmanship . We can not assent to this comparative estimate ; but we admit that Boltrope has not had full justice done to him in popular judgment . It is but a slight sketch , but it is extremely well done . His death is a bit of manly and genuine pathos ; and in his conversations with the chaplain there is here and there a touch of true humor , which we value the more because humor was certainly not one of the author 's best gifts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is another very well drawn ch*racter , in which we can trace something of a family likeness to the hunter and sailor above mentioned . The scene in which he is shrived by the Carmelite monk , in his boat , under the midnight moon , upon the Lagoons , is one of the finest we know of in the whole range of the literature of fiction , leaving upon the mind a lasting impression of solemn and pathetic beauty . In " The Cliainbearer , " the Yankee squatter , Thousandacres , is a repulsive figure , but drawn with a powerful pencil . The energy of character , or rather of action , which is the result of a passionate love of money , is true to human nature . The closing scenes of his rough and lawless life , in which his latent affection for his faithful wife throws a sunset gleam over his hard and selfish nature , and prevents it from being altogether hateful , are impressively told , and are touched with genuine tragic power . On the other hand , Cooper generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires for its successful execution a nice observation and a delicate hand . His heroes and heroines are apt to abuse the privilege which such personages have enjoyed , time out of mind , of being insipid . Nor can he catch and reproduce the easy grace and unconscious dignity of high-bred men and women . His gentlemen , whether young or old , are apt to be stiff , priggish , and coinmonplace ; and his ladies , especially his young ladies , are as deficient in individuality as the figures and faces of a fashion-print . Their personal and mental charms are set forth with all the minuteness of a passport ; but , after all , we can not but think that these fine creatures , with hair , brow , eyes , and lips of the most orthodox and approved pattern , would // do very little towards helping one through a rainy day in a country-house . Judge Temple , in " The Pioneers , " and Colonel Howard , in " The Pilot , " are highly estirnable and respectable gentlemen , but , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not think they would stand very high on the list . They are fair specimens of their class , - the educated gentleman in declining life , - many of whom are found in the subsequent novels . They are wanting in those natural traits of individuality by which , in real life , one human being is distinguished from another . They are obnoxious to this one general criticism , that the author is constantly reminding us of the qualities of mind and character on which he rests their claims to favor , without causing them to appear naturally and unconsciously in the course of the narrafive . The defect we are adverting to may be illustrated by comparing such personages of this class as Cooper has delineated with Colonel Talbot , in " Waverley , " Colonel Mannering and Counsellor Pleydell , in " Guy Mannering , " Monkbarns , in " The Antiquary , " an ( l old Osbaldistone , in " Rob Roy . " These are all old men : they are all men of education , and in the social position ofsgentlemen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : each has the distinctive individual flavor-perceptible , but indescribable , like the savor of a fruit-which is wanting in Cooper 's *vell-dressed and well-behaved lay-figures . In the delineation of female loveliness and excellence Cooper is generally supposed to have failed ,  --  at least , comparatively so . But in this respect full justice has hardly been done him ; and this may be explained by the fact that it was from the heroines of his earlier novels that this unfavorable judgment wa&amp;*drawn . Certainly , such sticks of barley-candy as Frances Wharton , Cecilia Howard , and Alice Munro justify the common impression . But it would be as unfair to judge of what he can do in this department by his acknowledged failures as it would be to form an estimate of the genius of Miehel Angelo from the easel-picture of the Virgin and Child in the Tribune at Florence . No man ever had a juster appreciation of , and higher reverence for , the worth of woman than Cooper . Towards women his manners were always marked by chivalrous deference , blended as to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own nature was robust , self4eliant , and essentially masculine : such men always honor women , but they understand them better as they grow older . There is so much foundation for the saying , that men are apt to love their first wives best , but to treat their second wives best . Thus the reader who takes up his works in chronological order will perceive that the heroines of his later novels have more spirit and character , are drawn with a more discriminating touch , take stronger hold upon the interest , than those of his earlier . Ursula Malbone is a finer girl than Cecilia howard , or even Elizabeth Temple . So when lie has occasion to delineate a woman who , from her position in life , or the peculiar circumstances into which she is thrown , is moved by deeper springs of feeling , is obliged to put forth sterner energies , than are known to females reared in the sheltered air of prosperity and civilization ,  --  when he paints the heart of woman roused by great perils , overborne by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the same master-hand which has given us such powerful pictures of character in the other sex . In other words , Cooper is not happy in representing those shadowy and delicate graces which belong exclusively to woman , and distinguish her from man ; but he is generally successful in sketching in woman those qualities which are found in both sexes . In " The Bravo , " Donna Violetta , the heroine , a rich and high-born young la ( ly , is not remarkable one way or the other ; but Gelsomina , the jailer 's daughter , born in an inferior position , reared in a sterner school of discipline and struggle , is a beautiful and consistent creation , constantly showing masculine energy and endurance , yet losing nothing of womanly charm . Ruth , in " The // January , Wept of the Wish-ton-Wish , " Hetty Hutter , the weak-minded and sound-hearted girl , in " The Deerslayer , " Mabel Dunhani , and the young Indian woman , " Dew of June , " in " The Pathfinder , " are further cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these women are represented and say that Cooper was wantmg in the power of delineating the finest and highest attributes of womanhood . Cooper can not be congratulated upon his success in the few attempts he has made to represent historical personages . Washington , as shown to us in " The Spy , " is a formal piece of mechanism , as destitute of vital character as Maelzel 's automaton trumpeter . This , we admit , was a very difficult subject , alike from the peculiar traits of Washington , and from the reverence in which his name and memory are held hy his countrymen . But the sketch , in " The Pilot , " of Paul Jones , a very different person , and a much easier subject , is hardly better . In both cases , the failure arises from the fact that the author is constantly endeavoring to produce the legitimate effect of mental and moral qualities by a careful enumeration of external attributes . Harper , under which name Washington is introduced , appears in only two or three scenes ; hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impressiveness of his manner , the gravity of his brow , the steadiness of his gaze , that we get the notion of a rather oppressive persona*e , and sympathize with the satisfaction of the Whartons , when he retires to his own room , and relieves them of his tremendous presence . Mr. Gray , who stands for Paul Jones , is more carefully elaborated , but the result is far from satisfactory . We are so constantly told of his calmness and abstraction , of his sudden starts and bursts of feeling , of his low voice , of his fits of musing , that the aggregate impression is that of affectation and self-consciousness , rather than of a simple , passionate , and heroic nature . Mr. Gray does not seem to us at all like the rash , fiery , and dare-devil Scotchmaa of history . His conduct and conversa tion , as recounted in the fifth chapter of the novel , are unnatural and improbable and we can not wonder that the first lieutenant did not know what to make of so melodramatic and sententious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper , as we need hardly say , has drawn copiously upon Indian life and character for the materials of his novels and among foreign nations much of his reputation is due to this fact . Civilized men and women always take pleasure in reading about the manners and habits of savage life ; and those in whom the shows of things are submitted to the desires of the mind delight to invest them with those ideal qualities which they do not find , or think they do not , in the artificial society around them . Cooper had enjoyed no peculiar opportunities of studying by personal observation the characteristics of the Indian race , but he had undoubtedly read everything he could get hold of in illustration of the subject . No one can question the vividness and animation of his sketches , or their brilliant tone of color . He paints with a pencil dipped in the glow of our sunset skies and the crimson of our autumn maples . Whenever he brings Indians upon th' stage , we may be sure that scenes of thrilling interest are before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam , and arrows to dart like sunbeams through the air ; that a net of peril is to be drawn around his hero or heroine , from the meshes of which he or she is to he extricated by some unexpected combination of fortunate circumstances . We expect a succession of startling incidents , and a rapid course of narrative without pauses or languid intervals . We do not object to his idealizing his Indians : this is the privilege of the novelist , time out of mind . He may make them swift of foot , graceful in movement , and give them a form like the Apollo 's ; he may put as much expression as he pleases into their black eves ; he may tessellate their speech as freely as he will with poetical and figurative expressions , drawn from the aspects of the external world : for all this // there is authority , and chapter and verse may he cited in support of it . But we have a right to ask that he shall not transcend the bounds of reason and possibility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided by sentiments which are wholly inconsistent with the inexorable facts of the case . We confess to being a little more than skeptical as to the Indian of poetry and romance : like the German 's camel , he is evolved from the depth of the writer 's own consciousness . The poet takes the most delicate sentiments and the finest emotions of civilization and cultivation , and grafts them upon the best qualities of savage life ; which is as if a painter should represent an oak-tree bearing roses . The life of the North-American Indian , like that of all men who stand upon the base-line of civilization , is a constant struggle , and often a losing struggle , for mere subsistence . The sting of animal wants is his chief motive of action , and the full gratification of animal wants his highest ideal of happiness . The " noble savage , " as sketched by poets , weary of the hollowness , the insincerity , and the meanness of artificial life , is really a very ignoble creature , when seen in the " open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cruel , indolent , and impassive . The highest graces of character , the sweetest emotions , the finest sensibilities . - which make up the novelist 's stock in trade ,  --  are not and can not be the growth of a so-called state of Nature , which is an essentially unnatural state . We no more believe that Logan ever made the speech reported by Jefferson , in so many words , than we believe that Chatham ever made the speech in reply to Walpole which begins with , " The atrocious crime of being a young man " ; though we have no doubt that the reporters in both cases had something fine and good to start from . We a*cept with acquiescence , nay , with admiration , such characters as Magua , Chingachgook , Susquesus , Tamenund , and Canonchet ; but when we come to Uncas , in " The Last of the Mohicans , " we pause an.d shake our heads with incredulous doubt . That a young Indian chief should fall in love with a handsome quadroon like Cora Munro - for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural enough ; but that he should manifest his passion with such delicacy and refinement is impossible . We include under one and the same name all the affinities and attractions of sex , but the appetite of the savage differs from the love of the educated and civilized man as much as charcoal differs from the diamond . The sentiment of love , as distinguished from the passion , is one of the last and best results of Christianity and civilization in no one thing does savage life differ from civilized more than in the relations between man and woman , and in the affections that unite them . Uncas is a graceful and beautiful image ; but he is no Indian . We turn now to a more gracious part of our task , and proceed to say something of the many striking excellences which distinguish Cooper 's writings , and have given him such wide popularity . Popularity is but one test of merit , and not the highest , - gau*ing popularity by the number of readers , at any one time , irrespective of their taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiefs " and " Thaddeus of Warsaw " were once as popular as any of the Waverley Novels . But Cooper 's novels have enduring merit , and will surely keep their place in the literature of the language . The manners , habits , and costumes of England have greatly changed during the last hundred years ; but Richardson and Fielding are still read . We must expect corresponding changes in this country during the next century ; but we may confidently predict that in the year 1962 young and impressible hearts will be saddened at the fate of Uncas and Cora , and exult when Captain Munson 's frigate escapes from the shoals . A few pages back we spoke of Cooper 's want of skill in the structure of his plots , and his too frequent recurrence to improbable incidents to help on the course of his stories . But most readers care lit-9 9 ' // tie about this defect , provided the writ-. er betrays no poverty of invention , and succeeds in making his narratives interesting . Herein Cooper never lays himself open to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an author need dread , because from it there is no appeal . It is bad to have a play hissed down , but it is worse to have it yawned down . But over Cooper 's pages his readers never yawn . They never break down in the middle of one of his stories . The fortuncs of his characters are followed with breathless and accumulating interest to the end . In vain does the dinner-bell sound , or the clock strike the hour of bed-time : the book can not be laid down till we know whether Elizabeth Temple is to get out of the woods without being burned alive , or solve the mystery that hangs over the life of Jacopo Frontoni . He has in ample measure that paramount and essential merit in a novelist of fertility of invention . The resources of his genius , alike in the devising of incidents and the creation of character , are inexhaustible . His scenes are laid on the sea and in the forest , - in Italy , Germany , Switzerland , and Spain , - amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frontier and pioneer life ; but everywhere lie moves with an easy and familiar tread , and everywhere , though there may be the motive and the cue for minute criticism , we recognize the substantial truth of his pictures . In all his novels the action is rapid and the movement animated : his incidents may not be probable , but they crowd upon each other so thickly that we have not time to raise the question : before one impression has become familiar , the scene changes , and new objects enchain the attention . All rapid motion is exhilarating alike to mind and body ; and in reading Cooper 's novels we feel a pleasure analogous to that which stirs the blood when we drive a fast horse or sail with a tenknot breeze . This fruitfulness in the invention of inciden'ts is nearly as important an element in the composition of a novelist as a good voice in that of a singer . A powerful work of fiction may he produced by a writer who has not this gift ; but such works address a comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelist is so fascinating as this . " Caleb XVilliams " is a story of remarkable power ; but " Ivanhoe " has a thousand readers to its one . In estimating novelists by the number and variety of characters with which they have enriched the repertory of fiction , Cooper 's place , if not the highest , is very high . The fruitfulness of his genius in this regard is kindred to its fertility in the invention of incidents . We can pardon in a portrait-gallery of such extent here and there an ill-drawn figure or a face wanting in expression . With the exception of Scott , and perhaps of Dickens , what writer of prose fiction has created a greater number of characters such as stamp themselves upon the memory so that an allusion to them is well understood in cultivated society ? Fielding has drawn country squires , and Smollett has drawn sailors ; but neither has intruded upon the domain of the other , nor could lie have made the attempt without failure . Some of our living novelists have a limited list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize as inevitably as we do the face and voice of an actor in the king , the lover , the priest , or the bandit : but Cooper is not a mere mannerist , perpetually copying from himself . His range is very wide : it includes white men , red men , and black men ,  --  sailors , hunters , and soldiers , - lawyers , doctors , and clergymen , - past generations and present ,  --  Europeans and Americans ,  --  civilized and savage life . All his delineations are not successful ; some are even unsuccessful : but the aberrations of his genius must be viewed in connection with the extent of the orbit through which it moves . The courage which led him to expose himself to so many risks of failure is itself a proof of conscious power . Cooper 's style has not the ease , grace , and various power of Scott 's , - or the ra // cy , idiomatic character of Thackeray 's ,  - -  or the exquisite purity and transparency of Hawthorne 's : but it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find good words , if not the best . It has certain wants , but it has no marked defects ; if it does not always command admiration , it never offends . It has not the highest finish ; it sometimes betrays carelessness : but it is the natural garb in which a vigorous mind clothes its conceptions . It is the style of a man who writes from a full mind , without thinking of what he is going to say ; and this is in itself a certain kind of merit . His descriptive powers are of a high order . His love of Nature was strong ; and , as is generally the case with intellectual men , it rather increased than diminished as he grew older . It was not the meditative and self-conscious love of a sensitive spirit , that seeks in communion with the outward world a relief from the burdens and struggles of humanity , but the hearty enjoyment of a thoroughly healthy nature , the schoolboy 's sense of a holiday dwelling in a manly breast . His finest passages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity in combination with striking or beautiful scenes in Nature . His genius , which sometimes moves with " compulsion and lahorious flight " when dealing with artificial life and the manners and speech of cultivated men and women , here recovers all its powers , and sweeps and soars with victorious and irresistible wing . The breeze from the sea , the fresh air and wide horizon of the prairies , the noonday darkness of the forest are sure to animate his drooping energies , and breathe into his mind the inspii'ation of a fresh life . Here he is at home , and in his congenial element : he is the swan on the lake , the eagle in the air , the deer in the woods . The escape of the frigate , in the fifth chapter of " The Pilot , " is a well-known passage of this kind ; and nothing can be finer . The technical skill , the poetical feeling , the rapidity of the narrative , the distinctness of the details , the vividness of the coloring , the life , power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make up a combination of the highest order of literary merit . It is as good a sea-piece as the best of Turner 's ; and we can not give it higher praise . We hear the whistling of the wind through the rigging , and the roar of the pitiless sea , bellowing for its prey ; we see the white caps of the waves flashing with spectral light through the darkness , and the gallant ship whirled along like a bubble by the irresistible current we hold our breath as we read of the expedients and maneuvres which most of us but half understand , and heave a long sigh of relief when the danger is past , and the ship reaches the open sea . A similar passage , though of more quiet and gentler beauty , is the description of the deer-chase on the lake , in the twenty-seventh chapter of " The Pioneers . " Indeed , this whole novel is full of the finest expressions of the author 's genius . Into none of his works has lie put more of the warmth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own heart beats through every line . The fresh breezes of the morning of life play round its pages , and its unexhaled dew hangs upon them . It is colored throughout with the rich hues of sympathetic emotion . All that is attractive in pioneer life is reproduced with substantial truth ; but the pictures are touched with those finer lights which time pours over the memories of childhood . With what spirit and power all the characteristic incidents and scenes of a new settlement are described , - pigeon - shooting , bass - fishing , deer-hunting , the making of maple-sugar , the turkey - shooting at Christmas , the slei*hin*-parties in winter ! How distinctly his landscapes are painted , - the deep , impenetrable forest , the gleaming lake , the crude aspect and absurd architecture of the new-horn village ! How full of poetry in the ore is the conversation of Leatherstocking ! The incongruities and peculiarities of social life which are the result of a sudden rush of population into the wilderness are also well sketched ; though with a pencil // less free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nature and the movements of natural man . As respects the structure of the story , and the probability of the incidents , the novel is open to criticism ; but such is the fascination that hangs over it , that it is impossible to criticize . To do this would he as ungracious as to correct the language and pronunciation of an old friend who revives by his conversation the fading memories of school-boy and college life . Cooper would have been a better writer , if he had had more of the quality of humor , and a keener sense of the ridiculous ; for these would have saved him from his too frequent practice of introducing both into his narrative and his conversations , but more often into the latter , scraps of commonplace morality , and bits of sentiment so long worn as to have lost all their gloss . In general , his genius does not appear to advantage in dialogue . His characters have not always a due regard to the brevity of human life . They make long speeches , preach dull sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance . Their discourse wants not only compression , but seasoning . They are sometimes made to talk in such a way that the force of caricature can hardly go farther . For instance , in " The Pioneers , " Judge Temple , coming into a room in his house , and seeing a fire of maple-logs , exclaims to Richard Jones , his kinsman and factotum ,  --  " how often have I forbidden the use of the sugar-maple in my dwelling The sight of that sap , as it exudes with the heat , is painful to me , Richard . " And in another place , he is made to say to his daughter , - " Remember the heats of July , my daughter ; nor venture farther than thou canst retrace before the meridian . " We may be sure that no man of woman born , in finding fault about the burning of maple-logs , ever talked of the sap 's " exuding " ; or , when giving a daughter a caution against walking too far , ever translated getting home before noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as had as Sir Piercie Shafton 's calling the cows " the milky mothers of the herds . " So , too , a lively perception of the ludicrous would have saved Cooper from certain peculiarities of phrase and awkwardnesses of expression , frequently occurring in his novels , such as might easily slip from the pen in the rapidity of composition , but which we wonder should have been overlooked in the proof-sheet . A few instances will illustrate our meaning . In the elaborate description of the personal charms of Cecilia Howard , in the tenth chapter of " The Pilot , " we are told of " a small hand which seemed to blush at its own naked beauties . " In " The Pioneers , " speaking of the head and brow of Oliver Edwards , he says ,  --  " The very air and manner with which the member haughtilg maintained itself over the coarse and even wild attire , " etc . In " The Bravo , " we read , - " As the stranger passed , his glittering organs rolled over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and again , in the same novel , - " The packet was received calmly , though the , organ which glanced at its seal , " etc . In " The Last of the Mohicans , " the complexion of Cora appears " charged with the color of the rich blood that seemed ready to burst its bounds . " These are but trivial faults ; and if they had not been so easily corrected , it would have heen hypercriticism to notice them . Every author in the department of imaginative literature , whether of prose or verse , puts more or less of his personal traits of mind and character into his writings . This is very true of Cooper ; and much of the worth and popularity of his novels is to be ascribed to the unconscious expressions and revelations they give of the estimable and attractive qualities of the man . Bryant , in his admirably written and discriminating biographical sketch , originally pronounced as a eulogy , and now prefixed to " Precaution " in Townsend 's edition , relates that a distin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy // coolness had for some time existed , after reading " The Pathfinder , " remarked , - " They may say what they will of Cooper , the man who wrote this book is not only a great man , but a good man . " This is a just tribute ; and tbe impression thus made by a single work is confirmed by all . Cooper 's moral nature was thoroughly sound , and all his moral instincts were right . His writings show in how high regard he held the two great guardian virtues of courage in man and purity in woman . In all his novels we do not recall a single expression of doubtful morality . He never undertakes to enlist our sympathies on the wrong side . If his good characters are not always engaging , he never does violence to virtue by presenting attractive qualities in combination with vices which in real life harden the heart and coarsen the taste . We do not find in his pages those moral monsters in which the finest sensibilities , the richest gifts , the noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless misanthropy . He never palters with right ; he enters into no truce with wrong ; he admits of no coml ) romise on such points . How admirable in its moral aspect is the character of Leatherstockino ! he is ignorant , and of very moderate intellectual range or grasp ; but what dignity , nay , even grandeur , is thrown around him from his noble moral qualities , - his undeviating rectitude , his disinterestedness , his heroism , his warm affections ! No writer could have delineated such a character so well who had not an instinctive and unconscious sympathy with his intellectual offspring . Praise of the same kind belongs to Long Tom Coffin , and Antonio , the old fisherman . The elements of character - truth , courage , and affection - are the same in all . Harvey Birch and Jacopo Frontoni are kindred conceptions : both are in a false relation to those around them ; both assume a voluntary load of obloquy ; both live and move in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust ; but in both the en ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception in both only adds to the admiration finally awakened . The carrying out of conceptions like these - the delineation of a character that perpetually weaves a web of untruth , and yet through all maintains our respect , and at last secures our reverence - was no easy task ; but Cooper 's success is perfect . Cooper was fortunate in having been born with a vigorous constitution , and in having kept through life the blessing of robust health . He never suffered from remorse of the stomach or protest of the brain and his writings are those of a man who always digested his dinner and never had a headache . His novels , like those of Scott , are full of the breeze and sunshine of health . They breathe of manly tastes , active habits , sound sleep , a relish for simple pleasures , temperate enjoyments , and the retention in manhood of the fresh susceptibilities of youth . his genius is thoroughly masculine , lie is deficient in acute perception , in delicate discrimination , in fine analysis , in the skill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large measure the power to present the broad characteristics of universal humanity . It is to this power that he owes his wide popularity . At this moment , in every public and cir. - culating library in England or America , the novels of Cooper will be found to be in constant demand . lie wrote for the many , and not for the few ; he hit the common mind between wind and water ; a delicate and fastidious literary appetite may not be attracted to his productions , but the healthy taste of the natural man finds therein food alike convenient and savory . In a manly , courageous , somewhat impulsive nature like Cooper 's we should expect to find prejudices ; and he was a man of strong prejudices . Among others , was an antipathy to the people of New England . His characters , male and female , are frequently Yankees , but they are almost invariably caricatures ; that is , they have all the unamiable characteristics and unattractive traits which are bestowed upon the people of New England by their // ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his quick powers of observation and essentially kindly judgment of men and life , he could not have failed to correct his misapprehensions , and to perceive that he had taken the reverse side of the tapestry for the face . Cooper , with a very keen sense of injustice , conscious of inexhaustible power , full of vehement impulses , and not largely endowed with that safe quality called prudence , was a man likely to get involved in controversies . It was his destiny , and he never could have avoided it , to be in opposition to the dominant public sentiment around him . Had he been born in Russia , he could hardly have escaped a visit to Siberia ; had he been born in Austria , he would have wasted some of his best years in Spielberg . Under a despotic government he would have been a vehement Republican ; in a Catholic country he would have been the most uncompromising of Protestants . lie had full faith in the institutions of his own country ; and his large heart , hopeful temperament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not the least tinge of radicalism . He believed that man had a right to govern himself ' , and that he was capable of selfgovernment ; but government , the subordination of impulse to law , he insisted upon as rigorously as the veriest monarchist or aristocrat in Christendom . He would have no authority that was not legitimate ; but he would tolerate no resistance to legitimate authority . All his sentiments , impulses , and instincts were those of a gentleman ; and vulgar manners , coarse habits , and want of respect for the rights of others were highly offensive to him . When in Europe , he resolutely , and at no little expense of time and trouble , defended America from unjust imputations and ignorant criticism ; and when at home , with equal courage and equal energy , he breasted the current of public opinion where he deemed it to be wrong , and resisted those most formidable invasions of right , wherein the many combine to oppress the one . His long controversy with the press was too important an episode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though our limits will not permit us to make anything more than a passing allusion to it . The opinion which will be formed upon Cooper*s course in this matter will depend , in a considerable degree , upon the temperament of the critic . Timid men , cautious men , men who love their ease , will call him Quixotic , rash , imprudent , to engage in a controversy in which he had much to lose and little to gain ; but the reply to such suggestions is , that , if men always took counsel of indolence , timidity , and selfishness , no good would ever be accomplished , and no abuses ever be reformed . Cooper may not have been judicious in everything he said and did ; but that he was right in the main , both in motive and conduct , we firmly believe . He acted from a high sense of duty ; there was no alloy of vindictiveness or love of money in the impulses which moved him . Criticism the most severe and unsparing he accepted as perfectly allowable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment ; but any attack upon his personal character , especially any imputation or insinuation involving a moral stain , he would not submit to . He appealed to the laws of the land to vindicate his reputation and punish his assailants . Long and gallant was the *varfare he maintained , - a friendless , solitary warfare , - and all the hydra-heads of the press hissing and ejaculating their venom upon him , - with none to stand by his side and wish him God-speed . But he persevered , and , what is more , he succeeded : that is to say , he secured all the substantial fruits of success . He vindicated the principle for which he contended : he compelled the newspapers to keep within the pale of literary criticism ; he confirmed the saying of President Jackson , that " desperate courage makes one a majority . " Two of his novels , " Homeward Bound " and " Home as Found , " bear a strong infusion of the feelings which led to his con- // 67 test with the press . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-known Anti-Rent agitation by which the State of New York was so long shaken ; and three of his novels , " Satanstoe , " " The Chainbearer , " and " The Redskins , " forming one continuous narrative , were written with reference to this subject . Many professed novel-readers are , we suspect , repelled from these books , partly because of this continuity of the story , and partly because they contain a moral ; but we assure them , that , if on these grounds they pass them by , they lose both pleasure and profit . They are written with all the vigor and spirit of his prime ; they have many powerful scenes and admirably drawn characters ; the pictures of colonial life and manners in " Satanstoe " are animated and delightful ; and in all the legal and ethical points for which the author contends he is perfectly right . In his Preface to " The Chainbearer " he says ,  --  " In our view , *ew York is at this moment a disgraced State ; and her disgrace arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any efforts-at all commensurate with the object being made to enforce them . " That any commonwealth is a disgraced State against which such charges can with truth be made no one will deny ; and any one who is familiar with the history of that wretched business will agree , that , at the time it was made , the charge was not too strong . Who can fail to admire the courage of the man who ventured to write and print such a judgment as the above against a State of which he was a native , a citizen , and a resident , and in which the public sentiment was fiercely the other way ? Here , too , Cooper 's motives were entirely unselfish : he had almost no pecuniary interest in the question of AntiRentism ; he wrote all in honor , unalloyed by thrift . His very last novel , " The Ways of the Hour , " is a vigorous exposition of the defects of the trial by jury in cases where a vehement public sentiment has already tried the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the leading character is an impossible being ; but the interest is kept up to the end ,  --  it has many most impressive scenes ,  --  it abounds with shrewd and sound observations upon life , manners , and politics , - and all the legal portion is stamped with an acuteness and fidelity to truth which no professional reader can note without admiration . Cooper 's character as a man is the more admirable to us because it was marked by strong points which are not common in our country , and which the institutions of our country do not foster . He had the courage to defy the majority : he had the courage to confront the press : and not from the sting of ill-success , not from mortified vanity , not from wounded self-love , but from an heroic sense of duty . How easy a life might he have purchased by the cheap virtues of silence , submission , and acquiescence I Booksellers would have enriched him ; society would have caressed him ; political distinction would have crowned him : he had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose himself that he should seem to lead where he only followed , and all comfortable things would have been poured into his lap . But he preferred to breast the stream , to speak ungrateful truths . He set a wholesome example in this respect ; none the less valuable because so few have had the manliness and self-reliance to imitate him . More than twenty years ago De Tocqueville said ,  --  " I know of no country in which there is so little true independence of mind and freedom of discussion as in America " : words which we fear are not less true to-day than when they were written . Cooper 's dauntless courage would have been less admirable , had he been hard , cold , stern , and impassive : but he was none of these . He was full of warm affections , cordial , sympathetic , and genial ; he had a woman 's tenderness of heart ; he was the most faithful of friends ; and in his own home no man was ever more gentle , gracious , and sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceived fell upon a heart that felt them keenly ; but he bared his breast none the less resolutely to the contest because it was not protected by an armor of insensibility . But we must bring this long paper to a close . We can not give to it tbe interest which comes from personal recollections . We saw Cooper once , and but once . This was the very year before he died , in his own home , and amid the scenes which his genius has made immortal . It was a bright midsummer 's day , and we walked together about the village , and around the shores of the lake over which the canoe of Indian John had glided . His own aspect was as sunny as that of the smiling heavens above us ; age had not touched him with its paralyzing finger : his vigorous frame , elastic step , and animated glance gave promise of twenty years more of energetic life . His sturdy figure , healthy face , and a slight bluffness of manner reminded one more of his original profession than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked like a man who had lived much in the open air ,  --  upon whom the rain had fallen , and against whom the wind had blown . His conversation was hearty , spontaneous , and delightful from its frankness and fulness , but it was not pointed or brilliant ; you re membered the healthy ring of the words , but not the words themselves . We recollect , that , as we were standing together on the shores of the lake , - shores which are somewhat tame , and a lake which can clnim no higher epithet than that of pretty , - he said : " I suppose it would be patriotic to say that this is finer than Como , but we know that it is not . " We found a chord of sympathy in our common impressions of the beauty of Sorrento , about which , and his residence there , he spoke with contagious animation . Who could have thought that that rich and abundant life was so near its close ? Nothing could be more thoroughly satisfying than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His air and movement revealed the same manly , brave , true-hearted , warm-hearted man that is imaged in his books . Grateful are we for the privilege of having seen , spoken with , and taken by the hand the author of " The Pathfinder " and " The Pilot " : " it is a pleasure to have seen a great man . " Distinctly through the gathering mists of years do his face and form rise up before the mind 's eye : an image of manly self-reliance , of frank courage , of generous impulse ; a frank friend , an open enemy ; a man whom many misunderstood , but whom no one could understand without honoring and loving .
