ART . XI . - Curiosities of Literature . By IsAAc DISRAELI . With a View of the Life and Writings of the Author . By his Son . From the Fourteenth , Corrected London Edition . Boston : William Veazie. 1859. 4 vols . Small Svo . NEARLY seventy years have elapsed since the first volume of the " Curiosities of Literature " was issued from the press ; yet the work retains its popularity undiminished , and the recent appearance of two new editions , one in England and the other in this country , shows that the present generation finds in it scarcely less to interest than did the generation to which it was first offered . As a suggestive contribution to literary history , it must , indeed , always hold a respectable place among similar books ; and , if it makes no attempt at searching analysis or exhaustive criticism , it embraces a more copious selection of noteworthy facts in regard to books and authors than can be found in almost any other compilation of the kind , while it doubtless owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreeable form in which these facts are presented . Thomas Moore says of it in his Diary , that it is " good invalid reading " ; and this casual remark very happily describes the character of the work . It makes but a small demand on the reader , yet it proffers to him an almost inexhaustible fund of amusement and instruction . Availing ourselves of the opportunity afforded by the publication of the beautiful edition named above , we design now to present a brief sketch of the life and character of Mr. Disraeli , together with a revaluation of the claims of his various writings to a permanent place in English literature . Isaac Disraeli , or D'Israehi , as the name was originally written , was the only son of a Venetian merchant of Jewish extraction , and was born in the town of Enfie*Ld , near London , in May , 1766 . His first teacher was a Scotchman , who kept a preparatory school in the neighborhood , to which Disraeli was sent when a mere child ; but he does not appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then showed a taste for poetry . This taste was developed at so early an age , it is said , that before he was fourteen he had begun to write // verse , and had greatly shocked his father by producing a poem of his own composition . He was immediately sent abroad ,  --  as his son intimates , in the hope that change of scene would wean his mind from this unprofitable occupation ; and he was consigned to the care of his father 's correspondent at Amsterdam , to be placed at college in that city . Here and at Leyden he passed several years with little profit from the direct instruction which he received , but diligently reading such books as his tutor 's library contained . At the age of fifteen he had read Voltaire 's works , and had made some acquaintance with those of Bayle ; and three years later he returned to England with his mind saturated with the sentimentalism of Rousseau . His new opinions , however , met with a rude shock when he rushed into his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with derisive laughter at his gaunt figure , his long hair , and his awkward appearance . Stung by this insulting welcome , the young man stormed and wept , and finally shut himself up in his room to give expression to his feelings through his pen . It was in vain that his father sought to smooth his ruffled temper by dwelling on the solicitude of his parents for his welfare , and by offering to place him in a great commercial establishment at Bordeaux . The son 's reply was , that commerce corrupts mankind , and that he had written and intended to publish a poem against it . This announcement only made matters worse , and confusion and discord once more reigned in the house . In the mean time the new aspirant for poetical honors determined to seek the advice and assistance of Dr. Johnson . He accordingly left his manuscript at the Doctor 's door ; but the great critic was on his death-bed , and a week later the parcel was returned unopened . Probably the poem was never published ; but in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essay covering four pages of that journal , and entitled " Romarks on the Biographical Accounts of the late Samuel Johnson , LL . D. , with an Attempt to vindicate his Character from late Misrepresentations . " This essay is believed to be his first printed production , and it enables us to form some idea of his tastes and acquirements at that time , though as a piece of criticism it is utterly worthless . Its main object was to offer some // strictures on five recent publications , in which , as Disraeli thought , the memory of Johnson had been unfairly dealt with ; but these strictures , which were inspired by an extravagant admiration of Johnson , are remarkably feeble and commonplace , and the style exhibits the worst faults of a young and inexperienced writer . The same faults are shown in a still more conspicuous manner in two letters addressed by him in the same year to Dr. Vicesimus Knox , master of Tunbridge Grammar School , and then known on both sides of the Atlantic as a distinguished essayist and theologian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole diction is pompous and turgid . " I am addressing myself , " he writes , " to the most learned and elegant writer our nation boasts " ; and his wish was to obtain admission to the Doctor 's family as a student . " I am a young man , " he says , " who hath beat along the ocean of letters with most miserable pilots ; and if in despair of meeting with a director I snatched the helm , it hath not been so much the action of temerity as that of a desire to gain the coast . I had no other guide than that bright effluence which a few constellations of the literary hemisphere dispensed ; but experience convinced me that they are insufficient lights to him who is doubtful and fearful amidst the multitudinous sea . ' " But if lie had an extravagant admiration of his correspondent , he did not have a very modest opinion of his own acquirements . " In your house alone , " he writes near the close of his first letter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different countries , and am conversant in the modern languages and in modern literature , - that is to say , in superficial knowledge and jejune ornament ; and if the style of my letter is uncommon , be pleased to recollect , Sir , that it is on a very unusual topic . " Whether this application was made with the knowledge of his parents , we are not informed ; but it is certain that his father 's house was still a very uncongenial home , and about this time they again thought it desirable to send him abroad . During his absence he travelled through France , and a considerable part of his time was passed in Paris , where he mingled freely in literary society , and added much to his // knowledge of general literature . In 1788 he retnrned to England ; and shortly afterward he wrote a poetical epistle to Warton , the Poet Laureate , " On the Abuse of Satire , " which was printed in the Gentleman 's Magazine for July , 1789 . This poem extends to about a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Dr. Wolcot , better known by his pseudonyme , Peter Pindar , and as an urgent appeal to Warton to drive Wolcot from the field by writing more poetry himself . It is modelled on the verse of Pope , has considerable spirit , and on the whole shows that its writer had acquired strength and self-reliance with his added years . Wolcot was greatly incensed at its appearance , and lie at once ascribed it to the pen of ilayley , the friend and biographer of Cowper , and at that time one of the most popular of English poets . When Disraeli went up to town lie found that his poem was making a noise in society , and that the newspapers were filled with comments on it , and with gossip about Wolcot and ilayley . Elated by this unexpected notoriety , lie hurried home to communicate the tidings to his parents , who seem now to have become convinced that any further resistance to their son 's inclinations would be fruitless . The success of his poem doubtless exerted a large influence over Disraeli 's subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry James Pye , Warton 's successor as Poet Lanreate ; and by Pye 's influence , the elder Disraeli was induced to consent that his son should henceforth devote himself to literary pursuits . Pye visited his young friend at Enfield , and encouraged him to persevere in the path which he had marked out ; and in the following year Disraeli publislied his first volume . This was a versified essay in defence of satirical poetry , under the title of " A Defence of Poetry , addressed to Henry James Pye , Esq. , to which is added a Specimen of a New Version of Telemachus . " It contains some well-pointed lines ; but as a whole , both the Defence and the metrical version of Telemachus are feeble and diffuse . Neither shows any intelleetnal growth since the publication of the " Abuse of Satire " ; and the translation of Telemachus was not completed . In the following year he published anonymously an octavo 45* // volume of miscellaneous anecdotes , drawn from various sources , and entitled " Curiosities of Literature . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received with much favor ; and two years afterward he published a second volume of the same character , which was equally popular . In 1817 , he added a third volume , embracing a larger amount of original matter , but formed on the same plan ; and in 1823 he published a second series , also in three volumes . Subsequently , these six volumes were carefully revised , and published in a new form as one work , accompanied by a Preface as full of egotism as any of Southey 's letters . " These volumes , " their author does not hesitate to say , " have imbued our youth with their first tastes for modern literature ; have diffused a delight in critical and philosophical speculation among circles of readers who were not accustomed to literary topics ; and finally , they have been honored by eminent contemporaries , who have long consulted them , and set their stamp on the metal . " Nevertheless this work has not escaped criticism ; and in 1838 a small volume of adversaria was published by Mr. Bolton Corney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several errors . The veteran author , then more than seventy years of age , replied in a spicy pamphlet , acknowledging some mistakes which have since been corrected , but in the greater number of instances maintaining his previous statements . The controversy terminated with a brief answer by Mr. Corney ; and it must be conceded that , in the main , his animadversions were fully justified by the facts before him . He had shown that Disraeli was sometimes hasty in his conclusions and careless in his language , and that he had sometimes been misled by his authorities . The work , however , did not suffer much in the general estimation , and it is still the most popular of Disraeli 's productions . Nor is it probable that it will ever cease to be read with interest , for its many curious anecdotes , its graphic sketches , and its genial criticism . For the ten years after the publication of the first volume of the Curiosities , the young enthusiast in literature seems to have given his pen little rest . During this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genius of the Literary Character " ; his " Miscellanies , or Literary IRecreations " ; " A Dissertation on Anecdotes " ; and several novels , which are now forgotten . One of them , however , " Mejnoon and Leila , " has the merit of being the first story in our language composed with the view of presenting an accurate picture of Oriental life and manners . Of these works , both the Essay on the Literary Character and the Miscellanies have retained their popularity , and both have been reprinted several times ; the former , after the lapse of more than twenty years from its first appearance , was almost entirely rewritten , and was published in a new edition , in 1818 , under the title of " The Literary Character , illustrated by the History of Men of Genius , drawn from their own Feelings and Confessions . " In 1822 it was again much enlarged , and was further enriched by the insertion of several manuscript notes by Lord Byron , with whom the book was a favorite . It is in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shows a depth and range of thought which we do not find in many of his productions , while its style is manly and its illustrations are copious and well selected . The " Miscellanies " comprises a small collection of papers , similar in design and execution to many of the later essays in the Curiosities , but containing nothing that requires special notice . Early in 1802 he was married to Miss Basevi , aunt of the distinguished architect of that name , with whom he lived happily for forty-five years . By this lady he had one daughter and three sons , the eldest of whom , Benjamin Disraeli , has added fresh honors to the family name by a career of remarkable brilliancy in literature and public life . For several years after his marriage , Disraeli published little or nothing , with the exception of a vc4ume of " Narrative Poems , " which appeared in quarto in 1803 , without winning much notice . In 1812 and 1813 he again made his appearance as an author , and published two volumes of essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including some Inquiries respecting their Moral and Literary Characters . " His design in this work was to show that authors receive " little encouragement and less remuneration , " and that " the most successful // author can obtain no equivalent for the labors of his life . " This is certainly a sombre view of the subject , and one that is only partially sustained by the facts of literary history ; but it is characteristic of Disraeli 's mind , and clearly shows that want of breadth and comprehensiveness which is the chief defect in his writings . But in spite of the fallacious theory which these volumes were designed to illustrate , they contain many curious facts and anecdotes drawn from the literary history of England , and they have been deservedly popular . A few months after the publication of this work , Disraeli brought out three more volumes composed on the same plan , and illustrating another division of the same general subject . To this new work he gave the title of " Quarrels of Authors ; or , Some Memoirs for our Literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed were exclusively English ; and in general the treatment was judicious and candid , though in some instances the author 's opinions do not agree with those now held by impartial critics . Thus , in his account of the famous quarrel between Pope and Addison , he fails to render entire justice to the latter , and he repeats some misrepresentations of Pope 's apologists which have since been exploded by Lord Macaulay and other writers . Among the authors whose quarrels and controversies fill the larger part of the volumes are Warburton and Pope , the two most noted literary combatants of the last century , Bentley , Hobbes , and Ben Jonson ; and there are also sketches of the controversies which grew out of the formation of the Royal Society , and some other essays of a similar character . Thus far Disraeli 's researches had been mainly directed to literary questions ; but lie now determined to investigate some of the vexed questions of political history . Accordingly , he published in 1816 an " Inquiry into the Literary and Political Character of King James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of James from the contempt into which it had fallen , and it certainly relieves his name from some undeserved obloquy , but it does not awaken any real sympathy with him , or overrule the popular judgment of his character and aims . The fact still remains , that James was an ambitious and arbitrary pedant , who entirely misunderstood the character and // 533 temper of the English people . It should be observed , however , that Disraeli 's admiration for the Stuarts was not a sudden passion , and traces of it may be found at a very early period of his life . " I suspect , " he says in the first series of the Curiosities , " that James was not that degraded and feeble character in which he ranks by the contagious voice of criticism . He has had more critics than readers . After a great number of acute observations and witty allusions , made extempore , which we find continually recorded of him by contemporary writers , and some not friendly to him , I conclude that he possessed a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity . " With this view the Inquiry was prepared and published . On the whole , it is a well-written production , and it comprises much miscellaneous information about the life , character , and times of James . Disraeli did not , however , possess the thorough familiarity with his subject , the large powers of generalization , or the judicial habits of mind , which are now demanded in an historian , and consequently his tract is little read , and never quoted as an authority . His next work , the " Commentaries on the Life and Reign of Charles I. , " was probably suggested by the " Inquiry , " though the first two volumes were not published until 1828 . Two more volumes followed in 1830 ; and in 1832 a supplementary volume appeared under the title of Eliot , llampden , and Pym , " in answer to some strictures on the preceding volumes . In these volumes , which have the same desultory and fragmentary character as his other writings , it was Disraeli 's design to present some new views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his principal advisers , and to depreciate the services of the popular leaders . The attempt was not very successful ; no one now reads the " Commentaries , " or entertains a different opinion of the Revolution in consequence of its publication ; and probably no work of equal research and ability ever influenced public opinion less . Yet at the time it was received with great favor by the Tories , who were then smarting under the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Bill , and in fearful anticipation of the grant of Parliamentary Reform ; and , true to her first love , the University of Oxford testified her gratitude optimi // regis optimo vindici , by conferring on him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law . The work does indeed show much research , and sets some transactions in a new light by the help of documents unknown to previous writers , or not accessible to them ; but it is the work of a partisan , and the theory which it is designed to uphold can not be successfully defended . Disraeli 's next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grave and eloquent dissertation on the " Genius of Judaism , " expounding at length the principal causes which have separated the Jews from every other nation , and long made them a special object of hatred . In dea*ling with the fundamental distinctions of his ancestral faith , and in recording some pages in the history of the " peculiar people , " Disraeli had a subject well suited to his powers ; and the volume comprises some very striking and admirable passages . But it has not been much read , and we are not aware that it has been reprinted since the publication of the second edition , immediately after its first appearance . This work affords one of the best specimens of Disraeli 's style , and exhibits his intellect in its full maturity . He was now , however , fast approaching the allotted term of human existence ; he had acquired a considerable reputation ; his books were widely read , and some of them had been often reprinted ; but he was still vigorous in body and mind , and he was reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of his theory as to the calamities of authors . No sooner had one volume left the press , than he began to plan another ; and he now turned his thoughts once more to a new subject . It did not enter into his design in early life to present a comprehensive survey of the literature of a particular period , such as Mr. ilallam has given us , or to do for English literature what our own countryman , Mr. Ticknor , has done with consummate ability for the literature of Spain . For such a task he had neither the breadth of culture , the patient industry , nor the impartiality of judgment which those eminent writers brought to the performance of their respective labors . Nevertheless , his principal works , with the exception of the " Commentaries on the Life and Reign of Charles I. , " must be regarded as contributions to such a general survey of the progress // of modern literature . They all belong to the department of literary history , and most of them are intended to illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was doubtless his perception of this fact which induced him , when nearly seventy years of age , to form the plan of a History of English Literature . This work he hoped to complete in six volumes , and he at once set about its execution with much zeal . But he had made little progress when an affection of the optic nerve deprived him of sight , and prevented the further prosecution of his undertaking . The operation of couching was performed without affording relief ; and he at length determined to relinquish his design , and to content himself with publishing a selection from the materials which he had collected . In this work he was assisted by his daughter , whose services were rendered with a cheerfulness and assiduity deserving of the warmest recognition . The result was the publication of three volumes of miscellanies , under the title of " Amenities of Literature , " comprising a series of independent essays more or less directly connected with the history of English literature . These volumes were published in 1841 ; and in his Preface Disraeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of filial devotion . " From the manner in which the volumes were prepared , they have a very fragmentary character ; but they contain much just criticism , and exhibit a higher order of powers than is shown in most of his other works . They open with an essay on " The Druidical Institution , " and end with one on " The War against Books " ; and among the authors noticed are Chaucer , Sir Philip Sidney , Spenser , Shakespeare , and Bacon . These papers show a great familiarity with the works of our older writers , a discriminating taste , and considerable power of analysis . The style is clear and forcible , and , though marked by little or no ornament , it gives no signs of old age . Yet the work has never equalled the " Curiosities of Literature " in popularity , and its fragmentary character will probably cause it to be forgotten long before its less ambitious and elaborate precursor . This was the last production of his pen , and with its publication Disraeli closed a literary career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the appearance of his first printed essay . He was enabled , however , with the help of his daughter , to revise his work on Charles I. , and to prepare a new edition of it for the press . In her society , and in this congenial occupation , his years glided away with scarcely any apparent abatement of his physical vigor ; and he had nearly attained his eighty-second year when he was attacked by the influenza , at that time an epidemic in England . The attack proved fatal , and on the 19th of January , 1848 , after a short illness , he died at his residence , Bradenham House , Buckinghamshire , where he had passed the last twenty years of his life . He was buried in Bradenham church , among the descendants of the Hampdens and other illustrious families whose names are indissolubly associated with the history of that famous county . On the day before he was seized with his last illness , he was informed by his publisher that all his works were out of print ; and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been published by his son . In attempting to measure the mental capacity of Mr. Disraeli , and to determine his relative rank in English literature , we must not overlook the circumstance that his early education was very defective , and that his mind was not trained by any severe discipline . Without the countenance of his parents or the advice of judicious literary friends , at a time when such countenance and advice would have been of the utmost value , he read in a desultory manner , and followed the prompting of his own inclination , as far as he was able . Accordingly he wrote poetry , essays , and fiction , without any definite plan for his literary life . Yet he was among the first who made literary history a study ; and notwithstanding the disadvantages under which he labored , he attained an honorable position among his contemporaries ; his books were popular ; and he had the reputation of being a well-read scholar . This reputation has somewhat declined ; but it will not be denied that he had a very extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected no opportunity for self-culture . He was , however , a man of facts and details , rather than a man of principles . He had little power of generalization or // 537 of sustained reasoning , and he rarely took a comprehensive view of any subject . Hence his works are , almost without exception , fragmentary in form . They are replete with curious and amusing information , but the facts seldom have an orderly and systematic arrangement , or illustrate any central idea . His books , indeed , must be regarded as collections of materials , rather than as elaborate treatises , and their real value consists in the variety and interest of the details of author-life which they embody . Disraeli , as we have intimated , lacked a judicial habit of mind , and like most antiquaries lie was disposed to magnify the importance of his researches , and to regard every circumstance which had escaped the notice of previous writers as a piece of secret intelligence . This weakness subjected him to some undeserved criticism , and it is probably one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early life his style was florid and pompous , but as he advanced in years it gained clearness and force , and his later works , the " Genius of Judaism " and the " Amenities of Literature , " contain many passages of genuine eloquence . In the former of these , in particular , he writes with a dignity and polished grace which no one could have predicted from his earlier poems and essays . All his works in illustration of literary history , however , are composed in an attractive and popular style ; and they owe scarcely less to this circumstance than to the exceeding richness of their materials . In his political opinions he was conservative ; but he took little part in the discussion of contemporary politics , except to advocate the removal of the Jewish disabilities . In literature his taste was catholic , and his critical judgments are in general candid and impartial . He had few literary antipathies , and Horace Walpole is almost the only writer for whom he entertained a deep and settled aversion on purely literary grounds . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student , and he made diligent use of the advantages which his father 's wealth enabled him to procure . " In London , " his son says , " his only amusement was to ramble among booksellers ; if he entered a club , it was only to go into the library . In the country he scarcely ever left his room , but to saunter in // abstraction upon a terrace , muse over a chapter , or coin a sentence . " So intense was this devotion to books , that he seems never to have allowed himself time for social intercourse , and during the greater part of the day and evening he was separated from his family , even marriage producing no change in this respect . The life of Disraeli forms a connecting link between the age of Johnson and our own times . His writings , however , ally him with the former period rather than with the latter ; for though most of them were published after the commencement of this century , they belong , both in form and spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the least valuable part of his works , was inspired by the genius of Pope , and it has the characteristic faults of Pope 's imitators . His criticism , though for the most part genial , lacked the philosophical breadth and the penetrating analysis which were shown by Coleridge and the Edinburgh Reviewers . His historical productions had the same defects as his criticism , and were mere records of facts , without any systematic attempt to show the relation of causes and effects . In a word , neither as a poet , as an essayist , nor as an historian , does he exhibit the characteristics which belong to recent writers in the same departments of literary endeavor ; and when judged by the standard of the nineteenth century , his writings do not take a. very high rank . But if we apply to them the standard by which we estimate the minor writers of the last century , his real merits will be more readily perceived , and he will be found to occupy a very creditable position .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
