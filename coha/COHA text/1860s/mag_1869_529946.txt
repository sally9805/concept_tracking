txt HUNTING IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS . qwq By reference to the hunting appointments in Bell 's Life in London , it will be seen that England has one hundred and twenty packs of hounds , Ireland forty , and Scotland six , making a total of one hundred and sixty-six . These figures , however , do not represent the actual number . There are in the " three kingdoms " many minor packs of hounds kept by private individuals , or by subscription , and these are not of sufficient importance to be included in the announcement column of Bell 's Life . Counting these in , it would be safe to say that about two hundred and fifty packs of hounds for the pursuit of the deer , fox , hare , and otter are now maintained in Great Britain and Ireland . Of the regular packs kept by subscription , by far the greater proportion is devoted to the chase of the fox , that being the animal by which the best sport is afforded across country . Indeed , there appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looked upon as " vermin , " and to extirpate him by riding him down with hounds is the only means of insuring the barn - yards against his ravages . And yet this is but the shadow of an idea , for the extirpation of the fox is very carefully guarded against . In all the fox-hunting districts of Great Britain the man who would kill a fox with gun or trap subjects himself to social ostracism . The sporting gentry of the county give him the cold shoulder , and even the farmers regard him with disfavor . For there is a strong traditionary love of hunting among the farmers , who are often keen fox-hunters themselves , enjoying full liberty to " follow the hounds " ; and any damage to their fields and fences by the horsemen , or to their henroosts by the foxes , is made good to them from a fund subscribed for that purpose . Therefore the fox is , in most districts , tolerated , nay , encouraged , as a sort of amusing rascal , whose grand redeeming point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The favor with which that sport has long been viewed in Great Britain is evident from the vast sums of money that are annually expended in maintaining it . One of the great county distinctions is , to be a " Master of FoxHounds , " and subjoin the cabalistic letters M. F. H. to one 's signature . Foxhunting has a literature of its own , too . Somerville 's " Chase " is a standard English classic , - a poem full of charming , pastoral pictures of rural English life and character . Peter Beckford , an ancestor , I believe , of the eccentric author of " Vathek , " wrote a book on hunting , in which is to be discerned that combination of scholarship and physical energy so characteristic of English gentlemen who follow fieldsports . But the volumes that have been written on the " noble art , " as the votaries of fox-hunting fondly style their dashing sport , are innumerable . The ephemeral literature of hunting and field-sports generally , of the pres-. ent period , may be styled the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne under which Apperley wrote so voluminously on these subjects thirty or forty years since . From him nearly all the writers in the English sporting papers of the present day have taken their color , and most of the writers of books treating of hounds and horses ; and , as Apperley was the best of them all , it is fair that this branch of writing should be known as " Nimrod literature . " And the pencil , no less than the pen , has found employment in depicting the stirring scenes of the hunting-field . Not to go back to the numerous painters by whom the sport has been illustrated in times long past , let me instance Sir Francis Grant , a painter of r*rnk and fashion , and now President of the Royal Academy . The first essays with the pencil that brought Grant into notice as an artist were pictures and sketches of hunting scenes . In these he was particularly happy , being an ardent sportsman himself , and one who , it is said , spent an inherited fortune on sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her Majesty 's Buck-Hounds on Ascot heath " is well // 433 known in this country , through the large engraving from it . Fifty years ago the most popular delineator of accidents and incidents of the hunting-field was Henry Alken , whose quaint , stiff plates in aquatint or some such manner are still often to be seen in old English ale-houses , and not unfrequently in similar resorts in New York . These , ab-. surd as they are in their hard , literal renderings , are valuable now , as being really faithful transcripts of what hunting - men and horses and hounds looked like half a century ago . Best of all illustrators of the hunting-field of the present period was John Leech , whose numerous scenes of sporting life and character were one of the most attractive features of Punch for so many years . No artist but Leech ever thoroughly drew an English hunter : by which I mean the horse used for hunting , that being the only way in which the word " hunter " is applied by English sportsmen . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , whether he meant him to represent a good rider or a bad one ; a point in which none of the other delineators of horses and their riders have ever come near him . In the whole extensive range of Leech 's presentments of social life and character , there is no phase , perhaps , that so marks his wonderful power of observation and ability for rendering action , as his scenes in the hunting-field . Englishmen carry the sport of foxhunting with them wherever they go . The Duke of Wellington maintained a pack of hounds when he commanded in the Peninsula , and no leader more than he ever fostered among his officers a taste for the sport . It was " a good way to make soldiers , " said the Iron Duke . At Gibraltar , in Australia , and in Canada , fox-hunting is kept up as far as practicable . In India the jackal is made to do duty for the fox , and in Australia the kangaroo ; but it is in the British Islands only that the sport is carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the style and accessories of fox-hunting have been greatly modified . Towards the end of the last century the horses and hounds were of a much heavier and slower type than they have been since . The sportsmen were attired much in the fashion of garments in which George Washington is generally represented . Excessively tight buckskin breeches were among the affectations of the sporting dandy of those days . I have been told by veteran fox-hunters how , in their youth , they used to put on their leather breeches before retiring for the night . In those good old times the field was taken at early dawn , and the tedious operation of pounding himself into the tights would have hazarded the wearer 's punctuality at the cover-side . Some years ago I met on the Long Island shore an aged fisherman , who told me that , when a youth , he served in an organization called the " Buckskin Guard , " I think , and that they used to sleep in their breeches lest they might be late for morning parade through trouble in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally termed in sporting slang , " pink " - has been long the recognized color for the fox-hunter 's costume . Some hunts wear green , and there is one hunt in England the uniform of which is orange-tawny plush . The old style of hunting-cap , made of strong leather covered with velvet , to protect the head in case of a fall , is now seldom worn by gentlemen . It is still , however , as it has long been , the proper head-gear of the huntsman , or official who manages the hounds , and of his attendant aid , who is styled a " whipperin , " - a term commonly abbreviated to " whip . " Of these , in the more important hunting-establishments , there are usually two , called the first and second whip , respectively . The modern style for a hunting gentleman is a scarlet coat , cut in the fashion of a dress-coat , corduroy or buckskin breeches , and very natty boots with buff-leather tops , which reach to within about four inches of the knees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is more frequently worn now than any other . // Until within forty years , the class of hunter used in England was very different from the one at present ridden to hounds . The sketches of Alken will convey a better idea of the old-fashioned hunter than any others of which I know . He was a short , compact horse , very thick in the crest , and round in the hindquarters , which were jauntily set off with a short , elevated tail . Horses ' tails used to be nicked underneath , and held up with pulleys , until they grew to the desired " cock , " or angle of elevation . It was also the fashion in those days to crop the ears of horses off very close , and I myself remember to have seen veteran hunters whose heads had been thus maltreated . There was no necessity for fast horses in the field then , for the hounds were comparatively slow , and did not require something , with racing blood in it , to " live " with them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster ideas took possession of people . That is the way the world goes . Once upon a time we were contented with stage-coaches and five miles an hour ; now it is nothing , but rail and forty . The fox-hounds , after a while , came to be more finely bred , until they became too swift for the steady old horse . This led to the introduction of racing blood into the hunter stock , until the English hunter became the bony , fine-drawn , leannecked thoroughbred so truthfully presented by Leech in his hunting sketches . Owing to the increased speed , there is less " music " in the fox-hunt now than there was formerly ; and , for the same reason , hunting is more like steeple-chasing than it used to be , and none the better for that , perhaps . A kennel of hounds is a very interesting sight . Some of the great English kennels are quite extensive establishments , covering , with their appendages , large spaces of ground . A kennel consists of a yard enclosed by high walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stream of clear water should pass through the enclosure , which also ought to have grass-plots for the hounds to roll upon , and trees for shade . Opening into the yard are the sheds or dormitories in which the hounds sleep . These are fitted up with long shelves of plank raised about a foot above the floor , and covered with clean straw , for the accommodation of the hounds . The kennels open , on the other side , into the feeding-yard . The principal food of hounds is a mess of oatmeal and potatoes , with which buttermilk is sometimes mixed . Instead of buttermilk , however , on certain days of the week , their food is enriched with " greaves . " This is a refuse from the tallow-candle factories , and is a brown , coarse-looking material made up in large cakes , which , when heated , melts down into a sort of pungent gravy , of which hounds are very fond . Boiled horse-flesh is another standard article of food in the kennels , and is given to the hounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as are detailed for duty get nothing but oatmeal porridge and buttermilk , so as to keep them sharp-set for their work . In some kennels the education of the hounds , and the state of discipline to which they have been brought by their keepers , are very amusingly exemplified at feeding-time . Two or three large troughs , filled with whatever the food allotted for the day may be , are ranged in the feeding-yard . All this time the baying of the hounds from the kennel bespeaks their impatience for the meal . At last , all arrangements having been completed , the doors leading to the kennel are thrown open , and out rushes the pack , pellmell . A few cracks from the whips of the huntsman and his assistants make them huddle all together at a little distance from the troughs . Then the huntsman , having made a careful survey of the pack , selects those hounds that are poorest in condition , and calls them out , one by one , by name , cheering them to the troughs . It is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how well they know their names . But the most amusing part of the scene is when the huntsmaa raises his horn , the blast of which is // the signal for all the hounds to rush forward and take their places at the troughs . The eager eyes with which they watch every movement of the huntsman 's hand , as he slowly dailies with the horn ; the tiptoe straining ; the stretching of sinewy necks and standing up on hind - legs , - all these are very characteristic , and curious to see . At last the shrill blast is blown , and in a moment the troughs are completely concealed from view by the spotted bodies of the hounds . In the field the discipline of hounds is equally remarkable . Fox-hounds will naturally hunt hares ; but , as hares are much more plenty than foxes , and would therefore interfere with the legitimate sport if noticed by the hounds , the latter are strictly educated to ignore them . This is remarkably illustrated in " drawing cover , " or , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hares will start up on every side , before the very noses of the hounds , who take no more notice of them than they would of toy-kittens . Should a young hound chance to forget himself , though , and make a dash at a hare , a sharp cut from the thong of one of the whips immediately brings him to a sense of his delinquency . The cover-side , at a " meet , " is a very picturesque and varied scene . A field , or lane , hard by the copse that is first to be drawn for a fox , is usually the rendezvous . By ten in the morning a number of sportsmen , members of the hunt , visitors at the neighboring country-houses , sporting swells fror* a distance , and farmers , have assembled at the cover-side . Many smart-looking grooms are to be seen there in charge of their masters ' hunters . The owners of these may have come down by rail , or they may have driven down in their sporting " drags , " or ridden upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in England to denote a smart roadster much used by gentlemen for general purposes . Nobody ever rides his hunter to the cover-side unless he happens to live within an easy distance of it . Men who own large stables have usu 435 ally two hunters brought for them to the place of meeting . One of them is termed the " second horse , " and the business of the light groom who rides him is to keep as near as he can to the hunt during the run , by making short cuts , trotting along roads , or in any other way , according to his judgment . Then , when the hounds have come to a check after a long burst over the country , he makes his way to his master , with the fresh horse . Leech made a capital sketch of one of these " second-horse men , " who is coolly clearing a fivebarred gate in taking a short cut on a noble thoroughbred hunter . Men in scarlet now come dropping in by twos and threes . Some of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the breeze . There are military men here , too ; but these , although daring riders across country , are not often the best . Here and there may be seen a portly squire , sometimes well advanced in years , - a well-mounted and well-appointed gentleman with rosy face and silvery hair , whom everybody seems to know . Ladies , with their attendant cavaliers , are frequently to be seen in the throng ; for it has become the fashion , of late years , for ladies to join the chase . Few of them , of course , ever see more than the " throw-off , " or beginning of it , but there are exceptions ; and it is not uncommon now to find fashionable young Amazons who ride across country with great pluck and skill . Sometimes there is a sporting parson on the ground . He wears a black coat , of course , but it is not always of a strictly clerical cut , and the rest of his equipments are of the regular sporting sort , though somewhat subdued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines the roadster with the hunter , and it sometimes happens that the parson leaves many of the redcoats far behind him in the run . In a clear space near the cover the hounds are drawn up , carefully watched over by the huntsman and whips . They lie lazily about , licking each other 's ears or their own paws . Some of them tumble on the grass , and others lift Hunting in t4e British Zsiands. // up their muzzles , and give utterance to the peculiar hell-like cry that distinguishes the fox-hound . Near the pack sits a gentleman upon a first-class hunter . Everybody , almost , seems to know him , and many of the corners exchange greetings with him as they pass . That is the master of the hounds . He is a man of standing in his county , often a nobleman , or a baronet , or a squire of landed estates . Several men of the farming class are generally to be seen on these occasions . They are , for the most part , men who breed horses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to show them off to advantage in the hunting-field . Most of them dress in a knowing and sportsmanlike style , but they never wear scarlet . There appears to be a social understanding about this , and the farmer who would turn out in pink would be set down even by his own class as " putting on airs . " A black-muzzled gypsy on a donkey is a very usual feature of a meet , and there are always many stragglers on foot , - earth-stoppers in tarnished velveteen coats , with sharp-looking little terriers under their arm* ; gaping country louts in smock-frocks ; idlers who pick up a living by holding gentlemen 's horses , catching runaways , and performing such other small services as are sometimes useful and timely to sportsmen who have " come to grief " It may be seen that the cover-side is no had place for variety of character and picturesque grouping . When the sportsmen have mustered in goodly numbers , the master of the hounds gives the word , and , with a wave of his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack into cover . Silent , but with eager eyes . and chops ready to " give tongue , " the beautiful , thoroughbred creatures , waving their long " sterns " ( tails ) like feathers , plunge into the thicket , and , with noses well down , thread rapidly to and fro , in and out , through its mazes . Presently the bell-note of a hound rings clear from the copse . If it is th' cry of a trustworthy hound , - and the huntsman knows the voice of every October , member of his pack , - he halloos " Hark to Chanter ! " or whatever the name of the hound may be , which means that the rest of the pack is at once to make for Chanter , and aid him in hitting off the scent . Sometimes the first tongue is given by a young hound , and , if there be a suspicion that he has " opened " on a hare , or on anything except a fox , it is the business of one of the whips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admonish him with his whipthong . Now a tremendous burst of hound - music comes from the whole pack , and every man settles himself firmly in his stirrups and tightens his reins , for it looks very like a " find . " The cry recedes and grows fainter , as the pack gets away towards the farther side of the cover , for it is often difficult to make the fox " break , " especially if the cover be large and close , and this is a moment of great anxiety with the huntsman and whips . Here , again , there comes to me a reminiscence from Leech , - one of those truthful touches of character that ' he never could have seized unless he had seen it . The first whip , " who is a little ruffled because the fox wo n't break , " comes tearing along a spongy piece of ground by the cover-side , and roars out to a little cockney rider with a cigar , whom he has nearly knocked over , " Now , then , sir ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cover . Mayhap your ugly mug might frighten him out ! " At last the welcome cry of " Gone away ! is heard from some one of the watchers along the skirts of the thicket . The fox , finding himself hotly pressed by the hounds , and his proper retreat closed against him ( the " earths " or holes in which the foxes burrow are attended to by the earth-stoppers the night before a hunt , while the foxes are out ) , has taken to the open country , and his purpose now is to make for the next cover , which may be miles distant ; and there he goes up the slope yonder , with his belly almost touching the ground , and his brush sticking straight out behind ! Hunting in tke Bri/isk Islands . // Now the huntsman rings out a blast from his horn to bring the hounds together , as he gallops his horse to the spot where the fox broke . The gallant pack tears madly through the cover , and , as the hounds come plunging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stooping low from his saddle , and waving his cap close down to the ground with a cheery " Halloo ! " Then , with a tremendous burst from every throat , away go the hounds , " breast high , " that is , with their heads well up , for well-bred fox-hounds never put their noses to the ground when the scent is hot . There they go at a terrific pace , - twenty-five or thirty couple of keen-scented , long-winded , ravenous pursuers , hot on the trail of one small , red-furred fugitive with a sharp nose , a sharper wit , and a long , bushy tail ! And now every man who means to ride to the hounds and see the hunt through must make up his mind for action , and that quickly . He who loiters now is thrown out for the day . The huntsman , now that his hounds are fairly off , takes his horse well in hand , and , dashing him at a fence that jntervenes between him and the pack , clears it cleverly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the line of chase . The two whips lag behind , for a moment , to look after any hounds that may come straggling from the cover , and then follow their leader . Such crack riders as happen to be out for the day then take their ground , each according to his own judgment . Some follow nearly on the line of the hounds . One or two swerve a little to the right or left , where they know that the ground is good for riding over ; for every stanch rider to hounds does all he can during a run to spare his horse , and take as little out of him as possible . I remember an old sketch of Alken 's , in which he shows the steady foxhunter galloping through an open gate , while " snob " flies his horse over the fence within an inch of the hinge-post . Some old stagers , who are heavy weights now , and rather more careful of themselves than they used to be 437 twenty years ago , take to the lane , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find roads and easy field-riding in the direction for which the fox is heading . Probably there are one or two spills at the first fence after leaving cover , followed by the common incident of a horse careering away after the hounds without his rider . After two or three fences have been crossed , the field - that is the horsemen composing the hunt - begins to scatter . The best riders may be seen well to the front , keeping clear of each other as they go ; for it is dangerous work to follow in one track , because , if one rider goes down , he is apt to trip up , the next , and so on . The fences are of almost every variety . There are deep ditches , the banks of which are protected with stiff thorn hedges . Timber post-and-rail fences are common obstacles . Sometimes they are double , and it is nice work to hand a horse over the first one , with hardly room for him when he lands to gather himself for a leap over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooks , and thesa are a great terror to some otherwise plucky horses , that would face anything rather than water . " How did you get over the brook ? " is a question commonly put to a man who has returned from a run with the hounds . Winding away there , far along the pastures , is a line of pollard willows , and they mark the course of the brook . The spotted hounds , so close together that one might " cover them with a blanket , " as the old sporting phrase has it , have reached the line of willows , and are splashing and struggling across the brook . A momentary check after they have emerged from it , and now they are off again , breast high , and with but little music , for the pace is too severe for that , and the hounds of today are but poor musicians compared with those of a generation or two ago . Yonder comes a scattered troop of redcoats thundering down the pastures to the brook . There can be no shirking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunting in the British Islands // qwq mile or so the brook presents the same face , and that it has to be ridden over or into by him who would keep well with the hounds . Twenty horsemen charge it at twenty several points . Some get clear over in a fly . Three or four go bodily in , the water splashmb so high over them as to make a spray-cloud in which an iris might sit , so that for a moment they are no longer seen , - dashing , impetuous riders , all , and given to going blindly at everything that offers . Here comes a stalwart farmer in a green coat and white hat , mounted upon a splendid iron-gray horse that sails over the water like a bird , and surges on after the chase with a long , swinging stride . A well-known horseman , on a fiery chestnut that has a trick of refusing his fences , is the next that faces the brook , for which he makes at a somewhat narrower spot between two pollard willows . His horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden swerve . Turning him straight round , with an exclamation that do s not sound exactly like a blessing , the experienced rider rushes him back up the field some fifty yards , and then . bringing him round abain , holds him with firm hands straight for the brook , cra* ming the spurs into him this time ; and over it they go in beautiful style . It is not every horseman who could do hurt , and he is loudly cheered by two r three riders who have also got safely over , and are now rattling away by his side . And now the hounds have come to a check . The huntsman is with them , and is " making casts , " that is , cheering his hounds hither and thither with waves of his hand , obedient to which the pack spreads itself in every direction , now with noses well to the ground . Availing themselves of the check , experienced riders dismount , slacken girths , and lead their foaming horses up and down . At last a stanch old hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hark to Jupiter ! " is now the word , and presently the chase is wheelinb onward as hotly as before , the foremost riders , reinforced by a few whom the check has enabled to come up , takinb their ground as at the start . Immediately ahead , now , and about five or six miles from the startr there is another cover , - this time , perhaps , of the prickly shrub called gorse or furze . In thi* there are a couple of fox-earths , but whether these have been stopped or not is known to but few who are following the hounds . The fox has never been in view since he broke , but now his line is revealed to the riders by the chattering magpies that are fluttering over the hedge a little this side of the cover . These are long-tailed blackand-white birds , somewhat larger than the purple grackle of this conntry . They are very cunninb and 6arrulous ; and whenever a fox makes his appearance near them , they are sure to follow his course with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover , the fox is in view for a short time , during which the hounds redouble their efforts , and strain every sinew and muscle , maddened at the sight of him . Then he disappears in the prickly mazes of the gorse , into which the hounds soon plunge after him . The huntsman and three or four of the hard riders are up , and , following the hounds by such open spaces as they can find winding through this very emharrassin* kind of cover , they see them lying and lolling about : on the ground , baying every now and then at a hole that had once been a rabbit 's burrow , hut which had some time since been enlarged and improved by Master Reynard into a dwelling for himself . And so , the fox has " gone to earth , " and the hunt is up for the day Or it may h ppen that the fox 's retreat has been cut off hy the earth-stoppers , in which case he may either be run into and killed by the hounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lead them another long spin over the country to some other well-known sanctuary of his , miles away , perhaps . When hounds have run into and killed a fox , . they are whipped off for * // inent , and the huntsman , having cut the fox 's brush off , hands it to the rider who has first " come in at the death , " by whom , according to etiquette , it is presented to any young Diana of the occasion who may chance to be up in time . The brush is affixed to the headstall of her horse 's bridle as a trophy , and the fox is thrown to the vociferous and angry pack . Of course , in the description just given , I have merely generalized the incidents of an English fox - hunt , so as to convey to those who never have seen one some idea of what it is like . No one fox-hunt is exactly like another , and with every pack of hounds many remarkable incidents and accidents occur in the course of a season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes - though comparatively seldom - fatal falls . Broken collar-bones are the commonest of the severe accidents to which men are liable in the hunting-field ; for a. rider , in getting a " pure * or " cropper ( pet names for a fall ) , is very apt to pitch upon his shoulder and fracture a clavicle . Once I witnessed a very remarkable incident in the way of a fall . The hounds had just come to a check , and a tall , heavy rider - a capital horseman he was , too - was urging his horse at full speed down a lane to come up with them . Just as he turned into the highway , there came along an immense drove of pigs on their way to the nearest market-town . Headlong in among them blundered the horse and his rider . The former plunged over with a tremendous crash , and broke his neck on the spot . The rider was pitched head foremost , and to a hood distance , along the backs of the pigs , which broke his fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few slight bruises . Another accident which I remember hearing of at the time of its occurrence happened to a near-sighted man , who was continually making dangerous blunders with hounds , which he persisted , however , in following . One day , having come to a fence that he did not like , he rode a 439 little way along it to look for an easy place . Presently he came to what he probably supposed to be a low wall built across a gateway or gap . This he charged with his horse , which rolled over with him far away to the other side . The wall proved to he an old gray cow that was lying across the gap , and that threw the horse over by rising under him just as he jumped . In this case the rider 's neck was broken , but the horse escaped unhurL I also recall an incident of a very heavy man getting down into the bottom of a deep ditch with his horse atop of him . Neither of them could stir , being wedged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which saved the fallen rider from sustaining any severe injuries . Spades were put in requisition , and man and horse were dug out after an hour 's work . Certain modern contrivances have gone far , in some parts of England , to embarrass the fox-hunter and render the sport less agreeable to him than it was a few years ago . Among these may be named the railway . Where the iron horse hunts , the other and older kind is apt to get into trouble . Railways are disa* , reeable , and in some cases dangerous , to sportsmen and hounds alike . But worse than the railway is the " invisible " wire fence , - an invention gradually creeping into use in the more closely cultivated counties . These fences are the most economical and convenient ones possible for the farmer , hut to the horseman they oppose a very treacherous and break-neck hindrance . A horse will run full tilt against one without seeing it , and the consequences may be easily imagined . Long before wire fences came into general use , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some ornamental grounds , near which the hounds met on the occasion referred to , and one of the sportsmen undertook , for a small wager , to leap his horse over it . Foolishly , he turned his horse from a distance and galloped him at the wire , which tripped him up as he half rose to clear it , and man and horse // came heavily to the ground , not much hurt , hut coiled and tangled up in a very remarkable , not to say ludicrous , way , with wire fence . Besides the larger establishments for hunting , there are , in many parts of the country , private packs of hounds kept on a smaller scale , and with these there is often excellent sport . As with the great establishments , everybody is welcome to join them in the field , and the greatest courtesy is always shown to strangers . Sometimes small subscription packs called " scratch " packs are to he met with . In these no particular attention is paid to the breeding and matching of the hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they generally manage to do their work very well . Hare-hunting , although it resembles fox-hunting in its general features , yet varies from it in many respects , owing to the difference in the nature of the two animals , and to various other causes . Unlike the fox , the hare does not run far across country in a straight line , but tries to baffle her pursuers by doubling , as well as by many ingenious little stratagems peculiar to herself . Sometimes she will manage to get back on her own tracks , for instance , thereby greatly puzzling the hounds , who not unfrequently are discovered to be running from instead of after their game for a considerable distance . The English hare is of larbe size , nearly twice as large as the common one of this country , and different from it in many respects . Depending altogether on its speed for safety , it frequently lies out in the open country far away from any cover or place of refuge , and it never runs into the ground . When lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealing itself that it will sometimes escape the notice even of the most practised eyes . Sometimes it squats in a furrow of a newly ploughed field , and you may never see it until you have almost touched it with your feet , when it is up and off with such wonderful speed that it is out of sight before you have had time to think about it . It is quite a common thing - I have seen it twenty times at least - for a hare to spring up in the very middle of a pack of hounds engaged in beating a field , jump clear over every hound that makes a snap at her , get cleverly away , and beat them all in the long run . Were it not for a certain consciousness of cruelty in pursuing and worrying an animal so timid and harmless as the hare , one might say that the sport of hare-hunting is , in some respects , more fascinating than the chase of the fox . There is more of hunting proper in it , though less of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more scientific sport of the two . Sometimes , when poor puss is very hard pressed by the hounds , after a long and harassing run , when all her ingenious little wiles and tactics and stratagems have gone for nothing , and all hope has deserted her , she will give way to the most piteous cry I have ever heard from any creature . It is her death-cry , for the hounds are then*just upon her , and in a moment there will be nothing seen of her but some flying tufts of fur . The hounds used for the chase of the hare are smaller than fox-hounds , and not nearly so fast . They do not depend upon their speed for killing a hare , but run down their prey by sheer perseverance and by giving it no time to rest ; and their cry is far more musical than that of the fox-hound . Sometimes old hares are to be met with that have grown gray in the cause of sport , having managed to baffle the hounds for many seasons . In some parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - such hares as these are supposed by the country people to be gifted with supernatural qualities , and I have been in many a district where " the witch hare " was spoken of by the superstitious peasants with something like awe . In the hare-hunting districts there is a class of men called " harefinders . " They are usually idle , shiftless fellows of the poacher type , very sharp in all matters concerning game animals and sport . These men roam over the // fields and by the hedges early in the morning , in the neighborhood where the harriers are to meet . By long practice , added to natural acuteness of sight , they are able to see the hare as she squats on her " form , " - the term used by sportsmen for the spot where a hare flattens herself out to elude observation . One of these men will come to the huntsman , and tell him that he has marked a hare and can bring him to the spot . In Ireland this is called " sohoing " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A subscription is got up for the finder , who goes forward and puts the hare up some distance in advance of the hounds ; and thus a good hunt may be obtained without any expenditure of time in beating the fields and hedges for the game . Long ago , but still within the present century , dwarf hounds known as " basket beagles " were often used for hunting hares . They were so called , because , to save them from unnecessary fatigue , they used to be driven to the place of meeting in a large creel placed upon a cart . The music of these little fellows is said to have been far superior to that of any hounds of the present day . Deer-hunting , as now practised to some small extent in Great Britain , is not to be compared as a sport with the chase of either the fox or the hare . I do not here speak of the kind of sport pursued in the highlands of Scotland , - a fine , wild , manly sport , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer there being run down with a sort of large greyhound , or shot with the rifle . The kind of deer-hunting to which I refer is rather a substitute for fox-hunting than otherwise , and has about it a certain amount of tameness , from the manner of its preparation and arrangements . The deer serving for this kind of sport is either the large red-deer or the ordinary fallow-deer of the English parks . It is ' taken to the place of meeting in a huge wooden box on wheels , where it is uncarted when the proper time comes and given a certain number of minutes , " law , " to get away before the hounds are laid on . Sometimes the animal , perfectly familiar with a scene so often before enjoyed , declines altogether to segregate himself from the gay throng , and turns his attention to testinb the succulent qualities of whatever herbabe may be within his reach . He is usually got off at last , however , and men who think more of riding than of hunting frequently get satisfactory sport with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insipid one now , as I have said , has long been considered as a " royal " one . And so it is that her Majesty 's buck-hounds are still maintained as a regular " institution , " and the position of " Master of the BuckHounds " is continued as a high office . Otter-hunting is only a local sport in the British Islands ; the otter being scarce now , and confined to particular districts . The hounds used for hunting this creature are of a peculiar breed , somewhat resembling small foxhounds , with a strain of the Skyeterrier in them , - ragged-looking fellows , with hairy muzzles and rough coats . Of course , horses are not used in the pursuit of the otter , which trusts for safety chiefly to its superior powers of swimming and diving . The otterhunters carry spears , and the sport in general has a sort of savage association about it , carrying one back to the skinclad javelin-men of ancient times . Firm of muscle and sound of digestion are those old English fox-hunters , who pass half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before breakfast , and live on the best of beef , bread , and port - wine . Recently some two or three specimens of this class have passed away , leaving to the providers of " Nimrod literature " a mine of wealth in the way of biographical reminiscence and anecdote . Among these departed heroes of the hunting-field was the late Sir Tatton Sykes , whose breakfast on a hunting morn , as described by his biographer , was a wonder in its way . Taking a shoulder of cold roast mutton , he would cut it into great " chunks , " and these he would immerse , fat and all , in a huge bowl of milk . To this he would add a goodsized // apple-pie , cut up in pieces to suit , and then he would make short work of the mess with a spoon . I have no desire to combat modern theories on the subject of gastronomy and the hygiene of food , but I will add that Sir Tatton Sykes was never known to have had a day 's illness during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or thereabouts , when he " went toearth.
