17*e Andes . THE ANDES . Tun Andes , like a vast wall , extend along the western coast of South America . Woods cluster , like billows of foliage , around the feet of the mountains . A vast network of intersecting streams is woven by the gigantic warp and woof of these mountains . Many brooks , stealing along , scarcely heard , over the table-lands , and many fierce torrents , dashing wildly through rocky crevices , fill the great streams that roll , some into the Caribbean Sea , some into the near Pacific ; while one , the mighty Amazon , stretches across the continent for more than three thousand miles , and swells the Atlantic with the torrents of the Andes . The keel of a vessel entering the Amazon from the Atlantic , may cut through waters that once fell as flakes of snow on the most western ridges of the Andes , and glistened with the last rays of the sun as he sank in the Pacific . A spell of fascination hangs about the Amazon . Its wonders , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered in its exploration give a throb of interest to its very name . How terrible were the sufferings of Gonzalo Pizarro and his companions , who set forth in youth and vigor to explore the valley of the Amazon I How worn and haggard the survivors returned to Quito , leaving some of the daring cavaliers of Spain to bleach in death on the wild plain , or to moulder in the lonely glen I No river has sadder chronicles of suffering and danger than the Amazon . Still , the exploration , so hazardous , yet of such vast value , will go on . Many a hero in the great war with nature will follow the track of Herndon , the noble man as well as the brave explorer , who escaped the perils of the great river , only to sink , with his manly heart , into the great deep . In science as in war , ranks after ranks may fail ; but the living press on to fill the vacant places . The squadrons are ever full and eager for service . To search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities from the graves of centuries , men will advance as heroically as an army moves to the capture of Chapultepec . Not a flower can breathe forth its fragrance , though in marshes full of venomous serpents and of as deadly malaria , but science will count its leaves , and copy with unerring pencil the softest tints that stain them with varied bloom and beauty . Science will detect every kind of rock in the structure of the most defiant crag . N*t a bird can chant or build its nest in the most leafy shade , but science will find the nest , describe every change of color on the feathers of the little singer , and set to music every tone that gushes from its tiny throat . Not a gem can repose safe from seizure , in the rocks , in the sand , or in the torrent . Not a star can twinkle in the abyss of night , but science will tell its rate of light , and describe its silent and mysterious orbit . Torrid heat , the earthquake , the tornado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will dare them all , to know one more law of nature . God speed the daring of science , if only her votaries will not place the law in the place of Him who made both it and the works which it was commissioned to guide . Science , when she has found the highest and the most comprehensive law of nature , has not touched Deity itself ; she has but touched the hem of the garment of the Great Lawgiver . One veteran of science , Alexander von Humboldt , has yielded to the great law of humanity , as inexorable as any that he found in nature . His researches in South America , though mainly confined // to the valley of the Oronoco , were most thorough , and his array of facts and observations are of inestimable value . Yet , Humboldt searched into nature with the coldness of the anatomist , content with examining its material structure , rather than with the zeal of one who seeks images of Divine power impressed alike on solid rocks and gliding streams . Science , however rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Author of creative energy and grandeur , bursting forth irrepressibly in scenes where angels would have adored the Great First Cause , and where man can do no less . Humboldt 's fame as an observer is founded on a rock which no mortal power can shake . He lacked the reverential insight into the higher and deeper powers of nature , but , so far as his mental eyes saw , he described surely and vividly the manifestations of those powers . He was an observer of wonderful skill in the outer courts of nature , though he seemed either not to seek or to be bewildered in seeking her interior shrine . He exemplified rather the talent than the geniu* of discovery , the patient sagacity which accumulates materials , rather than the fervid enthusiasm which traces the stream of nature 's action to its spring , the great Creative Will . Yet , the very title of Humboldt 's great work , the concentrated fruit of a life of toil , Cosmos , ' meaning beauty and order , and , then , the visible world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling above the spirit of material research . His warmest admirer could have respecting him no worthier hope than that he , who has left the scene of earthly beauty which he so long and diligently studied , may have had the joy to discern , in the sphere of celestial order , the Cosmos of the skies , higher and deeper truths than external nature can teach . An American artist , Church , has portrayed with great force and beauty some portions of the inspiring scenery of the Andes . Church 's pictures are avowedly compositions , and not transcripts of actual views ; yet , they are not more remarkable for ideal beauty than for truthfulness to nature . Although no real scenes among the Andes correspond to his painting , yet the glorious characteristics of the Andes are seen in every line , in every color , in all the strange lights and shadows of his paintings . Imagination , which sees at once the powers and proportions of things , is , when joined to a feeling heart , the surest guide to him who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of mater*ial forms . The realists of art may not be so well satisfied with a composition , as with the delineation , line by line , and point by point , of a scene in nature ; yet the more comprehensive critic will own that universality will gain by the composition far more than local identity can lose . By his imaginative skill , Church has portrayed in two or three pictures those characteristics of scenery which , to be faithfully delineated in copies from actual views , would require a hundred paintings . This is alike his best defence and his highest praise . In recalling my own observations among these noble mountains , and in striving to express them in language , I feel how much higher is the vantage ground of the painter . One may examine for hours the canvas , until every scene is fixed on the memory as on the canvas itself . Yet I will endeavor to give a general view of the scenery of the stupendous Andes-stupendous truly , yet among those mountains are scenes of such quiet beauty as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred miles from the Pacific Ocean arise some of the highest peaks of the Andes , yet the way upward is much longer . From the coast , or from the decks of ships sailing by it , may be seen , in clear weather , some of the peaks of the mountains . On the shores , hazes and mists often tempet // the tropical sun and obscure distant objects ; but , at early morning and evening , sometimes the great snowy dome of Chimborazo may be seen afar , towering in majesty above the tropical verdure between its base and the ocean . It looks as if invading the heavens with its colossal form ; and at such times it wears a vesture of glory . A few years ago , in New England , of a clear night in the depth of winter , an aurora of the north reddened the whole sky ; and the earth beneath , covered with snow , was as red as the sky above . Imagine such an aurora to fall upon the snowy summit of a mountain four miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush of beauty upon the brow of Chimborazo at suurise and at sunset . Turn from the broad Pacific , as its long waves glance in the sun ; and , as the morning tide washes up the tropical rivers , go with it along one of them , a part of the wa* perhaps , in a sailing vessel or a steamer , but the rest in a light canoe . Tropical shrubbery and forests line the banks of the stream . New forms and modes of life impress the traveller from the temperate zone . The scenery of the tropics , so long the wonder of the imagination , now expands in wild luxuriance before the sight . When you have gone as far as you can along the winding river , waiting , perhaps , for hours , here and there upon the bank , in some rude cabin , or under the shade of some broad fragrant tree , for the returning tide from the ocean to bear you swiftly on ; disembark upon a strange soil , and prepare to pursue your journey by mules or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark recesses by narrow paths , mere winding threads of road . Great clouds of foliage press around you , and , at the slightest breeze , thrill with that murmur of myriads of trees , which is so full of mystery and awe ; for there , the very forests , unbroken and unbounded , seem audibly to breathe together with mystical accord , and to blend low quivering tones with the grand chorus which swells daily upward from vales and mountains , seas and shores . Interspersed with the thick foliage , on every hand are blossoms and fruits of every tropical kind . Pale , white bridal blossoms clothe the orange tree , or golden fruit hangs among its clusters of glossy leaves . The starry rind and pale-green crown of the pineapple tempt you to enjoy the luscious fruit . High in air the cocoanut tree lifts its palmy diadem . The long broad leaves of the plantain protect its branches of green or yellow fruit , and throw a grateful shade upon the way , open here and there . Here is , indeed " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of blended fragrances . While the eye ranges , seeing trees , fruits , and flowers innumerable , of glorious hues and countless kinds , most never seen by you before , or at least only as exotics , the ear also takes in varied sounds . Birds are singing , insects humming ; every tree seems a choir , and the immeasurable forest a wide congregation of joyful voices . You are now on the lowest stage of that sublime gradation of climates and scenery displayed by the Andes . You cross it in two or three days ' journey ( for , as in the East , so , in the mountainous regions of South America , travelling is measured less by miles than by days ' journeys ) . You then arrive at the foot of one of the mountains . Stop and look up ! A ridge covered with forests to its very top stands steep before you . The wind makes tremulous the masses of evergreen foliage , which are now shaded by the reluctant mists of the morning , slowly ascending , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ridge rises another , and another yet , unseen at the foot . Begin the ascent . The mules tremble as they strive to keep their hold on the steep , slippery soil . Press upward in zigzag paths for hours . Reach the top of the ridge , and descend into the val // ley between it and another higher opposite ; then , ascend again . As you thus slowly , patiently , yet surely reach the heart of the mountainous region , wild diversity of views holds you bound in wonder and strange delight . Here are level places-here pure , bright brooks glide on as smoothly as in meadows . There , a torrent rushes over crags , foaming and roaring in an everlasting cascade . Before you may be a hillside , green with luxuriant pasturage , where flocks and herds graze quietly through the day , while the shepherd , with his crook and harmonic pipe , reminds you of classic scenes . Turn aside  --  and you may look down into cavernous recesses , whose gloomy depths you can not measure . Scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in life , the gentle charities , that , like the face of Una , make sunshine in the shady place , are often found not far from rugged rage and black despair . Press on through glad and sombre scenery . Press upward in steep ways , miry and craggy , narrow and broad , by turns . Now , so deep are the paths cut in the mountain , so high are the banks , so contracted is the way , that , the higher you rise , the less you appear to see ; and you feel disappointed at missing the grind horizon of smaller mountains , on which , coming nearer the summit , you expected to look ; but now , a shout of exultation breaks from your lips ; and well it may . A new Pacific Ocean seems to expand before you , as if by some sudden enchantment . It is an ocean of constant verdure and inexhaustible fertility , spreading far , far below you , as far as you can see , on every side but that from which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view . The seeming ocean is the first table land , whose soft , green undulations fill the horizon , though , when the sky is clear , the snowy mountains may be seen far away , dazzling the heavens and the earth with their brightness . Spring and autumn here join hands , consecrating the double seedtime and the double harvest of the year . Yonder is a field of ripened grain . And there is the Indian laborer , near his cabin of thatch and clay , guiding the rude ploughshare through the fertile soil . Descend the mountain , and , crossing that sea of beauty , ascend the mountains beyond . The scenes , just now all soft and pleasing , give way to others which unite the lovely and the severe . Look upward . There rises a mountain , so gently curving and so green , so alluring with its light and shade , that it seems the very emblem of graceful majesty , looking as if it must know its wondrous beauty , and as calm as if no wind strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet near , in vivid contrast , stands a craggy peak , towering up , up , toward the deep blue sky , so broken and so black that it seems like the very Giant Despair of mountains , frowning with unearthly fierceness upon his gentle neighbor , who returns his grim looks with meek and placid trust . Where whirlwinds and tempests await the signal for howling desolation , stands the beautiful colossal image of sublime serenity . Again , steep , rocky roads lead over rugged cliffs . Your horses climb panting , and descend , picking their steps , upon the other side . Stop awhile on this green space , a valley between two high ridges . Countless flowers spread fragrance and beauty around . They are not those alone of the strictly tropical level , but , owing to the height above the sea , the floral wealth of the temperate zone is embosomed in the torrid region itself , and adds the charm of an almost magical diversity to the intrinsic splendors of the scene . See small objects ffitting about from flower to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummingbirds , nowhere found but in America . Watch their colors , changing with every changing motion , purple , crimson , golden , green . It is as if the very flowers had // taken life , and were revelling with conscious glee in the soft , bright air . The hues of these birds are dazzlingly bright . The little creatures glance about like prismatic rays embodied in the smallest visible forms . After gazing upon these hummingbirds with joy as great as theirs , as they revel like fairies in the profusion of this flowery valley , look upward on the high , grand ridges that close it in . What suddenly starts from the very top of yon cliff , and floats in the air , high , high , above you ? It is the great condor , expanding his broad wings , wheeling in flight from ridge to ridge , curving with majestic motion , now poising himself upon his wings , now apparently descending , now suddenly but gracefully turning upward , until his lessening shape has gone beyond the farthest reach of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep ; rocky ridges inaccessible to man or beast ; brooks that quiver gently on ; impetuous torrents ; the beauty of Eden and craggy desolation like that of chaos-these all can you see among the Andes . Let not the fascination of this valley , the songs of birds , the flowers , the hummingbirds glistening among them like gems , the soft outlines of the scenery detain you long . Harder and sterner scenes await you . The Andes are a picture of life . Every cliff records a lesson ; and the unnumbered flowers interweave with their varied dyes and rich perfumes gentle suggestions , sweet similitudes for the understanding and the heart . If , as in this charming valley , the senses may be dissolved in joy , and the spirit would linger willingly in rapt delight , soon some hard experience , kindly sent , requires one to brace all manly energy for the rough encounter , the blast of peril , and duty 's steep and craggy road . You ascend in narrowing ways , casting long , lingering looks upon the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ridges are so near together that the shrubbery from the top of each joins in an arch overhead . There , you pass along by the side of a mountain , in a path which affords scarcely room for a single horseman , and where he who enters the close deffie , shouts aloud , and , if the first , thus gains a right of way through , and parties on the other side , hearing the shout , must wait their turn . Now , you leave for a while the narrow road , and descend upon a beautiful table land , bounded on the sides by parallel but distant mountains ; and the open places reveal fertile plains in far perspective . Light streams through the wide , clear space in a golden tide of splendor . Again , you are partly surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills , rising in gradations , and of such impressive magnitude and extent that one might imagine that here the secret forces of nature are wont to take bodily shape , to look on the grand tragic storms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side , the mountains subside into soft undulations ; on the other , the ridges are colossal , dark , and broken , and along the edges of their successive summits is a line of snow , varying with the line of the cliffs , and glittering like burnished silver in the sun , above the jagged battlements . The deep blue sky , the shining snow , the huge , dark , rocky bases , the different shades of color harmoniously blending , the soft and rugged shapes contrasting vividly-well may impress the soul with pleasure-relieving awe , with aweennobling pleasure . Dismount awhile for rest . Enter this rude , thatched house by the wayside , on a level spot . Laden mules pass by in crowds , attended by Indian drivers , each of whom doffs his hat and blesses you  --  a mere ceremony , it may be , but one in picturesque keeping with the scenery . Invigorated by the breeze , the shade , the rest , prepare to go higher , higher , higher yet . First , pluck some of these roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the line // of snow that never melts , you may place upon the cold bosom of perpetual wintsr these blushing symbols of perpetual spring . Again , you reach the edge of a cliff* through the deep , narrow valley between which and the cliff opposite pours a furious torrent , which , resounding louder and louder as it is approached , now drowns all other sounds in its despotic roar . But , fearful as it looks , it must be crossed . Some of these torrents are spanned by bridges ; but most of them are so impetuous , especially in the rainy season , that bridges even of stone would be undermined , and those of timber would be swept away like wisps of straw . You must now trust to the sagacity of your mules or horses . You descend the precipitous side of the cliff ; seeming to yourself as if about to fall headlong into the torrent ; but after a painful and perilous jaunt , you reach its level . Its roar now confuses and nearly stuns you . Each side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of the furious tide , while jutting rocks above seem just ready to be loosened by some convulsion , and to crush you with their merciless weight : meantime , your horse stands unmoved by the peril before or above him , apparently deaf to the noise of the torrent , and quietly surveys the rapids , as if to select the safest point to cross . Disturb him not . He takes his time , and places one foot and then another in the torrent . As he reaches the main current , he trembles , not with fear , but with the effort to keep himself from being swept against the rocks . He may be able to keep his footing and to walk across , though panting and shaking at every step ; or the stream may be so deep that he is forced to swim . If so , he bears up manfully ( if one may say so ) against the rushing force , and at last scrambles up the least steep peak of the opposite bank , bearing you more dizzy than he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ridge as precipitous as that which you descended to reach the stream . Quietly , patiently* surely the horse ascends . A sudden misstep or unwary slip among the loose stones of the path would send you far backward into the torrent which you have just escaped . This very seldom happens , for the horses and mules have been well trained for the service . In all the perils , the horse or mule is a safer guide than you . Give him a free rein , and he will bear you up the hardest , roughest , steepest places . You are now high among the Andes , far above every sign of tropical vegetation ; and , although hourly you are approaching the equatorial line , yet hourly also it is growing colder . Look up ! A snowy peak rises directly before you , and seems to challenge you with its refulgent , inaccessible majesty . The sight at first almost appals , but fascinates . The feeling of fear soon surrenders to absorbing enjoyment of the sublimity of the scene . The more you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain , a single glance at which repays all the fatigue and danger of the road ; - there it stands , as high above the Pacific Ocean as if Vesuvius should be piled upon itself again , and again , and yet again . Clear snow covers it with a robe of dazzling light . The snowy peak , though it seems so near in the pure atmosphere , is a weary distance off . As you advance slowly and laboriously upward , the wind blows almost like a hurricane . You can hardly breast its force . It grows colder and colder . Here , on the equator , man may freeze to death . Bear a stout heart and a firm face against the cold and the wind . Now it is too steep even for the horses and mules of the Andes . You are ascending toward the snowy peak whose alluring brightness has charmed the long way , since you saw it first . Dismount and climb as you can among the rocks . The glittering snow is near . You pant as if you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them laid out with care and beauty ; and the fruit trees of the temperate zone may here be cultivated ; but the great forests of the tropical- level and the pines of the mountains are absent . The Paramo8 are sandy plains , in fact , mountain deserts , in the dry season liable to great droughts , and in the wet season to fearful snowstorms . The armies of Independence , during the wars between Spain and South America , suffered terrible hardships and exposures in the Paramos . The Pampas are wide and level plains , not so high as the table lands , where graze innumerable herds of wild cattle . They are beyond the ranges of mountains , in the more central parts of South America . There are none west of the Andes . The table lands complete the sublime varieties of the scenery . Their serenity enchants , as the grandeur of the mountains that rise above them exalts the mind . The works of nature are not only adapted to human need with Omniscient skill , as these fertile lands among the sterner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are excited by the combinations , of Infinite Power . The emotion of awe , being one of great concentration , becomes even painful , if the tension of the mind be too long sustained ; and so He who tempers the ineffable splendor of His immediate presence even to the gaze of angels , with the rainbow of emerald about his throne , with the sea of crystal , the tree of life , or the gates of precious stones , also soothes the sublimity of mountains with gentle traits of scenery and soft gradations of color which give enjoyment more passive than awe , and rather captivate than overpower the eye and soul . From the table lands can often be seen in the distance snow-covered tops of mountains , projected in bold , white outlines against the deep-blue sky ; and there the sky is really blue , not of that pale tinge that often passes for it , but of a deeper blue than even the rich Oc tober sky of North America . As if joining the sky , are the shining summits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus meet in dazzling harmony . Sometimes so many of these white , towering heights can be seen , and in so different quarters , that one may almost fancy the sky itself to be a vast dome of sapphire supported by gigantic pillars of marble . Most of the cities , villages , and farms are on thete table lands . Often , for the sake of the grand view , a villa is built on a steep ridge , within sight of the broad , undulating surface of some plateau ; or , in some position of peerless beauty , the glittering cross on some convent may be seen . The Spanish race appreciate the picturesque , as is shown by their choice of sites , not only in Spain , but in Spanish America . The poetical , imaginative character which has marked Spanish annals for centuries , still marks those who have any claim to Spanish descent . The South American , though half an Indian , recognizes the grandeur of his native mountains , and the beauty of the broad , fertile valleys , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , would calculate whether or not the torrent that rushes foaming and glittering down the mountain is too steep to serve a mill , or whether the smaller mountains might not be levelled for building lots ; or he would gaze upon some beautiful table land with wonder indeed , but with wonder chiefly how much wheat or barley there grows to the acre , or can be made to grow . The table lands produce the grains and fruits of the temperate zone ; and , accordingly , proprietors who own , as many do , estates on the tropical and on the temperate level , may supply their tables with fruits from their own grounds , for which , in other countries , the world must be brought under contribution . The soil is cultivated mainly by Indians . Descendants of the ancient rulers of the land now till the fields of the descendants of the conquerors . // Some , indeed , representing more or less the Indian part of the population , are owners of estates ; yet a full Indian rarely has lands of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer of water , tills the fields , and performs most of the drudgery of the country . More South Americans of Indian descent , out of the general population , have gained honor and power than could possibly have done so under the confined and absolute sway of the Incas . The Indians of all Spanish America have progressed , however slowly and rudely , in the arts , labors , culture , and faith of Christian civilization , and , in the aggregate , are in advance of the Indians of AngloAmerica . Let the imagination survey the whole range of the Andes for their vast extent of sixty degrees of latitude . On every level space are seen the signs of culture and human habitation , fields green with the early grain , or yellow with the harvest . The roads now wind through forests of constant shade , even under the burning sun of the equator ; now they turn with gentle windings , or with steep abruptness , while below spread bright and beautiful lands , and interesting the more because associated with th' homes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of man 's abode will be gratefuL No one , indeed , whose soul has not been warped out of all . likeness to the Divine image which it once wore , can regard without abhorrence such intrusions of noisy machinery into scenes of natural sublimity as , for instance , have desecrated the neighborhood of Niagara Falls , and which would have done so yet more , but for the energetic and foreverpraiseworthy resistance of the proprietors of adjacent grounds ; as if Amencii , with her thousands of miles of rivers , and almost infinite number of rapid , unfailing brooks , had not mill privileges enough , without daring to insult the Divine Majesty by wresting the Falls of Niagara from their true design . The spirit of gain , which has been eager , though-thanks be to God - it has not been able to spoil the natural glory of Niagara , is vile , degraded , base enough to sell a mother 's dying gift for gold , or to seize , if it had the power , the jewelled gates of the New Jerusalem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , though the presence of that sacrilegious materialism , of that practical blasphemy , which defies creative Deity at the very shrines where its infinite power is most wonderfully displayed , is a plague spot , a malignant sign of spiritual leprosy , which warns all to beware of its vile contagion ; yet , the suggestions of rural toil , the sight of tilled fields , the cottage , the shepherd and his flock , are all harmonious with nature , even in her grandeur ; for they show that the glorious wonders of earth were given , not , indeed , to be distorted , but to be enjoyed by man ; and even the stupendous mountain derives a new charm from the reflection that it may minister daily to the elevation of the soul , while the benign fertility of the valley sustains the natural life . How pleasantly these villages nestle upon the breasts of the mountains , as if there to find shelter from the stormy blast I Trains of mules , attended by their drivers , whose shrill shouts echo among the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the coast , or with goods from other lands , Other trains descend , laden with grain and the fruits of the temperate zone , from the higher districts . Well-guarded mules bear bars of precious silver from the mountain mines for the currency of the world , or to rende* dazzling service on the tables of nobles and kings in foreign lands . Look upon the gorgeous clouds above you , as if the snowy Andes were soaring heavenward ; reach higher points and look upon shining clouds far below , as if the same snowy mountains had descended to bow in meek devotion . The llama , the delicate beast of burden , sometimes called the Feruvian cnxael , // with gently curving neck , moves gracehilly on , turning often and quickly , from side to side , mild , plaintive eyes , as if entreating pity . The cascade glances like a streak of silver from the mountain at your side ; in the valley you see the sweet , calm lake , or you hear the torrent , sounding among shadowy woodlands , never weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look abroad on the vast , snowy heights that appear in the horizon ; - then let the mind 's eye ' look beyond the horizon , and behold similar peaks stretching three thousand miles along . Then bend reverently before Him who has made earth so grand . Go to the galleries of Rome and Florence . It is wise to gather new beauty to the soul from works of art , and to study the exquisite graces which the great masters have gathered from nature and delineated in glowing canvas or in lasting marble ; yet , here is a gallery of paintings by the Great Master and Author of all sublimity and beauty in heaven and earth , extending , not from room to room of buildings made with hands and roofed with cedar , but from hall to hall of nature 's colossal cathedral , roofed by the infinite sky . Look at these pictures , ever changing , yet ever grand , of majestic mountains , of reposing valleys , of fertile plains , of rural homes , of streams and waterfalls , of vast forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise , sunset , and the glittering moon . What a marvellous variety in the objects portrayed ! What surprises at every turn ! Colors more brilliant than Titian or AIlsto*i could combine , join in harmonious effect on every side , and grace and vigor , beauty and grandeur , are blended in every scene and almost in every outline . Would you examine the famous statues of the world , and admire the symmetry of form and power of expression drawn forth by human skill from the hard , white stone ? Or will the fragments of ancient art give delight for their expres sive beauty , visible though in broken forms ? Behold here a gallery of statuary , a line of divine masterpieces , whiter than Parian marble , wrought by the AnCIEI%TT or ' DAYs . ' Will you admire Michael Angelo 's colossal Day and Night ' ? and revere the mortal genius that can-so impress the soul ?
