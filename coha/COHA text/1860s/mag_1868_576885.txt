THE NATIONAL FINANCES . PHILOSOPHIC METHOD IN FINANCE . Tail principle enunciated by Herbert Spencer , that every cause produces more than one effect , and each effect is the product of many causes , is nowhere so important as in political economy and national finance , the highest departments of social science , which is the sum of all the sciences . To consider all the causes of an abnormal financial condition which applies to 40,000,000 of people during and after a gigantic war , and all the effects of the remedies proposed , is a herculean task ; yet our investigations will have value , and our criticisms and recommendations can have weight , only as this is done . Gold , like a fevered pulse , ranges at 140 and upwards . Our dollar of aCcount and exchange , in which our national and all private debts are estimated , and which our greenbacks and banknotes represent , is depreciated , as compared with the currency of the world , to about seventy cents . The financial problem is , how can all these debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , be made worth par in gold ? how can the Government and country resume specie payments , and our normal financial condition be restorcd ? THE CAUSES OF DEPRECIATION . Were we to trace the history of the rise and fall of the premium on gold throughout the suspension of specie payments in England during her wars with Napoleon , and in the United States during the rebellion , it would be found that gold rose with military disaster , and fell with success , more powerfully and exactly than with any and all o*aer causes , and that these circumstances controlled the depreciation in paper more than all other influences combined . In 1862 , under the influence of Burnside 's successes in North Carolina , and Grant 's in Kentucky , and Farragut 's at New Orleans , gold stood at a nominal premium of 110 , until McClellan 's disasters on the Chickahominy , and the ill success of Burnside and Hooker with the army of the Potomac , raised the premium to 140 . In 1863 , under the influence of Grant 's victories at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gettysburg , gold did not materially advance . In 1864 , the military and financial crisis of the war , when 1,200,000 new men were required , and $1,400,000,000 additional debt were incurred , and Grant 's costly campaign before Richmond had not yet resulted in success , and Sherman 's triumph in Georgia seemed uncertain , and the Democratic party of the North declared the war for the Union a failure , gold reached 285 , and the bonds and notes of the United States were worth only thirty-eight cents on the dollar . In 1865 , on the surrender of the rebel armies , though our currency was more expanded than ever before , though the amount of our debt was greater , and though , during the preceding four years , $130,000,000 more gold had been exported than we had produced , gold fell to 128 ; in other words , our bonds and currency had advaned from 38 cents to 75-thus proving that neither expansion of currency , amount of debt , or scarcity of gold , are to be compared as causes of depreciation with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic efforts for its overthrow , and the prospect for a time of their success . When , by the fall of the rebellion , the permanency and undisputed dominion of the Government were vindicated , exactly three fourths of the premium on gold disappeared , the other fourth remaining to indicate the proportion of the prelnium which could be ascribed to other causes than distrust in the ability of the Government , viz. , the expansion of our currency , the scarcity of gold , the balance of foreign trade 612 May , // against us , and the dangers of voluntary repudiation by the people . ABSURDITY OF CONTRACTION AS A PANACEA . The theory that contraction of the currency alone can remove the premium on gold , or restore specie payments , is open to a logical reductio ad alsurdum . It claims to be based on the general doctrine put forth by Adam Smith , John Stuart Mill , and other political economists , that the value of a currency , whether paper or gold , decreases as its volume increases , and vice-versd . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( supposing it to be disconnected financially with all other countries ) , and this amount be reduced to $200,000,000 by destroying half of it , the purchasing power of the remaining $200,000,000 will be exactly doubled , all prices will be reduced , and the remaining $200,000,000 will perform the same functions , as a currency , as the whole previously performed . But both Smith and Mill teach that currency derives its purchasing power , not from the total property of a country , but only from the quantity offered for sale . Whatever the quantity of money offered for goods , is the value of the goods ; and whatever the quantity of goods offered for money , is the value of the money . To diminish by half the quantity of currency , will diminish by half the price of the goods immediately offered ; i.e. , the first sales which follow the diminution will feel the sacrifice , while , as the effects of the contraction diffuse over a greater mass of property , they become less . Thus , when our currency depreciated , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of those things offered for sale or in the market . Exports and imports , surplus and perishable products , rose in nominal price first ; real estate late , last , or not at all . The amount of property in this country , as assessed , being 17,000 millions , and the amount of currency only 700 millions , to suppose that a contraction of one half in the currency would diminish by one half the prices of the entire property of the country , is to suppose that a reduction of $350,000,000 in the dimensions of one of the instruments with which we do business , viz. , paper-money , would occasion a diminuton of 8,500 millions in the prices of all others  --  a preposterous absurdity . ROW FAR CONTRACTION OF CURRENCY INCREASES ITS vALUE . A contraction of the currency has a tendency to increase its value , but the destruction of $250,000,000 in currency can only add the purchasing power which was formerly possessed by that bulk of currency to something else . It can not add twice or thrice or a hundred times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we reflect that , in the destruction or withdrawal of $250,000,000 of currency , its purchasing power is diffused evenly , or nearly so , over all the other promises of the Government , i. e. , over the whole National debt , it is evident that , instead of adding fifty per cent , to the remainder , as it would if the currency were the only quantity involved in the problem , it will add only about ten per cent . TilE QUESTION STATED . The problem presented to the American financial Statesman is , Given our debt , with the taxation it involves and the resources we have , by what modes can we best return to specie payments ? If any are disposed to ask when we may return to specie payments , the an*-swer belongs to the more exalted domain of prophecy-which we decline to enter . If three fourths of the causes of depreciation are to be found in the typhoid condition of the Gover*nent credit , as shown in the sale of its bonds , then three fourths of the cure lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOVERNMENT AND THE J3USINR5S PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE . The latter is the foundation the former the superstructure . By this standard every measure aiming at a resumption of s* ecie payments is to be tested . The test for every plan for re // sumption must be , Will it raise the gold-price of the bonds of the United States from 75 cents on the dollar to 90 or 92 , or par ? If so , then our currency will stand at par also , and specie payments will resume themselves . If not , then it will have no tendency to restore specie payments . TILE REMEDIES PILOPOSED. - MR . ShERMAN 'S FUNDING BILL . The most prominent measure yet proposed for adjusting our finances , though not ostensibly aiming to effect our restoration to specie payments , is embodied in the report and bill of the Senate Committee on Finance . As originally presented , it proposed to fund the whole debt into bonds running nominally at six per cent. , but subject to a tax of one per cent. , which was to be distributed among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " dodge ' * to stop the clamor of repudiationists in favor of taxing National bonds . This feature has been wisely omitted . It at first also proposed that a portion of the consolidated loan should be issued payable in foreign coin at foreign capitals , so as to render it exclusively salable in Europe . This doubtful feature is also omitted . As thus emasculated , it isa proposition to issue bonds payable in coin in forty years , and redeemable in ten years , with interest in coin at five per cent. , quarterly , exempt from taxation . The holders of the existing 5.20s are expected to exchange their six per cent , bonds for these five per cents. , under the threat that , if they refuse , the 5.20s will be paid in depreciated greenbacks instead of in coin . This is the same impolicy pursued by the Rebel Gov*'nment , in compelling the holders of Confederate notes to exchange them for four per cent , bonds . It is an effort , by partial repudiation , to coerce the creditors of the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay six . Its tendency to injure the Government credit , by branding it with dishonor , is indisputable ; for the Government can as easily alloy and debase the " coin ' * in which this bill proposes to pay the new bonds , as it could resolve to pay the old bonds in depreciated promises to pay . It agrees to pay them in coin , but not in coin of specific weight and standard ; and if it should even legislate the question of its coin-dollars , it might still debase the standards of weight and fineness so as to repudiate the same obligations a second or third time , No contract can satisfy the creditors of a convicted repudiator . A government which has once lied to its creditors , must pay a liar 's rate of interest for ever after , until it has learned the economy of honesty from the hardships of usury . It is astounding that leading statesmen , who ought to know the pecuniary value of honor to a national or an individual debtor in distress , should gravely propose financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to credit-its integrity . PARTIAL cONvERTIBILITy OF BONDS AND CURnENcv . The same bill has also a provision making the bonds convertible into greenbacks , and the greenbacks into bonds , provided that not more than $400,000,000 in all of greenbacks shall be issued , including those now out . The mischiefs of this clause are apparent . It is only when the bonds would be worth less than the greenbacks that holders would convert them into greenbacks ; and only when the greenbacks were worth less , that they would reconvert them into bonds . Each conversion would be a loss to the Government . Now , the holder of 5.20s can go into the market , and , by selling , convert them into greenbacks , and get seven or eight per cent . more than par for them . Under this bill he could only get par . " UNIFICATION " OF TEE DEBT . There remains of the Senate bill but one important element  --  the policy of reducing the diverse forms of the National debt to one form . No argument is offered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unifying the debt has been conceded by every one . " Such an assertion is rash // on its face , and does not consist with the very existence of these diverse forms of debt ; for if Chase and Fessenden , as Secretaries , found that they could not raise all the money they needed without resorting to many forms of loans to suit customers , it follows that lenders to the Government prefer different securities ; and if more money could be raised at lower rates during war by adapting the form of the loan to the needs of the lender , why is not the same true during peace ? Diverse forms have certain advantages ; they enable the Government always to work off the one most advantageous to itself . For some purposes a hundred-year loan at three per cent . might be preferred by purchasers to a tea-year loan at seven . It does not follow that , because unifying the debt would simplify it . to the student , it would render it more available to the lender , or lower the aggregate rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of woollen goods vastly to zeduce broadeloths , beavers , cassimeres , delaines , &amp;c. , to one article of one width at one price ; but the result would not be desirable to manufacturer or consumer . Until lenders all prefer one form of the debt , there would be no economy in converting the whole debt into that form . The diversity of the forms of our debt also causes our interest to come due in a continuous current rather than in sudden floods , which would involve the double evil of damming up many millions useless in the sub-treasury for long periods , and suddenly letting them loose in a deluge upon the money-market . Since the features omitted from this bill may return in other forms , they deserve discussion . THE FOHEIGN LOAN . It is possible that , while the American people remain too poor to own their debt , and a portion of it must be held abroad , it is desirable to place that portion in the form most attractive to foreign buyers , even though it would thereby be made less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at London , in thalers at Berlin or Hamburg , and in francs in Paris , might prove a successful manipulation in the absence of any profounder policy ; but statesmanship would aim at measures tending to enable the American people to own their entire debt at home . So much of our debt as we ourselves hold is no drain upon our national resources . It is like debts due from various members of the same household to each other , which burden some , and enrich others , but do not render the whole , as a family , richer or poorer ; but the debts they owe abroad mortgage the common homestead , and bring them into bondage to strangers . The more our bonds are held within ourselves , the more our taxes are paid to ourselves , the less the drain of gold and products to sustain foreign incomes , or * , " and the less the burden of the debt and the disposition tow*rds repudiation . The less these dangers and burdens , the higher will be the price of our bonds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , and the nearer specie payments . So far as a foreign loan would tend to add to our foreign debt , it would tend against our credit and against specie payments . TAXING THE HONDS . The proposal to distribute among the States one per cent , per annum of the entire National debt , adds one per cent. , or $20,000,000 , to the burden of the taxpayers , without in any way furthering the point it pretends to aim at , viz. , to equalize taxation between the hold ers of bonds and other property . The bondholder is still exempt from taxation , since the Supreme Court has t*ree times decided the attempt to tax *ational securities to be unconstitutional , even where they are not exempt by their terms . Since our present National bonds are expressly exempt by their terms , Congress has no power to authorize the States to tax them ; and to tax them itself is repudiation . The terms of the loan admit that the creditors can not be made to pay the tax . // They concede that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if subjected to one per cent , tax , will only be obtained at six . The bondholder , therefore , is not taxed , but simply charges one per cent . more interest on his loan , and that one per cent. , or $20,000,000 additional , is levied on those who are now taxpayers , in proportion to their taxable assets , and paid over to the several States in proportion to population . The whole complaint , that bondholders are exempt from taxation , still remains , and is only intensified by the fact that the burdens from which they are exempt are increased by $20,000,000 . This device is a deceit , and will not stand the ordeal of a political campaign , wherein it will be sifted by its opponents , and its hollowness exposed . AB5OL*TE CONYNUTIBILITY OF BONDS AND cURRENcY . That feature of the Senate bill which aim* to make the bonds and greenbacks mutually convertible , really constitutes a separate policy , which the Senate bill only imperfectly adopts . The Senate bill provides that any holder of 5.20 and consolidated bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pTovided that the total amount of notes so to be issued shall not exceed $400,000,000 . As there are already issued some $357,000,000 in United States notes , the limit above imposed reduces the range of this convertibility to the moderate sum of $43,000,000  --  a sum too small to have any serious effect , and of course too small to test the scheme of making the bonds and currency mutually convertible at par . In order to test the latter theory to the full extent , the Secretary of the Treasury must be authorized to issue bonds for greenbacks , and , viceversd , greenbacks for bonds , to any extent desired , i. e. , to the whole amount of the National debt . This would seem like authorizing the payment of the National debt in greenbacks . But , say its advocates , the people will not demand the greenbacks to any greater extent than the wants of business require . If they demand a surplus of greenbacks , money will be plenty , the rate of interest will fall , and the holders of greenbacks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , when money is in demand , and the rate of money rises above that paid by the Government , holders of the bonds would convert them into greenbacks . This calculation is based on two false assumptions . The first is , that the class of capitalists who hold bonds , and the class of business-men whose money moves commerce and buys our crops and merchandise , are the same . They are not . When business men want currency , they have not bonds to offer for it , but business-nbtes . And bondholders can always go into the market and convert their bonds into currency , with five to ten per cent . premium by sale . Until the Government is ready to pay out its own notes in exchange for notes of private parties , it can not , like the banks , relieve the money-market . The second false assumption is , that a plethora of paper-money lowers the rate of interest . This is probably true of actual money , i. e. , paper redeemable at par in gold . But it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its value lowers the rate of interest correspondingly . If it were , then , when the gold-value of our greenbacks during the war fell from 100 to 35 cents per dollar , the rate of interest ought to have fallen from six or ten to two or three-and-a-half per cent. , but it did not decline one iota . If , therefore , the issue of greenbacks for bonds to the amount of 500 or 1000 millions would tend to depreciate the value of the currency , the rate of interest would not be lowered ; and hence the force which the authors of the scheme rely on to convert the greeuback* back into bonds would fail . Very few notes would or could be converted into bonds , because there are few to convert , and the least conversion cramps the moneymarket , and checks further conversion . But the amount of bonds which would be convertible into notes is limited only by the amount of the public debt . The // moment the process had begun , the inflation would cause a rise in all prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly increasing presentation of bonds to the Government , until the whole National debt had been converted into greenbacks . This would reduce the notes to a merely nominal value , and would involve National disaster , bankruptcy , and repudiation . The proposition , so far from being new , has been once adopted in its best feature-that of making the notes convertible at pleasure into the bonds . Such a provision was enacted at the time of the first issue of $150,000,000 in legal-tender notes . But it was found that its effect was to prevent the bonds from bearing any premium over the currency , and it was repealed . Such a provision only enables the holders of currency to keep our bonds down to par in currency . It has no effect to raise the value of either bonds or currency , but to depress both . It is like an offer by a manufacturer of broadcloths and cassimeres , to exchange his broadcloths for cassimeres , and his cassimeres for broadcloths , at the option of dealers , without any corresponding right to effect an exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dealers would , always exchange that which was worth less for that which was worth most . Moreover , the agreement would amount to an offer by the manufacturer always to undersell his dealers ; for , if they offer either cloth for 5 cents ' less than it is worth , and sell at that rate , he must sell at the same rate , or ( the same ) supply the article sold . The dealers would soon run both kinds of cloth down to 0 . And under the scheme of mutual convertibility , the dealers in bonds and currency would do the same thing . The scheme of mutual convertibility is a sluiceway through which ' to convert the whole National debt into currency , with all the disasters attendant on that result . SENATOR MORRILL ' 5 PLAN OP REstTEPTION . Senator Morrill has the resumption of specie payments more distinctly in view ; he proposes to fix a certain date , say July 1 , 1869 , when the Government will resume ; in the meantime , that the Government issue notes payable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of gold-interest payable by the Government to the National Banks be held by them in reserve , so as to put them in better condition to resume then than now . An objection to this is , that , while the gold-notes will be at par with gold , every note so issued locks up the- gold it represents , or else subjects the Government to the same necessity of failing to pay its goldnotes that it is now under of failing to meet its greenbacks . Indeed , the greenbacks are gold-notes in form . They promise to pay " dollars , " and nothing but gold and silver coins are dollars . If the Government locks up a. coin for every note it issues , the note makes no difference whatever in our finances . 110w , then , are the Government and people to be in any better position to resume a year from now , . than they are now ? Senator MorrilPs plan does not satisfactorily answer .. The point aimed at in requiring the National Banks to hold their gold as a. reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to render the Banks . stronger to meet their obligations . But this mode of accomplishing that object seems entirely inadequate . A banking system properly organized will no more need a law requiring the bank -- er to keep a reserve , than an army properly commanded needs a law requiring its general to hold a certain portion of his army in reserve at all times . In the latter case , such a law ' would reduce the available strength of the army for battle to the forces exclu-* sive of the reserve . The effect of requiring a bank to hold a reserve for the ' security of its creditors is equally absurd . It is no security to creditors , , since it can not be applied to pay them except in the event of liquidation . It weakens the available funds with which the bank is to contend with a " run , * , ' by the amo , unt of the reserve . It is aa* // iibsurdity which only the interested ingenuity of bankers could invent to call any sum a security to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which he is forbidden by law to pay over . SENATOR HENDER5ON 5 NATIONAL BANKING AMENDMENT . Senator Henderson 's bill , which requires the National Banks to deposit with the Government $100 in bonds for every $75 in currency issued , is much better calculated to strengthen the National banking system . At present prices this very nearly bases every dollar of paper issued by the banks on the value of a gold dollar in bonds ; and if the banks were organiZed on this basis , they could return to specie payments , as gold should recede to par , without the loss of a single dollar on their bills . The adoption of this provision would enable the Government safely to repeal the clause of the Banking Act which limits the amount of currency to $300 ,  - -  000,000 , and to throw open the National banking business as a *ystem of free banking to all who choose to comply with such provisions as may be necessary to make their bills secure and re deemable . IMPORTANCE OF A FREE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM . The expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire demands of the country for paper-money , ought to be accompanied by the withdrawal , pan passu , of the greenbacks . The superiority of the National Bank currency over the greenbacks is not generally appreciated . The greenbacks are a forced loan , adapted to a state of war ; the bank-notes are a voluntary system , adapted to a state of peace . The greenbacks are perpetual repudiation , for they promise to pay " dollars , " and do not ; the bank-notes are redeemed , for they promise to pay lawful money , and they do it . it is only necessary to repeal the legal-tender Act to adapt the National banking system to resumption . Greenbacks are a fixed volume of currency , not surceptible of contraotion or expansion with the business demands of the country ; the bank-notes expand and contract , so as to accommodate the wants of those seeking discounts . The greenbacks , by their standing repudiation , injure the credit of the Government ; the Banks , by being based on Government bonds , and by their universal distribution as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Government . The pretence that the Government , by destroying the National banking system , and substituting greenbacks for the bank-notes , would save the interest on the bonds deposited by the Banks as the basis of their circulation , has been so often exploded , that , though the measure is still pressed by a portion of the Banking and Currency Committee of the House , it needs no further reply than has been made in the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury and Com* troller of the Currency , showing that the mere National and State taxes paid by the Banks nearly offsets the amount of interest paid to them by the Government on their bonds ; so that the Government not only obtains the facilities of a banking system , but effects a loan of $340,000,000 at less than two per cent . BANKS OF DI5COUNT MU5T EXIST AND USR THEIR OWN CURRENCY . Moreover , the country needs some banking system , i. e. , some set of authoriZed and secured institutions , whose business it shall be to discount the business-notes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own demand-notes , which shall circulate as currency . This is the essence of banking . It involves several corollaries : 1 . The Bank ought to discount - private notes on its own responsibility , or the due precautions essential to safety in the business will not be preserved . The Government can not safely undertake to discount the notes of private parties . 2 . In order that the Bank may afford to discount notes on its own responsibility , it must have the interest on its currency for the time it is loaned . This it can not have unless the currency // is its own , or some currency which it receives in exchange for its own . If it issues the currency of the Government , it must first have either paid value for it to the Government , or to the private holders of it ; and , in either case , it loses the interest on what it paid . To suppose that a Bank can afford to borrow money of one party at lawful rates of interest in order to loan it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private bankers may , if possessed of large wealth , reputation , and sagacity , carry on a successful discounting business by loaning mainly their own or the money of their depositors , for which they pay a lower rate of interest than they receive ; but this system is necessarily limited . It is indispensable to any banking system , therefore , that it shall issue its own currency , be responsible for it , and have the iiiterest upon it while issued . It can not do so with the greenbacks , because , so long as they are issued only for value received , the Government has the interest on them . Hence the question , whether we shall have greenbacks or bank-notes , is reduced to the simpler question , Shall we have any banking system at all ? INADEQUACY OF GREENBACKS A5 A CURRENCY . The greenbacks in no way satisfy the demand of the business community for discounts . Since discounts are as indispensable an agency in commerce as railroads , banks of discount and circulation of some kind must exist . If the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National securities would be substituted for them . If based on National bonds , the Government would pay them the same amount and rate of interest thereon which it now pays to the National Banks . If based on State bonds , they would be as insecure as under the old system . In either case , a return to the old State system would be a backward movement in our finances . It would give us a heterogeneous and insecure currency in place of a uniform and secure one . It would lower the credit of the Government , by lessening the market-value for its bonds , now created by the requirement that they shall form the basis of our banking* system . It would tend to revive the financial sovereignty of the States , and destroy that of the United States ; for the control of our banking system is one of the most potent attributes of National sovereignty ; it is the hand of the Government on the purse-strings of the people . If vested in the nation , the hation will govern ; if vested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERFECTING TIlE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM . No measure would tend more directly towards a return to specie payments , than the adoption of the Senate Finance Committee 's policy of withdrawing the greenbacks and expanding the National banking system , so as to furnish us with our entire currency . This would increase the amount of bonds absorbed by tho Banks from $330,000,000 of bonds to at least $800,000,000 , perhaps $1,000,000,000 . This would render one half o*ir National debt available and useful as active business capital . The rise in the price of our bonds occasioned by the absorption of so much larger a quantity as the basis of our Banks and paper-money , would be accompanied by a return of nearly all our bonds from Europe , thereby putting an end to the drain of gold to pay foreign interest . This advance in our bonds would cause a like advance in the value of our currency or decline in the premium on gold , a more even diffusion of the National debt among the whole people , and consequent quietus on all tendencies towards repudiation , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent establishment of a National financial system , in lieu of the uncertainty which has hitherto prevailed . Such a currency , being secure and redeemable , would be incapable of undue inflation , and would expand and contract with the wants of the community . In this measure are combined all the causes which tend to hasten our return to specie payments , viz. , strength . // ening the Government credit , lessening the export of specie , and guarding against inflation . CAN WE RESUME TO-DAY ? None of the plans above examined are adequate to enhance the price of our bonds and currency to par with gold . It remains to consider whether specie payments can be successfully resumed , first by the Government , and then by the country , while gold is at its present premium , by a simple act of will , or , as Mr. Greeley expresses it , by writing over the Treasury-door , " The United States have resumed specie payments . " The theory of those who argue that " the best way to prepare for resumption is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep financial causes for the depreciation of our currency , but that it is entirely owing to financial cowardice in our Secretary of the Treasury . Mere courage will only remo*re such obstacles as are due to mere cowardice . This theory takes no account of the fact that the depreciation in our currency is caused* by depreciation in the whole bulk of the National debt , and that , before we can bring currency to par , our bonds must come to par ; which implies that $700 ,  - -  000,000 of gold-value must be added to our National debt , or that bonds now worth $1,800,000,000 in gold , shall become worth their face $2,500,000,000 in gold . No one would contend that the resolve of the Secretary of the Treasury to pay out $100,000,000 of gold , on demand , for United States n6tes until his gold should be gone , would add $700,000,000 of gold-value to the total National debt , still less that it would add a like value to all the private debts now existing . Hence it could not restore specie payments . Its practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one third of the greenbacks now in circulation , to exhaust the Treasury of its gold ; these would be presented , and the gold obtained would be shipped to Europe and invested in bonds , which , while intrinsically worth more than the greenbacks , would be selling for less . When the Government had paid out its gold , the total supply in the country being less by the amount shipped abroad , the tendency would be towards a higher premium . The argument that the Government has on hand one fourth as much gold as is required to pay its demand liabilities , and that , in speciepaying times , the Banks of the country had on hand only a fifth or sixth as much gold as would pay their totat liabilities , and that therefore the Government could as well pay specie now as the Banks could then , is a non constctt . To make the cases parallel , we must either compare the quantity of gold which each had , with its immediate liabilities , or with its total liabilities . We find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of gold *t possesses , while its demand liabilities are about five times greater . No Banks have evei* paid specie with so small a ratio of gold to both immediate and ultimate liabilities . hOARDING GOLD A5 A MEANS OF RESUMPTION . The theory that , by hoarding specie in the Treasury , we could ever collect enough to resume specie payments , equally overlooks the fact that it is not the demand liabilities only that are to be looked after , but that the whole volume of the debt affects the price of the currency . To collect $250,000,000 in gold to pay for greenbacks , in order to effect resumption , is like collecting a few thousand hogsheads of water with which to raise the level of a small fishpond which communicates by a secret channel with Lake Michigan . Unless enough be collected to raise the level of the whole lake , there will be no change in the level of the pond . So , unless gold enough can be collected to pay the whole debt , we can not , by mere hoarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoarding gold artificially lessens the supply , and , by increasing the premium , retards rather than hastens specie payments . // HOW SHALL WE RESTORE SPECIE PAYMENTS ? Since all projects which attempt to doctor the currency up to par without regarding it as a member or limb of the National debt , and prescribing for the whole system at once , are quackery , we are reduced to the conclusion that we will return to specie payments only when the National debt shall be brought to a substantial par with gold . How can this be done ? First , the cry of repudiation must be stopped . The price of our bonds , or the credit of the Government , is depressed almost as much now by distrust of our intentions to pay , as it was during the war by doubts of our ability . In order to stop the cry of repudiation , taxation must be diminished , and its burden lifted at every possible point from the industry and business of the people , so that the country can be allowed to prosper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tools required* for carrying on industry , for the necessary profits required to support the capitalist and the laborer , nor all the surplus profits required to give both an inducement to invest and labor . Taxation , therefore , must always be confined to a portion of the surplus profits of industry . When it asks more than this , it dries up its own sources . Supposing the property of the country , real and personal , to be assessed at $17,000,000,000 , worth $25,000,000 ,  - -  000 . This is probably much above the real value. * If we suppose the entire capital of the country to have earned , in net profits over losses , ten per cent. , we have our entire earnings $2,500,000,000 per year , or about $73 for each inhabitant ; out of which our average taxation for several years , $500,000,000 , has taken one fifth , or at least $14 for each inhabitant . It is obvious that no people can endure * For , what is underestimated by assessors is more than compensated by what is estimated two , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000 , and a mortgage on is of $9,000 , are assessed as real and personal property , amounting to $19,000 , when , in reality , the mortgage and the farm are the same $10,000 ; so the mortgage , if made part of the capital of an insurance or banking company , is assessed again , and so on . a taxation equalling a fifth of their gross earnings . The Senate Finance Committee state that , besides our interest on the debt and expenses of Government , we have actually paid on the principal of the liquidated and floating debt the enormous sum of $475,000,000 since August 1 , 1865 . It is to this unprecedented burden of taxation that our depression in all kinds of business is due . We are taking not merely the surplus profits , or even the actual earnings of capital and labor , but we a#re distraining the tools and implements with which labor and industry are carried on . With no clear idea of the remedy , the people do very clearly see the evil , and hence the agitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abuse , but as the expression of the people that their burden is greater than they can bear . Retrenchment is well , but is wholly inadequate . The payment of the principal of the National debt ought to be reduced to the minimum . PAYMENT OP PRINCIPAL NOT ESSENTIAL TO NATIONAL CREDIT . The experience of nations proves that the credit of a Government depends not so much on the amount of the principal of its debt , as on the ease , promptness , and prosperity with which it can pay the interest . Our credit was as low when we owed but $65,000,000 of debt , as it is to-day with $2,500,000,000 . We could not then borrow $3,000,000 more easily , or at a lower rate , than we could now borrow $300,000,000 . The principal of the debt consists of surpluses not needed in business , and is held as an investment by those who want it to remain as long as possible . It is an injury to them to pay it off , since it compels them to reinvest it . Whatever holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bond . It is no benefit to the taxpayer to pay it off because it draws from him a principal which he can not afford to pay in order to avoid paying an interest which he can afford . He can perpetually better afford to pay the interest // than the principal . For it is in the nature of a public debt , when securely funded , to run at a much lower rate of interest than capital of every kind is worth to business men and taxpayers . The debt of England runs at three and a half per cent. , while the average capital of the country is worth five . The debt of the United States averages five and a half per cent. , while the capital which would be drawn from the taxpayers to pay it off with is worth from seven to ten . The present depreciation in the goldvalue of the principal makes the gold interest equal to two per cent , more in currency , but this is temporary . When the bonds have risen to par , the rate of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a National debt will run at a far lower rate of interest than private debts , will then be still more apparent . Of course , no Englishman can afford to pay the principal of a debt in money which is worth to him five per cent. , ier order to save an annual interest of only three per cent . The exchange is not only a grievous loss the first year , but the second year , the fiftieth year , and the one thousandth year . ADVANTAGES OF A PERPETUAL LOAN . The bonds now issued are sacred against all tampering , and must be paid according to their terms when due , unless sooner voluntarily exchanged by their owners for some new loan . But if the Government could , with the consent of its creditors , fund their bonds , ' or most of them , into a perpetual loan , on the plan of the British consols , it would be more desirable to investors , and would be taken by them at a lower rate than a bond due in twenty or forty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing and retiring its bonds . It would guard against the immense demands for gold which will assail us as our present bonds mature . Suppose , for instance , that on the maturing of our first issue of 5.20s in 1882 , $400,000,000 of our bonds should be sent home for redemption , and the payment in specie of a third or half that sum should be re quired : it would drain us of our gold to an extent that would bankrupt the Treasury , and might involve total failure to meet our obligations . As our other bonds matured , the danger would be increased a hundredfold. * UTILIZE THE PRINCIPAL . The first step in our National economy , therefore , is either to make a considerable portion of the principal of the National debt perpetual , or to provide for its payment in moderate instalments extending over a long period , so as to impose the least possible present burden on industry , consistent with the ultimate discharge of so much of the principal as it may be found expedient to pay . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to embarrass us in the event of another war ; and if only to stop our foreign interest and avoid foreign complications , that portion of our . National debt which is held abroad should be paid off . But the payment of that portion which forms the basis of our banking and other trust business , would be a detriment rather than a benefit . This policy , which has already been adopted by Congress in the recent Act abolishing $100,000,000 of taxes , and reducing our revenue to within $10,000,000 of our expenses , relieves our own people of the burden of taxation heretofore amounting to nearly $200,000,000 per annum , abstracted from them for the payment of the principal . This relief will so lighten taxation and restore business prosperity as to end all disposition towards repudiation . The class of people who deny our ability to pay the principal , or feel oppressed by the attempt to do so , will be satisfied with the knowledge that a large portion of the principal of the debt is to be so utilized as to render its payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity of the Government * While this article is in press , a leading New York banker publishes his indorsement of these views , and shows that , allowing for the premium on our present bonds , in currency , a perpetual five per cent . loan negotiafi 'd at par would net about the same interest to lenders as our 5.20s. // 1868.1 TuB NATIONAL FixAxons. wrn be satisfied with the knowledge that this is best done by prompt payment of the interest , and that payment of the principal is in no degree essential to that end . The taxpayer will be satisfied with the knowledge that his taxation is reduced to the lowest possible figure . The bondholder will be satisfied with the knowledge that his investment is permanent and his interest secure . When he wants his principal , he will get it in full by selling his bond . The business community would be satisfied by the fact that , with nearly half our taxation removed , industry would revive , speculation would diminish , and production and legitimate business would again become a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is absolutely certain to produce the same annual interest as the gold , ought to be very nearly par with gold , or par less one year 's interest . The English consols have sufficient proximate certaintyas to interest to be worth from 92 to 97 per cent. , though all the world knows that the principal will absolutely never be paid : and as it is the great Savings Bank of the English nation , nobody is interested in having it paid . A few years of light taxation , no payment , or very slight payment , of principal , general prosperity , and absence of all effort at repudiation , would bring our bonds from 72 up to 90 or 95 in gold , and this would make every dollar of our currency worth par , thereby restoring specie payments , not only for the Government , but for the whole country , without defrauding any body or oppressing any class , or creating cramps or fluctuations in business . Under the operation of the legal-tender law , all private debts depreciate and appreciate in gold value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two will therefore advance to par with gold at the same time . HELPS TO SPECIE PAYMENTS . Considerable incidental aid to a return to specie payments would be derived by perfecting the National Banking System , by making the bonds deposited as the basis of their note-circulation equal to ten per cent . more in gold than the amount of notes issued by them , and making the system free of any other limitations than those necessary to make the bills redeemable and secure , and by retiring the United States notes pan pas&amp;u with the further issue of bank-notes , until the latter should form the sole currency of the country . Some aid would also be derived from repealing the legal-tender Act , as to all contracts entered into after a certain date . This would help to givecertainty to values , as it would give us the same standard for our internal as for our foreign commerce , and the same for obligations payable before , as for those payable after , specie payments shall be resumed . Further aid would be derived from creating a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making them the basis for insurance and trust companies as well as for banking ; for every National bond that is utilized by being made the basis of business becomes productive , and loses its character of debt in its higher function of capital , just as a greenback merges its character of " forced loan* ' in its more useful function of currency . And when thus converted into capital , ' it is like the surplus rock on a farm converted into fences or buildings . It becomes valuable as an aid to industry ; and to ; pay off a bond so utilized is to destroy capital , to the extent that the bond so utilized performs its functions better than the new security which would have to be substituted for it . As the banking system , when perfect , would require $t , 000 ,  - -  000,000 of bonds , if the insurance business could be made to absorb $500,000 ,  - -  000 more , it is probable that our whole debt would be held in this country , and the drain of specie or exports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes paid by the National Banks reduce the net interest paid by the Government on the bonds held by them to two per cent. , the absorption of $t , b00 ,  --  // net interest on the National debt to the following , viz : 2 per cent on $1,500,000,000 $30,000,000 5 per cent on $500,000,000 25,000,000 Total interest on entire debt $15,000,000 This would be a saving on our present annual interest ( $130,000,000 ) of $75 ,  - -  000,000 , which is four times the sum which the advocates of destroying the National Banks claim to save by substituting the greenbacks . To any policy which aims at causing all our debt to be held at home , it may be asked , where are we to get the principal in gold or exports with which to pay for such aa importation of boads ? We answer , only by such a rapid increase of our wealth and prosperity as will create a balance of trade in our favor , i. e. , a large excess of our production over our consumption , and a consequent National saving which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe-just as our National insolvency was represented by their exportation , and will be indicated by their continuance abroad . NO TAXATION OF NATIONAL BONDS . Of course , all efforts to tax the National bonds , either by Federal or State authority , should cease . There can be no inequality among citizens in exempting the National bonds from taxation , because the debt being due from the taxpayers , they all share the benefit of the exemption in exact proportion to the taxes they pay . It is the debt of the taxpayers , the Government being only an agent ; and whatever lessens its rate of interest , is so much gain divided among the taxpayers . There is no monopoly in the exemption of the bonds from taxation ; because all taxpayers are free to own as many of the bonds as they please , and to profit by the exemption . What every body has equal access to can not be a monopoly . If the taxpayer can not afford to own the bonds , it is because his money is worth more to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the bondholder take a less rate of income than he can afford to . The power to tax a debt is the power to repudiate it . If vested in the Congress , it would be dishonor . If exercised by the State , it would destroy the sovereignty of the National Government in its most vital functionsthat of raising money on loan , without which no Government can exist . The Supreme Court has three times decided the taxation of National bonds , by local or State authority , to be unconstitutional , viz. , in McCulloch vs . The State of Maryland , 4 Wheaton , 316 ; Weston vs. the City of Charleston , 2 Peters , 449 ; and Osborne vs . The Bank of the United States , 9 Wheaton , 738 . A tax of one per cent , on the interest of the bonds , if it could be inflicted on the bondholder , would lower the value of the principal one fifth , or would reduce the value of the bond from 72 to 57* , and the reduction of the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in gold to about 185 . A tax of two per cent , annually on the bonds , if it could be enforced on the bondholder , would lower the value of the bonds ( supposing them to average six per cent , interest ) one third , or from 72 to 48 , causing gold to stand 20S* . A tax of three per cent , would be equivalent to a repudiation of half the principal , and one of six per cent , to a repudiation of the whole . The mere agitation of such an enormity lowers the price of bonds and currency , raises the premium on gold , increases the quantity of bonds necessary to carry the burden of the national debt , and so burdens the taxpayers , and punishes guilty and innocent alike for the projected dishonesty . The repudiator , who , whether openly or secretly , under the guise of taxing the debt , helps to increase its bulk and burden , causes a mischief , if less guilty in intent , but little less burdensome in effect , than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EQUAL TAXATION . Another policy vital to the Government credit , and to specie payments , is the distribution of taxittion in such manner as to secure the largest ratio of the amount collected to the amount anthorized , and to effect the least possible // 1868 . NATIONAL HONESTY . burden on industry , and the utmost equality of distribution . But this we can not even enter upon , as it would form a treatise in itself . We have endeavored to state facts , and to base our theories on facts alone . If our discussion tends to show that most of the remedies which have been proposed for our financial troubles have been misconceived , and founded on false assunip tions , and that the actual remedies are very simple , and in accordance with the practice of other nations which have been situated as ours now is , we are sustained in the former position by the fact that most of the policies proposed have been discarded , and in the latter , by the truth that nations in like circumstances must find it their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
