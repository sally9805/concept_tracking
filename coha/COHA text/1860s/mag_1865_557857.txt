ART . II . - Lettres In*dites de VOLTAIRE . Recueillies par M. DE CAYROL , et annote'es par M. ALPHONSE FRAN9OIS . Preced*es d'une Pr*face de M. SAINT-MARC GIRARDIN , de l'Acad6mie Fran*aise . Paris . 1856. 2 vols. 8vo . ON the 28th Of March , t727* , the remains of Sir Isaac Newton lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber in London . Statesmen , nobles , and philosophers gathered there to pay the last homage to a man whose sole claim to distinction was that he had enlarged the boundaries of human knowledge . When the body was carried to its last resting-place in Westminster Abbey , the pall was borne by the Lord Chancellor , the highest official in the kingdom ; by the Duke of Montrose and the Duke of lloxburgh ; by the Earls of Pembroke , Sussex , and Macdesfield , - members of the Royal Society , of which Newton had been President for nearly a quarter of a century . The funeral was attended by a concourse of the mcii highest in rank and greatest in name in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude of citizens who understood little , it is true , of what Newton had done for them and their posterity , but who felt , in some degree , how becoming it was in men great by accident to pay such honors to a man great by nature . There were two poets then in London upon whom this scene , so honorable to England and to human nature , made a profound impression . One of these was James Thomson , whose Seasons were then in course of publication , with the applause which six generations have ratified . In his poem upon the death of Newton , he expresses the feeling that in honoring hint England redeemed herself : - " For , though depraved and sunk , she brought thee forth , And glories in thy name ; she points thee out To all her sons , and bids them eye thy star , While , in expectance of the second life , When time shall be no more , thy sacred dust Sleeps with her kings , and dignifies the scene . " The other poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second imprisonment in the Bastille . What a lasting impression was made upon his susceptible mind by Newton 's // stately funeral , the numerous allusions to it in his letters attest . In extreme old age , his eye would kindle and his countenance light up when he spoke of his once having lived in a land where a professor of mathematics , only because he was great in his vocation , could be buried in a temple where the ashes of kings reposed , and the highest subjects in the kingdom feel it an honor to assist in bearing thither his body . Voltaire had more reason than the poet of the Seasons to feel the significance of such an event . He had had cause to know that in France nothing was really held sacred but hereditary rank . He was then thirty-one years of age . As yet he had written nothing that savored of immorality or impiety . Except some youthful indiscretions , which his countrymen were the last people in the world to judge with severity , he had done nothing to tarnish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , with the great philosopher of England , he could yet justly claim to represent the intellectual interests of France . He was4 the author of three successful plays , at a time when the production of a successful play was considered the highest achievement of genius . He had written a poem , La Henriade , which France appeared willing to rank with the great epics of antiquity . His success had produced a kind of sham revival of letters at Paris . " I have brought poetry into fashion , " he writes in his gay , extravagant manner ; " all the world is writing poems . " His young king had given him a pension of two thousand francs , and the queen another of fifteen hundred . Princes had courted his society . He had been received well at court during the festivities at the marriage of Louis XV . " The queen , " he wrote , " has wept at Miariamne ; she has laughed at L'Indiscret ; she speaks to me often ; she calls me my poor Voltaire . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new poet with welcome ; his position in France for ten years , both as a citizen and a man of letters , had been high . Nevertheless , against the merest caprice , or the . vaguest suspicion of a man of rank , neither the dignity of his calling nor his rights as a citizen had availed him aught . Twice lie had been exiled from Paris because he was the friend of a nobleman out of favor at court . Again , because he was suspected ( falsely ) of having written some verses reflecting upon the government , // he was imprisoned in the Bastille for eleven months . His favorite work , La Henriade , written to celebrate the glory of an ancestor of his king , he was obliged to publish by stealth in a foreign country , because the capricious and inconsistent tyranny of the government refused to sanction its appearance in France . And now , as he s.tood looking upon the funeral cortege of the English philosopher , the recollection of a more recent outrage , one so vile that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bosom , and giving him the keenest sense of the meaning of what lie beheld . The incident which consigned Voltaire a second time to the Bastille has never , we believe , been told correctly in English . He was dining one day at the Duc de Sully 's , with whom he was in great intimacy . Another of the guests was the Chevalier de iRohan , cousin of the host , a dull and debauched , a sordid and malignant member of one of the most powerful families in France . In the vivacity of conversation , Voltaire presumed to differ in opinion from this personage , who was often a lord among wits , but never a wit among lords , and whose presence weighed heavily upon the company . " Who is this young man , " asked De Rohan , " who , in contradicting me , speaks so loud ? " Voltaire , with flashing eye , replied : " Monsieur le Duc ! he is a man who does not drag about with him a great name , but who honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and left the house . The guests openly applauded the poet ; and the Duc de Sully himself said aloud , " We are glad if you have rid us of him . " A week after , as Voltaire was dining again with the IDuc de Sully , a message was brought to him that some one wished to speak with him in the street below . 1-Je endeavored to excuse himself . " It is to do a good work that you are sought , " said the messenger . Voltaire rose at these words , and , napkin in hand , descended to the gate of the mansion , where he observed a carriage and a hackneycoach standing . Approaching the door of the coach , a dolorous voice from within asked him to mount upon the step . At the moment of his complying with this request , he was seized by a strong hand , and held firmly by his coat . Two or three ruffians ( ham-string cutters Voltaire calls them ) sprang from the other vehicle , one of whom gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane . A v*oice from the private carriage then cried , " Enough ! " the poet was released , and the vehicles drove rapidly away . The voice that cried " Enough ! " was that of the Chevalier de IRohan . It was in broad daylight , in the streets of Paris , in the summer of 1725 , that this deed was done . Voltaire , his clothes torn and disarranged , but not in a fury of passion ( for it was only little things that put him in a fury ) , ascended to the company , related what had occurred , and called upon the Duc de Sully to resent this outrage committed upon one of his guests as done to himself . He asked him to go with him at once to a magistrate , and join him in a statement of the facts . The Duc de Sully , who had known and caressed Voltaire for six years , whose dinners and suppers Voltaire for six years had distinguished and enlivened , chose to win an immortality of shame by refusing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his world too well to hope for justice from the laws , unless his demand were supported by a man of rank . He retired to the country , engaged a fencing-master , and studied English . In the spring of 1726 , he reappeared in Paris . One evening , accompanied by a single friend , he went to the theatre and entered the box of the Chevalier de Rohan . " Sir , " said he to that valiant nobleman , " if some affair of interest has not made you forget the outrage of which I have to complain , I hope you will give me satisfaction for it . " The Chevalier accepted the challenge at once , and himself named the time and place of meeting , - nine the next morning , at St. Anthony 's Gate . He however immediately made known the nature of the interview to his family . Some of his relatives complained to the Duc de Bourbon , then Prime Minister , and , what was far more dangerous , enlisted in their cause the Minister 's mistress by showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written . One of them afterwards declared that the reason of their interference was that De Rohan was suffering from the effects of a fall , and was unfit for an encounter in the field . Now it appears that , in challenging De iohan , Voltaire had broken an edict of the king , which forbade a commoner to challenge a nobleman . Voltaire 's father held an office of // about the grade of first auditor of our treasury , and possessed an income of twenty-five thousand francs a year . Voltaire himself kept three servants , enjoyed considerable revenue , lived in the best society , and had a European celebrity . Nevertheless , the De IRohaus stooped to avail themselves of the royal edict . They further alleged , that Voltaire , in his search after the Chevalier , had dared to invade the sacred domicile of the Cardinal de IRohan . The next morning , instead of meeting the Chevalier at the rendezvous , Voltaire encountered the officers of the police , armed with a leltre de cachet , which consigned him to the Bastille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Minister of Police on this occasion : " I represent , very humbly , that I was assailed by the brave Chevalier de iRohan , assisted by six ruffians , behind whom he was boldly posted . Since that time , I have sought continually to repair , not my honor , but his , - a thing too difficult . If I went to Versailles , it is wholly false that I sought the Chevalier de Rohan at the house of the Cardinal de Rohan . " He was confined in the Bastille for thirty-two days . He was then released , on condition that he should leave France immediately , and not return without the king 's permission . Such was the kind of justice meted out to men of letters under Louis XV . Such were the recollections which the spectacle of the honors paid to Newton revived in the mind of Voltaire . The volumes named at the head of this article add about thirteen hundred letters to the six thousand four hundred which the public already possessed from Voltaire 's indefatigable hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the seventy volumes of his works , we have an average of more than two lettems for each week of his public life of sixty-six years ; and even as we write comes notice of a new series of letters just discovered in Germany . The entire Voltaire correspondence , including the letters addressed to him as well as those written by him , comprises the astonishing number of ten thousand letters , of which about eight thousand were written or dictated by himself . This correspondence fills thirty volumes octavo , all annotated and indexed . The new volumes are chiefly interesting from the light they throw upon // the least known and most important part of Voltaire 's life , - his two years ' residence in England . They contain , among other curious things , twenty-two letters written by him in the English language . With the aid of this new collection , we can now give a tolerably connected account of his life in England , of the company he kept there , the work he did , and the influences he imbibed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , not been sufficiently noted . It was in England that Voltaire lighted the torch with which he set the world on fire . If he had never seen England , he would never have been the Voltaire we know him now . His works and letters bear us out in the assertion , that the principal employment of the last forty years of his life was to impart to France what England taught him . That was the new wine which burst the rotten old bottle of the French monarchy . On the 1st of May , 1726 , Voltaire sat in his room in the Bastille . The order for his release and expatriation had arrived , and he was writing letters to his friends , several of which are preserved . To one he wrote , asking her to come and see him , " perhaps for the last time " ; to another , requesting the loan of a travelling carriage ; to others , ordinary notes of farewell . The Bastille was not a place of horror to such prisoners as he . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner of five courses from the Governor 's own table , with a bottle of excellent claret , and another dinner of three courses for his servant , with a bottle of yin ordinaire , but he had a comfortable apartment , in which his literary labors were assiduously continued , and in which he entertained daily at dinner his sometime fellow-clerk and lifelong friend , Thieriot . The government of France was , even then , a government of mistresses . A man might be consigned to the Bastille to appease the wounded vaiiity of a woman , and yet have friends in the ministry who could convert his dungeon into a scene of luxury , maintained at the king 's expense . Only a hint to the Governor of the Bastille was needed . Let us look in upon Voltaire for a moment , before sending him into exile . This man , whom Goethe styles the most French of Frenchmen , was strikingly French in person and manners . His height , as he himself records , was five feet six // inches , - about the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his letters , with the slenderness of his figure and the meagreness of hi* countenance . He speaks of himself as a " dried herring " ; and once , when he had said , " I hope soon to see you face to face , " he added , " that is , if I may apply the word face to such a phiz as mine . " But his portraits , which may still be collected by the hundred , do not justify this description . They show us a forehead broad and high , but not prominent ; a large , long nose , a powerful under jaw , and somewhat prominent cheek-bones , - a countenance which would certainly present a very gaunt appearance if it were emaciated . It was far from being a handsome face ; but his associates tell us , that , in these years , the wonderful brightness of his dark eyes and his luxuriant brown hair atoned for its deficiencies , and rendered his countenance striking and attractive . His figure , too , was erect and agile . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Frenchman , " yet in a room full of fine company he was not an ordinary-looking nor an unprepossessing person , and his manners had all the vivacious grace of his nation and its court . Goldsmith , who says he saw him many years later , observes that , " when he was warmed in discourse , and had got over a hesitating manner which sometimes he was subject to , it was rapture to hear him . His meagre visage seemed insensibly to gather beauty ; every muscle in it had meaning , and his eye beamed with unusual brightness . " Frederic the Great wrote to him , after their quarrel : " You are charming in conversation ; you know how to instruct and amuse at the same time . You are the most seductive spirit that I know , capable of making all the world love you when you wish it . Such are the graces of your soul that you can at once offend those who know you , and deserve their indulgence . Indeed , you would be per'fect if you were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good stead in a country that cherished an hereditary contempt for Frenchmen . It was in 1721 that Aaron Hill , in speaking of a company of French comedians playing in London , styled them " the French vermm . On the 2d of May , Voltaire left the Bastille . On the 6th , he was at Calais , domiciled with M. Dunoquet , paymaster of the // king 's troops , to whom he had been recommended by a lady of rank , - one of his fellow-prisoners in the Bastille . " We were like Pyramus and Thisbe , " he wrote to this lady from Calais ,  --  " separated from each other by a wall ; only we did not kiss through a chink . " A few days after , he crossed the Channel and sailed up the Thames as far as Greenwich , four miles below London , where he landed . It was one of the most beautiful days of May . The sky , he records , was without a cloud , and a soft breeze from the west te.mpered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It chanced , also , to be the day of the great Greenwich Fair , which was then a day of festivity to Londoners , who came in crowds to witness games , races , and regattas . The river was covered , he says , with two rows of merchant-ships for the space of six miles , with their sails all spread to do honor to the king and queen , who were upon the river in a gilded barge , preceded by boats with bands of music , and followed by a thousand wherries , each rowed by two men in breeches and doublet , with large silver plates upon their shoulders . " There was not one of these oarsmen , " remarks the stranger , " who did not assure me by his face , his dress , and his excellent condition ( embonpoint ) that he was a freeman and lived in plenty . " Near the river , in the famous Greenwich Park , four miles in circumference , he observed a prodigious number of wellformed young people on horseback cantering around a racecourse marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloped up and down with much grace . But he was especially pleased with the girls on foot , most of whom were clad in Indian stuffs . Many of them were beautiful ; all were well made ; *nd there was a neatness in their dress , a vivacity in their movements , and an air of satisfaction in their faces , that made them all pleasing . Roaming about the Park , he came to a smaller race-course , not more than five hundred feet long . " What is this for ? " he asked . He was told that this was for a foot-race , while the larger course was for horses . Near one of the posts of the large circle was a man on horseback holding in his hand a silver pitcher , and at the end of the smaller course were two poles , with a large hat at the top of one , and a chemise floating like a flag from the other . Between // the two poles stood a stout man holding a purse . The pitcher , he learned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the thot-race . But what of the hat and the chemise ? He was " agreeably surprised " to be told that there was to be a race by the girls , and that the winner was to receive , besides the purse , the chemise " as a mark of honor , " while the winfling man was to have the hat . Continuing his rambles , he had the good fortune to fall in with some English merchants to whom he had letters of introduction . These gentlemen , he says , did the honors of the festival with the eagerness and the cordiality of men who are happy themselves and wish to make others sharers in their joy . They had a horse brought for him ; they sent for refreshments ; and took care to get him a place whence he could comfortably view the races , the river , and London in the distance . At first , he thought himself transported to the Olympic Games ; but when he beheld the beauty of the Thames , the fiee* of ships , the immensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . " Some one told him that at that very moment there was a " combat of gladiators " in progress at London ; and then he thought he was with the ancient IRomans . Near him on the stand was a Danish courier , who had only arrived that morning , and was to set out on his return in the evening . " He appeared to me , " says Voltaire , " overcome with joy and wonder . He believed that this nation was always gay , that the women were all beautiful and animated , that the sky of England was always clear and seren* , that people there thought only of pleasure , and that every day in the year was like this . He went away without being undeceived . For my part , I was more enchanted even than my Dane . " Such were Voltaire 's first hours in England . Ben Franklin was a journeyman printer in London then . What more likely than that he was at Greenwich that day ? He may have brushed past the eager little Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after . He may have been one of the stout , well-dressed , fresh-complexioned youths whom Voltaire admired that day galloping about in the Park ; for at Greenwich Fair many young fellows rode who trudged the rest of the year on foot . // Voltaire was not long in learning that England was not always clad in smiles . He was in London the same evening , probably at the house of his friend Lord Bolingbroke , which was usually the place of his abode in London , and to which his letters from France were always addressed . He had become acquainted with that fascinating nobleman four years before , when he was an exile in France , and was paying his court to Madame de Villette , whom he afterwards married . Bolingbroke , always a favorite with men of letters , won the heart of the French poet . After spending a day with him in 1722 , Voltaire wrote to one of his friends : " You must share my enchantment . I have found in this illustrious Englishman all the learning of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never heard our language spoken with more energy and exactness . This man , who has been all his life immersed in pleasure and business , has found the means of learning everything an*retaining everything . He knows the history of the ancient Egyptians like that of England . He is as familiar with Virgil as with Milton Both he and Madame de Villette were infinitely pleased with my poem ( La Henriade ) . In the enthusiasm of their approbation , they placed it above all the poems that have appeared in France ; but I know how much I ought to abate of their extravagant applause . " The next year Bolingbroke was permitted to retnrn to England and to repossess his estates . " He will be in Paris to-day , " wrote Voltaire , " and I shall have the grief to bid him farewell , perhaps , forever . " In 1726 , they had changed parts . Bolingbroke was at home , living in affluence and honor . Voltaire was an exile , deprived of his pensions and his rentes . Lord Bolingbroke made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the best Tory houses in England . In the course of his first evening in London , as Voltaire relates in the letter quoted above , he met some ladies of fashion . He spoke to them of the " ravishing spectacle " which he had witnessed at Greenwich , not doubting that they also had witnessed it , and had formed part of the gay assemblage of ladies galloping round the course . He was a little surprised , however , to observe that they had not that air of vivacity which // people usually exhibit who have just returned from a day 's pleasure . On the contrary , they were constrained and reserved , sipped their tea , made a great noise with their fans , talked scandal , played cards , or read the newspaper . At length , one of these fine ladies , " more charitable than the rest , " informed the puzzled foreigner that people of fashion never abased themselves so far as to attend miscellaneous gatherings like the one which had given him so much delight ; that all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only servants and villagers ; that those handsome young men , so well mounted , and cantering so gayly in the Park , were no thing but scholars and apprentices on hired horses . These unexpected statements he could not believe , and he felt himself moved to anger against the lady who made them . Bent on pursuing his investigations into the character of this strange people , he went the next day into the city , to find the merchants and aldermen who had been so cordial to him at his " supposed Olympic Games . " In a coffee-house which was dirty , ill-furnished , badly served , and dimly lighted , he found most of those gentlemen who , on the afternoon before , had been so affable and good-humored . Not a man of them recognized him . He ventured to address a remark to some of them . They either made no reply at all , or else merely answered yes or no . He imagined he must have offended them . He tried to remember if he had rated the fabrics of Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooks were better than the English , if he had intimated that Paris was a more agreeable city than London , if he had hinted that time passed more pleasantly at Versailles than at St. James 's , or if he had been guilty of any other enormity of that kind . No , his conscience acquitted him of all guilt . At length , " with an air of vivacity that appeared very strange to them , " he took the liberty of asking one of them why they were all so melancholy . The prospect of being able to " chaff " a Frenchman appears to have put a little animation into this group of silent Britons . One of them replied , with a scowl , " The wind is east . " At this moment , one of their friends came up , who said with an unmoved countenance : " Molly has cut her throat this morning . Her lover found her dead in her bedroom with a bloody razor // at her side . " The company , " who all were Molly 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting their eyebrows . One of them merely asked what had become of the lover . " He has bought the razor , " quietly remarked one of the company . The stranger , who seemed to take all this seriously and affects to relate it seriously , could not refrain from inquiring further into such a terrible tragedy . Appalled at once at the event and at the indifference of the company , he asked what could have induced a girl , apparently fortunate , to put an end to her existence in so revolting a manner . They only replied , that the wind was east . Not being able to perceive anything in common between an east wind and the suicide of a young girl or the melancholy humor of the merchants , he abruptly left the coffee-house , and sought again his fashionable friends at court . There , too , all was sad ; and nobody could talk of anything but the east wind . He thought of the Dane whom he had met on the stand at Greenwich Fair , and was inclined to Laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English climate ; but to his astonishment , he found that the climate was having its effect upon himself , - he could not laugh ! Expressing his surprise to one of the court physicians , the doctor told him not to be astonished so soon , foe in the months of November and March he would have cause indeed to wonder . Then people hanged themselves by dozens ; everybody was sick with low spirits , and a black melancholy overspread the whole nation ; for in those months the wind blew most frequently from the east . " This wind , " continued the " chaffing ' * doctor , " is the bane of our island . The very animals suffer from it , and wear a dejected look . Men robust enough to stand this cursed wind lose at least their good-humor . Every one shows a severe countenance and has a mind disposed to desperate resolutioi*s . It was an east wind that cut off the head of Charles I. and dethroned James II . " Then , whispering in the ear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor to ask at court , never ask it unless the wind is west or south . " It was not alone the courtiers and the merchants who were disposed to amuse themselves with this inquisitive foreigner . // 1865 . Voltaire 's Residence in England . He was in a boat one day upon the Thames . One of the oarsmen , seeing that he had a Frenchman for a passenger , began to boast of the superior liberty of his country , and declared , with an oath , that he would rather be a Thames boatman than a French archbishop . The next day , Voltaire relates , he saw this very man at the window of a prison stretching his hand through the bars . " What do you think now of a French archbishop ? " cried Voltai.re . " Ah , sir , " replied the man , " the abominable government we have ! They have forced me away from my wife and children to serve in a king 's ship , and have put me in prison and chained my feet , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Frenchman who was with Voltaire at the time confessed that he felt a malicious pleasure in seeing that the English , who reproached the French with their servitude , were as much slaves as they . " I had a sentiment more humane , " remarks Voltaire . " II was grieved that there was no more liberty on earth . " He consoled himself , also , with observing , that , if the king impressed sailors , everybody in England could speak and write with sufficient freedom . " I have seen four very learned treatises against the reality of the miracles of Jesus Christ printed here with impunity , at a time when a poor booksell&amp;r was put into the pillory for publishing a translation of La Religicuse en *Jhemise . " He thought it a strange British inconsistency that the government should permit the printing of heresy and punish the publication of indecency . A few days after , he observed another oddity at Newmarket . He was told that there he would see the true Olyiripic Games . He saw , indeed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a " prodigious number of the swiftest horses in Europe flying around the course , ridden by little postiions in silk jackets " ; but he also saw " jockeys of quality betting against one another , who put into this solemnity more of swindling than magnificence . " He evidently preferred Greenwich Fair to Newmarket Races . These novel scenes , which he afterwards described with so much gayety , were not sufficient at the time to divert his mind from the recollection of the outrage which he had suffered in France . After spending a few weeks in England , he returned secretly to Paris , at the imminent risk of a third and more rigorous // Bastilling than he had yet suffered . We know nothing of this perilous adventure , except what he relates of it in a letter to his most intimate friend , dated August 22 , 1726 . " I confess to you , " he wrote , " that I have made a little journey to Paris recently . Since I did not see you , you will easily conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , whom the instinct of his poltroohery concealed from me , as if he divined that I was on his track . At last , the fear of discovery made me leave more precipitately than I came . " He added , that he was still uncertain whether he should returii to England , although in that country the arts were honored and encouraged , and merit made the man . " It is a country where they think freely and nobly , without servile fear . If I followed my inclination , it would be there that I should settle , in the idea merely of learning to think . But I know not yet if my little fortune , much deranged by so many journeys , my bad health , worse than ever , my taste for the most profound retreat , will permit me to encounter the din of Whitehall and London , where I am well recommended , and where I shall be made sufficieiitly welcome . Only two things remain for me to do in my life : one is , to risk it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end it in a solitude which accords with my way of thinking , with my misfortunes , and with the knowledge that I have of men . I give up with all my heart my pensions from the king and queen , regretting only that I could not succeed in making over a part of them to you . " To add to his unhappiness , his sister died at this time . " How much better , " he writes , " for my family and for myself , if I had been taken away in her stead ! " The receiit death of his father , too , involved him in a troublesome lawsuit . He returned to England early in the autumn . Having little expectation of being again permitted to reside in France , he settled himself to work with his usual ardor , as though he intended to attempt a career in England as man of letters . His first object , of course , was to make a complete conquest of the English language . He studied it , as he remarks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors and in society ; " conversing freely with wigks and torys ; dining with a bishop , and supping with a Quaker ; going on Saturday to the Synagogue , and on Sunday to St. Paul 's ; hearing a sermon in the morning , // and attending the play after dinner ; passing from the court to the exchange ; and , above all , not taking offence at the coldness , the disdainful and icy aspect , with which English ladies receive a stranger , and which some of them never lay aside . " What success attended his efforts to master the language , we shall see in a moment . The friendship of Bolingbroke brought him at once into friendly relations with the literary circle of which that nobleman was the idol and Pope the ornament . The affection entertained for Bolingbroke by literary men was as remarkable as the detestation in which he was held by some of his political associates . Pope paid him the most stupendous compliment , perhaps , that one mortal ever bestowed upon another . " I really think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great man which looks as if he were placed here by mistake . When the comet appeared to us a month or two ago , I had sometimes an imagination that it might possibly have come to our world to carry him away , as a coach comes to one 's door for other visitors . " And when Pope was dying , Bolingbroke hung sobbing over his chair , and said : " I have known him these thirty years , and value myself more upon that man 's love than " His voice failed him and he could utter no more . Voltaire was exceedingly fond of both these brilliant men . In one of his poetical epistles , published in 1726 , he speaks of Bolingbroke as one who possessed the eloquence of Cicero , the intr*pidity of Cato , the wit of M*ecenas , and the agreeableness of Petronius . He loved him living and he defended him dead . Those sceptical opinions of which , later in life , he was the most conspicuous champion in Europe , evidently took their tone , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deistical party who frequented his house . He relates , however , but one trifling anecdote of his intercourse with Lord Bolingbroke . The conversation turning one day upon the alleged avarice of the Duke of Marlborough , some one appealed to Bolingbroke to confirm the allegation , and with the more confidence because Bolingbroke had been of the party opposed to Marlborough . His reply was , " He was so great a man that I have forgotten his faults . " We may remind the reader , in passing , that , up to this time , // the English deists had had it all their own way . Shaftesbury , Collins , Toland , Chubb , Mandeville , had as yet found no opponents who could cope with them . Paley and Butler had not entered the lists . Wollaston 's puny effort tempted even the young Franklin to try his hand at refuting the work which he was setting in type . iDeism was in fashion . Voltaire probably met scarcely a man in England whose intellect he respected , who was not either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - that is , Churchmen to whom the Church was a profession merely , - a source of income and honors . Of the authors then flourishing in London , the one whom Voltaire rated highest was Pope , who was then thirty-eight years of age . Pope 's mere mastery of the art of rhyming would have sufficed to attract the regard of a man who had written only in rhyme , and who thought that there was no true poetry without rhyme . It appears that upon this vexed question of rhyme Pope and Voltaire were of the same opinion . He tells us that he asked Pope one day why Milton had not written Paradise Lost in rhyme . " Because lie could not , " answered Pope . This does not accord with the experience of Pope 's successor in Homeric translation . Cowper says , that to rhyme in English demands " no great exercise of ingenuity " ; and that he has frequently written more lines in a day " with tags to them " than he ever could without . Voltaire and Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of poems . The vein of moralizing that runs through many of Pope 's productions was peculiarly pleasing to Voltaire , who constantly insists that a poem should do something more than amuse . Pope had not yet written the Essay on Man , nor the Universal Prayer ; but his conversation was much in the spirit of those works , which Voltaire regarded as among the masterpieces of English literature , and which by and by lie caused to be translated into French . Goldsmith reports , that " Mr. Voltaire has often told his friends that he never observed in himself such a succession of opposite passions as lie experienced upon his first interview with Mr. Pope . When he first entered the room and perceived our poor melancholy English poet , naturally deformed and // wasted as he was with sickness and study , he could not help regarding him with the utmost compassion . But when Pope began to speak and to reason upon moral obligations , and dress the most delicate sentiments in the most charming diction , Voltaire 's pity began to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not uncommon with him to assert , that no man ever pleased him so much in serious conversation , nor any whose sentiments mended so much upon recollection . " It was in the autumn of 1726 that Pope was overturned , as he was returning to London , in Lord Bolingbroke 's coach , from that nobleman 's country-house . The poet had a narrow escape from drowning in the stream into which he was thrown , and two of his fingers were cut with the glass of the coach window . The accident elicited from Voltaire the first specimen of his English that has been preserved . He had then resided in England four months , since lie had spent two months in his secret visit to France . The following is his letter of condolence to Pope : - " SIR - I hear this moment of your sad adventure : the water you fell into was not Hippocrene 's water ; otherwise it would have supported you : indeed , I am concerned beyond expression for the danger you have been in , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers which have written The Rape of the Lock , ' the Criticism , ' and which have so becomingly dressed Homer in an English coat , should have been so barbarously treated ? Let the hand of Dennis or of your poetasters be cut off - yours is sacred . I hope , sir , you are now perfectly recovered . Really , your accident concerns me as much as all the disasters of a master ought to affect his scholar . I am sincerely , sir , with the admiration which you deserve , " Your most humble servant , " VOLTAIRE . " In my Lord Bolingbroke 's House , Friday , at noon , Nov. 16 , 1726 . " Dr. Croly , the editor of Pope 's works , thinks this a " stiff and school-boy epistle . " It seems to us , however , pretty well done for a man who had lived no longer in England . In this connection , the reader may not be displeased to see another specimen of Voltaire 's English , written in March , 1727 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in Paris , but soon broke into English as follows : - // " It was indeed a very hard task formed to find that damned book which , under the title of Improvement of Human Reason " ' ( a translation from the Arabic ) , " is an example of nonsense from one end to the other , and which besides is a tedious nonsense , and consequently very distasteful to the French nation , that detests madness itself , when madness is languishing and flat . The book is scarce , because it is bad , it being the fate of all wretched books never to be printed again . So I spent almost a fortnight in the search of it , till at last I had the misfortune to find it . " I hope you will not read it throughout , that spiritless nonsense romance , though indeed you deserve to read it , to do penance for the trouble you gave me to inquire after it , for the tiresome perusal I made of some parts of this whimsical , stupid performance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great an idea of so mean a thing . " You will find in the same parcel the second volume of M. Gulliver , which ( by the by I do n't advise you to translate ) strikes at the first " ( i. e. the first volume ) ; " the other is overstrained . The reader 's imagination is pleased and charmingly entertained by the new prospect of the lands which Gulliver discovers to him ; but that continued series of new fangles , follies , of fairy tales , of wild inventions , pall at last upon our taste . Nothing unnatural may please long ; it is for this reason that commonly the second parts of romances are so insipid . " Farewell ; my services to those who remember me ; but I hope I am quite forgot here " there ? . - Lettres InJdites , Vol . I. p. 3* . The errors in this hasty familiar letter can not conceal from us that Voltaire had caught much of the spirit of the language at this time , and was not far from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then in the highest repute . Voltaire was much in his company in London , and it was he who suggested the translation of Gulliver into French . Swift befriended the stranger in various ways , and corresponded with him from Ireland . When the Dean proposed visiting France in 1727 ' , Voltaire gave him letters to his friends , and advised them of the coming of " the English Rabelais . " There was another member of the Pope circle , then unknown to fame , with whom Voltaire contracted the most valuable and the most lasting of his English friendships . This was Everard Falkener , a Turkey merchant , who lived at Wandswortb , five // miles from London , where , in an elegant home provided with a library , he entertained men of letters with generous hospitality . Falkener in later years , partly through Bolingbroke 's influence , became the English Ambassador at Constantinople , where he served many years with such ability as to receive the honor of knighthood . He was afterwards variously employed in public life , - much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a merchant should be chosen for offices to which in France none but nobles could pretend . At the abode of Falkener at Wandsworth , Voltaire resided for more than a year , laboring assiduously at his vocation , and conversing with his host upon Horace and Virgil . There he wrote his play of " Brutus " in the English language , his " History of Charles XII. , " and his Essays upon Epic Poetry and upon the Civil Wars of France ; and there , too , were written most of those Letters upon the English which , a few years later , made so much noise in the world , and brought upon the author new persecutions . For thirty-five years he remained the friend and correspondent of Sir Everard Falkener , writing to him always in the English language . Their friendship extended even to the next generation ; for two sons of Falkener visited Voltaire at Ferney , long after their father 's death , and were royally entertained there . Placing one of them at his right and the other at his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mon Dieu ! How happy I am to find myself between two Falkeners . " Voltaire relates that he called upon Congreve to pay his homage to the man then esteemed the first of living English dramatists . Congreve affected to disregard his own celebrity as an author , and said that he desired only to be considered in the light of a gentleman . Voltaire , who was always a stickler for the dignity of the profession of a man of letters , was so much offended at this ridiculous vanity , that he almost lost his politeness . " If you had only been a gentleman , " said he , I should never have come to see you . " Voltaire , meanwhile , had a business enterprise on his hands . " He knew by intuition , " as Bulwer has recently remarked , " that a man who would raise himself into a Power should begin by securing a pecuniary independence . " At every period // of his life he looked well to his moneys and his usances . He probably learned the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said , made his fortune as a moneylender , and with that fortune bought the offices which gave him consideration . Deprived of his pensions , and collecting with difficulty the revenue of his property in France , which was already considerable , he was busy in England with preparing to publish , by subscription , an edition of La Henriade in French . French was then the language of the English court . A company of French comedians usually played in London during a part of the season . Every man of rank was supposed to speak French , of course , and every one who expected court favor necessarily knew the language in which court favor was solicited . It has been hitherto regarded as a mystery , how it was that Voltaire succeeded so wonderfully in an enterprise which at first wore so unpromising an appearance that no bookseller would undertake it . The names of the king and queen figured at the head of the list of subscribers , which embraced those of a vast number of the nobility and gentry . The price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reported to have been three thousand , yielding the poet a profit of two thousand pounds ! The mystery , however , disappears when we look closely into the facts . The friendship of Bolingbroke procured him a most favorable introduction to two powerful classes , namely , men of letters and the old Tory party ; of both of whom Lord Bohingbroke was a champion and a favorite . But this was not all . A letter now lying before us shows that a way of access was opened for him to Whig circles , and even to the chiefs of that party , then all-powerful at court and in Parliament . Sir Robert Walpole was Prime Minister , Horace Walpole ( brother of Sir Robert and uncle of the Horace Walpole of Strawberry Hill ) was the English Minister at the French court . Three weeks after the departure of Voltaire from the Bastille , we find this Horace Walpole writing in his behalf to Bubb Dodington , and writing , too , at the solicitation of the French Minister for Foreign Affairs . Thus , a minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his prosperity , and took measures to promote // it , - a minister , too , that owed his place to his friendship for England , and whom the Walpoles were especially solicitous to gratify . If our readers will turn to the diplomatic memoirs of that time , they will perceive that a recommendation from the Count de Morville was the very last thing in the world , just then , that a Walpole would have disregarded . The following was the letter of the English plenipotentiary to Dodington . " PARIS , May 29 , 1726 . " DEAR Sin - Mr. Voltaire , a French poet , who has wrote several pieces with great success here , being gone for England in order to print by subscription an excellent poem , called Henry IV. , which , on account of some bold strokes in it against persecution and the priests , can not be printed here ; M. de Morville , the Ma*cenas , or , I may truly say , the Dodington here , for the encouragement of wit and learning , has earnestly recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting this subscription among my friends ; on which account , as well as for the sake of merit , I thought I could apply myself nowhere more properly than to you ; and I hope this will answer the particular view and interest which I have in it myself ; which is to renew a correspondence so agreeable to me ; who am , with the greatest truth and affection , sir , " Your most obedient and most humble servant , " H. WALPOLE . " This letter had the effect intended . It was at Mr. Dodington 's scat in Dorsetshire that Voltaire became intimate with Young , afterwards the author of the " Night Thoughts , " and already a poet of considerable celebrity . The anecdote which connects the names of Young and Voltaire is familiar to many of our readers . The French poet , it is said , objected to Milton 's personification of Sin and Death , when Dr. Young is reported to have addressed him thus : " Thou art so witty , profligate , and thin , At once we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as others have it , " That thou thyself art Milton 's Death and Sin . " If Dr. Young was guilty of such a couplet upon a stranger , it must have been in jest , over Dodington 's " flowing Burgundy " ; for a few years later we find him dedicating a poem to Vol // taire , in complimentary verse , styling him his " patron , " and alluding to his many triumphs in prose and verse . He speaks of having soothed him with " gentle rhymes " on Dorset Downs , when Milton 's Death and Sin provoked his rage , and recalls himself to Voltaire as one " Who half inclined thee to confess , Nor could thy modesty do less , That Milton 's blindness lay not in his song . " Having access to the most influential circles in England , both literary and political , Voltaire was not the man to abstain from making the most of his opportunities . He appears to have conducted Iris publishing enterprise himself . Certain it is that he personally solicited his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg you , " he writes to Dean Swift , enclosing the advertisement , " to use your influence in Ireland to procure some subscribers for La Henriade , which is finished , and which , for want of a little aid , has not yet appeared . The subscription is only one guinea , payable in advance . " Swift did procure subscribers in Ireland . Besides Voltaire 's " pushing , " the poem had the advantage of containing much that was calculated to please the English taste of that day . Copies of the Dutch edition were in circulation in England . Queen Elizabeth figures in it . England is always alluded to , as in all the works of Voltaire , with respect . And there were very many passages that appealed to the Protestant feeling of a country that had only twenty-eight years before dethroned a king because he was a Catholic . Now , in two senses of the word , La Henriade may be called an orthodox production . The poet employs the machinery , the supernatural effects and persons , the episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superstition , Fanaticism , Discord , Love , appear as persons , retarding , accelerating , guiding the action of the poem . St. Louis , also , father of the Bourbons , plays a decisive part . The reader is conducted to heaven and to hell , and is permitted even to look upon the eternal throne of God . Siniiles in the style of Homer , imitated by all epic poets , continually occur ; and prophetical views of the future , in the manner of Virgil and Dante , give Voltaire an opportunity of introducing characters // living in his own time . Besides this poetic orthodoxy , there is an evident attempt throughout to propitiate the masters of France by an orthodoxy of opinion . The poet speaks of his Protestant hero as " a supporter of the party of error " ; and concludes his poem by converting him to the Catholic faith , causing him even to discern a God under the guise of bread ,  --  " the living sustenance of his elect . " The descriptions of God , and of his dwelling-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , Voltaire does not forget that he lives under an absolute king , and that Paris has a Bastille . " He who dies for his king , dies always with glory , " is one of his lines ; and in another he tells his countrymen that the crimes committed by their ancestors will not involve them , " for your love for your kings has made reparation for them all . " Yet , notwithstanding this framework and veil of orthodoxy , the essential spirit of the poem is modern and Protestant . It is 110 " Heavenly Muse " whom its opening lines invoke , but " August Truth . " While denouncing persecution for opinion 's sake , the poet declares that Catholics and Protestants , as parties , are equally cruel and false . The massacre of St. Bartholomew is related with eloquence and pathos , as an English Protestant of that day would have had it related . As a climax of horror , the poet says that the murderers were urged on by the voice of " sanguinary priests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared , with arms wet with the blood of innocence , to offer to God that execrable incense . " Papal Rome is represented as " inflexible to the vanquished , complaisant to the conqueror . " The hero of the poem observes , that " a great man ought not to dread the thunders of Rome , and that Rome and Geneva are equally indifferent to him . " The decline of tile Church from its original purity , the pride , the arrogance , the vices of the Papal hierarchy , are treated in a manner which would not have displeased Luther ; while true Religion is devxk*A xx X ag*wagj* XXi eA*y N*A* wowVV Xx** *x*o*jeA . " Far from the pageantry of Rome , from worldly pomp , from temples consecrated to human vanity , whose splendid decorations impose upon the universe , humble Religion hides herself in deserts . There lives she with God in peace profound , while her name , profaned in the world , is the holy pretext of the fury // of tyrants , a blind for the people , the contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bless , her portion . She prays in secret for the ingrate who outrages her . Without ornament , without art , beautiful in her own charms , her modest loveliness remains forever hidden from the false , importunate crowd who rim to her altars to worship Fortune . " In hell , too , the reader finds many kings undergoing punishment for the wrongs which they committed and the wrongs which they did not avenge . There also are ministers who sold to the highest bidder the honors due to virtue , and the justice due to all men . The Inquisition is heartily denounced , and the Bastille is spoken of as " that frightful castle , palace of vengeance , which often confines crime and innocence . " The most careless reader of La Henriade perceives or suspects that the passages which conform to the orthodoxy of France were dictated by policy ; while the heart of the poet is in those which denounce tyranny , fanaticism , superstition , intolerance , and cruelty . Compared with the great epics of Homer , Virgil , Dante , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work indeed . Its departures from historic truth are of themselves fatal to its effect upon a modern reader ; who , at the same time , finds something almost ludicrous in the hero relating the civil wars of Fraiice to Queen Elizabeth precisely in the tone of . *Eneas recounting to Dido the fall of Troy . It is like clothing the statue of a member of . Congress in the costume of a Roman Senator . Nevertheless , La Henriade is a brilliant , flashing , stirring production . It contains several passages that approach the highest excellence , and several lines that reach it . If Voltaire could only have forgotten his Virgil , discarded the supernatural , and relied only on rational means of exciting interest , lie might have produced a work which other nations beside the French would still read with satisfaction as well as pleasure . As it is , we can only regard it as the supreme effort of that stage of mental culture which we call the Sophomoric ; though for ten years longer Voltaire continued to call it " the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of his poem to Queen Caroline , consort of George II. , a princess who paid some honor to literature . His dedicatory epistle was written in the // English language . We believe it has never been printed in America . " To THE QUEEN . " MADAM : - It was the fate of Henry the Fourth to be protected by an English queen . He was assisted by the great Elizabeth , who was in her age the glory of her sex . By whom can his memory be so well protected as by her who resembles so much Elizabeth in her personal virtues ? " Your Majesty will find in this book bold , impartial traths ; morality unstained with superstition ; a spirit of liberty , equally abhorrent of rebellion and of tyranny ; the rights of kings always asserted , and those of mankind never laid aside . " The same spirit in which it is written gave me the confidence to offer it to the virtuous consort of a king who , among so many crowned heads , enjoys almost the inestimable honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power consist in being beloved , and his glory in being just . " Our Descartes , who was the greatest philosopher in Europe before Sir Isaac Newton appeared , dedicated his Princ*ples to the celebrated Princess Palatine Elizabeth ; not , said he , because she was a princess ( for true philosophers respect princes and never flatter them ) ; but because of all his readers she understood him the best , and loved truth the most . " I beg leave , Madam , ( without comparing myself to Descartes , ) to dedicate The Henriade to your Majesty upon the like account , not only as the protectress of all arts and sciences , but as the best judge of them . " I am , with that profound respect which is due to the greatest virtue as well as the highest rank , may it please your Majesty , your Majesty 's most humble , most dutiful , and most obliged servant , " VOLTAIRE . " Readers familiar with the dedicatory epistles of that time will admit that this one is less extravagantly fulsome than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing aa idea or two . Goldsmith informs us that the queen acknowledged the homage of the poet by sending him her miniature " worth two hundred guineas . " But as Voltaire does not mention the circumstance in any of his existing letters , and as he was not the man to omit mentioning it if it had occurred , we must regard it as more than doubtful . Of the reception of La Henriade by the English public , we only know one fact : within four // years of the appearance of Voltaire 's edition , the poem was translated into English verse and published in London . It had already appeared in German , and erelong found an Italian and a Spanish translator . Voltaire presented himself as an English author during his residence in England . He published a volume in the English language in December , 1727 , of which the following was tho title , as given in a London monthly magazine : - " An Essay upon the Civil Wars of France , extracted from curious Manuscripts . And , also , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to Milton . By Mr. de Voltaire . London . Printed by Samuel Fallasson , and sold by the Booksellers of London and Westminster . 1727 . In 8vo. pagg. 130 . " We know of no copy of this work in America ; and in the works of Voltaire the Essays appear in French . The editor of the magazine , unfortunately , did not think it necessary to criticise the volume . He merely remarks , " These two Essays deserve to be read by all the curious . " Spence informs us that Pr . Young corrected one of them . The Doctor , he observes , set honestly to work and marked the passages that were most faulty ; " and when he went to explain himself about them , Voltaire could not avoid bursting out laughing in his face . " In sending a copy of his work to Dean Swift , Voltaire indulges in the strain of extravagant compliment which disfigures so many of his letters : " Have some indulgence for one of your admirers , who owes it to your writings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having the rashness to write in English . " It is in his character of observer , however , that Voltaire chiefly interests us during his stay in England . We have said enough to show that he knew the language sufficiently well to appreciate English authors , and that he had access to circles which enabled him to study the national character . Let us see what it was that he observed in England , what he studied , what impressions were made upon him . With regard to the objects of his inquiry we can justly give him the praise of being one of the most intelligent of travellers ; for , besides the lan .. guage of the country , it was its religion , its institutions , it learning , its poetry , its drama , that he studied . // In all these , and above them all , he loved the freedom that the people enjoyed , - " the noble liberty of thinking , " which he deemed the cause of whatever he found in any of them that was excellent . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different religious sects lived together in harmony . " Enter the London Exchange , " he remarks in one of his Letters upon the English , " a place more respectable than many courts . There you see the representatives of all nations assembled for a useful purpose . There the Jew , the Mahometan , and the Christian treat one another as if they were of the same religion , and give the name of infidel only to bankrupts . There the Presbyterian trusts the Anabaptist , and the ChurchofZEngland man takes the word of a Quaker . On leaving this peaceful and free assembly , some go to the Synagogue , others go to drink ; this man proceeds to be baptized in a great tub in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost ; that man circumcises his son , and causes to be muttered over the child Hebrew words which are quite unintelligible to him ; others go to their churches to await the inspiration of God with their hats on : all are content . If there was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be feared ; if there were but two , they would cut one another 's throats ; but as there are thirty , they live in peace and are happy . " The Quakers , who were still a novelty in England to foreigners , attracted the particular attention of this most unquakerlike of men . Believing , as he says , that the doctrines and history of so extraordinary a people merited the study of an intelligent man , he sought the society of one of the most famous Quakers in England , a retired merchant , who lived in a cottage near London , " well built and adorned only with its own neatness . " The curious stranger visited him in his retreat . " The Quaker was an old man of fresh complexion , who had never been sick , because lie always bad been continent and temperate . In my life I have never seen a presence more noble nor more engaging than his . He was dressed , like all those of his persuasion , in a coat without plaits at the sides , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-brimmed hat like those of our ecelesiastics. lie received me with his hat on , and advanced towards me without making the least inclination of his body ; but there was more politeness // in the open and humane expression of his countenance than there is in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other , and in that of carrying in the hand what was made to cover the head . Friend , ' said he to me , I see that thou art a stranger ; if I can be of any use to thee , thou hast only to speak . ' Sir , ' said I to him , with a bow and a step forward , according to our custom , I flatter myself that my reasonable curiosity will not displease you , and that you will be willing to do me the honor to instruct me in your religion . ' The people of thy country , ' he replied , make too many compliments and bows ; but I have never before seen one of them who had the same curiosity as thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still kept paying him bad compliments , because a man can not all at once lay aside his habits ; and , after a wholesome and frugal repast , which began and ended with a prayer to God , I began to question my host . I began with the question which good Catholics have put more than once to the Huguenots : My dear sir , ' said I , have you been baptized ? ' No , ' replied the Quaker , nor my brethren either . ' How ! Jlforbleu ! You are not Christians , then ? ' My friend , ' he mildly rejoined , swear not ; we do not think that Christianity consists in sprinkling water upon the head with a little salt . ' Heh , bon Dieu ! ' said I , shocked at this impiety ; have you forgotten , then . that Jesus Christ was baptized by John ? ' Friend , once more , no oaths , ' replied the benign Quaker : Christ received baptism from John ; but he baptized no one ; we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' cried I , how you would be burned by the Holy Inquisition . In the name of God , my dear man , let me have you baptized ! .... Art thou circumcised ? ' he asked . I replied that I had not that honor . Very well , friend , ' said he , thou art a Christian without being circumcised , and I without being baptized . ' " The conversation was continued to great length . In his report of it , Voltaire affects throughout the tone of the good Catholic , - Louis XV . being then king of France , and Cardinal de Fleuri his prime minister . He adds , that thc benign Quaker conducted him , on the following Sunday , to a Quaker meeting , where he heard one of the brethren utter a long , nonsensical harangue , " half with his mouth , half with his nose , " of which no one understood anything . He asked his friend why they permitted such silliness ( sottises ) . The Quaker answered that they were obliged to endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man got up to speak , whether he was moved by the Spirit or by folly . The Quaker meeting appears to have // effaced the good impressions of the sect which he had derived from his conversations with the retired merchant . Nevertheless , he proceeds to relate the history of the Quakers and of William Penn . He concludes by remarking that the denomination , though flourishing in Pennsylvania , was on the decline in England , because the young Quakers , enriched by their fathers ' industry , desired to enjoy the honors of public office , and to wear fashionable clothes , and to escape the reproach of belonging to a sect ridiculed by the world . In his remarks upon the Church of England , Voltaire gives us a taste of his veritable self : " One can have no public employment in England , or Ireland , without being of the number of the faithful Anglicans ; this reason , which is an excellent proof , has converted so many dissenters that to-day not a twentieth part of the nation is out of the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of convocation formerly enjoyed some credit ; at least , it had the privilege of meeting , of debating controverted points of doctrine , and of burning , now and then , some impious books , i. e. books against themselves . The Whig ministry , however , does not even permit those gentlemen to assemble , and they are reduced , in the obscurity of their parishes , to the mournful business of praying to God for a government which they would not be sorry to disturb . " " The priests are almost all married . The awkwardness which they acquire at the Universities , and the little acquaintai*ce they have here with women , usually has the effect of obliging a bishop to be contented with his own wife . The priests go to the taverns sometimes , because custom permits it ; and if they get drunk , it is in a serious way , and without scandal When they are told that in France young men , known by their debaucheries and raised to the rank of bishop by female intrigues , openly make love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly and elaborate suppers , and go from those suppers to implore the illumination of the Holy Spirit , and boldly call themselves the successors of the Apostles , then they thank God that they are Protestants . Nevertheless , they are abominable heretics , fit to be burned by all the devils , as IRabelais says ; and that is the reason why I do not meddle with their affairs . " // Upon the government of England Voltaire descants in a graver strain . Ho failed not to inform his countrymen that in England no tax could be laid , except with the consent of the King , Lords , and Commons , and that every man was assessed , not as in France according to his rank , or rather according to his want of rank , but according to his income . Nor did he omit to remark that in England the peasant 's feet were not blistered by wooden shoes . " He eats white bread ; lie is well clad ; he fears not to increase the number of his beasts , nor to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a higher tax the next year . You see many peasants who have five or six hundred pounds sterling a year , and yet do not disdain to continue to cultivate the lands that have enriched them , and upon which they live as freemen . " He observed with pleasure that the younger sons of noble families frequently entered into commerce ,  --  a thing unheard of theii in France . " I know not , however , " lie slyly remarks , " which is the more useful to a state , a well-powdered lord , who knows precisely at what hour the king gets up and goes to bed , and who gives himself airs upon playing the part of slave in a minister 's antechamber , or a merchant who enriches his country , who froni his counting-room sends orders to Surat and Cairo , and contributes to the happiness of mankind . " Of the philosophers of England , Locke and Newton were those whom he studied longest and admired most . He was one of the first of his countrymen who understood the discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularly known to France . Locke he frequently styles the wisest of human beings , and the only man who had ever written worthily upon metaphysics . Lord Bacon , he thought , " knew not Naturo , but he knew and pointed out all the paths that lead to a knowledge of her . " " He despised , early in his career , that which fools in square caps taught under the name of philosophy , in those mad-houses called colleges ; and he did all that he could to keep them from continuing to confuse the mind by their nature abhorring a vacuum , their substantial forms , and all those words which not only ignorance rendered respectable , but which a ridiculous blending with religion rendered sacred . He is the father of experimental philosophy . " All of Vol // 3* ( Voltaire 's Residence in England . taire ' s remarks upon Bacon , Newton , and Locke show that he was at home in their works , and that he comprehended the peculiar importance of each of those great men . The same praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . Shakespeare was above the reach of his genius . The fact alone that Voltaire , reading Shakespeare in Shakespeare 's own ton no , failed to perceive his superiority to all other poets and dramatists , suffices to prove to us that , great Frenchman as he was , he was not a great man . " Shakespeare , " he says , " created the English theatre . He had a genius full of force and fecundity , of nature and sublimity ; but without the least spark of good taste , and without the slightest knowledge of the rules . I am going to say something bold , but true : it is , that the merit of this author has ruined the English drama . There are such beautiful scenes , there are passages so grand and so terrible in those monstrous farces which they call tragedies , that his pieces have always been played with great success . Time , which alone gives reputation to men , renders at length their faults respectable . Most of the odd and gigantesque notions of this author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to pass for sublime . Modern authors have almost all copied them ; but that which succeeded in Shakespeare is hissed in them . " He proceeds to remark , that England has produced but one tragedy worthy to be ranked with the master-pieces of the French stage , and that was Addison* s Cato . The writings of Voltaire contain , perhaps , a hundred allusions to Shakespeare , but most of them in this tone ; and in the last piece of prose he ever wrote , he still speaks of him as an inspired barbarian . In one of his essays , in 1761 , after giving a ludicrous outline of Hamlet , he enters into an inquiry how it could be that a nation which had produced the Cato of Addison could endure such crudities . This is his reason : " The chairmen , the sailors , the hackney-coachmen , the shopmen , the butchers , and even the clergy , in England , are passionately fond of shows . Give them cock-fights , bull-fights , gladiatorial combats , funerals , witchcraft , duels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them ; and there is more than one lord as curious in these things as the populace . The people of London find in the tragedies of Shakespeare all that can please // such a taste as this . The courtiers were obliged to follow the torrent . " Two or three considerations may lessen our astonishment at Voltaire 's inveterate blindness to the transcendent merits of Shakespeare . Oiie is , that he spoke of Shakespeare precisely as the great lights of English literature , from Dryden to Goldsmith , were accustomed to speak of him . Dryden styled Troilus and Cressida " a heap of rubbish . " Dryden thought he had converted the Tempest into a tolerable play when he had spoiled it . Pope spoke of a forgotten play of the Earl of Dorset 's as " written in a much purer style than Shakespeare 's in his first plays . " Bolingbroke , as Voltaire mentions , agreed with him upon the irregularities of Shakespeare . Goldsmith speaks of the " amazing , irregular beauties of Shakespeare . " When George III . said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , " he probably expressed an opinion that prevailed in the higher circles of his time . There is reason to conclude that , when Voltaire 's Letters upon the English appeared in London , his remarks upon Shakespeare were approved by the frequenters of such houses as those of Bolingbroke , Dodington , and Pope . The customs of the French stage , in Voltaire 's day , furnish some further explanation of his insensibility to Shakespeare . The tragic drama in France was a kind of ' drawing-room pastime ,  --  decorous , artificial , high-flown , and dull . The common people attended the theatre only on festive days , when free admissions were given . This Voltaire himself records in one of his letters . To have introduced into a play the name of a prince of the reigning family , would have been deemed a very gr&amp;at audacity . No author presumed to do it till Voltaire , emboldened , as lie says , by Shakespeare 's example , brought upon the scene characters far*ious in the history of France . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the courtly audiences of that day peasants , mechanics , or any plebeian except a soldier , a valet de chambre , or a waiting maid . No one could kill another on the stage . The only killing permitted was decorous and classical s*iicide . The entire action of the play was required to be exhibited in the same apartment , and in the space of time occupied in its rep- // 879 resentation . Subject to such rules , - subject , also , to the restraints of rhyme , - what could a French tragedy be but a series of stately dialogues ? The events were not exhibited , but related . There was no coloring or naturalness , no comic interludes , no relief , no forms of salutation even ; and scarcely any of those passages like Shakespeare 's " Mercy is twice blessed , " or " All the world s a stage , " which lift the auditor out of the scene before him into the realm of abstract truth . The villains are conscious villains ; they confess themselves villains to themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shakespeare , unlike the villains of real life , who invariably use the little intellect they have in forming a theory of their situation which justifies or palliates their guilt . Accustomed to such a drama as this , Voltaire was sho*cked beyond measure at such scenes as those of the grave-diggers in Hamlet , the fool in Lear , the cobblers in Julius Ca*sar . When his Tancre*de was performed , in FT6O , the leading actress implored his consent to the erection of a scaffold upon the stage , draped in black . " My friend , " he replied , " we must fight the English , not imitate their barbarous theatre . Let us study their philosophy ; let us trample under our feet , as They do , infamous prejudices ; let us drive out the Jesuits and wolves ; let us no longer stupidly oppose inoculation and the attraction of gravitation ; let us learn from them how to cultivate land ; but let us beware of copying their savage drama . " Moreover , his self-love was interested . If Shakespeare was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traegdy , what was L ' cEdipe ? We must nevertheless repeat , that , if Voltaire had been as great a man as he was a Frenchman , he would have recovered from the wound to his self-love , and hailed the Shakespearian method as the true one . His inability to do this limits his claim to our regard , both as a human being and as an artist . It serves to explain , also , in some degree , his failure to comprehend things of higher iraportance than the drama . He succeeded little better With Milton . In many passages of his works , he ridicules the " odd and extravagant concep // tions " of that poet , to whose merit , however , he was not wholly insensible . Paradise Lost , he concludes , " is a work more peculiar than natural , fuller of imagination than of grace , and of boldness than judgment ; of which the subject is wholly ideal , and which seems not made for man . " He admired the " majestic strokes with which Milton dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant , which he gives the Devil . " The description of the Garden of Eden pleased him , as well as the " innocent loves of Adam and Eve . " But when he comes to speak of the combats between the angels and the fallen spirits , of the mountains hurled upon each other , and of the great gathering of the devils in a hall , he can see in those passages only something barbaric and ludicrous . Milton , he remarks , was a bad prose-writer , and combated the apologists of King Charh*s as a ferocious beast fights a savage . In all that he says of Milton , we perceive the influence of the English circle which he frequented . So Bolingbroke spoke of the author of Paradise Lost . It was during Voltaire 's stay in England that news was brought to the literary circle which he frequented that a daughter of Milton was living in London , old , infirm , and very poor . " In a quarter of an hour , " he tells us , " she was rich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was soliciting subscriptions for the edition of Corneille which he published for the benefit of the granddaughter of that poet , whom he had adopted and was educating . He used it as a spur to the zeal of those who were aiding him . Milton 's daughter died soon after , but not before she had related many particulars of her father 's life and habits , which Voltaire eagerly gathered and afterwards recorded . The English comedy of that time appears to have afforded the stranger much enjoyment . He complains , however , of the . indecency of the popular comedies . But he appears to have been shocked only at the indecency of the words employed , not at all at the enormous and hideous indecency of the events exhibited . " We are bound to consider , " he remarks , " that , if the Romans permitted gross expressions in the satires which only a few people read , they allowed no improper words upon the stage . For , as La Fontaine says , Chaste are the ears , // though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one should pronounce in public a word which a modest woman may not repeat . " Here we have the explanation of the fact that an Englishman in Paris and a Frenchman in London are equally astounded at the indecency of the plays which they attend . The Frenchman brings to the theatre fastidious ears , and the Englishman chaste eyes . The third and fourth acts of Tarluffe contain nothing offensive to a French audience , though it would be shocked at some of the words in the first act of Othello . An Englishwoman can endure a gross word or two in the midst of a scene otherwise proper , but would be inclined to ran out of the theatre upon the performance of a whole act of decorous seduction which threatens at every moment to be successful ; the husband of the lady being hidden under the table , and appearing only when the author has exhausted every other resource . Apropos of Tarluffe , Voltaire gives an unexpected reason for the failure in England of a comedy which has given to the English stage so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uriah Heep . He says , that before there can be false devotees there must be true ones ; and one of the great advantages of the English nation is , that it has no Tartaffes . " The English scarcely know the name of devotee ; but they know well that of honest man . You do not see there any imbeciles who put their souls into the keeping of others , nor any of those petty ambitious men who establish in a neighborhood a despotic sway over silly women formerly wanton and always weak , and over men weaker and more contemptible than they . " Would he have said as much in 1865 ? Voltaire conclu*les his reviews of English literature by remarking , that , as the English had profited much from works in the French language , so the French , in their turn , ought to borrow from them . " We have both , " he adds , " we and the English , followed the Italians , who are in everything our masters , and whom we have surpassed in some things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to give the preference ; but happy he who knows how to enjoy their different merits . " In one particular , however , he awards the palm to England : // England honored literature and learning most . In France , he says , Addison might have been member of the Academy , and might have obtained a pension by the influence of a woman ; or he might have been brought to trouble under the pretext that there might be found in his Cato some reflections upon the porter of a man in power . In England , he was Secretary of State ; Newton was Master of the Mint ; Congreve held an important office ; Prior was plenipotentiary ; Swift was dean in Ireland , and much more considered there than the primate ; and if Pope 's religion kept him out of office , it did not prevent his gaining two hundred thousand francs by his translation of Homer . " What encourages most the men of letters in England is the consideration in which they are held . The portrait of the prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own study ; but I have seen that of Mr. Pope in twenty houses . " Voltaire lived two years in England . In 1728 , before the copies of La Henriade had been all delivered to the subscribers , the capricious tyranny which had banished him permitted his return to France . He had abandoned himself so entirely to the study of English , that when he resumed the habit of writing in French it was some time before he could use it with his former freedom . It is scarcely possible to overstate the influence upon his mind and writings of his residence in England . The index to his works contains more than a thousand references to English authors , English learning , English customs , English laws , and especially English freedom . His letters are full of England and the English . " The French , " he says in one of them , " are not public-spirited ; hard and trifling nation , they have not even the word . " In another he observes : " The love of law has become a passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the keeping of the law . " In and other : " In England a man must be all Whig or all Tory . " In another : " We have been obliged to adopt their natural philosophy , to imitate their system of finance , to build ships after their plans ; when shall we imitate them in their noble liberty of giving the mind all the play ( essor ) of which it is capable ? When shall fools cease to hunt down the wise ? " In // another : " Last year ( 1752 ) the Bishop of Worcester preached in London , before Parliament , in favor of inoculation . Such sermons are of more value than the twaddle of our preachers . " In another : " In truth , we are the whipped cream of Europe ; there are not twenty Frenchmen who understand Newton . " We could fill many pages with such passages as these , all tending to show that it was this residence in England which completed Voltaire 's education as a thinking man , and gave tone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after his return to France , he was in his company one evening when the conversation turned upon England , and one of the company " undertook to revile " both the language and the authors of that country . Diderot defended them , but not with much success . Voltaire listened in silence to the dispute till midnight ; which was the more surprising , because , as Goldsmith remarks , this was one of his favorite topics . But , at last , " Voltaire appeared roused from his reverie . His whole frame seemed animated . He began his defence with the utmost elegance mixed with spirit , and now and then lie let fall his finest strokes of raillery upon his antagonist ; and his harangue lasted until three in the morning . I must confess that , whether from national partiality , or from the elegant sensibility of his manner , I never was more charmed , nor did I ever remember so absolute a victory as he gained in this dispute . " We observe in the volumes of his letters that he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . Among his English correspondents were Bolingbroke , Lady Bolingbroke , Swift , Falkener , Hume , Robertson , Lord Lyttelton , Horace Walpole , Lord Chatham , and Colman . To his friend Falkener he dedicated his tragedy of Zaire , and to him he wrote the long series of letters in the English language which appear in the volumes of Letires In6dites . In 1748 , he had the pleasure of congratulating him upon his marriage to a connection of the Duke of Marlborough , and upon his appointment to be secretary to the Duke of Cumberland , commanding the English army in Flanders . This letter shows that twenty years ' absence from England had not made him forget his English . // " A M. LE CHEVALIER FALKENER . LUN*nLLE , * Ia Cour de Lorraine , le 5 Novembre , 1748 .

I do present your lady with my most humble respects , and I kiss your child . " You are a lusty husband , and I a weak bachelor , as much unhealthy as when you saw me , but some twenty years older . Yet I have a kind of conformity with you ; for if you are attached to a hero , so I am in the retinue of another , though not so intimately as you are .

I find a great delight in opening my heart to you , and in giving you thus an account of my conduct . I will tell you that , being appointed also historiographer of France , I write the history of the late fatal war , which did much harm to all the parties ; and did good only to the king of Prussia .

It has the fate of moral books that please many , without mending anybody . I am now , // my dear friend , at the court of King Stanislas , where I have passed some months with all the easiness and cheerfulness that I enjoyed once at Wandsworth ; for you must know that King Stanislas is a kind of Falkener He is indeed the best man alive .

" I have at Paris some enemies , such as Pope had at London ; and I despise them as he did . In short , I live as happy as my condition can permit . " Excepto quod non simul esses , cetera ketus ! ' I return you a thousand thanks , my dearest and worthy friend . I wish you all the happiness you deserve ; and I 11 he yours for ever . " VOLTAIRE. ** Voltaire was the last man in the world to hide any light that he possessed under a bushel . He was nothing , if not communicative . There never was a person so little reticent . The whole of his long life was a ceaseless acquiring and imparting . La Ifenriade was the result of his conversations with a man familiar with the times of Henry IV . His History of Charles XII . came of his chance acquaintance with a person who had been part of that history . His Elements of Newton grew out of his sympathy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew a thing than he was on fire to communicate it . He says truly of himself , that he had a " passion " to make known to France the masterpieces of other nations , - their science , their wisdom , their history . He labored for thirty years to overcome the scruples of the French against inoculation . This instinct of communication being so powerful in him , we can not wonder that his English experience , so novel , so interesting , so triumphant , should have strongly in-. fluenced all his subsequent writings . To state the effect upon France of his English knowledge , would be to state the causes of the French Revolution . The most remarkable pages in Mr. Buckle 's History of Civilization are two in his first volume which contain a catalogue of names of French authors who , during the reign of Louis XV. , studied the language and the authors of England . Those two pages // prove that every person who influenced France at that period drew inspiration from English sources . And this was chiefly Voltaire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1730 ,  --  letters written with all his vivacity and wit , - disclosed to the intelligence of France glimpses of an unknown and enchanting world ; for at that day France was as far from England as Australia now is from the United States . Not twenty Frenchmen , probably , could then read English . The philosophy of Bacon , Newton , and Locke had scarcely been heard of , save by a few men of learning . The poetry and literature , the Church , the institutions , the customs of England , were all unknown . Voltaire partly lifted the veil , and revealed enough to excite a desire to see more . The French government , too , by placing its ineffectual ban upon the work , added to it the charm of forbidden fruit . It drove Voltaire from Paris ; but finding a retreat in the chateau of Madame du Chatelet , he endured seventeen years of solitude , during which he had no resource against ennui but in literary labors of the same tendency . Nothing would have been easier than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not at all inclined to be a martyr . No man in France was more disposed to make himself comfortable in the world . A smile now and then from the king , a place , and a pension , would have kept his restive pen under curb . The government chose to make an enemy of him . It had reached that point of blindness and folly which never yet ended except in destruction . Within fifteen years after Voltaire had published his English letters , it was truly said by a French writer that in France English held the rank of a learned language . " Our women study it , and have abandoned Italian in order to study the language of this philosophic people . There is not any of us who does not desire to learn English . " The prevalence of this taste can be directly traced to Voltaire . The very fashions of England were adopted in Paris to an extent that was ridiculous . Many of our readers remember , perhaps , the letter of the eccentric Count Lauragunis , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ; a strange and sudden revolution has happened in our dress , equipages , furniture , kitchens , and diversions . Our dandies , // who formerly were dressed , painted , and perfumed like dolls at ten in the morning , now ride in the environs of Paris in a plain shirt and frock , like English jockeys . Our delicate ladies , who never ventured to stir out iii the morning , run all over Paris and frequent the public walks , in the genteel and loose dress of milkmaids . Our carriages are neat , plain , and convenient . Horse-races are frequent ; our stables are full of English hunters and grooms ; and our whips , saddles , and boots are manufactured by your countrymen , who have reduced ours to beggary . We have introduced roast beef and puddings in lieu of our soups , ragouts , and fricassee . We hunt , swear , drink toasts , and determine all disputes by bets , like your nobility and gentry , " etc. , etc . Seven years later , Voltaire published his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular , entertaining statement of the contents of the Principia . This work had a twofold effect . Besides overturning and flually abolishing the old philosophy , it excited that universal taste for science which prevailed in Europe during the thirty years preceding the Revolution , and which was a potent cause of that Revolution . This work , too , was forbidden ; which greatly assisted to give it currency , and to make the intellect of France a solid phalanx against the old r6girne . That was the secret of the French Revolution . When the established order of things in Church or State is such that every man of sense and feeling is necessarily its foe , one of two things must speedily come to pass , - reform or revolution . Little , indeed , could such a man as Voltaire have affected the march of events , if he had not had the constant and mighty co-operation of an absolute king . Voltaire wrote , and the king served him as advertising agent . The correspondence of Voltaire must have been an important element of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , were written under restraint , or for a purpose which compelled him to take the tone of the great world . The great mass of them , however , written to old friends and sclioolfellows , breathe the spirit of liberty . Opening a volume at random , we aru likely enough to fall upon such a letter as the following , which may serve to show his habit of mind . It was written to the Marquis d'Argenson , from Holland , in 1143. // " Be Chancellor of France , Monsieur , if you wish me to return ; restore to us the glory of literature , since we are losing that of arms . Men were made originally , it seems to me , to think , to instruct one another , and not to kill one another . Would that war were the only persecution which the arts experience ! I groan at seeing that poor Abb6 Langlet shut up at seventy in the Bastille , after having given us a good method of studying history , and some excellent chronological tables . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sixth volume of Supplements to the history of that good citizen , President de Thou , was a crime of state ? What a climax of barbarity , and what an extreme of littleness , not to permit us to print hooks which explain Newton , and which say that the reveries of Descartes are rev-eries ! " I prefer the abuse of liberty practised in Holland of printing one 's thoughts , to that slavery to which they wish to reduce the human mind in France . If they go on in this train , what will remain to us but the remembrance of the glory of the beautiful age of Louis XIV. ? " This doctrine might make me desire to establish myself in the country where I now am . Having nothing to aspire to here , I should have nothing to complain of . I should live tranquil , and wish France more brilliant days . " There are here some very estimable men . The Hague is a delicious place in summer , and liberty renders the winters less rude . I love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are parties here , it is true , as there must be in a republic ; but the spirit of party detracts nothing from the love of country : I see great men opposed to great men . " I am very glad , for the honor of poetry , that there is a poet here " ( Van Haren ) " who has helped to procure succors for the queen of Hungary , and that the trumpet of war has been the very humble servant of the lyre of Apollo . I see , on the other hand , with not less adiniration , one of the principal members of the government , who is of the peace party , walking in the streets unattended , inhabiting a house fit for those Roman consuls who cooked their own vegetables , spent scarcely two thousand florins a year upon themselves , and gave more than twenty thousand to indigent families . " These great examples escape most travellers ; but are not such curiosities better worth seeing than the processions at Rome , the priests at the Capitol , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of genius , - these are my miracles ! " This government would please you infinitely , evcn with the faults that are inseparable from it . It is wholly municipal , which is just that which you love . Besides , the Hague is the place of news and of // books . It is properly the city of ambassadors , whose society is always very useful to one who wishes to instruct himself . You see them all here in one day . They go out , they return home ; every street is a promenade ; you can show yourself or remain in privacy , just as you like . It is Fontninebleau with no court to make . " A volume of letters in this tone could be selected from his correspondence . Perhaps we could find a thousand explosions like the following : " What a dog of a country is France , where a man can not utter what he thinks ! They speak their mind in England , - what harm comes of it ? Does the liberty of thinking hinder the English from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! French ! in v in you drive out the Jesuits . You are still only half men ! " When we consider that Voltaire was in correspondence with all the influential men and women of his time , that his letters , from the celebrity of their author , were handed about , preserved , and very frequently printed , we may form some estimate of their effect upon public opinion during the half-century preceding the evolution . Voltaire failed not to notice , what the people of the United States have frequently had to deplore , the inconsistencies of the English character . The witty Frenchman observed* the contradictions of English history , but he was philosopher enough to know that inconsistency is not English , but human . " Divide the human race , " he says , " into twenty parts . Nineteen of them are composed of those who labor with their hands , and who will never know that there has been such a man as Locke in the world . In the remaining twentieth part how few there are that read ! and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one who studies philosophy . The number of people who think is exceedingly small . " While this description of the human race remains substantially true , let us never be surprised at inconistencies in the acts or the feelings of a nation .
