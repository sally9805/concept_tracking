txt ART . YJII. - View of the State of Europe during the lJliddle Ages . By HENRY HALLAM , LL . D. , F. R. A. S. , Foreign Associate of the Institute of France . Boston : Crosby , Nichols , Lee , &amp; Co. 1861. 3 vols . Small 8vo. pp. xiv . and 484 , 404 , 488 . THE recent appearance of these volumes - the first instalment of a new and elegant edition of Mr. ilallam 's Works - affords a fit occasion for presenting some remarks on his character as an historian , and for re-examining his separate books with reference to their intrinsic merits and to their relative place in English literature . Of the personal history of this eminent man comparatively little is known even by the bestinformed readers . It is not necessary , however , for the proper execution of our purpose at this time , to retrace the outlines of his life , or to attempt any estimate of his character as it was exhibited either at home or in society . Few persons ever projected less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no light would be thrown on our subject by a narrative of events whose influence was scarcely felt beyond the domestic circle . In Mr. ilallam we see a man of a singularly // Jan. cool temperament dealing with the vexed questions of history and criticism without anythii*g of personal or party bias ; and his works are to be considered as almost purely intellectual productions . Reserving , therefore , a sketch of his personal history for another opportunity , we design now to confine ourselves to an examination of his historical writings , irrespective of his life and character . The first work which brought him prominently before the public was his " View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages , " published in 1818 . Nearly twenty-five years had then elapsed since the death of Gibbon , the last of the three illustrious historians , who , in the latter half of the preceding century , had enriched English literature by their writings , and secured for themselves a place among the most distinguished authors of any age or nation . This interval had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant letters ; but it had produced few historical compositions of permaiient interest and worth . During this period the revival of English poetry had occurred , and most of the poems of Byron , Shelley , Coleridge , and Wordsworth had been written ; a few young men , accidentally brought together in the Scottish capital , had started the Edinburgh Review , and its establishment had been followed by a remarkable change in the general character of periodical criticism , which at once became more elevated and more searching ; Sir Walter Scott had published the first of the Waverley Novels , and had shown what are the capabilities of the historical romance ; and physical and intellectual science had been diligently cultivated by men whose names are as familiar as household words . But historical literature had not shared in this progress ; and although during this interval the poet Southey had composed an elaborate History of Brazil , " and Turner , Coxe , IRoscoe , Malcolm Laing , and other writers , had sought to illustrate various portions of British and Continental history , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear their mantles . It was under these circumstances that Mr. Hallam gave to the world the first acknowledged fruits of his historical studies , and at once acquired a reputation of the first order . He was // 1861.1 IIALLAM AS AN hISTORIAN . then forty years of age , and in the full maturity of all his intellectual powers . His qualificatibns for the task which he had assumed were peculiar . He had been educated as a lawyer ; and his legal studies had given him the skill in sifting testimony , and had fostered the habits of clearness and precision in statement , which are of the first importance to an historian . At the same time , he had never presented himself as an advocate at the bar , and he had not acquired the narrowness of view and the disposition to distort facts to which an ambition for forensic success has sometimes been thought to lead . He had not , indeed , enjoyed the advantage of sitting in Parliament , to which Gibbon ascribed so beneficial an effect in qualifying any one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutest details of Parliamentary history , as well as with the whole course of social and political progress in England . Nor was his knowledge confined to these subjects alone . His acquaintance with the classical writers of antiquity , with the medieval authors , and with the languages and literatures of the priiicipal nations on the Continent , was scarcely less exact and comprehensive . His memory was tenacious ; and the facts which he had amassed had been carefully digested , and were always ready at command . His views as to the province of history were more enlarged than those of his immediate predecessors ; and he had a deeper sense of the duties and responsibilities of an historian . " The philosophy of history , " he said in his first work , " embraces far more than the wars and treaties , the factions and cabals of common political narration ; it extends to whatever illustrates the character of the human species in a particular period , - to their reasonings and sentiments , their arts and industry . " His principles were liberal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . His researches had been thorough , and sometimes exhaustive ; and his historical theories had been long and carefully weighed . In society he has been described as disputatious , but a taste for controversy is not one of the characteristic features of his writings . Such a man was not likely to base his conclusions on insufficient premises , or to be hasty in publishing his opinions ; and no important change in his method of dealing with historical // or literary questions occurred between his earliest and his latest works . What he was a*t the outset of his literary career , he was through its whole course ; and the same moral and intellectual qualities were exhibited in the " View of the Middle Ages , " which were shown in the " Introduction to the Literature of Europe , " published more than twenty years afterward . In each work we find abundant evidence of vast and various erudition , as well as of candor and impartiality ,  --  of sober judgment , as well as of intellectual acuteness . In the breadth and accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as the most important qualification of an historian , Mr. Hallam is scarcely surpassed by Gibbon , while in this respect he is much superior to ilume and Robertson . His text offers to us only the ripened fruits of a thoroughly cultivateA mind ; and his notes are immense storehouses of curious and minute learning , often drawn from recondite sources , and indicating a range of previous reading seldom attempted in England , except by some laborious drudge . " I have quoted to my recollection , " he says in the Preface to his latest work , and we suppose the remark is not less true of his other books , " no passage which II have not seen in its own place ; though I may possibly have transcribed in some instances , for the sake of convenience , from a secondary authority . " The plan of each of his works included the discussion of a great variety of topics , and though he is much better informed as to some of them than he is as to others , there are very few which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has not shed much light . It is true , that some parts of his " View of the Middle Ages " have been pronounced superficial ; but this is the judgment of those writers alone who were disappointed or aggrieved that greater prominence is not assigned to the topics in which they were most interested . Indeed , the extent of his researches and the copiousness of his information on these very topics have been frequently attested by writers who had made them a specialty ; and since Mr. ILIallam 's death , a distinguished mathematician , Mr. Do Morgan , has publicly borne witness to the fulness and accuracy of his history of mathematical studies during the Middle Age , - one of the subjects as to which it // has sometimes been alleged that his knowledge was insufficient . On this point no higher authority could be cited ; nor could a more explicit declaration be des'ired . " Were IL to write the History of Mathematics , " says Mr. IDe Morgan , in a letter to the London Athen*um , " I should certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion whom I should be glad to cite in my favor , and bound to oppose with reason when I differed from him . " This thorough and accurate acquaintance with every fact relating to the subject before him is , perhaps , the most noteworthy element in Mr. Hallam 's character as an historian , though the greatest prominence is not usually assigned to it in speaking of his works . Without it he could not have secured the place among English historians which he has long maintained by universal consent ; for his writings exhibit few graces of style when compared with the productions of other historians of the same rank . In this respect there can scarcely be a greater contrast than that which exists between Mr. Hallam 's books and Hume 's " History of England . " The latter work is marked by a notorious carelessness and by frequent misrepresentations ; but it has secured a permanent place in English literature by its simple beauty of style , scarcely less than by its happy blending of general observations and philosophical reflections with the narrative . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we feel entire confidence that we are under the guidance of a writer whose knowledge of his subject is ample , and who bases his statements on a personal examination of the authorities cited , while we constantly miss the transparent simplicity of Hume ' s unambitions style . This amplitude of knowledge , however , would be insufficient , and indeed worthless , if it were not accompanied by equal acuteness in determining the real worth of any authority , and in deciding between conflicting accounts of the same transaction ; *nd this quality Mr. Hallam also possesses in large measure . Though he had a firm belief in the truths of religion , his mind was naturally sceptical ; and he brought to the examination of all historical questions a disposition to investigate them thoroughly for himself , and a determination to take as little as possible on trust . His discussion of them shows the effect of // his legal training , and is uniformly marked by great logical skill . Many of his notes afford striking illustrations of his acuteness in detecting mistakes and misrepresentations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind was not by nature analytical ; and while he was acute in investigating facts , his literary criticisms , though for the most part judicious , often fail to lay bare the heart of the subject . Of this defect he seems to have been fully aware ; and in the Preface to his " Introduction to the Literature of Europe , " he expressly says , that he does not wish the work " to be considered as a book of reference on particular topics , in which point of view it must often appear to disadvantage , " - adding , that , " if it proves of any value , it will be as an entire and synoptical work . " In one word , Mr. Hallam is to be regarded as a philosophical historian , rather than as a philosophical critic . Closely connected with these fundamental qualities of knowledge and discrimination is a third characteristic not less obvious in any analysis of Mr. Hallam 's character , - his extreme caution . We have already referred to his disinclination to quote anything at second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original sources of information . But his caution is even more apparent when it becomes necessary for him to express an opinion on any doubtful point . Numerous illustrations of this characteristic will occur to every one who is familiar with his writings . They are found in all his works ; but we are inclined to think they are most numerous in the eighth chapter of his " View of the Middle Ages , " which treats of the early Constitutional History of England . Thus , in speaking of the origin of county representation in Parliament , he says : " Since there is no sufficient proof whereon to decide , we can only say with hesitation , that there may have been an instance of county representation in the fifteenth year of John . " Such passages show at once the cautiousness and the candor of a writer , and are among the most convincing proofs that he is entitled to confidence when his language assumes a more positive tone . Passing now from these qualities , which are exhibited in an equal degree perhaps by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral and intellectual traits in // respect to which Mr. ilallam has fewer rivals , and no superior . Of these the most conspicuous is his impartiality ; and here his pre-eminence is at present undisputed . " On a general survey , says Lord Macaulay , " we do not scruple to pronounce the Constitutional History the most impartial book that we ever read . " This strong commendation is almost equally applicable to his other works , and has been sanctioned by the concurrent testimony of nearly an entire generation of readers , though at the time of its publication the book referred to was fiercely attacked by some of the party journals . With the blindness of partisan malice , they denied that Mr. Hallam possessed even this merit ; and one writer , Mr. Southey , went so far as to assert , that the author " carried into the history of the past , not merely the maxims of his own age , as infallible laws by which all former actions are to be tried , but the spirit and the feeling of the party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogance , its injustice and its ill-temper . " But this grave charge is utterly unfounded . There is not a page in either of Mr. Hallam 's works which is acrimonious , arrogant , or ill-tempered ; and few writers have endeavored more sedulously , or more successfully , to avoid even the appearance of injustice . His path often lies across the battlefields on which rival biographers , historians , and critics have contended with characteristic bitterness ; but he never suffers himself to be drawn aside by either faction , or to become the advocate and apologist of any party . Yet he never exhibits that weak and timeserving spirit which regards with an indifferent eye virtue and vice , liberality and bigotry , the cause of popular rights and the cause of irresponsible power . Tyranny , indeed , and injustice , " he says , " will by all historians , not absolutely servile , be noted with moral reprobation " ; and it is in the spirit of this declaration that all his writings are composed . Mr. Hallam 's impartiality does not proceed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discusses , but from the moderation of his views , and the calmness of his judgment . Extreme opinions find little favor in his eyes . He was a Whig ; but he was a Whig educated at Oxford , and this circumstance doubtless exerted a very fortunate influence on the // character of his writings . Even when he expresses the strongest disapprobation of any system of policy , or pronounces the most unfavorable opinion as to the character of any individual , or any body of men , he never suffers himself to lapse into partisanship , and his language has the calmness and dignity of a judicial opinion . Unlike Mr. Carlyle , he never attempts to make a man odious by personal abuse , and in his delineation of character he uses other colors beside black and white . It is this moderation in his views - this inflexible determination to follow the narrow path between the mountain and the seawhich , as we conceive , constitutes Mr. Hallam 's least questionable title to a place among the greatest historians who have written in our language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very hard to hold moderate opinions . Akin to this important element in the character of a great historian , is a modesty unfortunately as rare as it is praiseworthy . Though Mr. Hallam 's information on nearly every topic is so copious , his whole tone is singularly free from pedantry and dogmatism ; and , as we have already intimated , his language is never positive unless he is perfectly sure of his ground . He does not disparage other writers ; nor does he boast of his own labors . He makes no pretension to a knowledge which he does not possess , and if he has occasion to cite any authority which he has not personally examined , or to refer to any fact beyond his personal observation , he never fails to mention the circumstance . Thus , when speaking of the controversy respecting the authorship of the treatise De Imitatione Christi , he commences an elaborate note with the declaration , " I am not prepared to state the external evidence upon this keenly debated question with sufficient precision . " In quoting some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he introduces them with the modest confession , " The following remarks on Pulci 's style come from a more competent judge than myself . " Of Lord Stuart of Rothsay 's collection of ancient Portuguese songs , he says : " I have been favored by my noble friend the editor with the loan of a copy , though my ignorance of the language prevented me from forming an exact judgment of its contents . " At the same time , it is certain from other passages that he had a // 171 1861. sufficient knowledge of Portuguese to read portions of this very book with some degree of ease . Many other passages of a similar character might be cited in illustration of this honorable trait ; but it is needless to multiply instances of the direct manifestation of a quality which underlies all of Mr. Hallam 's writings . Only one other prominent characteristic of his works remains to be noticed . We mean their clearness of statement . On every subject which Mr. Hallam examines , either cursorily or at length , his views are free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are judiciously arranged , according to a definite and well-considered plan ; his narrative is luminous ; and his judgments are expressed in no ambiguous terms . In his own mind he had a clear view of his subject under all its relations ; and therefore he had no difficulty in conveying a clear view of it to other minds . Occasionally , indeed , he presupposes in his readers a degree of familiarity with his subject which many of them perhaps do not possess , especially in his first two works ; and in his " Introduction to the Literature of Europe " his plan is faulty in not combining in a single view all that is said of each writer under different heads . With the qualification implied in this remark , his writings can not be justly charged with obscurity of thought or ambiguity of expression ; and these defects , if they are to be regarded as such , do not affect the substantial excellence of his works . In distinctness of purpose and general clearness of statement , his books leave little to be desired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian are well founded , he may be briefly described as learned , acute , and cautious , candid in the discussion of controverted questions , sober in judgment , moderate in his opinions , modest in the estimate of his own labors and the expression of his own views , and luminous in statement . To combine these various qualities in one consistent and balanced character , it was only necessary that he should have a firm grasp of his subject ; and this additional merit will be readily conceded to him . However various may be the topics which he has to discuss , and into whatever paths his inquiries may lead , lie is always the master of his subject , and holds it steadily in view . // His philosophy of history , too , is sound and comprehensive . He recognizes a general progress of the human mind ; but it is not a uniform progress , and occasionally yields to a retrograde movement . " The trite metaphors of light and darkness , of dawn and twilight , " he says , " are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle . Ages , and suggest by analogy an uninterrupted progression , in which learning , like the sun , has dissipated the shadows of barbarism . But with closer attention , it is easily seen that this is not a correct representation ; that , taking Europe generally , far from being in a more advanced stage of learning at the beginning of the fifteenth century than two hundred years before , she had in many respects gone backwards , and gave little sign of any tendency to recover her ground . There is , in fact , no security , as far as the past history of mankind assures us , that any nation will be uniformly progressive in science , arts , or letters ; nor do I perceive , whatever may be the current language , that we can expect this with much greater confidence of the whole civilized world . " Nor does he regard great men - the leaders in the world 's progress , the poets , statesmen , or philosophers of any age - as merely fulfilling an apparent law of demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " for the want of great men in any period ; - nature does not think fit to produce them . They are no creatures of education and circumstance . " The underlying principles on which his works are composed present , indeed , a strong contrast to the materialistic philosophy according to which Mr. Buckle proposes to write " The History of Civilization in England . " Mr. Hallam does not confound the ineradicable distinctions of race ; nor does he find the cause of a peculiar civilization in the adventitious circumstances of climate , food , soil , and the general aspects of nature , or trace the growth of poetry to the prevalence of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions . Such superficial views find no place in his works , which are conceived in a very different spirit , and wrought from very different materials , from those on which Mr. Buckle bases his conclusions . Mr. Hallam 's style , considered merely as such , presents few salient features to provoke adverse criticism , or to invite com // mendation ; and it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected . If it seldom rises into sustained eloquence , it seldom falls below the level of the subject , and is always free from the admixture of foreign idioms . It is less stately and sonorous than Gibbon 's , less simple and lucid than ilume 's , less graceful and flowing than Robertson 's , and it exhibits none of the rapid movement and breadth of illustration which characterize the immortal work of Lord Macaulay . It is not so good as Prescott 's and Irving 's , but it is incomparably better than Bancroft 's . In this respect , however , it is not easy , nor perhaps quite just , to compare Mr. ilallam 's works with histories composed on an entirely different plan . Laws , institutions , and customs are the topics of which he treats ; and these do not require or permit so much variety of expression and briskness of movement as we demand in compositions more strictly narrative in form , and into which the details of battles and sieges and the pomp and ceremony of courts may enter . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement , and ease and simplicity of diction , changing only with the varying interest of the topics discussed . That Mr. ilallam 's works contain few passages of genuine eloquence , and that his imagery is often tawdry and commonplace , must be ascribed to the poverty of his imagination , as compared with the affluence of his mind in other respects . His strength lay in his ability to deal with abstract questions , and to trace the relations of cause and effect along the course of events , rather than in the faculty of reproducing to his own mind the common life of a past age ; and this defect is reflected even in his style , which is seldom or never picturesque . In passing from this general survey of Mr. Hallam 's works to an examination of them in detail , little need be added to what has been said already ; and any discussion of the manner in which he has treated particular topics would be foreign to our purpose . By many persons his first book is regarded as his greatest production . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to any previous publication of its kind in our language , and the labors of no subsequent writer have diminished its value as a masterly account of the social and 15* // political condition of Europe from the invasion of France by Clovis , in 486 , to the expedition of Charles VIII . against Naples , in 1494 . Indeed , the only sketch of this period which can be compared with it is the preliminary dissertation in Robertson 's " History of the Reign of Charles V. " ; but notwithstanding Mr. ilallam 's great inferiority to Robertson in the command of a fluent and graceful style , his " View " is in every other respect a much more satisfactory production . It is more profound , more exact , more comprehensive in plan , and more copious in illustration . Its object , as he remarks in his Preface , is " to exhibit , in a series of historical dissertations , a comprehensive survey of the chief circumstances that can interest a philosophical inquirer during the period usually denominated the Middle Ages . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the history of France , of the origin and decline of the Feudal System , of the history of Italy , Spain , Germany , the Greeks and Saracens , and Ecclesiastical Power in the Middle Ages , of the Constitutional History of England , and of the State of Society . To this distribution of topics no valid objection can be taken . It presents , under a judicious arrangement , and with but little repetition , all the facts that are necessary for the proper execution of Mr. Hallam 's design , together with a sketch of the history of each of the principal kingdoms which had existed during this period . From the comprehensiveness of his plan , some omissions occur , but they are of comparatively little importance ; and whether we consider the work as a whole , or examine its separate parts , it must be regarded as a splendid monument of the author 's various learning , his unwearied industry , and his humane and liberal principles . It is a striking proof of the conscientiousness with which his researches were conducted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that thirty years after this work was published Mr. ilallam returned to the subject , and gave to a new generation of readers a supplementary volume of notes and illustrations , which have been carefully embodied in the subsequent editions . Mr. Hallam 's next work was to some extent a continuation of his first , though its plan was far more limited , and embraced only one of the topics which had formerly engaged his atten // tion . In the eighth chapter of his " View of the Middle Ages , " he had traced the Constitutional History of England through the Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods to the accession of Henry VII. , and had shown the gradual rise of free institutions and the dawn of English liberty . At this point , which is only a few years earlier than the event selected by Mr. Hallam as marking the close of the Middle Age , he resumes the discussion and carries it forward to the accession of George III . This period of nearly four centuries is the most momentous in English history , and includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of any other age or nation . In tracing its history Mr. Hallam has occasion to deal with nearly all the great questions about which Whigs and Tories had contended for the last two centuries , and to clear the ground from the abundant misrepresentations of Hume and other partisan writers . When he wrote , party spirit raged with a fury but little abated by the lapse of time , and on few or none of the fundamental questions relating to the theory of the Constitution was there even a substantial agreement among historical critics . Yet Mr. Hallam never allows himself to swerve from the line of a rigid impartiality , and he treats every topic with equal candor . It is this quality , always rare among English historians when speaking of the political changes and revolutions in their own country , which forms the crowning merit of " The Constitutional History of England . " Other historians have shown equal or even greater familiarity with the course of events , and an equally vigorous understanding ; but no one else has exhibited such entire freedom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after the publication of this History , and when he was in his sixtieth year , Mr. Hallam published the first volume of his third and last work , to which he gave the modest title of " Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth , Sixteenth , and Seventeenth Centuries . " Like the preceding work it was suggested by his early studies , and the first three chapters were designed partly as an expansion and partly as a correction of the statements in the ninth chapter of the " View of the Middle Ages . " Its design included notices of nearly // every distinguished writer in the cultivated nations of modern Europe ; but it was impossible within the limits which he had assigned to himself to treat any subject much in detail , or to present any exhaustive criticisms . Hence , there is an inequality of execution in the different parts of the work ; and not unfrequently the real grounds on which an author 's position depends are missed . It would be obviously unfair to Mr. Hallam to compare so compendious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works which treat of the literature of a single people only . But if we bear in mind the precise objects which he had in view , and consider his work as a whole , rather than in its several parts , its great excellence will be generally admitted by competent critics . It worthily closed Mr. Hallam 's labors as an historian and critic , and gave roundness and completeness to the series of his writings . Twentyone years afterward he breathed his last . His position in English literature was settled beyond the probability of change even before his death ; and no historian is held at the present time in more honorable estimation . On many points his authority is undisputed ; and on all , his opinions have much weight . His influence , both direct and indirect , has been very widely and deeply felt ; and few of his judgments have been overruled , or seem likely to be affected by more extensive researches , or by the discovery of new sources of information . This is especially true of his opinions on the controverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best characteristics as an historian are very clearly exhibited . No one now entertains the views on these topics which were very generally received before the " Constitutional History " was published ; and the change in the common judgment concerning them may be ascribed in no small degree to Mr. Hallain 's labors . A new spirit was breathed into this important study ; more accurate researches have been made ; and a more liberal and candid tone has been adopted . A more searching analysis has been applied to the examination of the primary sources of information ; and a more profound philosophy has traced the connection of events and exhibited their mutual dependence . For the whole period covered by this great work , Mr. Hahlam is an eminently trustworthy // guide ; and the same remark will apply to his " View of the Middle Ages . " B is " IntroduCtioli to the Literature of Europe " has undoubtedly exerted much less influence than his other works , though few books are more frequently cited by writers on literary history , or can be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual progress of Europe .
