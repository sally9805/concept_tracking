Appleton 398 The Man without a Country Edward Everett Hale 448 Main text THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE UNDER DIFFICULTIES ; AND WHAT CAME OF IT . " MR . GEER ! " Mr. Geer was unquestionably asleep . This certainly did not indicate a sufficiently warm appreciation of Mrs. Geer 's social charms ; but the enormity of the offence will be greatly modified by a brief review of the attending circumstances . If you will but consider that the crackling of burning wood in a huge Franklin stove is strongly soporific in its tendencies ,  --  that the cushion of a capacious arm-chair , constructed and adjusted as if with a single eye to a delicious doze , nay , to a long succession of dozes , is a powerful temptation to a sleepy soul ,  --  that the regular , and , it must be confessed , somewhat monotonous click , click , click of Mrs. Geer 's knittingneedles only served to measure , without disturbing the silence ,  --  and , lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  you will not cease to wonder that Mr. Geer " was glorious , O'er all the ills of life victorious . " To most men , an interruption at such a time would have been particularly annoying ; but when Mrs. Geer spoke in that way , Mr. Geer , asleep or awake , always made a point of hearing ; so he roused himself , and turned his round , honest face and placid blue eyes on the partner of his bosom , who went on ,  --  " Mr. Geer , our Ivy will be seventeen , come fall . " " Possible ? " replied Mr. Geer . " Who ' d ' a ' thunk it ? " Mr. Geer , as you may infer , was eminently a free-thinker , or rather , a free-actor , in respect of irregular verbs . In fact , he tyrannized over all parts of speech : wrested nouns and verbs from their original shape , till you could hardly recognize their distorted faces ; and committed that next worst sin to murdering one 's mother , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was absolutely fascinating . Having delivered his opinion thus sententiously , he at once subsided , closed his placid eyes , and retired into his inner world of  --  thought , perhaps . " Mr. Geer ! " This time he fairly jumped from his seat , and cast about him scared , blinking eyes . " Mr. Geer , how can you sleep away your precious time so ? " " Sleep ? I  --  I  --  am sure , I was never wider awake in my life . " " Well , then , tell me what I said . " " Said ? Eh ,  --  eh ,  --  something about Ivy , was n't it ? " And Mr. Geer nervously twitched up the skirts of his coat , and replaced his awry cushion , and began to think that perhaps , after all , he had been asleep . But Mrs. Geer was too much interested in the subject of her own cogitations to pursue her victory further ; so she answered ,  --  " Yes , and what is a-going to become of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter ? " asked Mr. Geer , wildly . " Matter ? Why , she ' ll be seventeen , come fall , and does n't know a thing . " " O Lud ! that all ? That a' n't nothin ' . " And Mr. Geer settled comfortably down into his arm-chair once more . He felt decidedly relieved . Visions of small-pox , cholera , and throat-distemper , the worst evils that he could think of and dread for his darling , had been conjured up by his wife 's words ; and when he found the real state of the case , a great burden , which had suddenly fallen on his heart , was as suddenly lifted . " But I tell you it is something , " continued Mrs. Geer , energetically . " Ivy is ' most a woman , and has never been ten miles from home in her life , and to no school but our little district  --  " " And she ' s as pairk a gal , " interrupted Mr. Geer , " as any you ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other who she will . " " She ' s well enough in her way , " replied Mrs. Geer , in all the humility of motherly pride ; " and so much the more reason why she should n't be let go so . There ' s Mr. Dingham sending his great logy girls to Miss Porter 's seminary . ( I wonder if he expects they ' ll ever turn out anything ? ) And here ' s our Ivy , bright as a button , and you full well able to maintain her like a lady , and have done nothing but turn her out to grass all her life , till she ' s fairly run wild . I declare it ' s a shame . She ought to be sent to school to-morrow . " " Nonsense , Sally ! nonsense ! I a' n't a-goin ' to have no such doin 's . Sha' n't go off to school . What ' s the use havin ' her , if she ca n't stay at home with us ? Let Mr. Dingham send his gals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-larnin ' in the world wo n't make ' em equal to our Ivy with only her own head . I do n't want her to go to gettin ' up high-falutin ' notions . She ' s all gold now . She do n't need no improvin ' . Sha' n't budge an inch . Sha' n't stir a step . " " But do consider , Mr. Geer , the child has got to leave us some time . We ca n't have her always . " " Why ca n't we ? " exclaimed Mr. Geer , almost fiercely . " Sure enough ! Why ca n't we ? There a' n't nobody besides you and me , I suppose , that thinks she ' s pairk . What ' s John Herricks and Dan Norris hangin ' round for all the time ? " " And they may hang round till the cows come home ! Nary hair of Ivy 's head shall they touch ,  --  nary one of ' em ! " Just at this juncture of affairs , the damsel in question bounded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the old man ; " your mother ' s been a-slanderin ' you ; says you do n't know nothin ' . " Ivy knelt before him , rested her arms on his knees , and turned upon him a pair of palpably roguish eyes . " Father , it is an awful slander . I do know a sight . " " Lud , child , yes ! I knew you did . No more you do n't want to marry John Herricks , do you ? " " O Daddy Geer ! O  --  h  --  h ! " " Nor Dan Norris ? nor none of ' em ? " " Never a one , father . " " Nor do n't you ever think of gettin ' married and slavin ' yourself out for nobody . I ' m plenty well able to take care of you , as long as I live . You ' ll never live so happy as you do at home ; and you ' ll break my heart to go away , Ivy . " " I ' ll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accent on the first syllable . ) " Indeed , I never will . I ' ll never be married , as long as I live . " " No more you sha' n't , good child , good child ! " And again Farmer Geer betook himself to the depths of his arm-chair , with the complacent consciousness of having faithfully discharged his parental duties . " She should not go to school . She would not be married . She had said she would not , and of course she would not . " " Of course I shall not , " mused Ivy , as she lay in her white bed . " What could put it into poor papa 's head ? Marry John Herricks , with his everlasting smirk , and his diddling walk , and take care of all the Herricks ' sisters and mothers and aunts , and the Herricks ' cows and horses and pigs  --  and  --  hens  --  and  --  and  --  " But Ivy had kept her thoughts on her marriage longer than ever before in her life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personal property and real estate , the blue eyes were closed in the sweet , sound sleep of youth and health . Mrs. Geer , in her estimate of her daughter 's attainments , was partly right and partly wrong . Ivy had never been " finished " at Mrs. Porter 's seminary , and was consequently in a highly unfinished condition . " Small Latin and less Greek " jostled each other in her head . German and French , Italian and Spanish , were strange tongues to Ivy . She could not dance , nor play , nor draw , nor paint , nor work little dogs on footstools . What , then , could she do ? Imprimis , she could climb a tree like a squirrel . Secundo , she could walk across the great beam in the barn like a year-old kitten . In the pursuit of hens ' eggs she knew no obstacles ; from scaffold to scaffold , from haymow to haymow , she leaped defiant . She pulled out the hay from under the very noses of the astonished cows , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have deposited her golden treasure . With all four-footed beasts she was on the best of terms . The matronly and lazy old sheep she unceremoniously hustled aside , to administer consolation and caresses to the timid , quaking lamb in the corner behind . Without saddle or bridle she could " Ride a black horse To Banbury Cross . " ( N. B.  --  I do n't say she actually did . I only say she could ; and under sufficiently strong provocation , I have no doubt she would . ) She knew where the purple violets and the white innocence first flecked the spring turf , and where the ground-sparrows hid their mottled eggs . All the little waddling , downy goslings , the feeble chickens , and faint-hearted , desponding turkeys , that broke the shell too soon , and shivered miserably because the spring sun was not high enough in the morning to warm them , she fed with pap , and cherished in cotton-wool , and nursed and watched with eager , happy eyes . O blessed Ivy Geer ! True Sister of Charity ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From the conjugal and filial conversation which I have faithfully reported , a casual observer , particularly if young and inexperienced , might infer that the question of Miss Ivy 's education was definitively settled , and that she was henceforth to remain under the paternal roof . I should , myself , have fallen into the same error , had not a long and intimate acquaintance with the female sex generated and cherished a profound and mournful conviction of the truth of the maxim , that appearances are deceitful . E. g. , a woman has set her heart on something , and is refused . She pouts and sulks : that is clouds , and will soon blow over . She scolds , storms , and raves ( I speak in a figure ; I mean she does something as much like that as a tender , delicate , angelic woman can ) : that is thunder , and only clears the air . She betakes herself to tears , sobs , and embroidered cambric : that is a shower , and everything will be greener and fresher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to his farm , another to his merchandise ; the world will not wind up its affairs just yet . But , put the case , she goes on the even tenor of her way unmoved : " Beware ! beware ! Trust her not ; she is fooling thee . " Thus Mrs. Geer , who was a thorough tactician . Like Napoleon , she was never more elated than after a defeat . Before consulting her husband at all , she had contemplated the subject in all its bearings , and had deliberately decided that Ivy was to go to school . The consent of the senior partner of the firm was a secondary matter , which time and judicious management would infallibly secure . Consequently , notwithstanding the unpropitious result of their first colloquy , she the next day commenced preparations for Ivy 's departure , as unhesitatingly , as calmly , as assiduously , as if the day of that departure had been fixed . Mrs. Geer was right . She knew she was , all the time . She had a sublime faith in herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed forward gloriously to her goal . Mr. Geer had as much firmness , not to say obstinacy , as falls to the lot of most men ; but Mrs. Geer had more ; and as Launce Outram , hard beset , so pathetically moaned , " A woman in the very house has such deused opportunities ! " so Farmer Geer grumbled , and squirmed , and remonstrated , and  --  yielded . Mrs. Geer was not right . She had reckoned without her host . Her affairs were gliding down the very Appian Way of prosperity in a chariot-and-four , with footmen and outriders , when , presto ! they turned a sharp and unexpected corner , and over went the whole establishment into a mirier mire than ever bespattered Dr. Slop . To speak without a parable . When her expected Hegira was announced to Miss Mary Ives Geer , that young lady , to the ill-concealed vexation of her mother , and the **29;94;TOOLONG exultation of her father , expressed decided disapprobation of the whole scheme . As she was the chief dramatis persona , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfered with Mrs. Geer 's plans . All the eloquence of that estimable woman was brought to bear on this one point ; but this one point was invincible . Expostulation and entreaty were alike vain . Neither ambition nor pleasure could hold out any allurements to Ivy . Maternal authority was at length hinted at , only hinted at , and the spoiled child declared that she had not had her own will and way for sixteen years to give up quietly in her seventeenth . One last resort , one forlorn hope ,  --  one expedient , which had never failed to overcome her childish stubbornness : " Would she grieve her parents so much as to oppose this their darling wish ? " And Ivy burst into tears , and begged to know if she should show her love to her father and mother by going away from them . This drove the nail into her old father 's heart , and then the little vixen clenched it by throwing herself into his arms , and sobbing , " O , papa ! would you turn your Ivy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fallacies ! Shallowest of sophists ! But she was the only and beloved child of his old age ; so the fallacy passed unchallenged ; the strong arms closed around the naughty girl ; and the soothing voice murmured ,  --  " There , there , Ivy ! do n't cry , child ! Lud ! lud ! you sha' n't be bothered ; no more you sha' n't , lovey ! " and the status quo was restored . " It is not in the sea nor in the strife We feel benumbed and wish to be no more , But in the after silence on the shore , When all is lost , except a little life , " said one who had breasted the stormiest sea and plunged into the fiercest strife . Ivy , who had never read Byron , and therefore could not be suspected of any Byronical affectations , felt it , when , having gained her point , she sat down alone in her own room . When her single self had been pitted against superior numbers , age , experience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was adequate to the emergency ; but her end gained , the excitement gone , the sense of disobedience alone remaining , and she was thoroughly uncomfortable , nay , miserable . " Mamma is right ; I know I am a little goose , " sobbed she . ( The words were mental , intangible , unspoken ; the sobs physical , palpable , decided . ) " I never did know anything , and I never shall ,  --  and I do n't care if I do n't . I do n't see any good in knowing so much . We do n't have a great while to stay in the world any way , and I do n't see why we ca n't be let alone and have a good time while we are here , and when we get to heaven we can take a fresh start . O , dear ! I never shall go to heaven , if I am so bad and vex mamma . But then papa did n't care . But then he would have liked me to go to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! I will not ! I ' ll study at home . O , dear ! I wish papa was a great man , and knew everything , and could teach me . Well , he is just as happy , and just as rich , and everybody likes him just as well , as if he knew the whole world full ; and why ca n't I do so , too ? Rebecca Dingham , indeed ! Mercy ! I hope I never shall be like her ; I would rather not know my A B C ! What shall I do ? There ' s Mr. Brownslow might teach me ; he knows enough . But , dear me ! he is as busy as he can be , all day long ; and Squire Merrill goes out of town every day ; and there ' s Dr. Mix , to be sure , but he smells so strong of paregoric , and I do n't believe he knows much , either ; and there ' s nobody else in town that knows any more than anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go to school , if I am ever to know anything . " ( A renewal of sobs , uninterrupted for several minutes . ) " There ' s Mr. Clerron ! " ( A sudden cessation . ) " I suppose he knows more than the whole town tumbled into one ; and writes books , and  --  mercy ! there ' s no end to his knowledge ; and he ' s rich , and does everything he likes , all day long . O , if I only did know him ! I would ask him straight off to teach me . I should be scared to death . I ' ve a great mind to ask him , as it is . I can tell him who I am . He never will know any other way , for he is n't acquainted with anybody . They say he is as proud as Lucifer . If he were ten times prouder , I would rather ask him than go to school . He might just as well do something as not . I am sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should be glad to help him . I ' ll go straight to him the first thing to-morrow morning . " Once seeing a possible way out of her difficulties , her sorrow vanished . Not quite so gayly as usual , it is true , did she sing about the house that night ; for she was summoning all her powers to prepare an introductory speech to Felix Clerron , Esq. , a gentleman and a scholar . Her elocutionary attempts were not quite satisfactory to herself , but she was not to be daunted ; and when morning came , she took heart of grace , slung her broad-brimmed hat over her arm , and began her march " over the hills and far away , " in search of her  --  fate . " And did her mother really let her roam away , alone , on such an errand , to a perfect stranger ? " " Humanly speaking , " nothing was more unlikely than that Mrs. Geer , a prudent , modest , and sensible woman , should give her consent to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor did she . The fact is , her consent was not asked . She knew nothing whatever of the plan . " Worse and worse ! Did the wilful girl go off without leave ? without even informing her parents ? " I am sorry to say she did . In writing a story of real life , one can not take that liberty with facts which is quite proper , not to say indispensable , in history , science , and belles-lettres generally . Duty compels me to adhere closely to the truth ; and for whatever of obloquy may be heaped upon me , or upon my Ivy , I shall find consolation in the words of the illustrious Harrison ; or perhaps it was the illustrious Taylor ; I am not quite sure , however , that it was not the illustrious Washington :  --  " Do right , and let the consequences take care of themselves . " I am therefore obliged to say , that Ivy 's departure in pursuit of knowledge was entirely unknown to her respected and beloved parents . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoiled child ,  --  spoiled as only stern New England Puritan parents , somewhat advanced in years , can spoil their children . I do not defend Ivy . On the contrary , notwithstanding my regard for her , I hand her over to the reprobation of an enlightened community ; and I hereby entreat all young persons into whose hands this memoir may fall to take warning by the fate of poor Ivy , and never enter upon any important undertaking , until they have , to say the least , consulted those who are their natural guides , their warmest friends , and their most experienced counsellors . While I have been writing this , Ivy Geer , light of heart , fleet of foot , and firm of will , has passed over hillside , through wood-path , and across meadow-land , and drawn near the domains of Felix Clerron , Esq . Light of heart perhaps I scarcely ought to say . Certainly , that enterprising organ had never before beat so furious a tattoo in Ivy 's breast , as when she stood , hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling . To do her justice , she had intended to do the penance of wearing her hat when she should have reached her destination ; but in her excitement she quite forgot it . So , as I said , she stood on the doorstep , as a royal maiden stood three hundred years before ( not in the same place ) , with the " wind blowing her fair hair about her beautiful cheeks . " There had come to Ivy from the great , gay world a vague rumor , that , instead of knocking at a door , like a Christian , with your own good knuckles , for such case made and provided , modern fashion had introduced " the ringing and the dinging of the bells . " This vague rumor found a local habitation , when Mr. Clerron came down upon the village and established himself , his men and women and horses and cattle ; but as Ivy stood on his doorstep , looking upward , downward , sidewise , with earnest , peering gaze , no bell , and no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little door-knob at the right hand side of the door ,  --  a thing which could not be accounted for . After long and serious deliberation , she came to the conclusion that the bell must be inside , and that the knob was a screw attached to it . So she tried to twist it , first one way , then the other ; but twist it would not . In despair she betook herself to her fingers and knocked . Nobody came . Twist again . No use . Knock again . Ditto . Then she went down to the gravelled path , selected one of the largest pebbles , took up her station before the door , and began to pound away . In a moment , a gentleman in dressing-gown and smoking-cap , with a cigar between his fingers , came round the corner . Seeing her , he threw away his cigar , lifted his velvet cap , bowed , and , with a gentle " allow me , " stepped to the door , pulled the bell , and again passed out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault and battery on the door of a respectable , peaceable , private gentleman , as not to make the silent reflection , " Pulled the knob , instead of twisting it . How easy it is to do a thing , if you only know how ! " The summons was soon answered by a black gnome , and Ivy was ushered into a large room , which , to her dazzled , sun-weary eyes , seemed delightfully fresh and green-looking . Two minutes more of waiting ,  --  then a step in the hall , a gently opening door , and Ivy felt rather than saw herself in the presence of the formidable Mr. Clerron . A single glance showed her that he was the person who had rung the bell for her , though the gay dressing-gown had been exchanged for a soberer suit . Mr. Clerron bowed . Ivy , hardly knowing what she did , faltered forth , " I am Ivy Geer . " A half-curious , half-sarcastic smile glimmered behind the heavy beard , and gleamed beneath the heavy eyebrows , as he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but another glance at the trembling form , the frightened , pale face , and quivering lips , changed the smile into one that was very good-natured , and even kind ; and he added , playfully ,  --  " I am Felix Clerron , very much at your service . " " You write books and are a very learned man , " pursued Ivy , hurriedly , never lifting her eyes from the floor , and never ceasing to twirl her hat-strings . There was no possibility of supposing her guilty of committing a little diplomatic flattery in conveying this succinct bit of information . She made the assertion with the air of one who has a disagreeable piece of business on hand , and is determined to go through with it as soon as possible . He bowed and smiled again ; quite unnecessarily ,  --  since , as I have before remarked , Ivy 's eyes were steadfastly fixed on the carpet . A slight pause for breath and she pitched ahead again . " I am very ignorant , and I am growing old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of . Mamma wishes me to go to school . Papa did not , but now he does . I wo n't go . I would rather be stupid all my life long than leave home . But mamma is vexed , and I want to please her , and I thought ,  --  Mr. Brownslow is so busy , and you ,  --  if you have nothing to do ,  --  and know so much ,  --  I thought "  --  She stopped short , utterly unable to proceed . Wonderfully different did this affair seem from the one she had planned the preceding evening . It is so much easier to fight the battle of life in our own chimney-corner , by the ruddy and genial firelight , than in broad day on the world 's great battle-field ! Mr. Clerron , seeing Ivy 's confusion , kindly came to her aid . " And you thought my superfluous time and wisdom might be transferred to you , thus making a more equal division of property ? " " If you would be so good ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I inquire how you propose to effect such an exchange ? " He really did not intend to be anything but kind , but the whole matter presented itself to him in a very ludicrous light ; and in endeavoring to preserve proper gravity , he became severe . Ivy , all-unused to the world , still had a secret feeling that he was laughing at her . Tears , that would not be repressed , glistened in her downcast eyes , gathered on the long lashes , dropped silently to the floor . He saw that she was entirely a child , ignorant , artless , and sincere . His better feelings were roused , and he exclaimed , with real earnestness ,  --  " My dear young lady , I should rejoice to serve you in any way , I beg you to believe . " His words only hastened the catastrophe which seems to be always impending over the weaker sex . Ivy sobbed out-right ,  --  a perfect tempest . Felix Clerron looked on with a bachelor 's dismay . " What in thunder ? Confound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter abandonment to sorrow melted his heart again ,  --  not a very susceptible heart either ; but men , especially bachelors , are so  --  green ! ( the word is found in Cowper . ) He sat down by her side , stroked the hair from her burning forehead , as if she had been six instead of sixteen , and again and again assured her of his willingness to assist her . " I must go home , " whispered Ivy , as soon as she could command , or rather coax her voice . His hospitality was shocked . " Indeed you must not , till we have at least had a consultation . Tell me how much you know . What have you studied ? " " O , nothing , Sir . I am very stupid . " " Ah ! we must begin with the Alphabet , then . Blocks or a primer ? " Ivy smiled through her tears . " Not quite so bad as that , Sir . " You do know your letters ? Perhaps you can even count , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enlighten me . " Ivy grew calm as he became playful . " I can cipher pretty well . I have been through Greenleaf 's Large . " " House or meadow ? And the exact dimensions , if you please . " " Sir ? " " I understood you to say you had traversed Greenleaf 's large . You did not designate what . " He was laughing at her now , indeed , but it was open and genial , and she joined . " My Arithmetic , of course . I supposed everybody knew that . Everybody calls it so . " " Time is short . Yes . Do you like Arithmetic ? " " Pretty well , some parts of it . Fractions and Partial Payments . But I ca n't bear Duodecimals , Position , and such things . " " Positions are occasionally embarrassing . And Grammar ? " " I think it ' s horrid . It ' s all indicative mood , common noun , third person , singular number , and agrees with John . ' " " Bravissima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may say ,  --  and not entertaining , certainly . What other branches have you pursued ? Drawing , for instance ? " " O , no , Sir ! " " Nor Music ? " " No , Sir . " " Good ! excellent ! An overruling Providence has saved you and your friends from many a pitfall . Shall we proceed to History ? Be so good as to inform me who discovered America . " " I believe Columbus has the credit of it , " replied Ivy , demurely . " Non-committal , I see . Case goes strongly in his favor , but you reserve your judgment till further evidence . " " I think he was a wise and good and enterprising man . " " But are rather sceptical about that San Salvador story . A wise course . Never decide till both sides have been fairly presented . He that judgeth a matter before he heareth it , it is folly and shame unto him , ' said the wise man . Occasionally his after-judgment is equally discreditable . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well !  --  Geographia . My young friend , what celebrated city has the honor of concentrating the laws , learning , and literature of Massachusetts , to wit , namely , is its capital ? " " Boston , Sir . " " Your Geography has evidently been attended to . You have learned the basis fact . You have discovered the pivot on which the world turns . You have dug down to the antediluvian , ante-pyrean granite ,  --  the primitive , unfused stratum of society . The force of learning can no farther go . Armed with that fact , you may march fearlessly forth to do battle with the world , the flesh , and  --  the  --  ahem  --  the King of Beasts ! Do you think you should like me for a teacher ? " " I ca n't tell , Sir . I did not like you as anything awhile ago . " " But you like me better now ? You think I improve on acquaintance ? You detect signs of a moral reformation ? " " No , Sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike you so much as I did . " " Spoken like a major-general , or , better still , like a brave little Yankee girl , as you are . I am an enthusiastic admirer of truth . I foresee we shall get on famously . I was rather premature in sounding the state of your affections , it must be confessed ,  --  but we shall be rare friends by and by . On the whole , you are not particularly fond of books ? " " I like some books well enough , but not studying-books , " said Ivy , with a sigh , " and I do n't see any good in them . If it was n't for mamma , I never would open one ,  --  never ! I would just as soon be a dunce as not ; I do n't see anything very horrid in it . " " How should you , to be sure ? There is a distinction , however , which you must immediately learn to make . The dunce subjective is a very inoffensive animal , contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly remark , inspires no horror , but rather an amiable and genial self-complacency . The dunce objective , on the contrary , is of an entirely different species . He is a bore of the first magnitude ,  --  a poisoned arrow , that not only pierces , but inflames ,  --  a dull knife , that not only cuts , but tears ,  --  a cowardly little cur , that snaps occasionally , but snarls unceasingly ; whom , which , and that , it becomes the duty of all good citizens to sweep from the face of the earth . " " What is the difference between them ? How shall one know which is which ? " " The dunce subjective is the dunce from his own point of view ,  --  the dunce with his eyes turned inward ,  --  confining his duncehood to the bosom of his family . The dunce objective is the dunce butting against his neighbor 's study-door ,  --  intruding , obtruding , protruding his insipid folly and still more insipid wisdom at all times and seasons . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's angels , in one respect at least : you may thrust him through and through with the two-edged sword of your satire , and at the end he shall be as intact and integral as at the beginning . Am I sufficiently obvious ? " He was talking , however , quite as much to himself as to Ivy , and with a bitterness evidently born of suffering . " It is very obvious that I am both , according to your definition . " " It is very obvious that you are neither , but a sensible young girl ,  --  with no great quantity of the manufactured article , perhaps , but plenty of raw material , capable of being wrought into fabric of the finest quality . " " Do you really think I can learn ? " asked Ivy , with a bright blush of pleasure . " Can learn ? " " As much as if I went to school ? " " My dear miss , as the forest oak , cabined , cribbed , confined ' with multitudes of its fellows , grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open fields alone , stretches out its arms to the blue heavens and its roots to the kindly earth ,  --  so , in a word , shall you , under my fostering care , flourish like a green bay-tree , only not quite so high and mightily as I am flourishing now ;  --  that is , if I am to have the honor . " " Yes , Sir , I mean  --  I meant  --  I was thinking as if you were teaching me  --  I mean were going to teach me . " " Which I also mean , if your parents continue to wish it . " " O , they wo n't care ! " " Wo n't care ? " " No , Sir , they will be glad , I think . Papa , at least , will be glad to have me stay at home . " " Did not they direct you to come to me to-day ? " Ivy blushed deeply , and replied , in a low voice , " No , Sir ; I knew mamma would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And to prevent any sudden temptation to disobedience , and a consequent forfeiture of your peace of mind , you took time by the forelock and came on your own responsibility ? " " Yes , Sir . " " Very ingenious , upon my word ! But , my dear Miss Geer , I must confess I have not this happy feminine knack of keeping out of the way of temptation . I should prefer to consult your friends , even at the risk of losing the pleasure of your society . " " O , yes , Sir ! I do n't care , now it is all settled . " And so , over hillside , along wood-path , and through meadow-land , with light heart and smiling eyes , tripped Ivy back again . To Mrs. Geer shelling peas in the shady porch , and to Mr. Geer fanning himself with his straw hat on the steps beside her , Ivy recounted the story of her adventures . Mrs. Geer was thunderstruck at Ivy 's temerity ; Mr. Geer was lost in admiration of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Geer declared Ivy to be as smart as a steel trap . Mrs. Geer vetoed the whole plan ; Mr. Geer did n't know . But when at sunset Mr. Clerron rode over , and admired Mr. Geer 's orchard , and praised the points of his Durhams , and begged a root of Mrs. Geer 's scarlet verbena , and assured them he should be very glad to refresh his own early studies , and also to form an acquaintance with the family ,  --  he knew very few in the village ,  --  and if Mrs. Geer would drive over when Ivy came to recite ,  --  or perhaps they would rather he should come to their house . O , no ! Mrs. Geer could not think of that . Just as they pleased . Mrs. Simm , the housekeeper , would be very glad to meet Mrs. Geer . By the way , Mrs. Simm was a thrifty and sensible woman , and he was sure they would be pleased with each other . When , in short , all this and much more had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed pupil of Mr. Felix Clerron . " Eureka ! " cries the professional novel-reader , that far-sighted and keen-scented hound that snuffs a dnouement afar off ; and anon there rises before his eyes the vision of poor little Stella drinking in love and learning , especially love , from the divine eyes of the anything but divine Swift ,  --  of Shirley , the lioness , the pantheress , the leopardess , the beautiful , fierce creature , sitting , tamed , quiet , meek , by the side of Louis Moore , her tutor and master ,  --  and of all the legends of all the ages wherein Beauty has sat at the feet of Wisdom , and Love has crept in unawares , and spoiled the lesson while as yet half-unlearnt ;  --  so he cries , " She is going the way of all heroines . The man and the girl ,  --  they will fall in love , marry , and live happily all the rest of their days . " Of course they will . Is there any reason why they should not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lawfully be joined together , let him now speak , or else hereafter forever hold his peace . I repeat it , of course they will . You surely can not suppose I should , in cold blood , sit down to write a story in which nobody was to fall in love or be in love ! Scoff as you may , love is the one vital principle in all romance . Not only does your cheek flush and your eye sparkle , till heart , brain , and soul are all on fire , over the burning words of some Brontean Pythoness , but when you open the last thrilling work of Maggie Marigold , and are immediately submerged " in a weak , washy , everlasting flood " of insipidity , and heart-rending sorrow , you do not shut the book with a jerk . Why not ? Because in the dismal distance you dimly descry two figures swimming , floating , struggling towards each other , and a languid curiosity detains you till you have ascertained , that , after infinite distress , Adolphus and Miranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both well mated for life : She ' s got a fool for a husband , He ' s got a fool for his wife . " Sir , scoff as you may , love is the one sunbeam of poetry that gilds with a softened splendor the hard , bare outline of many a prosaic life . " Work , work , work , from weary chime to chime " ; tramp behind the plough , hammer on the lapstone , beat the anvil , drive the plane , from morn till dewy eve ; but when the dewy eve comes , ah ! Hesperus gleams soft and golden over the far-off pine-trees , but " The star that lightens your bosom most , And gives to your weary feet their speed , Abides in a cottage beyond the mead . " It is useless to assert that the subject is worn threadbare . Threadbare it may be to you , enervated and blas man of pleasure , worn and hardened man of the world ; but it is not for you I write . The fountain which leaps up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted till the springs of all life are dry . Tell me , O lover , gazing into those tender eyes uplifted to yours , twining the silken rings around your bronzed finger ,  --  does it abate one jot or tittle of your happiness to know that eyes just as tender , curls just as silken , have stirred the hearts of men for a thousand years ? Love , then , is a sine qua non in stories ; and if love , why not marriage ? What pleasure can a humane and benevolent man find in separating two individuals whose chief , perhaps whose sole happiness , consists in being together ? For certain inscrutable reasons , Divine Benevolence permits evil to exist in the world . All who have a taste for misery can find it there in exhaustless quantities . Johns are every day falling in love with Katys , but marrying Isabels , and Isabels the same , mutatis mutandis . We submit to it because there is no alternative ; and we believe that good shall finally be wrought and wrested from evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel-world the work of our own hand , an abridged edition , a daguerrotype copy of the world without , of which we know so little and so much . I always do and always shall read the last page of a novel first ; and if I perceive there any indications that matters are not coming out " shipshape , " my reading invariably terminates with the last page . For the rest , please to remember that I am not writing about a princess of the blood , nor of the days of the bold barons , but only the life of a quiet little girl in a quiet little town in the eastern part of Massachusetts ; and so far as my experience and observation go , men and women in the eastern part of Massachusetts are not given to thrilling adventures , hairbreadth escapes , wonderful concatenations of circumstances , and blood and thunder generally ,  --  but pursue the even tenor of their way , and of their love , with a sober and delightful equanimity . If you want a plot , go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and myriads of that kin , and help yourself . As for me , I must confess I hate plots . I see no pleasure in stumbling blindfolded through a story , unable to see a yard ahead , fancying every turn to be the last , and the road to go straight on to a glorious goal ,  --  and , lo ! we are in a more hopeless labyrinth than ever . I have a sense of restraint . I want to breathe freely , and can not . I want to have leisure to observe the style , the development of character , the author 's tone of thought , and not be galloped through on the back of a breathless desire to know " how they are coming out . " But , my dear plot-loving friend , be easy . I will not leave you in the lurch . I am not going to marry my man and woman out of hand . An obstacle , of which I suppose you have never heard ,  --  an obstacle entirely new , fresh , and unhackneyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let patience have her perfect work . Wonderful was the new world opened to Ivy Geer . It was as if a corse , cold , inert , lifeless , had suddenly sprung up , warm , invigorated , informed with a spirit which led her own spell-bound . Grammar ,  --  Grammar , which had been a synonyme for all that was dry , irksome , useless ,  --  a beating of the wind , the crackling of thorns under a pot ,  --  Grammar even assumed for her a charm , a wonder , a glory . She saw how the great and wise had shrined in fitting words their purity , and wisdom , and sorrow , and suffering , and penitence ; and how , as this generation passed away , and another came forth which knew not God , the golden casket became dim , and the memory of its priceless gem faded away ; but how , at the touch of a mighty wand , the obedient lid flew back , and the long-hidden thought " sprang full-statured in an hour . " She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlessly in a million minds till the poet came and crystallized them into clear-cut , prismatic words , tinged for each with the color of his own fancy , and wrought into a perfect mosaic , not for an age , but for all time . Led by a strong hand , she trod with awe down the dim aisles of the Past , and saw how the soul of man , bound in its prison-house , had ever struggled to voice itself in words . Roaming in the dense forest with the stern and bloody Druid ,  --  bounding over the waves with the fierce pirates who supplanted them , and in whose blue eyes and beneath whose fair locks gleamed indeed the ferocity of the savage , but lurked also , though unseen and unknown , the tender chivalry of the English gentleman ,  --  gazing admiringly on the barbaric splendor of the cloth-of-gold , whereon trod regally , to the sound of harp and viol , the beauty and bravery of the old Norman nobility , she delighted to see how the mother-tongue , our dear mother-tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury ,  --  gathering from one its strength , from another its stateliness , from a third its harmony , till the harsh , crude , rugged dialect of a barbarous horde became worthy to embody , as it does , the love , the wisdom , and the faith of half a world . So Grammar taught Ivy to reverence language . History , in the light of a guiding mind , ceased to be a bare record of slaughter and crime . Before her eyes filed , in a statelier pageant than they knew , the long procession of " simple great ones gone forever and ever by , " and the countless lesser ones whose names are quenched in the darkness of a night that shall know no dawn . She saw the " great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change " ; but amid all the change , the confusion , the chaos , she saw the finger of God ever pointing , and heard the sublime monotone of the Divine voice ever saying to the children of men , " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she saw , and rejoiced in the thought , that , even when this warning was unheeded ,  --  when on the brow of the mournful Earth " Ichabod , Ichabod , " was forever engraven ,  --  when the First Man with his own hand put from him the cup of innocence , and went forth from the happy garden , sin-stained and fallen , the whole head sick , and the whole heart faint ,  --  even then she saw within him the Divine spark , the leaven of life , which had power to vitalize and vivify what Crime had smitten with death . Though sea and land teemed with strange perils , though night and day pursued him with mysterious terrors , though the now unfriendly elements combined to check his career , still , with unswerving purpose , undaunted courage , she saw him march constantly forward . Spirits of evil could not drive from his heart the prescience of greatness ; and his soul dwelt calmly under the foreshadow of a mighty future . And as Ivy looked , she saw how the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land far and wide . They delved into the bosom of the pleased earth , and brought forth the piled-up treasures of uncounted cycles . They unfolded the book of the skies , and sought to read the records thereon . They plunged into the unknown and terrible ocean , and decked their own brows with the gems they plucked from hers . And when conquered Nature had laid her hoards at their feet , their restless longings would not be satisfied . Brave young spirits , with the dew of their youth fresh upon them , set out in quest of a land beyond their ken . Over the mountains , across the seas , through the forests , there came to the ear of the dreaming girl the measured tramp of marching men , the softer footfalls of loving women , the pattering of the feet of little children . Many a day and many a night she saw them wander on towards the setting sun , till the Unseen Hand led them to a fair and fruitful country that opened its bounteous arms in welcome . Broad rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their household gods ,  --  and the foundations of Europe were laid . Here were sown the seeds of those heroic virtues which have since leaped into luxuriant life ,  --  seeds of that irresistible power which fastened its grasp on Nature , and forced her to unfold the secret of her creation ,  --  seeds of that far-reaching wisdom which in the light of the unveiled past has read the story of the unseen future . And still under Ivy 's eye they grouped themselves . Some gathered on the pleasant hills of the sunny South , and the beauty of earth and sea and sky passed into their souls forever . They caught the evanescent gleam , the passing shadow , and on unseemly canvas limned it for all time in forms of unuttered and unutterable loveliness . They shaped into glowing life the phantoms of grace that were always flitting before their enchanted eyes , and poured into inanimate marble their rapt and passionate souls . They struck the lyre to wild and stirring songs whose tremulous echoes still linger along the corridors of Time . Some sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flood . They hunted the wild dragon to his mountain-fastnesses , and fought him at bay , and never quailed . Death , in its most fearful forms , they met with grim delight , and chanted the glories of the Valhalla waiting for heroes who should forever quaff the " foaming , pure , and shining mead " from skulls of foes in battle slain . Some crossed the sea , and on " that pale , that white-faced shore , Whose foot spurns back the ocean 's swelling tide , " they reared a sinewy and stalwart race , " whose morning drum-beat encircles the world . " And History taught Ivy to reverence man . But there was one respect in which Ivy was both pupil and teacher . Never a word of Botany had fallen upon her ears ; but through all the unconscious bliss of infancy , childhood , and girlhood , for sixteen happy years , she had lived among the flowers , and she knew their dear faces and their wild-wood names . She loved them with an almost human love . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likings and dislikings , their joys and sorrows ,  --  who among them chose the darkest nooks of the old woods , and who bloomed only to the brightest sunlight ,  --  who sent their roots deep down among the mosses by the brook , and who smiled only on the southern hillside . Around each she wove a web of beautiful individuality , and more than one had received from her a new christening . It is true , that , when she came to study from a book , she made wry faces over the long , barbarous , Latin names which completely disguised her favorites , and in her heart deemed a great many of the definitions quite superfluous ; but she had strong faith in her teacher , and when the technical was laid aside for the real , then , indeed , " her foot was on her native heath , and her name was MacGregor . " A wild and merry chase she led her grave instructor . Morning , noon , or night , she was always ready . Under the blue sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her infancy , she could not be otherwise than happy ; but when was superadded to this the companionship of a mind vigorous , cultivated , and refined , she enjoyed it with a keen and intense delight . Nowhere else did her soul so entirely unfold to the genial light of this new sun which had suddenly mounted above her horizon . Nowhere else did the freshness and fulness and splendor of life dilate her whole being with a fine ecstasy . And what was the end of all this ? Just what you would have supposed . She had led a life of simple , unbounded love and trust ,  --  a buoyant , elastic gladness ,  --  a dream of sunshine . No gray cloud had ever lowered in her sky , no thunderbolt smitten her joys , no winter rain chilled her warmth . Only the white fleeciness of morning mist had flitted sometimes over her summer-sky , deepening the blue . Little cooling drops had fluttered down through the leafiness , only to span her with a rainbow in the glory of the setting sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountains of her heart the stone was to be rolled away . The secret chord was to be smitten by a master-hand ,  --  a chord which , once stirred , may never cease to quiver . At first Ivy worshipped very far off . Her friend was to her the embodiment of all knowledge and goodness and greatness . She marvelled to see him so at home in what was to her so strange . Every word that fell from his lips was an oracle . She secretly contrasted him with all the men she had ever met , to the utter discomfiture of the latter . Washington , the Apostle Paul , and Peter Parley were the only men of the past or present whom she considered at all worthy to be compared with him ; and in fact , if these three men and Felix Clerron had all stood before her , and offered each a different opinion on any given subject , I have scarcely a doubt as to whose would have commended itself to her as combining the soundest practical wisdom and the highest Christian benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore off ,  --  and their intimacy became less and less that of teacher and pupil , and more and more that of friend and friend . With the sudden awakening of her intellectual nature , there woke also another power , of whose existence she had never dreamed . It was natural , that , in ranging the fields of thought so lately opened to her , she should often revert to him whose hand had unbarred the gates ; she was therefore not startled that the image of Felix Clerron was with her when she sat down and when she rose up , when she went out and when she came in . She ceased , indeed , to think of him . She thought him . She lived him . Her soul fed on his life . And so  --  and so  --  by a pleasant and flowery path , there came into Ivy 's heart the old , old pain . Now the thing was on this wise :  --  One morning , when she went to recite , she did not find Mr. Clerron in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments in looking over her lessons , she rose and was about to pass to the door to ring , when Mrs. Simm looked in , and , seeing Ivy , informed her that Mr. Clerron was in the garden , and desired her to come out . Ivy immediately followed Mrs. Simm into the garden . On the south side of the house was a piazza two stories high . Along the pillars which supported it a trellis-work had been constructed , reaching several feet above the roof of the piazza . About this climbed a vigorous grape-vine , which not only completely screened nearly the whole front of the piazza , but , reaching the top of the trellis , shot across , by the aid of a few pieces of fine wire , and overran a part of the roof of the house . Thus the roof of the piazza was the floor of a beautiful apartment , whose walls and ceiling were broad , rustling , green leaves , among which drooped now innumerable heavy clusters of rich purple grapes . From behind this leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my twining vine ! " Ivy turned and looked up , with the uncertain , inquiring smile we often wear when conscious that , though unseeing , we are not unseen ; and presently two hands parted the leaves far enough for a very sunshiny smile to gleam down on the upturned face . " O , I wish I could come up there ! " cried Ivy , clasping her hands with childish eagerness . " The wish is father to the deed . " " May I ? " " Be sure you may . " " But how shall I get in ? " " Are you afraid to come up the ladder ? " " No , I do n't mean that ; but how shall I get in where you are , after I am up ? " " O , never fear ! I ' ll draw you in safely enough . " " Lorful heart ! Miss Ivy , what are you going to do ? " cried Mrs. Simm , in terror . Ivy was already on the third round of the ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said I might . " " He said you might , yes , " continued Mrs. Simm ,  --  talking to Ivy , but at Mr. Clerron , with whom she hardly dared to remonstrate in a more direct way . " And if he said you might throw yourself down Vineyard Cliff , it do n't follow that you are bound to do it . He goes into all sorts of haphazard scrapes himself , but you ca n't follow him . " " But it looks so nice up there , " pleaded Ivy , " and I have been twice as high at home . I do n't mind it at all . " " If your father chooses to let you run the risk of your life , it ' s none of my lookout , but I a' n't going to have you breaking your neck right under my nose . If you want to get up there , I ' ll show you the way in the house , and you can step right out of the window . Just wait till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Simm disappeared , Mr. Clerron said softly to Ivy , " Come ! "  --  and in a moment Ivy bounded up the ladder and through an opening in the vine , and stood by his side . " I ' m ready now , Miss Ivy , " said Mrs. Simm , reappearing . " Miss Ivy ! Where is the child ? " A merry laugh greeted her . " O , you good-for-nothing ! " cried the good-natured old housekeeper , " you ' ll never die in your bed . " " Not for a good while , I hope , " answered Mr. Clerron . Then he made Ivy sit down by him , and took from the great basket the finest cluster of grapes . " Is that reward enough for coming ? " " Coming into so beautiful a place as this is like what you read yesterday about poetry to Coleridge , its own exceeding great reward . ' " " And you do n't want the grapes ? " " I do n't know that I have any intrinsic objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle that I opposed . " " Very well , we will go shares , then . You may have half for the free gift , and I will have half for the principle . Little tendril , you look as fresh as the morning . " " Do n't I always ? " " I should say there was a little more dew than usual . Stand up and let me survey you , if perchance I may discover the cause . " Ivy rose , made a profound courtesy , and then turned slowly around , after the manner of the revolving fashion-figures in a milliner 's window . " I do n't know , " continued Mr. Clerron , when Ivy , after a couple of revolutions , resumed her seat . " You seem to be the same . I think it must be the frock . " " I do n't wear a frock . I do n't think it would improve my style of beauty if I did . Papa wears one sometimes . " " And what kind of a frock , pray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrid blue thing . Comes about down to his knees . Made of some kind of woollen stuff . Horrid ! " " And what name do you give to that white thing with blue sprays in it ? " " This ? " " Yes . " " This is a dress . " " No . This , and your collar , and hat , and shoes , and sash are your dress . This is a frock . " Ivy shook her head doubtfully . " You know a great deal , I know . " " So you informed me once before . " " O , do n't mention that ! " said Ivy , blushing , and quickly added , " Do you know I have discovered the reason why you like me this morning ? " " And every morning . " " Sir ? " " Go on . What is the reason ? " " It is because I clear-starched and ironed it myself with my owny-dony hands ; and that , you know , is the reason it looks nicer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore dresses . " " You can , if you choose , I suppose . There is no one to hinder you . " " Simpleton ! that is not what you were intended to say . You should have asked the cause of so singular a wish , and then I had a pretty little speech all ready for you ,  --  a veritable compliment . " " It is well I did not ask , then . Mamma does not approve of compliments , and perhaps it would have made me vain . " " Incorrigible ! Why did you not ask me what the speech was , and thus give me an opportunity to relieve myself . Why , a body might die of a plethora of flattery , if he had nobody but you to discharge it against . " " He must take care , then , that the supply does not exceed the demand . " " Political economy , upon my word ! What shall we have next ? " " Domestic , I suppose you would like . Men generally , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah , Ivy , Ivy ! little you know about men , my child ! " He leaned back in his seat and was silent for some minutes . Ivy did not care to interrupt his thinking . Presently he said ,  --  " Ivy , how old are you ? " " I shall be seventeen the last day of this month . " A short pause . " And then eighteen . " " And then nineteen . " " And then twenty . In three years you will be twenty . " " Horrid old , is n't it ? " He turned his head , and looked down upon her with what Ivy thought a curious kind of smile , but only said ,  --  " You must not say horrid ' so much . " By and by Ivy grew rather tired of sitting silent and watching the rustle of the leaves , which hid every other prospect ; she turned a little so that she could look at him . He sat with folded arms , looking straight ahead ; and she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she would like very much to smooth out the wrinkles in his forehead and run her fingers through his hair , as she sometimes did for her father . She had a great mind to ask him if she should ; then she reflected that it might make him nervous . Then she wondered if he had forgotten her lessons , and how long they were to sit there . Determined , at length , to have a change of some kind , she said , softly ,  --  " Mr. Clerron ! " He roused himself suddenly , and stood up . " I thought , perhaps , you had a headache . " " No , Ivy . But this is not climbing the hill of science , is it ? " " Not so much as it is climbing the piazza . " " Suppose we take a vacation to-day , and investigate the state of the atmosphere ? " " Yes , sir , I am ready . " Ivy did not fully understand the nature of his proposition ; but if he had proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she would have said and acted , " Yes , sir , I am ready , " just the same . He took up the basket of grapes which he had gathered , and led the way through the window , down-stairs . Ivy waited for him at the hall-door , while he carried the grapes to Mrs. Simm ; then he joined her again and proposed to walk through the woods a little while , before Ivy went home . " You must know , my docile pupil , that I am going to the city to-morrow , on business , to be gone a week or two . So , as you must perforce take a vacation then , why , we may as well begin to vacate to-day , and enjoy it . " " I am sorry you are going away . " " You are ? That is almost enough to pay me for going . Why are you sorry ? " " Because I shall not see you for a week ; and I have become so used to you , that somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day without you ; and then the cars may run off the track and kill you or hurt you , or you may get the small-pox , or a great many things may happen . " " And suppose some of these terrible things should happen ,  --  the last , for instance ,  --  what would you do ? " " I ? I should advise you to send for the doctor at once . " Mr. Clerron laughed . " So you would not come and nurse me , and take care of me , and get me well again ? " " No , because I should then be in danger of taking it myself and giving it to papa and mamma ; besides , they would not let me , I am quite sure . " " So you love your papa and mamma better than  --  " He stopped abruptly . Ivy finished for him . " Better than words can tell . Papa particularly . Mamma , somehow , seems strong of herself , and does n't depend upon me ; but papa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ! I think , if I should die , he would die of grief . I have , I can not help having , a kind of pity for him , he loves me so . " " Do you always pity people , when they love you very much ? " " O no ! of course not . Besides , nobody loves me enough to be pitied , except papa .  --  Is n't it pleasant here ? How very green it is ! It looks just like summer . O Mr. Clerron , did you see the clouds this morning ? " " There were none when I arose . " " Why , yes , sir , there was a great heap of them at sunrise . " " I am not prepared to contradict you . " " Perhaps you were not up at sunrise . " " I have an impression to that effect . " He smiled so comically , that Ivy could not help saying , though she was half afraid he might not be pleased ,  --  " I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , I consider myself tolerably early . I believe I have been up every morning but one , this week , by nine o'clock . " Ivy was horror-struck . Her country ideas of " early to bed and early to rise " received a great shock , as her looks plainly showed . He laughed gayly at her amazed face . " You do n't seem to appreciate me , Miss Geer . " " Nine o'clock ' ! " repeated Ivy , slowly ,  --  " every morning but one ' ! and it is Tuesday to-day . " " Yes , but you know yesterday was a dark , cloudy day , and excellent for sleeping . " " But , Mr. Clerron , then you are not more than fairly up when I come . And when do you write ? " " Always in the evening . " " But the evenings are so short ,  --  or have been . " " Mine are not particularly so . From six to three is about long enough for one sitting . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired ! " " Not so tired as you think . You , now , rising at five or six , and running round all day , become so tired that you have to go to bed by nine ; of course you have no time for reflection and meditation . I , on the contrary , take life easily ,  --  write in the night , when everything is still and quiet ,  --  take my sleep when all the noise of the world 's wakingup is going on ,  --  and after creation is fairly settled for the day , I rise leisurely , breakfast leisurely , take a smoke leisurely , and leisurely wait the coming of my little pupil . " " Mr. Clerron ! " " Well ! " " May I tell you another thing I do n't like in you ? a bad habit ? " " As many as you please , provided you wo n't require me to reform . " " What is the use of telling it , then ? " " But it may be a relief to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . We shall exchange opinions , and perhaps come to a better understanding . Go on . " " Well , sir , I wish you did not smoke so much . " " I do n't smoke very much , little Ivy . " " I wish you would not at all . Mamma thinks it is very injurious , and wrong , even . And papa says cigars are bad things . " " Some of them are outrageous . But , my dear , granting your father and mother and yourself to be right , do n't you see I am doing more to extirpate the evil than you , with all your principle ? I exterminate , destroy , and ruin them at the rate of three a day ; while you , I venture to say , never lifted a finger or lighted a spark against them . " " Now , sir , that is only a way of slipping round the question . And I really wish you did not . Before I knew you , I thought it was almost as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , now , that it can not be ; still  --  " " Feminine logic . " " I have not studied Logic yet ; still , as I was going to say , sir , I do n't like to think of you as being in a kind of subjection to anything . " " Ivy , seriously , I am not in subjection to a cigar . I often do n't smoke for months together . To prove it , I promise you I wo n't smoke for the next two months . " " O , I am so glad ! O , I am so much obliged to you ! And you are not in the least vexed that I spoke to you about it ? " " Not in the least . " " I was afraid you would be . And one thing more , sir , I have been afraid of , the last few days . You know when I first knew you , or before I knew you , I supposed you did nothing but walk round and enjoy yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hard ; and I have feared that you could not well spare two hours every day for me ,  --  particularly in the morning , which are almost always considered the best . But if you like to write in the evening , you would just as soon I would come in the morning ? " " Certainly . " " But if two hours are too much , I hope you wo n't , at any time , hesitate to tell me . I have no claim on a moment ,  --  only  --  " " My dear Ivy Geer , pupil and friend , be so good as to understand , henceforth , that you can not possibly come into my house at any time when you are not wanted ; nor stay any longer than I want you ; nor say anything that will not please me ;  --  well , I am not quite sure about that ;  --  but , at least , remember that I am always glad to see you , and teach you , and have you with me ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you do me every day of your blessed life . " " O Mr. Clerron ! " exclaimed Ivy , with a great gush of gratitude and happiness ; " do I , can I , do you any good ? " " You do and can , my tendril ! You supply an element that was wanting in my life . You make every day beautiful to me . The flutter of your robes among these trees brings sunshine into my heart . Every morning I walk in my garden as soon as I am , as you say , fairly up , till I see you turn into the lane ; and every day I watch you till you disappear . You are fresh and truthful and natural , and you give me new life . And now , my dear little trembling benefactor , because we are nearly through the woods , I can go no farther with you ; and because I am going away to-morrow , not to see you again for a week , and because I hope you will be a little lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must let you  --  kiss me ! " Ivy had been looking intently into his face , with an expression , at first , of the most beaming , tearful delight , then gradually changing into waiting wonder ; but when his sentence finally closed , she stood still , scarcely able to comprehend . He placed his hands on her temples , and , smiling involuntarily at her blushes and embarrassment , half in sport and half in tenderness , bent her head a little back , touched brow , cheeks , and lips , whispered softly , " Go now ! God bless you for ever and ever , my darling ! " and , turning walked hastily down the winding path . As for Ivy , she went home in a dream , blind and stunned with a great joy . The week of Mr. Clerron 's absence passed away more quickly than Ivy had supposed it would . The reason for this may be found in the fact that her thoughts were very busily occupied . She was more silent than usual , so much so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivy , I have n't heard you sing this long while , and seems to me you do n't talk either . What ' s the matter ? " " Do I look as if anything was the matter ? " and the face she turned upon him was so radiant , that even the father 's heart was satisfied . Very quietly happy was Ivy to think she was of service to Mr. Clerron , that she could give him pleasure ,  --  though she could in no wise understand how it was . She went over every event since her acquaintance with him ; she felt how much he had done for her , and how much he had been to her ; but she sought in vain to discover how she had been of any use to him . She only knew that she was the most ignorant and insignificant girl in the whole world , and that he was the best and greatest man . As this was very nearly the same conclusion at which she had arrived at an early period of their acquaintance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive of any very valuable results . The day before Mr. Clerron 's expected return , Ivy sat down to prepare her lessons , and for the first time remembered that she had left her books in Mr. Clerron 's library . She was not sorry to have so good an excuse for visiting the familiar room , though its usual occupant was not there to welcome her . Very quietly and joyfully happy , she trod slowly along the path through the woods where she last walked with Mr. Clerron . She was , indeed , at a loss to know why she was so calm . Always before , a sudden influx of joy testified itself by very active demonstrations . She was quite sure that she had never in her life been so happy as now ; yet she never had felt less disposed to leap and dance and sing . The non-solution of the problem , however , did not ruffle her serenity . She was content to accept the facts , and await patiently the theory . Arriving at the house , she went , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not finding the books , proceeded in search of Mrs. Simm . That notable lady was sitting behind a huge pile of clean clothes , sorting and mending to her heart 's content . She looked up over her spectacles at Ivy 's bright " good morning , " and invited her to come in . Ivy declined , and begged to know if Mrs. Simm had seen her books . To be sure she had , like the good housekeeper that she was . " You ' ll find them in the book-case , second shelf ; but , Miss Ivy , I wish you would come in , for I ' ve had something on my mind that I ' ve felt to tell you this long while . " Ivy came in , took the seat opposite Mrs. Simm , and waited for her to speak ; but Mrs. Simm seemed to be in no hurry to speak . She dropped her glasses ; Ivy picked them up and handed them to her . She muttered something about the destructive habits of men , especially in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the subject at once , abruptly exclaimed ,  --  " Miss Ivy , you ' re a real good girl , I know , and as innocent as a lamb . That ' s why I ' m going to talk to you as I do . I know , if you were my child , I should want somebody to do the same by you . " Ivy could only stare in blank astonishment . After a moment 's pause , Mrs. Simm continued ,  --  " I ' ve seen how things have been going on for some time ; but my mouth was shut , though my eyes were open . I did n't know but maybe I ' d better speak to your mother about it ; but then , thinks I to myself , she ' ll think it is a great deal worse than it is , and then , like enough , there ' ll be a rumpus . So I concluded , on the whole , I ' d just tell you what I thought ; and I know you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you must promise me not to get mad . " " No , " gasped Ivy . " I like you a sight . It ' s no flattery , but the truth , to say I think you ' re as pretty-behaved a girl as you ' ll find in a thousand . And all the time you ' ve been here , I never have known you to do a thing you had n't ought to . And Mr. Clerron thinks so too , and there ' s the trouble . You see , dear , he ' s a man , and men go on their ways and like women , and talk to them , and sort of bewitch them , not meaning to do them any hurt ,  --  and enjoy their company of an evening , and go about their own business in the morning , and never think of it again ; but women stay at home , and brood over it , and think there ' s something in it , and build a fine air-castle ,  --  and when they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take on . Now that ' s what I don ' t want you to do . Perhaps you ' d think I ' d better have spoken with Mr. Clerron ; but it would n't signify the head of a pin . He ' d either put on the Clerron look and scare you to death and not say a word , or else he ' d hold it up in such a ridiculous way as to make you think it was ridiculous yourself . And I thought I ' d put you on your guard a little , so as you need n't fall in love with him . You ' ll like him , of course . He likes you ; but a young girl like you might make a mistake , if she was ever so modest and sweet ,  --  and nobody could be modester or sweeter than you ,  --  and think a man loved you to marry you , when he only pets and plays with you . Not that Mr. Clerron means to do anything wrong . He ' d be perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on . There ai n't a more honorable man every way in the whole country . Now , Miss Ivy , it ' s all for your good I say this . I don ' t find fault with you , not a bit . It ' s only to save you trouble in store that I warn you to look where you stand , and see that you do n't lose your heart before you know it . It ' s an awful thing for a woman , Miss Ivy , to get a notion after a man who has n't got a notion after her . Men go out and work and delve and drive , and forget ; but there ai n't much in darning stockings and making pillow-cases to take a woman 's thought off her troubles , and sometimes they get sp'iled for life . " Ivy had remained speechless from amazement ; but when Mrs. Simm had finished , she said , with a sudden accession of womanly dignity that surprised the good housekeeper ,  --  " Mrs. Simm , I can not conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you suppose I am not quite able to take care of myself , I assure you you are very much mistaken . " " Lorful heart ! Now , Miss Ivy , you promised you would n't be mad . " " And I have kept my promise . I am not mad . " " No , but you answer up short like , and that is n't what I thought of you , Ivy Geer . " Mrs. Simm looked so disappointed that Ivy took a lower tone , and at any rate she would have had to do it soon ; for her fortitude gave way , and she burst into a flood of tears . She was not , by any means , a heroine , and could not put on the impenetrable mask of a woman of the world . " Now , dear , do n't be so distressful , dear , do n't ! " said Mrs. Simm , soothingly . " I ca n't bear to see you . " " I am sure I never thought of such a thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sobbed Ivy , " and I do n't know what should make you think so . " " Dear heart , I do n't think so . I only told you , so you need n't . " " Why , I should as soon think of marrying the angel Gabriel ! " " O , do n't talk so , dear ; he ' s no more than man , after all ; but still , you know , he ' s no fit match for you . To say nothing of his being older , and all that , I do n't think it ' s the right place for you . Your father and mother are very nice folks ; I am sure nobody could ask for better neighbors , and their good word is in everybody 's mouth ; and they ' ve brought you up well , I am sure ; but , my dear , you know it ' s nothing against you nor them that you ai n't used to splendor , and you would n't take to it natural like . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want to go back to the old fashions , and you ' d most likely have to leave your father and mother ; for it ' s noways probable Mr. Clerron will stay here always ; and when he goes back to the city , think what a dreary life you ' d have betwixt his two proud sisters , on the one hand ,  --  to be sure , there ' s no reason why they should be ; their gran'ther was a tailor , and their grandma was his apprentice , and he got rich , and gave all his children learning ; and Mr. Felix 's father , he was a lawyer , and he got rich by speculation , and so the two girls always had on their high-heeled boots ; but Mr. Clerron , he always laughs at them , and brings up " the grand-paternal shop , " as he calls it , and provokes them terribly , I know . Well , that ' s neither here nor there ; but , as I was saying , here you ' ll have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other , and a great house and servants , and parties to see to , and , lorful heart ! Miss Ivy , you ' d die in three years ; and if you know when you ' re well off , you ' ll stay at home , and marry and settle down near the old folks . Believe me , my dear , it ' s a bad thing both for the man and the woman , when she marries above her . " " Mrs. Simm , " said Ivy , rising , " will you promise me one thing ? " " Certainly , child , if I can . " " Will you promise me never again to mention this thing to me , or allude to it in the most distant manner ? " " Miss Ivy , now , "  --  began Mrs. Simm , deprecatingly . " Because , " interrupted Ivy , speaking very thick and fast , " you can not imagine how disagreeable it is to me . It makes me feel ashamed to think of what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . I suppose  --  indeed , I know  --  that you did it because you thought you ought ; but you may be certain that I am in no danger from Mr. Clerron , nor is there the slightest probability that his fortune , or honor , or reputation , or sisters will ever be disturbed by me . I am very much obliged to you for your good intentions , and I wish you good morning . " " Do n't , now , Miss Ivy , go so  --  " But Miss Ivy was gone , and Mrs. Simm could only withdraw to her pile of clothes , and console herself by stitching and darning with renewed vigor . She felt rather uneasy about the result of her morning 's work , though she had really done it from a conscientious sense of duty . " Welladay , " she sighed , at last , " she ' d better be a little cut up and huffy now , than to walk into a ditch blindfolded ; and I wash my hands of whatever may happen after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . " Alas , Ivy Geer ! The Indian summer day was just as calm and beautiful ,  --  the far-off mountains wore their veil of mist just as aerially ,  --  the brook rippled over the stones with just as soft a melody ; but what " discord on the music " had fallen ! what " darkness on the glory " ! A miserable , dull , dead weight was the heart which throbbed so lightly but an hour before . Wearily , drearily , she dragged herself home . It was nearly sunset when she arrived , and she told her mother she was tired and had the headache , which was true ,  --  though , if she had said heartache , it would have been truer . Her mother immediately did what ninety-nine mothers out of a hundred would do in similar circumstances ,  --  made her swallow a cup of strong tea , and sent her to bed . Alas , alas that there are sorrows which the strongest tea can not assuage ! When the last echo of her mother 's footstep died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , the tide of bitterness and desolation swept unchecked over her soul , and she wept tears more passionate and desponding than her life had ever before known ,  --  tears of shame and indignation and grief . It was true that the thought which Mrs. Simm had suggested had never crossed her mind before ; yet it is no less true , that , all-unconsciously , she had been weaving a golden web , whose threads , though too fine and delicate even for herself to perceive , were yet strong enough to entangle her life in their meshes . A secret chamber , far removed from the noise and din of the world ,  --  a chamber whose soft and rose-tinted light threw its radiance over her whole future , and within whose quiet recesses she loved to sit alone and dream away the hours ,  --  had been rudely entered , and thrown violently open to the light of day , and Ivy saw with dismay how its pictures had become ghastly and its sacredness was defiled . With bitter , though needless and useless self-reproach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorrowfully , she felt that Mrs. Simm 's words were true , and a great gulf lay between her and him . She pictured him moving easily and gracefully and naturally among scenes which to her inexperienced eye were grand and stately ; and then , with a sharp pain , she felt how constrained and awkward and entirely unfit for such a life was she . Then her thoughts reverted to her parents ,  --  their unchanging love , their happiness depending on her , their solicitude and watchfulness ,  --  and she felt as if ingratitude were added to her other sins , that she could have so attached herself to any other . And again came back the bitter , burning agony of shame that she had done the very thing that Mrs. Simm too late had warned her not to do ; she had been carried away by the kindness and tenderness of her friend , and , unasked , had laid the wealth of her heart at his feet . So the night flushed into morning ; and the sun rose upon a pale face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint heart ; for Ivy , kneeling by the couch where her morning and evening prayer had gone up since lisping infancy ,  --  kneeling no longer a child , but a woman , matured through love , matured , alas ! through suffering , prayed for strength and comfort ; prayed that her parents ' love might be rendered back into their own bosoms a hundred-fold ; prayed that her friend 's kindness to her might not be an occasion of sin against God , and that she might be enabled to walk with a steady step in the path that lay before her . And she arose strengthened and comforted . All the morning she lay quiet and silent on the lounge in the little sitting-room . Her mother , busied with household matters , only looked in upon her occasionally , and , as the eyes were always closed , did not speak , thinking her asleep . Ivy was not asleep . Ten thousand little sprites flitted swiftly through the chambers of her brain , humming , singing , weeping , but always busy , busy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear old father had drawn a chair close to her , and was looking into her face . Tears came into her eyes , her lip involuntarily quivered , and then she felt the pressure of his  --  his !  --  surely that was not her father 's kiss ! She started up . No , no ! that was not her father 's face bending over her ,  --  not her father 's eyes smiling into hers ; but , woe for Ivy ! her soul thrilled with a deeper bliss , her heart leaped with a swifter bound , and for a moment all the experience and suffering and resolutions of the last night were as if they had never been . Only for a moment , and then with a strong effort she remembered the impassable gulf . " A pretty welcome home you have given me ! " said Mr. Clerron , lightly . He saw that something was weighing on her spirits , but did not wish to distress her by seeming to notice it . " I wait in my library , I walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and lo ! here you are lying , doing nothing but look pale and pretty as hard as you can . " Ivy smiled ; but did not consider it prudent to speak . " I found your books , however , and have brought them to you . You thought you would escape a lesson finely , did you not ? But you see I have outwitted you . " " Yes ,  --  I went for the books yesterday , " said Ivy , " but I got talking with Mrs. Simm and forgot them . " " Ah ! " he replied , looking somewhat surprised . " I did not know Mrs. Simm could be so entertaining . She must have exerted herself . Pray , now , if it would not be impertinent , what subject was it that drove everything else from your mind ? The best way of preserving apples , I dare swear , or the superiority of pickled grapes to pickled cucumbers . " " No , " said Ivy , with the ghost of another smile ,  --  " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do , Mr. Clerron ? Have you had a pleasant visit to the city ? " " Very well , I thank you , Miss Geer ; and I have not had a remarkably pleasant visit , I am obliged to you . Have I the pleasure of seeing you quite well , Miss Geer ,  --  quite fresh and buoyant ? " The lightness of tone which he had assumed had precisely the opposite effect intended . " Ye banks and braes o ' bonny Doon , How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair ? How can ye chant , ye little birds , And I sae weary fu ' o ' care ? " is the wail of stricken humanity everywhere . And Ivy thought of Mr. Clerron , rich , learned , elegant , happy , on the current of whose life she only floated a pleasant ripple ,  --  and of herself , poor , plain , ignorant , to whom he was the life of life , the all in all . I would not have you suppose this passed through her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ideas rather trooped through in a pellmell sort of way ; but they got through just as effectually . Now , if Ivy had been content to let her muscles remain perfectly still , her face might have given no sign of the confusion within ; but , with a foolish presumption , she undertook to smile , and so quite lost control of the little rebels , who immediately twisted themselves into a sob . Her whole frame convulsed with weeping and trying not to weep , he forced her gently back on the pillow , and , bending low , whispered softly ,  --  " Ivy what is it ? " " O , do n't ask me !  --  please , do n't ! Please , go away ! " murmured the poor child . " I will , my dear , in a minute ; but you must think I should be a little anxious . I leave you as gay as a bird , and healthy and rosy ,  --  and when I come back , I find you white and sad and ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assure you , my little Ivy , and you must believe , that I am your true friend ,  --  and if you would confide in me , perhaps I could bring you comfort . It would at least relieve you to let me help you bear the burden . " The burden being of such a nature , it is not at all probable that Ivy would have assented to his proposition ; but the welcome entrance of her mother prevented the necessity of replying . " O , you ' re awake ! Well , I told Mr. Clerron he might come in , though I thought you would n't be . Slept well this morning , did n't you , deary , to make up for last night ? " " No , mamma , I have n't been asleep . " " Crying , my dear ? Well , now , that ' s a pretty good one ! Nervous she is , Mr. Clerron , always nervous , when the least thing ails her ; and she did n't sleep a wink last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ivy generally sleeps like a top . She walked over to your house yesterday , and when she got home she was entirely beat out ,  --  looked as if she had been sick a week . I do n't know why it was , for the walk could n't have hurt her . She ' s always dancing round at home . I do n't think she ' s been exactly well for four or five days . Her father and I both thought she ' d been more quiet like than usual . " The sudden pang that shot across Ivy 's face was not unobserved by Mr. Clerron . A thought came into his mind . He had risen at Mrs. Geer 's entrance , and he now expressed his regret for Ivy 's illness , and hoped that she would soon be well , and able to resume her studies ; and , with a few words of interest and inquiry to Mrs. Geer , took his leave . " I wonder if Mrs. Simm has been making mischief ! " thought he , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That unfortunate lady was in her sitting-room , starching muslins , when Mr. Clerron entered . She had surmised that he was gone to the farm , and had looked for his return with a shadow of dread . She saw by his face that something was wrong . " Mrs. Simm , " he began , somewhat abruptly , but not disrespectfully , " may I beg your pardon for inquiring what Ivy Geer talked to you about , yesterday ? " " O , good Lord ! she ha ' n't told you , has she ? " cried Mrs. Simm ,  --  her fear of God , for once , yielding to her greater fear of man . The embroidered collar , which she had been vigorously beating , dropped to the floor , and she gazed at him with such terror and dismay in every lineament , that he could not help being amused . He picked up the collar , which , in her perturbation , she had not noticed , and said ,  --  " No , she has told me nothing ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it is connected with her visit here yesterday . If it is anything relating to me , and which I have a right to know , you would do me a great favor by enlightening me on the subject . " Mrs. Simm had not a particle of that knowledge in which Young America is so great a proficient , namely , the " knowing how to get out of a scrape . " She was , besides , alarmed at the effect of her words on Ivy , supposing nothing less than that the girl was in the last stages of a swift consumption ; so she sat down , and , rubbing her starchy hands together , with many a deprecatory " you know , " and apologetic " I am sure I thought I was acting for the best , " gave , considering her agitation , a tolerably accurate account of the whole interview . Her interlocutor saw plainly that she had acted from a sincere conscientiousness , and not from a meddlesome , mischievous interference ; so he only thanked her for her kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age when it would , perhaps , be well for him to conduct matters , particularly of so delicate a nature , solely according to his own judgment . He was sorry to have given her any trouble . " Scissors cuts only what comes between ' em , " soliloquized Mrs. Simm , when the door closed behind him . " If ever I meddle with a courting-business again , my name ai n't Martha Simm . No , they may go to Halifax , whoever they be , ' fore ever I ' ll lift a finger . " It is a great pity that the world generally has not been brought to make the same wise resolution . One , two , three , four days passed away , and still Ivy pondered the question so often wrung from man in his bewildered gropings , " What shall I do ? " Every day brought her teacher and friend to comfort , amuse , and strengthen . Every morning she resolved to be on her guard , to remember the impassable gulf . Every evening she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and binding her closer and closer to him . She thought she might die , and the thought gave her a sudden joy . Death would solve the problem at once . If only a few weeks or months lay before her , she could quietly rest on him , and give herself up to him and wait in heaven for all rough places to be made plain . But Ivy did not die . Youth and nursing and herb-tea were too strong for her , and the color came back to her cheek and the languor went out from her blue eyes . She saw nothing to be done but to resume her old routine . It would be difficult to say whether she was more glad or sorry at seeming to see this necessity . She knew her danger , and it was very fascinating . She did not look into the far-off future ; she only prayed to be kept from day to day . Perhaps her course was wise ; perhaps not . But she had to rely on her own judgment alone ; and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustworthy basis . A new difficulty arose . Ivy found that she could not resume her old habits . To be sure , she learned her lessons just as perfectly at home as she had ever done . Just as punctual to the appointed hour , she went to recite them ; but no sooner had her foot crossed Mr. Clerron 's threshold than her spirit seemed to die within her . She remembered neither words nor ideas . Day after day , she attempted to go through her recitation as usual , and , day after day , she hesitated , stammered , and utterly failed . His gentle assistance only increased her embarrassment . This she was too proud to endure ; and , one day , after an unsuccessful effort , she closed the book with a quick , impatient gesture , and exclaimed ,  --  " Mr. Clerron , I shall not recite any more ! " The agitated flush which had suffused her face gave way to paleness . He saw that she was under strong excitement , and quietly replied ,  --  " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are not quite well yet , and must not try to do too much . We will commence here to-morrow . " " No , sir ,  --  I shall not recite any more at all . " " Till to-morrow . " " Never any more ! " There was a moment 's pause . " You must not lose patience , my dear . In a few days you will recite as well as ever . A fine notion , forsooth , because you have been ill , and forgotten a little , to give up studying ! And what is to become of my laurels , pray ,  --  all the glory I am to get by your proficiency ? " " I shall study at home just the same , but I shall not recite . " " Why not ? " His look became serious . " Because I can not . I do not think it best ,  --  and  --  and I will not . " Another pause . " Ivy , do you not like your teacher ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flash from her lips . She sprang up and stood erect before him , her eyes on fire , and every nerve quivering with intense excitement . He was shocked and startled . It was a new phase of her character ,  --  a new revelation . He , too , arose , and walked to the window . If Ivy could have seen the workings of his face , there would have been a revelation to her also . But she was too highly excited to notice anything . He came back to her and spoke in a low voice ,  --  " Ivy , this is too much . This I did not expect . " He laid his hand upon her head as he had often done before . She shook it off passionately . " Yes , I hate you . I hate you , because  --  " " Because I wanted you to love me ? " " No , sir ; because I do love you , and you bring me only wretchedness . I have never been happy since the miserable day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have utterly failed in what it has been my constant endeavor to do . " " No , sir , you have succeeded in what you endeavored to do . You have taught me . You have given me knowledge and thought , and showed me the source of knowledge . But I had better have been the ignorant girl you found me . You have taken from me what I can never find again . I have made a bitter exchange . I was ignorant and stupid , I know ,  --  but I was happy and contented ; and now I am wretched and miserable and wicked . You have come between me and my home and my father and mother ,  --  between me and all the bliss of my past and all my hope for the future . " " And thus , Ivy , have you come between me and my past and my future ;  --  yet not thus . You shut out from my heart all the sorrow and vexation and strife that have clouded my life , and fill it with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , because , in looking forward , I see only you . I should have known better . There is a gulf between us ; but if I could make you happy  --  " " I do n't want you to make me happy . I know there is a gulf between us . I saw it while you were gone . I measured it and fathomed it . I shall not leap across . Stay you on your side quietly ; I shall stay as quietly on mine . " " It is too late for that , Ivy ,  --  too late now . But you are not to blame , my child . Little sunbeam that you are , I will not cloud you . Go shine upon other lives as you have shone upon mine ! light up other hearths as you have mine ! and I will bless you forever , though mine  --  " He turned away with an expression on his face that Ivy could not read . Her passion was gone . She hesitated a moment , then went to his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strange moistened gleam in his eyes as he turned them upon her . " Mr. Clerron , I do not understand you . " " My dear , you never can understand me . " " I know it , " said Ivy , with her old humility ; " but , at least , I might understand whether I have vexed you . " " You have not vexed me . " " I spoke proudly and rudely to you . I was angry , and so unhappy . I shall always be so ; I shall never be happy again ; but I want you to be , and you do not look as if you were . " If Ivy had not been a little fool , she would not have spoken so ; but she was , so she did . " I beg your pardon , little tendril . I was so occupied with my own preconceived ideas that I forgot to sympathize with you . Tell me why or how I have made you unhappy . But I know ; you need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely wrong . It was a prudish and whimsical notion of my good old housekeeper 's . You are never to think of it again . I never attributed such a thought or feeling to you . " " Did you suppose that was all that made me unhappy ? " " Can there be anything else ? " " I am glad you think so . Perhaps I should not have been unhappy but for that , at least not so soon ; but that alone could never have made me so . " Little fool again ! She was like a chicken thrusting its head into a corner and thinking itself out of danger because it can not see the danger . She had no notion that she was giving him the least clew to the truth , but considered herself speaking with more than Delphic prudence . She rather liked to coast along the shores of her trouble and see how near she could approach without running aground ; but she struck before she knew it . Mr. Clerron 's face suddenly changed . He took both her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps I have been misunderstanding you . I will at least find out the truth . Ivy , do you know that I love you , that I have loved you almost from the first , that I would gladly here and now take you to my heart and keep you here forever ? " " I do not know it , " faltered Ivy , half beside herself . " Know it now , then ! I am older than you , and I seem to myself so far removed from you that I have feared to ask you to trust your happiness to my keeping , lest I should lose you entirely ; but sometimes you say or do something which gives me hope . My experience has been very different from yours . I am not worthy to clasp your purity and loveliness . Still I would do it if  --  Tell me , Ivy , does it give you pain or pleasure ? " Ivy took his hands , as he had before held hers , gazed steadily into his eyes , and said ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love me ? " " I am , Ivy . I do love you . " " How do you love me ? " " I love you with all the strength and power that God has given me . " " You do not simply pity me ? You have not , because you heard from Mrs. Simm , or suspected , yourself , that I was weak enough to mistake your kindness and nobleness ,  --  you have not in pity resolved to sacrifice your happiness to mine ? " " No , Ivy ,  --  nothing of the kind . I pity only myself . I reverence you . I think  --  I have hoped that you loved me as a teacher and friend . I dared not believe you could ever do more ; now something within tells me that you can . Can you , Ivy ? If the love and tenderness and devotion of my whole life can make you happy , happiness shall not fail to be yours . " Ivy 's gaze never for a moment drooped under his , earnest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , slowly and distinctly . " Now I am blessed . I can never ask anything more . " " But I ask something more , " he replied , bending forward eagerly . " I ask much more . I want your love . Shall I have it ? And I want you . " " My love ? " She blushed slightly , but spoke without hesitation . " Have I not given it ,  --  long , long before you asked it , before you even cared for my friendship ? Not love only , but life , my very whole being , centred in you , does now , and will always . Is it right to say this ?  --  But I am not ashamed . I shall always be proud to have loved you , though only to lose you ,  --  and to be loved by you is glory enough for all my future . " One moment Ivy rested in the arms that clasped her ; but as he whispered , " Thus you answer the second question ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . " Never ! " " Ivy ! " " Never ! " more firmly than before . " What does this mean ? " he said , sternly . " Are you trifling ? " There was such a frown on his brow as Ivy had never seen . She quailed before it . " Do not be angry ! Alas ! I am not trifling . Life itself is not worth so much as your love . But the impassable gulf is between us just the same . " " What is it ? Who put it there ? " God put it there . Mrs. Simm showed it to me . " " Mrs. Simm be  --  ! A prating gossip ! Ivy , I told you you were never to mention that again ,  --  never to think of it ; and you must obey me . " " I will try to obey you in that . " " And very soon you shall promise to obey me in all things . But I will not be hard with you . The yoke shall rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You will not do as much , I dare say . You will make me acknowledge your power every day , dear little vixen ! Ivy , why do you draw back ? Why do you not come to me ? " " I can not come to you , Mr. Clerron , any more . I must go home now , and stay at home . " " When your home is here , Ivy , stay at home . For the present , do n't go . Wait a little . " " You do not understand me . You will not understand me , " said Ivy , bursting into tears . " I must leave you . Do n't make the way so difficult . " " I will make it so difficult that you can not walk in it . Why do you wish to leave me ? Have you not said that you loved me ? " " It is because I love you that I go . I am not fit for you . I was not made for you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among your friends , your sisters . I am ignorant . You would be ashamed of me , and then you would not love me ; you could not ; and I should lose the thing I most value . No , Mr. Clerron ,  --  I would rather keep your love in my own heart and my own home . " " Ivy , can you be happy without me ? " " I shall not be without you . My heart is full of lifelong joyful memories . You need not regret me . Yes , I shall be happy . I shall work with mind and hands . I shall not pine away in a mean and feeble life . I shall be strong , and cheerful , and active , and helpful ; and I think I shall not cease to love you in heaven . " " But there is , maybe , a long road for us to travel before we reach heaven , and I want you to help me along . Ivy , I am not so spiritual as you . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . I want to see you and talk with you every day . Why do you speak of such things ? Is it the soul or its surroundings that you value ? Do you respect or care for wealth and station ? Do you consider a woman your superior because she wears a finer dress than you ? " " I ? No , sir ! No , indeed ! you very well know . But the world does , and you move in the world ; and I do not want the world to pity you because you have an uncouth , ignorant wife . I do n't want to be despised by those who are above me only in station . " " Little aristocrat , you are prouder than I. Will you sacrifice your happiness and mine to your pride ? " " Proud perhaps I am , but it is not all pride . I think you are noble , but I think also you could not help losing patience when you found that I could not accommodate myself to the station to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I am , indeed , too proud to wish to lose that ; and losing your respect , as I said before , I should not long keep your love . " " But you will accommodate yourself to any station . My dear , you are young , and know so little about this world , which is such a bugbear to you . Why , there is very little that will be greatly unlike this . At first you might be a little bewildered but I shall be by you all the time , and you shall feel and fear nothing , and gradually you will learn what little you need to know ; and most of all , you will be yourself the best and the loveliest of women . Dear Ivy , I would not part with your sweet , unconscious simplicity for all the accomplishments and acquired elegancies of the finest lady in the world . " ( What men always say . ) " You are not ignorant of anything you ought to know , and your ignorance of the world is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness as I. But we will not talk of it . There is no need . This shall be our home , and here the world will not trouble us . " " And I can not give up my dear father and mother . You and your friends  --  " " They are my friends , valued and dear to me , and dearer still they shall be as the parents of my dear little wife  --  " " I was going to say  --  " " But you shall not say it . I utterly forbid you ever to mention it again . You are mine , all my own . Your friends are my friends , your honor my honor , your happiness my happiness henceforth ; and what God joins together let not man or woman put asunder . " " Ah ! " whispered Ivy , faintly ; for she was yielding , and just beginning to receive the sense of great and unexpected bliss , " but if you should be wrong ,  --  if you should ever repent of this , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be destroyed . " " Ivy , am I a mere school-boy to swear eternal fidelity for a week ? Have I not been tossing hither and thither on the world 's tide ever since you lay in your cradle , and do I not know my position and my power and my habits and my love ? And knowing all this , do I not know that this dear head "  --  etc. , etc. , etc. , etc . But I said I was not going to marry my man and woman , did I not ? Nor have I. To be sure , you may have detected premonitory symptoms , but I said nothing about that . I only promised not to marry them , and I have not married them . And that is the end of my story .
