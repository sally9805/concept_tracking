No . CCV . OCTOBER , 1864 . ART . I. - The Life of Frederick William von Steuben , MajorGeneral in the Revolutionary Army . By FRIEDERICH KAPP . With an Introduction by GEORGE BANOROFT . New York : Mason Brothers . 1859. 8vo. pp . P*735 THE author of this volume is by birth and education a German . An exile in 1848 for having believed in the possibility of a united Germany , and dared to act from his belief , the first months of his residence in the United States were passed in travelling through Texas on horseback : a journey which resulted in a History of American Slavery , and decided the part which he was to take in the politics of his adopted country . Then establishing himself at New York , he studied law , was admitted to the bar , and in a few years obtained a large and lucrative practice . So intelligent a man could not look upon the working of institutions so different from those of his native country without curiosity as to their origin and growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who moulded them . This carried him to American history ; and , finding German names there , he naturally asked himself what German elements had entered into this new civilization , and how far their existence and value had been recognized . First among them in the most important crisis of our history was the military element , directly transplanted from the camp of the Great Frederic , by one who had listened to the master 's teachings and fought under his eye . // And thus the Life of Steuben was undertaken by Mr. Kapp , not as a literary recreation , but as a serious answer to a serious question . For the American portion of this inquiry the materials were abundant . Steuben 's papers , which , at his death , had passed into the hands of his Aid , Colonel Benjamin Walker , were given some twenty years ago by Colonel Walker 's heirs to the New York Historical Society . The same institution has the Gates papers , which contain the greater part of Steuben 's correspondence with Lafayette in fl81 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other officers with whom he was officially connected . In the Greene papers , yet unpublished , there were sixty-two letters be*ing directly upon the subject . Some important papers were found among the manuscripts of Duponcean ; in Dr. Sprague 's rich collection of autographs ; and among the materials collected by Judge Jones , the historian of Oneida County , for a Life of Steuben , which he had once purposed to write , - materials which , having relinquished his own design , he liberally communicated to Mr. Kapp . Still more valuable were the documents which had been accidentally left among the papers of Colonel Walker when that gentleman 's heirs gave the Steuben papers to the Historical Society of New York : " opinions on military matters , muster-rolls , army lists , complete returns , order-books , letters , " - " a necessary supplement " to the main collection . The historical student will easily conceive the delight with which Mr. Kapp first discovered these " priceless documents " amid heaps of old bills and business records , long since useless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of their intelligent owner , Mr. Mann , to be used first for his own purposes , and then deposited by the side of their companions amid the treasures of that noble institution which has done and is still doing so much for the study of American history . Continuing his researches , our author found a living coinmentator for this mass of documentary records , - a man who could tell him how Steuben looked and walked and talked , how his voice sounded , how his eye lighted up and his face glowed when he spoke of the great men he had lived with , and the great things he had helped them do , and how that eye and // that face looked when death suddenly laid his hand upon them . Steuben 's last words , " iDo not be alarmed , my son , " had fallen upon his ears sixty-five years before , and there he still was , a hale , hearty man , older by twenty years than his adopted father lived to be , but with his recollections of him unimpaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in its protracted course had given him no friend so kind , so disinterested , and so true . John W. Mulligan was this old man 's name , and a rare privilege he held it to be enabled to talk of his friend to one so able to appreciate him . We , too , once heard him speak of Steuben , heard him describe the evacuation of New York , and tell how he and hundreds with him felt when they saw the British boats pugh off from the shore , and the British fleet drop reluctantly down the bay . But he also has passed away , and the last link between the gallant old German and the living generation is forever severed . Thus far Mr. Kapp 's researches had gone on smoothly . He had examined everything that was to be found in New York , Philadelphia , Albany , and Utica . Public institutions and private collections had been thrown open to him without reserve . One place only remained to be explored , - the Archives at Washington . From one door only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building in which the servants of the people preserve the original and authentic record of the people 's history . For Steuben 's European life the materials were less complete and far more difficult to reach . His position in the Prussian army had not been so prominent a one as to make it necessary for him to commit the daily record of his actions to paper , and the mention of him which occurs here and there in the official documents of the Seven Years ' War , though always honorable , is always brief . Mr. Bowen , in the valuable memoir of Steuben which he contributed to Sparks 's American Biography , was compelled to pass over his early history as a period of which " nothing was known . " Yet for Steuben , as for all men , that early history was the key to his later history , and when we remember that he came to the United States at the age of forty-seven , we shall see how impossible it is without it to understand him as a man , even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kapp 's connection with Germany stood him in // good stead . Familiar with historical research , he knew what to ask for and where to go ; and the result of his persevering and well-directed labors is two chapters , which give us interesting glimpses of the child and the boy , and a satisfactory view of the man . We have entered into these details , because we wished to show from the beginning what strong ground Mr. Kapp stands on as a biographer . The historian 's claim to our confidence is founded upon the industry and intelligence with which he collects his documents , even more than upon the skill with which he uses them . It is not impossible to make an interesting picture out of scanty materials , but it requires a high sense of historic responsibility to hold back your hand from your pen until you have become satisfied that there is nothing left for you to discover . On first approaching his subject , Mr. Kapp felt strongly tempted to confine himself to a selection of Steuben 's letters and despatches , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced him that there were too many breaks in them to permit him to do this and give a faithful picture of his hero . Germany possesses a classic work of this kind ,  --  the Life of the celebrated jurist Feuerbach , by his son , the no less celebrated philosopher . Carlyle , too , has tried his iron hand at it in his own way , in the letters and speeches of Cromwell . And , wherever the materials are not too abundant , it is the surest way of conveying a correct idea of a man 's character , habits of thought , and actions . But it would have been a sad mistake in Mr. Sparks to have sent out his eleven volumes of selections from Washington 's letters without an independent narrative of his life . And we greatly doubt whether the record of Steuben 's services would have reached so wide a circle of readers in the eight or ten volumes which it would have required to do justice to the sixteen folios of the Historical Society , with all the additions made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucid and comprehensive narrative into which he has woveii them . Not but what we hope that Steuben 's letters , and the letters of the other leaders of our great Revolutionary struggle , will some day be published . In no other way can the difficulties // against which they contended , and the inadequate materials with which they carried on the contest , be fully understood . In no other way can the lessons of that period of our history be made fully available for the present and the future . For there is scarcely a rule of action illustrated by that war which does not apply with equal force to this , and scarcely a mistake in the conduct of this which might not have been avoided by a careful study of the history of the iRevolution . In the use of his documents Mr. Kapp has employed an intelligent and judicious criticism , equally free from the two equally dangerous extremes of credulity and scepticism . He weighs evidence calmly and carefully , and draws his conclusions with great fairness . We have verified his references far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he errs , it is in good faith : never from wilful carelessness , and still less from wilful misrepresentation . He is nowhere guilty of the meanness of mutilating quotations and suppressing evidence . Steuben is his hero , and , if not altogether a hero after his own heart , yet one whom he can hold up to the world without blushing . He claims for him all that he believes to be his due : and as you read the evidence that he founds the claim upon , you can not accuse him of having asked too much . Even in the only three passages in which we are not prepared to accept his conclusions , we are not disposed to call his sincerity in question . We think that he has been unjust towards Lafayette . Steuben , who had fought in the trenches at Prague thirteen years before Lafayette was born , and who , , during the longest and bloodiest of all the wars of the century , had won himself a place in the military family of a man whose confidence was never given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalrous young Frenchman , who , when they first met , had been only twice under fire , with the affectionate reverence with which Americans looked up to him . Nor did it soften the veteran 's feelings towards his young colleague , that , while Lafayette 's ample fortune permitted him to live according to his rank , he was compelled to depend even for the necessaries of life upon an inadequate and irregular pay . Moreover , Lafayette was a Frenchman , and Steuben loved to recall the days when he had fought against Frenchmen and " helped make them // run . " Lafayette was mercurial . Steuben , though hot-blooded and quick , was dignified and punctilious . Lafayette had embraced the cause of the young republic with the enthusiasm of a heart fresh from Plutarch and Livy , Raynal and Rousseau ; Steuben had put on the American uniform as he would have put on the uniform of Austria or Sardinia , for higher rank , higher pay , and the chances of glory . One , in short , was just entering upon life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach ; the other had already passed through more than half its course , seeing friendships cool and illusions fade by the way , and with nothing but a small competence and dependent rank as the reward of his blood and toils . When these two men were brought together on the same field of action , it was hardly possible that there should not be frequent clashings between them . Frederic 's veteran listened with ill-concealed contempt to the military opinions of the " mousquetaire noir , " and the young Marquis , sure of the friendship of Washington , sure of the attachment of the army , may sometimes , perhaps , have given himself too little thought of the claims of a military adventurer , however deserving of respect . In these differences , Mr. Kapp - naturally , we grant , but still , we think , somewhat too decidedly - takes sides with his countryman . In Lafayette 's military character lie finds little to justify the hopes that were formed of him . And even in the juster estimate which he gives of his diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collateral influences are expanded to their utmost proportions , and , instead of the active , efficient , and persevering enthusiast , who hurried to and fro , from Europe to America , from France to Spain , giving neither sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids till his end had been attained , we have a vain , frivolous character , of little ability and less weight in the conduct of great affairs . We have dwelt with pain upon this portion of Mr. Kapp 's volume , for to our minds there are few things more painful than the misappreciation of an historical character by one whose general sympathies would lead him to view it aright . But fortunately it forms a very small part of the work , leaving its general accuracy of statement and opinion unimpaired. // Another of his conclusions in which we can not fully concur is his unqualified condemnation of Congress in its treatment of Beaumarchais . iDe Lom6nie , it is true , bears him out in all he says ; but is iDe Lom6nie fully borne out by the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted , who assured Mr. George Sumner that he had been " fully , largely , and generously paid . " * The question is one of the most important and difficult in the diplomatic history of our Revolution , - too important and difficult , indeed , to be discussed in a subordinate paragraph , and on which , for the present , therefore , we must confine ourselves to simple expression of doubt . There is one more point upon which we can not fully accept Mr. Kapp 's views . The crowd of foreign officers who beset the doors of Congress and the tent of the commander-in-chief with their claims and pretensions , gave serious umbrage to native officers , and added materially to the perplexities and heartburnings occasioned hy questions of rank . Steuben himself speaks of these barons and marquises , for they dealt freely in titles and orders , with scarcely less severity than Washington . Yet Steuben could not have felt , what must always have been . present to the mind of Washington , that the foreign officer was usually contending for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for his birthright . To distinguish between a high-minded and honorable adventurer like Steuben , and an abmitious incendiary like Conway , was not always an easy task ; and even the examples of Lee and Gates might have been accepted as demonstrations that birth within the political limits of the same empire did not carry with it the same feelings as birth upon the same soil . On more than one occasion it was held necessary to select native citizens for services of peculiar responsibility ; j* nor , when foreigners grew importunate in their calls for promotion and important com * See an oration delivered before the municipal authorities of the city of Boston , July 4 , 1859 , by George Sumner , Preface , note .

Their sacrifices of position at home , and money on their voyage hither , were like the sacrifices which the lottery gambler makes when he buys a ticket with ready money in the hope of a prize , but with a perfect knowledge that it may bring him nothing but a blank . Washington 's opinion upon this subject was decided , and expressed without modification ; * and on such subjects Washington 's opinion must be accepted as embodying the opinions of Greene and Knox and the men in whom he most confided . Mr. Kapp is far from justifying the conduct and pretensions of this mixed rabble of " hungry adventurers . " The sensitiveness which he manifests is neither unnatural nor unbecoming . It was perfectly natural that he should feel the wrong done to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was highly becoming that he should express his sense of it strongly . But the native American of 1776 was in a very different position from the native American of 1853 ; and they who would have been the first to look coldly upon the selfimposed champions of a struggle for political independence , would have been the last to approve an unjust and narrowminded contest for political supremacy . And now , having frankly expressed our dissent from the only parts of his work with which we can not fully and heartily agree , we will endeavor , with Mr. Kapp 's guidance , to follow the gallant German through the vicissitudes of his adventurous career , from his cradle within the walls of the stern old fortress of Magdeburg to his grave under a hemlock of an American forest . The name , which , passing through the variations of Stoebe , Steube , and Stoeben , finally took its place in modern history under the form of Von Steuben , t first appears in the thirteenth century , in the list of noblemen who held feudal manors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other * See Washington to Franklin , Sparks , V. 32 ; stronger to R.

During the Thirty Years ' War , the branch from which the General descended was separated from the parent stock , and won distinction through its successive generations by the pen and the sword . One among them , his grandfather , an eminent theologian , was known by an " able commentary on the New Testament and the Apocalypse . " Another , his father 's elder brother , was distinguished as a mathematician , a writer upon military science , and the inventor of a new system of fortification . His father , Wilhelm Augustine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the military service of Prussia at the age of sixteen , was married at thirty-one , when a captain of engineers , and , after having served with distinction in the great wars of the century , and filled positions of confidence and trust under Frederic the Great , died in honorable poverty at the age of eighty-four , on the 26th of April , 1783 . Of his ten children only three , two sons and a daughter , lived to grow up ; and of these the subject of our history , Frederic William Augustus Henry Ferdinand , was the eldest . At the time of his birth , November 15 , 1730 , his father was stationed at the fortress of Magdeburg on the Elbe , and while he was yet a child , he followed him , as the duties of service called him , to Cronstadt and the Crimea . When the father returned to Prussia , the son was barely ten years old . Thus all the associations of his infancy and childhood were military , - " guns , drums , trumpets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully turned of fourteen , another chapter was added to his rude experience of life : he served under his father as a volunteer in the campaign of 1744 , and shared the perils and hardships of the long and bloody siege of Prague . Fortunately his father , who had received a good education himself , felt the importance of giving the best that he could command to his son . And fortunately , too , the Jesuits ' Colleges of Neisse and Breslaa afforded the means of thorough // elementary instruction . Here young Steuben laid the foundations of a superior knowledge of mathematics , and acquired a tincture of history and polite literature . And here he formed an idea of the importance of intellectual culture , which led him , when first called into active life , to turn to account every opportunity of adding to his store . About his profession there could be no doubt . Even if all his early impressions had not filled him with aspirations for military glory , there could have been no question about the surest road to distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army as a cadet . In two years he became an ensign ; in four more , a lieutenant ; and first lieutenant just a year before the breaking out of the Seven Years ' War . Of this period two letters are the only words of his own that have been preserved , and those words are in bad French . But the thoughts are those of an ardent young man , who knew his profession and loved it , and asked nothing from fortune but a chance to distinguish himself . " Yes , my dear Henry , if there is a war , I promise you , at the end of a second campaign , that your friend will be either in Hades or at the head of a regiment . " And soon the war came ,  --  the great Seven Years ' War ; not , indeed , a war of principles and ideas , - a political war merely ; yet in military science the connecting link between the great wars of Eugene and Marlborough , and the development of strategy by Napoleon . Steuben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant one . The first campaign found him a first lieutenant . The last left l*im a major , and in temporary command of a regiment . He was wounded at the battle of Prague in May , 175T , and shared the triumph of IRossbach in November . The next year gave him a wider field . The brilliant , dashing , dare-devil hero of this war was the General von Mayr , the illegitimate son of a nobleman , and an uneducated , self-made soldier , one of those men whom war raises to rank and fortune , and peace sends to the jail or the gallows . Forced into the army by necessity , he had resolutely made his way to a command , fighting with equal desperation under differ*nt banners , and entering , at last , the Prussian service . Frederic , who wanted just such a man to oppose to the enemy 's // Croats and Pandours , put him at the head of a free corps , where his dauntless courage and enterprising genius had full play . Steuben became his adjutant-general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the beginning of 1759 , death , which had so often passed the bold adventurer by in the field , came to him in his tent , and then Steuben returned to his regiment with a knowledge of the management of light infantry , and a habit of cool and prompt decision in the tumult of battle , which he could hardly have learned so quickly or so well in any other school . lie was soon appointed adjutant to General von Hiilsen , fighting with him in the unsuccessful battle of Kay , in July , and wounded in the murderous battle of Kunersdorf , where Frederic commanded iii person , and having , something like Melas at Marengo , won a victory and prepared his bulletins , was defeated with terrible slaughter on the same day , and by the same enemy . Then for two years , from August , 1759 , to September , 1761 , we lose sight of him . But that he passed them in good service is evident from his reappearance as Aid to General Knoboch when Platen made his brilliant march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the names of father and son appear together , for the elder Steuben , as major of engineers , built the bridge over the Wartha which the younger Steuben crossed ; too swiftly , perhaps , to clasp his father 's hand , or do more than exchange a hurried glance of recognition as the headlong torrent of war swept him onward . Some skilful marching comes next , with overwhelming odds to make head against , and the scene closes for a time with a blockade and a capitulation ; a blockade in an open town , desperately defended , till ammunition and provisions failed , and half the town was on fire , and an honorable capitulation , with flying banners , and beating drums , and all the honors of war . In this surrender , Steuben was the negotiator , and by its terms he followed his general and brother officers to St. Petersburg as prisoners of war . But the imprisonment was a pleasant one , for the Grand Duke Peter , a warm admirer of Frederic , took him into special favor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surer path to promotion than active participation in a victory ; // for he did his king such good service with the Grand Duke , that on his return to Prussia he was made captain , and raised from the staff of a subordinate general to that of the great commander himself . And here his military education received its highest finish ; for besides what he learnt in the daily performance of his duty under the king 's own eye , he was admitted to the lessons upon the higher principles of the art of war which Frederic himself gave to a limited number of young officers whom he had selected , not for birth or fortune , but for talent and zeal . And thus it was as Aid to the king that he took part in the siege of Schweidnitz , and saw the curtain fall upon the checkered scenes of this long and bloody war . The king , well pleased with his services , bestowed upon him a lay benefice , with an income of four hundred thalets . Peace came , and with it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Devil , " was the expressive phrase with which the future marshal was sent back to private life ; and among the reasons assigned for Steuben 's withdrawal from the army is dissatisfaction with the new position assigned him in it . However this may be , we find him , soon after the peace of Hubertsburg , travelling for amusement , staying a short time at ilalle and Dessau , then going to Hamburg , where he made an acquaintance that was to exercise a decisive influence upon his future career at a decisive moment , - the acquaintance of the Count St. Germain , - and last to the baths of Wildbad in Suabia , where he was presented to the Prince of Hoheuzollern Hechingen , and , through the influence of the Princess of Wurtemberg and Prince Henry of Prussia , received the appointment of Grand Marshal of his court . In the busy idleness of this petty court Steuben passed nearly ten years ; acceptable to the Prince for his intelligent devotion and strict performance of his duty , acceptable to the courtiers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dealings . He had leisure for reading , of which he had once been fond , and for society , in which he was well fitted to shine . The Prince loved travelling , and Steuben travelled with him wherever he went ,  --  to other courts of Germany , and , welcomest duty of all , to Paris , where his rank opened for him the doors of the most celebrated saloons , and procured him the acquaintance // of the men he most desired to know . So contented was lie with this mode of life , that he purchased a small country seat by the name of Weilbeim ; and thus , but for that " vice of courts , " which has ever reigned in them supreme , he might have floated pleasantly on the easy tide to the French Revolution , and drawn his sword once more with comrades of the Seven Years ' War under the banners of the Duke of Brunswick . But Steuben was a Protestant , the descendant of Protestants from Luther 's day downwards ; the court was Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a heretic should stand so high and live so intimately with their sovereign . How they intrigued against him , and how cunningly they strove to sow dissensions betwixt the Prince and his Grand Marshal , we can readily conceive , although the story has not come down to us in all its details . But Steuben , well knowing that , whatever the immediate result of the actual contest might be , there could be no return to the tranquillity which had formed the chief charm of his position , discreetly bowed to the blast and resigned , carrying with him into private life the esteem of the Prince , and the friendship of many eminent men whose friendship he had won under the Prince 's auspices . Once more a free man , he seems to have experienced some return of military ambition . For a moment , there was a prospect of war , and could he have obtained , without much effort , the rank he felt himself entitled to , he would have entered the service of the Emperor . But his heart was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to Joseph , as his friends the Prince de Ligne and General von Ried urged him to do , and the negotiations which he had indolently begun were suffered to fall through . In 1769 the Margrave of Baden had conferred upon him the cross of the order of " La Fid6lit6 " and now , on resigning his grand-marshal*hip , he first turned his steps toward Carlsrnhe , the seat of the Margrave 's court . Even quieter than that of ilechingen was the life that lie led here . A1z*solute master of his time , and of a competent income , he could go whither he would , still sure of meeting or making friends everywhere . A visit to the country-seat of the Baron von Waldener in Alsace brought him once more into contact with the Count St. Germain ; and in the winter of 1776 , while // Washington was struggling through the Jerseys and striking his daring blow at the German mercenaries in Trenton , Steuben was making at Montpellier the acquaintance of the Earl of Warwick and Earl Spencer . So intimate did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel and make them a visit in England . Paris lay in his way , and as the Count St. Germain had recently been made Minister of War , lie could not resist the temptation of passing a few days there and congratulating him on his advancement . It was early in May , 17fl* . ' Franklin had already taken up his residence at Passy , and was drawing young and old around him . Silas Deane had been in France almost a year . Arthur Lee was there , too , busy , active , jealous , suspicious . Beaumarchais was gliding to and fro , as adroit , keen-eyed , and subtile as his own Figaro . Paris was unconsciously vibrating to the touch of the lightning-tamer , and preparing to hail him as the breaker of misused sceptres . But it was not of this that Steuben was thinking as he rode through the Barri*re on the 2d of May ; and as soon as he had made himself comfortable at his hotel , he wrote to tell the Count of his arrival , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not com* to Versailles , " was the answer . " In three days I will see you at the Arsenal , and will send an officer to conduct you thither . We have important questions to *discuss together . " At this interview , for the first time perhaps , certainly for the first time with any approach to personal interest , he heard the story of the revolted colonies , of their perils and their resources , of the sympathy which France and Spain felt for them , and of the danger that , with all their courage and resolution , with all the secret aid of their European friends , they might still fail for want of a man like him to organize and discipline their citizen soldiers . Here was glory , here was fortune , here was a field such as no European war could afford , for applying the lessons of his great master , and demonstrating the superiority of the system which they both believed in so firmly . Steuben was taken by surprise . At first , the difficulties and objections rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at length , trying to meet them all . " What would you advise me , not as a minister , but as a friend ? " " Sir , as a minister I have no advice to give you on these subjects ; but as your friend , I would never advise you to do anything which I would not do myself , were I not employed in the king 's service . " Thus ended the first interview . Next day they met again . Twenty-four hours ' reflection had removed some doubts , awakened some hopes . It was but a distant sound of the trumpet , but the old spirit - the spirit formed in infancy , cherished through boyhood , and accepted in manhood as the chief spring of action - was stirred again . With many warnings to be cautious , to keep away from Versailles , and not allow himself to be too freely seen in Paris , St. Germain gave him a letter to Beaumarchais . Beaumarchais introduced him to Deane , Deane took him to Franklin . The interview was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner to which he was then little accustomed , " ( not the court manner , that is , but one that he became well accustomed to in the sequel , ) " that he had no authority to enter into engagements , and could not advance him anything for the expense of bis.voyage . " This was not the way to speak to a man whom the Great King had honored with his confidence . Steuben returned to Beaumarchais to say that he should go back immediately to Germany , and did not want to hear anything more about America . Next day he went to Versailles . St. Germain seemed hurt at his decision , but he invited Steuben to pass a few days at his house . This , at least , could not be refused . After dinner , the Spanish ambassador , Count Aranda , came in , not , perhaps , altogether by accident . " Here is a man , " said St. Germain , as he presented Steuben to him , " who will risk nothing , consequently he will gain nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer and the Earl of Warwick , he formed at the same time the acquaintance of the Prince de Montbarey , who , like most of the men of distinction with whom he was brought into connection , conceived a high opinion of his talents and an affection for his person . He too was at Versailles , and Steu // Oct. ben , as St. Germain had doubtless foreseen , went to wait upon him . Another sharp attack upon his resolution by another friend . " I can determine nothing until I return to Germany , " was his answer . But the idea had taken possession of his mind , and his friends , when they saw him turn his steps homeward instead of going'to England , must have felt almost sure of him . July was near its end when he reached IRastadt . A letter from Beaumarchais was there before him , telling him that a ship and money were ready for him , and that Count St. Germain expected his immediate return . A letter from the Count himself urged him to hasten back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baden was at llastadt , and Steuben , who placed great confidence in his judgment , told him the story , and showed him the letters . Prince Louis , a lieutenant-general himself in the service of Holland , could see no room for hesitation . And thus , between two princes , three counts , and the adroitest of negotiators , the aide-de-camp of the most absolute of kings surrendered himself to the service of the most democratic of republics . There were still difficult details to arrange . First , Frederic 's consent to transfer to Steuben 's nephew , the Baron von Canitz , his canonry of llavelsberg , which now brought him an income of four thousand six hundred livres . Then the fixing upon a definite character to present himself in , and securing , as far as possible , the means of making his application to Congress successful . It was already known in France that a strong feeling had been excited in America by the facility with which the Congress had given commissions to foreign officers . On the very day that Steuben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the camp in which he was watching the movements of Sir William Howe , wrote Franklin " that every new arrival was only a new source of embarrassment to himself , and of disappointment and chagrin to the gentlemen who came over . " * It was evident that no Major , no Colonel Steuben could be advanced to a position in which he could introduce the reforms the French Minister felt it to be so important to // effect , without seriously offending the just susceptibilities of the native officers . The refusal to confirm Deane 's contract with Du Coudray was one of the objections which Steuben had urged after his interview with Franklin . And yet St. Germain and Vergennes were both convinced that , without a reform in the organization of the American army , the money and stores of France would be given in vain . It was decided , therefore , that Steuben should assume the rank of a lieutenant-general , an assumption imperfectly borne out by his actual rank of general of the Circle of Suabia ; and , to meet the objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , that he should merely wait upon them to announce his intention of serving one or two campaigns as a volunteer , and ask letters to the leading members of Congress . lie had not yet seen Vergennes . On the third day after his return Montharey introduced him to the Minister in a special audience . " You are determined , then , to go to America ? " said the veteran diplomatist . " Do you think the idea extravagant ? " asked Steuben . " On the contrary , it is the road to fame and distinction ; but I strongly recommend you to make an agreement beforehand , and not rely too implicitly on republican generosity . " Steuben replied , that he should make no conditions ; but that , if the republic should prove ungrateful , he expected that the King of France would not , and that Count Vergennes and the Prince de Montbarey would not allow his services to go unrewarded . The Minister was instantly on his guard . " You know very well that it is impossible for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Go , succeed , and you will never regret the step you have taken . " His preparations were now made rapidly . With St. Germain he discussed the reforms he proposed to introduce into the American army . From Beaumarchais he received as a loan the money for his outfit and passage . lie chose four officers for aids , - De l'Enfant , De IRomanai , Des Epini*res , and De Ponthi*re . NQt knowing English , he required a secretary and interpreter ; and at Beaumarchais 's house he found Peter S. // IDuponcean , familiar some thirty years ago to the citizens of Philadelphia as a hale old man , long known to the legal world as a skilful lawyer , to publicists as the translator of Bynkershoek , to the world of letters as the author of a treatise on the Chinese Language which won the prize of the Institute of his native France ; but then a gay , light-hearted young Frenchman of seventeen , with a remarkable talent for the study of language , and a premonitory passion for English , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickname of L'Anglais . Two vessels were upon the point of sailing for America with part of the arms and stores furnished by Beaumarchais under the name of llortalez &amp; Co. , and the royal commissioner gave Steuben his choice of the two . By the advice of Count Miranda he fixed upon the " Heureux , " a twenty-four-gun ship , which was to sail from Marseilles under the name of " Le Flamand . " Steuben also assumed a new name , Frank , and , as a protection in case of capture by the English , received despatches under that name to the Governor of Martinique . Cheerful , self-reliant , nothing doubting but that two or three years would see him safely returned with a full purse and laurelled brow , to talk over his campaigns in the saloons of Paris and at the watering-places of Germany , he embarked with his military family on the 26th of September , 1T7T , just fifteen days after the battle of Brandywine , and while the weary and half-trained band which , before another campaign , he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the position whence in eight days more it was to make its bold dash upon Germantown . The Flamand 's passage was long , boisterous , and perilous . At last the laud came in sight , and on a bright , clear 1st of December the vessel entered the harbor of Portsmouth , New Hampshire , and Steuben saw for the first time the flag of tho Republic waving over an American fortress . As soon as General Langdon learned that the anchoring ship held a Prussian lieutenant-general , a veteran of the Seven Years ' War , he hastened on board to welcome him ; and , taking him and his suite in his barge , brought them to the landing , whither the whole town was flocking to gaze at and greet them . Meanwhile , the guns of the fortress fired a lieutenant-general 's salute , // and the ships in the harbor , displaying their flags , joined in the national welcome . At that day 's dinner Steuben first heard of the surrender of Burgoyne , and hailed the tidings as a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next.reviewed the troops . One of his earliest cares , also , was to write to Washington and Congress , expressing his desire " to deserve the title of a citizen of America by fighting for her liberty . " With his own letters he forwarded copies of those which Franklin , Deane , and Beaumarchais had given him . On the 12th of December , he set out for Boston . Here his chief entertainer was John Hancock , just returning to private life after honorable service in Congress ; and often during the five weeks that the bad roads kept Steuben waiting for the answers to his letters , his feet trod that long flight of steps and crossed that hospitable threshold , which but a few months ago still remained to tell of the olden time and Boston 's provincial splendor . At last Washington 's answer came , courteous , though formal , and referring him to Congress as the only body authorized to accept offers of service and make appointments . At the same time Hancock informed him that he had been directed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite a comfortable journey to York , in Pennsylvania , where Congress was then sitting . Hancock was not the man to do this work negligently . The ground was covered with snow , and sleighs , with five negroes for drivers and grooms , were prepared for the baggage , and saddle-horses for the general and his suite . A purveyor , too , accompanied them to provide provisions and quarters . The enemy were in pos* session of Newport and New York , and made frequent incursions into the interior . A roundabout course , extending to four hundred and ten miles , was the only route Steuben and his party could take without exposing themselves to unnecessary danger . The journey began on the 14th of January , and it was the 5th of February before they reached York . Thus at the very outset Steuben gained what to his military . eye was an invaluable view of a large section of his new country . And now opens the serious chapter of Steuben 's American life . The Congress at York was not that wise congress which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship of state " upon its perilous voyage , but that weak and divided Congress which had opened its ears to calumnies upon Washington , and almost resolved to set up Gates as his rival . Gates himself , with a brain whirling with the excitement* of unmerited success , was enjoying the good dinners and warm quarters at the temporary seat of government , while Washington was starving and freezing with his army in the huts and hovels of Valley Forge . How was Steuben , with his five weeks ' stock of English to distinguish between the true hero and the false one ? St. Germain had chosen his man well : an experienced and scientific soldier , for no other could have done such work as he was appointed to do ; a man experienced in men also , and both too wise and too honorable to become the tool of a faction . Gates loaded him with civilities , and urged him to stay at his house . But meeting the civilities with polite appreciation , he refused the dangerous hospitality . It soon became apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American army , Vergennes , St. Germain , Montbarey , and Miranda had proved themselves wise in their generation . Dazzled by the claim which was so well borne out by his professional knowledge and personal dignity , Congress appointed a special committee to wait upon him and listen to his proposals . They were not such as Congress had been in the habit of receiving , for he told them that he asked for neither rank nor pay ; that he wished to enter the army as a volunteer , and perform any duty which the commander-inchief might assign him ; and that commissions for his aids , and the payment of his actual expenses , were the only conditions for which he should stipulate , leaving the question of ultimate compensation to be decided by the success or failure of the struggle . No time was lost in idle discussions . The committee reported without delay . The next day he received a formal entertainment from Congress as a mark of special honor , members and guests gazing upon him , as , in his rich uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his breast , he sat at the right hand of President Laurens , and auguring well for the army which was to be trained by a man of such a keen eye and // soldierly bearing . When all was over , the President handed him the resolution of the Congress - Whereas , Baron Steuben , a lieutenant-general in foreign service , has in a most disinterested and heroic manner offered his services to these States as a volunteer , " Resolved , That the President present the thanks of Congress , in behalf of these United States , to Baron Steuben , for the zeal he has shown for the cause of America , and the disinterested tender he has been pleased to make of his military talents , and inform him that Congress cheerfully accept of his services as a volunteer in the army of these States , and wish him to repair to General Washington 's quarters as soon as convenient . " Steuben lost no time in setting out for camp . The ovations continued . At Lancaster the German population felt all their national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subscription ball was given in honor of his arrival . While lie was yet some miles from camp , Washington came out to meet him and conduct him to his quarters . There a guard of twenty-five men had been stationed with an officer at their head . Steuben would have declined the honor , saying that he was merely a volunteer . " The whole army , " said Washington , " would gladly stand sentinel for such volunteers . " The next day the troops were mustered , and Washington accompanied Steuben to pass them in review . During part of his life , at least , Washington was a soldier at heart . When he first heard the bullets whistle , he found " something charming in the sound . " * He had often said , that " the most beautiful spectacle he had ever beheld was the display of British troops ' * on the morning of 3raddock 's defeat.f And even after he had declared that " he scarcely could conceive the cause that would induce him to draw his sword again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobserved spectator , he would be glad to peep at the Russian and Austrian troops at their manceuvrings on a grand field day . " * Thus , when * The discovery of a letter of Washington 's with these very words in it confirms Walpole 's story , hitherto called in question as inconsistent with Washington 's character .

IX . p. 145. // Steuben came to him as a Prussian veteran , he felt that there was a bond between them which they might both cheerfully acknowledge . And perhaps he also felt that to bring him at once before the army as the object of uncommon honors was the surest way of preparing the army to look up to him as a man capable of imparting to them the knowledge and habits in which they were so universally deficient . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no longer an unprincipled intriguer like Conway to look to for the reform of discipline , but " a gentleman , a man of military knowledge , " * and with that knowledge of the world without which the highest military knowledge would have been of no avail . But it was a serious drawback that he could talk with him only through an interpreter , even though the interpreter were Hamilton or Laurens . At no time in the course of the war had the condition of the army been more distressing . The life at Valley Forge was a daily struggle with cold and hunger ; the log and mud huts in which the troops lived were an imperfect protection against the rigor of the winter , made doubly severe by the want of proper clothing and nutritious food . The frequent failure of supplies had familiarized the minds of the men with the idea of mutiny , and brought the officers to feel that , if not almost justifiable , it was at least inevitable . There was no assurance of greater regularity or abundance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . Out of the original force of seventeen thousand men , there were three thousand nine hundred and eightynine without clothes enough to enable them to mount guard or appear on parade . From desertion and disease five thousand and twelve men were all that could be called out for duty ; and these were so imperfectly armed , that muskets , fowling pieces , and rifles were found in the same company , with a few bayonets scattered here and there ; guns and bayonets alike rusty and unfit for service . These , however , were the men with whom Washington had maneuvred in front and on the flanks of the well-armed and well-disciplined army of Sir William Howe ; had fought the battle of the Brandywine , where a // 186* . Baron Steuben. 343 portion of them under Greene had marched four miles in fortynine minutes , seizing and holding a favorable position for covering the retreat of the main body ; and the battle of Germantowii , where a dense fog and an error of judgment were all that saved that wing of the British army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this because they possessed what Burgoyne * attributed to the Northern army , - " the fundamental points of military institution , - sobriety , subordination , regularity , and courage Their panics were confined and of short duration ; their enthusiasm extensive and permanent . " It was to the honor of Steuben 's sagacity that , with an eye accustomed to the faultless equipments and precision of movement of Prussian troops , he should have detected those fundamental points , or the capacity for acquiring them , under the rags and rusty equipments and in the awkward " Indiaii file " of the American troops . One of the characteristic acts of the Conway cabal had been the creation for Conway of the office of inspector-general , with powers so extensive as to justify the expression of " imperium in irnperio , " which Marshall applies to the organization of the commissariat.f But , happily for the army , the conspiracy was detected before he entered fully upon the performance of his duties , and thus one of the immediate results of the attempt to forward the malignant aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-minded and honorable man . In another way , too , the Providence that watched over us had educed good from this evil . Muffin , the quartermaster-general , though originally a member of Washington 's family , and intrusted by him with this responsible office " from a thorough persuasion of his integrity , " j had proved false both to Washington and to his country ; neglecting his official duty , and entering deeply into the plots of the intriguers . During the hardships of this trying winter , he had held himself aloof from camp , and contributed nothing , either directly or indirectly , to the feeding or clothing of the army . At last a committee was * Letter to Lord G. Germain . Sparks 's Correspondence of the Revolution , II . pp. 96 , 97 , note . f Marshall 's Washington , Vol . I. p. 215 , 2d ed . ? Sparks , Vol . IlL p. 68. // fOot . sent by Congress to take counsel with Washington , and see what could be done to a ' *ert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * which were becoming more and more imminent every day . One of the effects of their exertions and representations was the appointment of General Greene as Muffin 's successor . One of the chief obstacles to the establishment of discipline was thus removed , and if zeal and energy could accomplish it , the army would henceforth be fed and clothed . Steuben 's first step was to draw up a plan of inspectorship , and , after revising it , with the assistance of Greene , Hamilton , and Laurens , submit it to Washington for approval . Washington approved and transmitted it to Congress . There was no time to lose . Winter was passing , and the moment for opening a new campaign drawing menacingly near . " Will you undertake to execute this plan ? " asked Washington . " With your support and assistance , I will , " replied Steuben . He began by drafting from the line a hundred and twenty men as a guard for the commander-in-chief , and a military school for himself . These men he drilled twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the prejudice ( one of England 's legacies ) which led officers to regard the drilling of a recruit as a sergeant 's and not an officer 's business , lie took the musket into his own hands and showed them how he wished them to handle it . At every drill his division-inspectors were required to be present , and doubtless many officers and soldiers were present , too , without requisition . " In a fortnight my company knew perfectly how to bear arms , had a military air , knew how to march , to form in column , deploy , and execute some little manoeuvres with excellent precision . " Hitherto every attempt to instruct the soldiers had been begun according to rule , by the manual exercise ; and sometimes from one cause , and sometimes from another , every such attempt had failed . In nothing does Steuben 's superiority to a mere martinet appear more decidedly , than in his passing the manual by , 0 * Nearly Washington 's words . See also , for a vivid picture of the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vol V. p. 232 ; and to Governor Clinton , p. 238. // and beginning with manoeuvres . The sight of men advancing , retreating , wheeling , deploying , attacking with the bayonet , changing front , and all with promptness and precision , made an impression upon the spectator which no perfection in the mere handling of the musket could have produced . The actors , too , moved by a common impulse , felt that confidence in themselves which men always feel when acting harmoniously together , and learnt , from the outset , to look with double confidence upon the man who had awakened them to a consciousness of their deficiencies by " skilfully yielding to circumstances " in the development of their capacities . Every scholar of this school became an apostle of reform . The army that looked on and admired longed to be permitted to share in the lesson . Battalions came next , then brigades , and then divisions . It was on the 24th of March that the elementary manoeuvres began , and by the 29th of April American troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were able to execute the grand mannuvres of a regular army . On the 5th of May Steuben was appointed by Congress Inspector-General , with the rank and pay of major-general . Steuben 's success is easily explained . His heart was in his work . He was up before day ; smoked a single pipe ; swallowed a single cup of coffee ; had his hair carefully dressed ; his uniform was carefully put on ; then , as the first sunbeam appeared , he was in the saddle and off for the parade-ground . There was no waiting for loitering aids . No part of his work was beneath him . He took the guns into his own hands , examined the equipments with his own experienced eye . Not a voice was to be heard but his and that of his officers as they repeated his orders . Not a mistake passed unreproved . The conviction that he was thoroughly master of what he was teaching them would hardly have reconciled officers and men to his severity and " sudden gusts of passion , " if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a review near Morristown , Lieutenant Gibbons , a brave and good officer , was arrested on the spot and ordered into the rear , for a fault which it afterwards appeared another had committed . At a proper moment the commander of the regi // ment came forward and informed the Baron of Mr. Gibbons 's innocence , of his worth , and of his acute feelings under this unmerited disgrace . " Desire Lieutenant Gibbons to come to the front , Colonel . " " Sir , " said the Baron to the young gentleman , " the fault which was made , by throwing the line into confusion , might , in the presence of an enemy , have been fatal . I arrested you as its supposed author ; but I have reason to believe that I was mistaken , and that , in this instance , you were blameless ; I ask your pardon : return to your command . I would not deal unjustly by any , much less by one whose character as an officer is so respectable . " * All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the men who saw him standing there , hat in hand , before his subaltern , heedless of the rain that poured down upon his unprotected head , never forgot the scene . Thus far all went on well . Even in their tatters , the men began to feel a pride in being soldiers . If some officers were still compelled to mount guard in an old blanket cut into the shape of a dressing-gown , they knew at least how to perform the duties of officers or guard . Washington , in a general order , praised their progress , and thanked the man to whom they owed it . But a reform in drill was but a small part of the real work to be done . The whole organization of the army required reform . " The internal administration of a regiment and a company was a thing completely unknown . " " The number of men in a regiment was fixed by Congress , as well as in a company , " but some were three months ' men , some six , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant coming and going . Accurate returns of such regiments were out of the question .. " Sometimes a regiment was stronger than a brigade " ; sometimes it contained but thirty men , and a company but a single corporal . The men " were scattered about everywhere . " Officers acted as if the army were but a nursery of servants : each claiming one , many two or three . And thus many hundred soldiers were converted into valets . But on the regimental books they still held their places unchanged ; and long after many of them had ceased to belong to the army even as valets , pay was still drawn in their names // from the impoverished treasury . Leaves of absence , and even dismissals , were given by colonels , and sometimes by captains , at will . While men went and came in this manner , and were thus employed , there could be little hope of preserving the public property intrusted to their hands . Every musket was valued at eighteen dollars with a bayonet , and at sixteen without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight thousand muskets were required to replace those lost by negligence , or carried off by the men whose terms of enlistment had expired . With the most methodical and systematic of men at their head , it had been utterly impossible to introduce method and system into this ebbing and flowing mass . Steuben aimed at the correction of all these abuses ; but unfortunately , in asking for the powers which he deemed essential for the accomplishment of his task , he asked for some which seemed to trench upon the rights of other officers . Some of the major-generals became alarmed . All the brigadiers , it was apprehended , would resign if his demands were complied with . Whatever Washington 's private opinion may have been , he publicly conformed to the public opinion , and issued in June the general orders by which the office continued to be regulated till 1779 . These orders not only defined the duties , but greatly limited the powers , of the Inspector-General . Steuben saw the cause , understood it , foresaw , too , the consequences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted himself to circumstances , and continued to labor with unabated energy in his daily drills and special reforms . Events were already demonstrating the excellence of his work . In May , 1tj78 , Lafayette , upon the point of being cut off from the main body of the army , was able to save his men by an orderly retreat , in which their good discipline was manifest . Washington , however , anxious for Lafayette 's detachment , ordered out the whole army to support them , and in less than fifteen minutes the whole army was under arms and ready to march . At Monmouth , not long after , at the sound of Steuben 's now familiar voice , Lee 's broken ranks rallied and wheeled into line under a heavy fire , as calmly and precisely as if the battle-field had been a parade-ground. // Oct . But the roar of the cannon stirred the old soldier 's blood , and he began to feel keen longings for more exciting work than teaching maneuvres and examining reports . It so chanced , also , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's court-martial , Washington found it necessary to give Steuben the temporary command of a division on the march to the Hudson in July , 1778 . And thus , when directed to resume his *luties as Inspector-General , all the vexation and disgust he had felt at the obstacles which had been thrown in his way were renewed , heightened by the refusal of De Neuville , the inspector of Gates 's army , to 1*eceive orders from him as Inspector-General . Steuben now talked freely of his dissatisfaction , objected to the position which he had hitherto worked in so cheerfully , and more than intimated his intention to resign unless his desire for a command in the line were complied with . ' Washington did not approve of Steuben 's aims , but he appreciated his services at their full value , and continued to treat him with his wonted urbanity , freely acknowledging how much he had done , but carefully abstaining from everything that might have been interpreted into an encouragement of his new pretensions . It was with Congress to decide what the inspectorship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold in the line . Steuben accordingly went in August to Philadelphia , where Congress was once more sitting in the old hall where the Declaration of Independence had been made . But it was there with a task to perform to which legislative bodies are altogether unequal , with a responsibility weighing upon it which none but a strong executive could have borne , vainly trying to govern by treasury boards and boards of war , - to call out the resources of the country by requisitions and recommendations , and to decide questions which demanded immediate decision as they decided upon laws and acts which demanded careful study and deliberate discussion . It was , too , shorn of some of its brightest ornaments , disturbed by internal dissensions which it no longer had the self-control to conceal , and with a spirit poisoned by jealousy of the army on which it depended for its existence . It was to this Congress that Steuben brought his claims , and , // finding no encouragement of his wishes , he abandoned the idea of obtaining a regular command in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress a new plan for the permanent establishment of the inspectorship . The difficulty in regard to Neuville was speedily settled . He was made responsible to the Inspector-General , thus soothing Steuben , whose value was felt , and irritating to resignation the Frenchman , whose value was doubted . A committee was ap .. pointed to consider his new plans concerning the inspectorship , and Congress seemed ready to proceed at once to the discussion of them . But the unfavorable turn which things were taking in Rhode Island afforded an opportunity for postponing the matter indefinitely , and Steuben was requested to go to the assistance of General Sullivan . But by the end of August , Sullivan 's expedition being ended before he could reach him , although he travelled with the utmost despatch , he again found himself with the main army . When the army r*ioved to Fredericksburg , he was once more actively engaged in the dull routine of manoeuvres , drills , and reports . He seems meanwhile to have become convinced that this was the field in which he could do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of his longing for a more dazzling glory , he resolved henceforth to content himself with the glory of being useful . To induce Congress to place his department upon a permanent footing was now his immediate object ; and when the army went into winter quarters4 he again repaired to Philadelphia . It was an irritating business for a hot-tempered , earnest man , convinced of the correctness of his views , - convinced , too , that , important as many other things which Congress was busy about might be , there was none in the wide circle of their competency more important than this . All Washington 's influence , all the force of Hamilton 's representations , were employed in his favor , but still week after week wore away , and February , 1*79 , was near its end before the question was seriously taken up . Then at last a series of resolutions , embodying nearly the substance of his later plans , as revised and approved by Washington , was passed ; and , much as they fell short of his original expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set himself effectively to work . // But he had not idled away the winter in attendance upon Congress . To make his inspectorship successful , it was necessary that every officer should be provided with a uniform system of regulations for the order and discipline of the troops . He had congratulated himself at the o*itset that no existing work had attained to a sufficient degree of popularity to make it a general standard. * He had found every colonel , almost every captain , with a system of his own , and agreeing only in marching their men in Indian file . The ground , therefore , was free , and to fill it aright he composed that volume so long known in the army of the United States as Steuben 's IRegulations , or the " Blue Book . " And here again we see his superiority over mere formalists and drill-masters . With a thorough knowledge of all that had been done , he knew also what it was possible to do . Fully aware that in European armies a man who had been drilled three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit , he was equally aware that in the American army he could not count upon more than two months for transforming a recruit into a soldier . Accordingly , taking less the Prussian system than his own perfect familiarity with the subject for guide , and with a wise consideration for the English prejudices which had struck such deep root in the American mind , he set himself to his task , with Fleury and Walker for assistants , Do l'Enfant for draughtsman , and Duponceau for secretary ; and by the 25th of March the first part of his work was ready for the actior* of Congress , having already received the sanction of Washington and of the Board of War . On the 29th , Congress resolved to accept and print it . Here again Steuben 's patience was put to a severe test . The printing of his book cost him more oaths than the composing * The military bibliography of that period is briefly given by Washington in a letter to a young officer : " Bland ( the newest edition ) stands foremost ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officers , lately published at Philadelphia ; The Partisan , Young and others . " - Sparks , Vol . III . p. 154 . Among General Greene 's books is a " New System of Military Discipline by a General Officer , " published by R. Aitken , printer and bookseller , Philadelphia , 1776 , with an appendix containing nine sections of " rules , maxims , &amp;c. , " some of the most original of which are , " Nothing but principle can conduct a man through life , " " Bad habits are more difficult to correct than to prevent , " " The mind must be prepared before it can receive , " " That attack has least effect which is most obstructed , " &amp;c. , &amp;c. // of it . There were but two copper-plate printers in Philadelphia , and one of them so bad that it was found necessary to throw away above six hundred prints . Only one binder was employed , and , though a good one , the attractions of privateering were so great , that neither he nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work they were called to do . Steuben was anxious to have two copies richly bound , - one for the Commander-in-Chief , and one for the French Minister , - but in the whole city there was not gold-leaf enough to gild them . His temper failed him more than once , but fortunately the men he had chiefly to do with were Pickering and Peters , who admired and loved him too much to take offence at his sallies . Pickering , in one of his letters , enters into a full explanation of the causes of delay , and closes with a delicate appeal to Steuben 's better feelings . " Should I again discover marks of extreme impatience and even asperity in the Inspector-General , 1 will impute them to his anxiety to introduce a perfect order and discipline in the army , and to his zeal in securing the safety and independence of America . " Peters writes with a happy mixture of jest and gravity , promising " to distinguish between the Baron Steuben uninformed and the Baron Steuben acquainted with facts and difficulties , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman ( zo*5nically ) angry and fretted . " At last the work was done ; copies were sent to Governors of States , and distributed through the army ; and for the first time since the war began American officers had a clear and definite guide for the performance of their duties . Steuben made no delay in putting his theories into practice . He reviewed all the regiments , and ordered the introduction of the system of manoeuvres contained in the Regulations . Regiments were formed into battalions , each battalion consisting of a definite number of men . To make sure that the arms and equipments were fit for immediate use , and that the men were not merely men on paper , but actually in the ranks , he continued his rigorous monthly inspections . In these inspections there was no trifling , no hurrying over details . Seven hours were not thought too long for the inspection of a brigade of three small regiments . " Every man not present was to be // accounted for ; if in camp , sick or well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cartridge-boxes opened , even the flints and cartridges counted ; knapsacks unslung , and every article of clothing spread on the soldier 's blanket and tested by his little bpok , whether what he had received from the United States within the year was there ; if not , to be accounted for . Hospitals , stores , laboratories , every place , every thing , was open to inspection , and inspected . " The exact , careful man was sure to be praised , and often rewarded ; the careless to be sternly reproved . The crowning lab or and complement of all was the establishment of a system of minute written reports according to prescribed forms , extending throughout the whole army , and embracing every department of the service . In all this work Steuben was but adapting established principles to the exigencies of a new case . But in the formation of the light infantry he became an inventor , sending back a lesson from the New World to the Old , from Frederic 's pupil to Frederic himself . The wars with the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in loose bodies instead of close masses , each man using his rifle or musket to the best advantage , according to his own judgment . These bodies of skirmishers had turned the day against English and German regulars at Bemis 's Heights and Stillwater . Steuben organized them into a light infantry with a drill and discipline of their own . Frederic , meditating upon the suggestions of the American war , saw how much such troops might be made to assist the operations of his dense masses , and accepted the improvement . The other armies of Europe followed his example , and from that time they have formed an essential part of every great army , and done important service on every great battlefield . It was soon evident that a new spirit had entered the army . Encampments exhibited the regularity of scientific disposition . Reviews displayed in officers and men familiarity with complex evolutions , and that harmony of movement which gives thousands the appearance of a single body under the control of a single will . Inspections demonstrated the possibility of enforcing neatness and exactness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The treasury , which had been repeatedly called upon to pay the services of men who had long ceased to render service of any kind , was relieved from a heavy burden by the introduction of exact rolls and regular reports . The war office , instead of having to *ount upon an annual loss of from five to eight thousand muskets , could enter upon its record that in one year of Steuben 's inspectorship only three muskets were missing , and they were accounted for . The opposition and jealousy which had clogged his first steps gradually gave way before the perfect demonstration of his success . Officers ceased to shrink from labor with the example of industry like his before them , or to consider any part of their duty as beneath them when they saw him come down from so much greater a height to do it . " Do you see there , sir , your colonel instructing that recruit ? " he one day said to North . " I thank God for that , sir. ** And no sooner did the soldier find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more evidently the change which had taken place within him . Hamilton declared that , till he saw the troops forming and man*uvring at Monmouth , he had never felt the full value of discipline . The only use which the few soldiers who were provided with bayonets had hitherto made of them had been as forks to roast their meat with , but within less than four months from the organization of the inspectorship by Congress , - on the night of the 15th of July , 1779 , - these same soldiers took Stony Point at the point of the bayonet . Henceforth Steuben 's life becomes so mixed up with the general history of the army , or so filled with minute details , that it is impossible to follow it step by step , within limits like ours . It was not all at once that he could carry out his farreaching views . The army was once more to be remodelled , and he passed weeks at Philadelphia in close communication with Congress and the Board of War , keeping up all the time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last , he was ever ready to conform his own . But Congress again wearied and vexed him by delays , for which the embarrassed condition of the public finances was but a partial justification , and which caused , at times , " the loss of months where // it was dangerous to lose days . " Private jealousies and personal claims still continued to interfere with the introduction of essential changes . They who have studied the history of this period in the letters of the actors know that not all our statesmen were wise , not all our officers high-minded , not all our citizens more devoted to their country than to their pockets . There were times when the whole country seemed heartily sick of the war ; and when , perhaps , a Wood or a Seymour , a New York World or an Evening Express , might have stirred up thousands to open resistance , or lured them on to treason to their children and their God . For a time , too , the condition of our finances seemed hopeless . The currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise to pay " of the United States or of the individual States was not worth the " promise to pay " of a private citizen ; and it was not until the treasury board had been replaced by a skilful financier , that the real wealth of the country could be brought to the support of its real interests . In his personal as well as in his public capacity Steuben suffered from these things . But lie suffered without losing heart , if he sometimes lost patience ; and before the war was brought to a close , he had the satisfaction of seeing himself recognized as the true organizer of the American army . Meanwhile he rendered other important services . He accompanied Reed in his survey of the fortifications of Philadelphia . He rendered valuable service on Washington 's staff , the best staff , in many respects , which the world had ever seen . He wrote elaborate opinions and plans of operations , which contributed much to Washington 's assistance in forming his own opinions and plans . He taught the etiquette of receptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , trifling as such cares may appear when compared with the grave duties of a general in the midst of such a war , they cease to be trifling when we consider how important it was that the Minister 's despatches should represent us as not wholly devoid of a knowledge which the Old World prized so highly . He did service , too , of a more difficult nature , when he was sent , without any ostensible command , to supply at West Point the deficiencies of General Howe ; and when , under the presidency of Greene , and with some of the best officers in the army for his // colleagues , he sat in judgment upon Andr6 . And in all these various duties lie demeaned himself so wisely , so tempered and controlled his ardent nature , and manifested throughout such elevation of sentiment and such pure devotion to his adopted country , as to prove that Pickering had fnterpreted his character well when , in the midst of his perplexities , lie wrote him , " Courage , dear Baron ; those talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing jealousy , are always sure to triumph ultimately over all obstacles . " But next to what he accomplished as inspector , his most importaiit services were those lie rendered in Virginia in the winter of 1780 and 1781 , and during the memorable and decisive siege of Yorktown . When Greene was appointed to the command of such fragments of the Southern army as had survived the fatal day of Camden , Steuben went with him , because there was " an army to be created . " With Greeiie his relations had been of the friendliest and most intimate kind , from the day when they sat down with Hamilton and Laurens , in Steuben 's straitened quarters at Valley Forge , to discuss the first draft of the inspectorshiip . And now they set out from Philadelphia together for the field on which they both felt that the fate of the war was to be decided . Riding the whole of the first day in company , how pleasantly they journeyed on , and how confidentially they talked , Duponceau , in his old age , dearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Chester , where Greene , to his astonishment , turned the conversation upon the Latin poets , and talked about them like a man who had studied them well . Greene 's chief rehiahce for men and supplies was Virginia ; and as it was by the organization of the means of reinforcement and support that the serious work was to begin , he di-9 rected Steuben to take command there , and do whatever his judgment suggested for the accomplishment of it . Jefferson was then Governor of the State , and goveriiing in a way which has afforded his adversaries an ample field of crimination , and cost his eulogistic biographers much labor to defend . The disorder of the finances was great , but , being an evil common to the whole country , can not be accepted as an excuse for the utter prostration of the government . The departments were // without a head . The Executive acted only by expedients . Resources were wantonly wasted by neglect and peculation . The public arms were scattered , the soldiers and recruits naked . The militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wantonness that would have excited wonder in hirelings . A body of volunteers had been raised at great expense for six months ' service . Before they were all collected the time was so nearly run out , that it was thought better to dismiss them at once , than to send them to the support of the Southern army . Other corps were raised with the same shortsightedness , and dismissed to save the expense of feeding them . Steuben saw that the fate of Virginia was bound up with that of the Carolinas , and that the surest way to defend her was to strengthen Greene 's army . The militia that refused to follow the Southern commander beyond Ramsay 's Mills , because , unless they set out for home immediately , the time they were called out for would expire before they could reach it , might have enabled him to follow up the blow which had almost shattered Oornwallis at Guilford , and avert the invasion which cost Virginia some blood and much treasure . In spite of obstacles , Steuben persisted in his labors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion was so far checked that the traitor was able to accomplish but a part of the evil he had meditated . It was to him , too , that part of Lafayette 's success was owing ; the old general having prepared the way which the young general followed so happily . But still , of all his hard experience of life , this was the hardest ; and it was with an indescribable feeling of relief that he found himself in the lines before Yorktown . His first siege had been the siege of Prague , as a vohinteer , when a boy of fourteen ; his last the siege of Schweidnitz , as Frederic 's aid , at the close of the Seven Years ' War . And now , in the trenches at Yorktown , he saw another great war drawing rapidly to its end , and bringing with it the end of his own long and honorable military career . He was the only American officer who had ever been present at a siege ; and here , as on so many occasions , his experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , that he had ever had the command of a division , and fortune so far smiled upon him as to bring on // the first overtures for surrender during his turn of duty in the trenches ; thus giving him the privilege , so highly prized by soldiers , of being in actual command when the enemy 's flag came down . When the victorious army returned northward , he returned with it to resume his place as Inspector-General : a minute , laborious , and for most men a wearisome round of monotonous duties , but which , under the influence of the spirit which he brought to them , were now universally recognized as the basis of good military organization . Never was the discipline of the troops more perfect than during the last two years of the war ; and it is surely not claiming too much for Steuben to say that the sense of duty and subordination which that discipline cultivated was not the least among the causes which enabled an impotent Congress peacefully to disband an injured and irritated army . His last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make arrangements for taking possession of the military posts which were to be ceded to us at the signing of the peace , - a service for which his familiarity with the laws and usages of war peculiarly fitted him . Another serv*e which he rendered was in the formation of plans of a military academy , and we commend to the attention of those whose duty it is to watch over our great institution at West Point a careful meditation of that part of his project in which lie provides for full professorships of history and geography , of civil and international law , and of eloquence and belles lettres . It was probably from him , too , that the first suggestioti of the " Cincinnati " came , and , had his counsels been followed , the disbanding of the army , instead of being done stealthily , like something that Congress was afraid to do , would have been done in the broad daylight , with the solemnity with which a great people performs a great duty . And now , the war being at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy his glory , and talk over his American life with his old friends . But in coming to America he had made over his benefice of Havelsberg to a nephew , and exhausted all his other resources , - freely exchanging the independence which he had won by long service for the chances // of success in the new cause to which he devoted himself . Unfortunately , however , instead of following Vergennes 's advice and Lee 's example , and making a definite contract with Congress , he had contented himself with their unrecorded acquiescence in his offer to make his compensation depend upon the success of the war . And thus , when the war had succeeded , and he asked for a settlement of his claims , Congress asked for the proof of his contract ; and although unquestionable proof of the nature of his original agreement with the Congress committee was given by the members of that committee ; although the importance of his services was established by the testimony of the whole army ; although Hamilton supported his claims in Congress and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost extent which the limits he had prescribed to himself in his relations with Congress permitted , it was not till after an eight years ' struggle with poverty that Steuben obtained a final settlement . Then , indeed , his claims were partly , if not fully , acknowledged , and an annuity of twentyfive hundred dollars settled upon him . How he suffered , meanwhile , he , the large-hearted , free-banded , high-spirited man , from personal privations and public insult ; how he suffered , not merely from the actual want of the day , but from the ever-present menace of the morrow , and - keenest pang of all for a heart like his - from the inability to relieve the sufferings of others ,  --  is a story which , fortunately , our limits do not permit us to repeat . We commend it to the serious attention of our readers in the clear , minute , and incontrovertible narrative of Mr. Kapp . During this interval , most of his time was passed in New York , where his extensive information , refiuied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Disqualified by his age from entering upon a new profession , he could not settle contentedly down in idleness . His papers bear witness to the interest which he took in the political occurrences and questions of the day , as well as to the extent of his reading and his habit of patient thought . Like most of those who had been brought into close relations with the Congress of the Confederation , he was the advocate of a strong and effective central government , and had he lived , would have witnessed the overthrow // of the Federalists with as keen regret as Hamilton himself . Among his studies of this period is a plan for a peace establishment of the army , which Washington approved ; and a few years later lie prepared a plan of fortifications for New York , which became the basis of the plan adopted upon the approach of our second war with England . At one moment , despairing of obtainiiig a settlement with Congress , he turned his thoughts westward , and drew up a plan for the establishment , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Spanish territories on the Mississippi . But Spain wanted no such colonists , and his memorial remained unanswered . In 1787 he was chosen one of the Regents of the University of New York , - a tribute of respect which must have been singularly gratifying to his feelings . A more important expression was given by New York , Virginia , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey to their sense of his services , by large grants of land ; and could he but have got money enough to make these grants available , lie would have been an independent man . At length his claims upon the nation were acknowledged . Henceforth he had a fixed income , knew what he could afford to undertake , and how he could afford to live . To take up and settle his lands would afford a pleasant occupation for his decliiiing years . Wherever an old soldier was to be found , he was sure to find a friend , and as disappointment had neither hardened nor embittered his heart , it was to friendship that lie looked for happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , eveii if his pecuniary embarrassments had permitted it . America was now his home . And thus , with such hopes as childless old age may indulge in , and such aspirations as had survived thirteen years of active participation in great eveiits , and ten years ' experience of courts , he entered upon the last phase of his career . The sixteen thousand acres of land which New York had given him lay in Oneida County , about twelve miles north of old Fort Schuyler , the Utica of our day , and formed part of the township which still bears his name . It was a rough , stony tract , fitter for grazing than planting , with a high ridge running across it , from which , as his eye became fam7niliar with the landscape , he could distinguish the highlands of seven different // counties , and , gleaming over the tree-tops on the farthest verge of the horizon , the bright waters of Oneida Lake . This was his home during the active mouths of the year , and when the cold months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would turn his face southward and resume his station at 216 Broadway , opposite St. Paul 's Church . As a landholder , he could indulge his generous impulses , and more than one who had no other claim upon him than what the name of old soldier gave him received a grant of sixty or a hundred acres , either as a free gift or on terms that differed little from it . As a farmer , he could indulge his old habits of methodic organization and a methodic division of his time . Sixty acres were set apart and cleared for the manor-house , which was to be a building suited to his rank and habits of life . Meanwhile he contented himself with a log-house , enlarged after a short time by the addition of a frame-house of two rooms . Here Mulligan , then a young man fresh from Columbia College , and who served him as secretary , was his constant inmate , North , or Walker , or some other old companion , often coming to stay a week or more with him , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom was a Dutch emigrant named Mappa , a gentleman of distinguished ability and high culture , frequently visited him to talk over the questions of the day and the news from Europe . This news he got from the Leyden Gazette , the Gahignani 's Messenger of those days , and inexplicably strange it seemed to him , at times , especially when he read therein that the Prussian eagles had turned back in ignominious retreat before the tricolored flag of the new republic . He studied farming as he had studied the art of war , by method and rule , entering everything in his diary , and recording his progress step by step . The minute accuracy of the Inspector-General pervaded the daily habits of the farmer in his clearing . And never , perhaps , even as he rode his war-horse down the line , looking , as one who saw him describes him , " like the god of war himself , " did he feel a truer pleasure than when he guided Molly , his quiet little mare , through the stumps and half-worn paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book filled up the time pleasantly , Voltaire being one of his chief favorities , and Gibbon , whose great History had // soon found its way across the Atlantic , coming in for a share of his attention . Of German literature , although it had already entered upon the brightest period of its marvellous development , and might have held out , at least in the " Revolt of the Netherlands " and the " Thirty Years ' War , " great attractions for one who had himself been an actor in a great revolt and a great war , his biographer makes no mention ; leaving us thereby to conclude that , like Frederic , he had failed to comprehend this part of the great changes that were going on around him . And thus the last four years of his life glided smoothly away , with little in them to recall Frederic 's camp , or the drawingrooms at Hechingen , but with something of a grateful variety , and much to awaken a placid interest . Loving much and much beloved , he had reached unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His last appearance in public was as President of the German Society in New York , when , with drums beating and banners displayed , he marched at its head from the Lutheran schoolhouse in Nassau Street , down Broadway , and through Whitehall , to see its members do their voluntary day 's work upon the fortifications of Governor 's Island . His last service to the country was in the summer of 1794 , as president of the board of commissioners for fortifying the northern and western frontiers of the State , - a work which filled up the whole summer , and was very near ending in his capture by the Indians . The winter of 1794 began early . In November the ground was already covered with snow . The log-hut began to look sad and lonely in the cold white landscape . Little Molly could no longer make her way through the clearing . North 's visit was over . Mulligan was alone with him , with the two servants . The regular time for going to New York was not quite come , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations for the journey . The 25th of November came . There was no change in his firm tread , or the clear ring of his voice , or the kindly light of his hazel eye . He played his game of chess , - he listened while Mulligan read , - and at eleven , his usual bedtime , they parted for the night . He had been for some years a communicant of the Lutheran Church , and before he laid his head upon his pillow we may well believe that he // had bowed it in prayer . Then came a few hours of sleep , and in sleep the death-stroke , sudden , but not instantaneous , and made bitter by great agony . His servant ran to call Mulligan . " Do not be alarmed , my son , " Steuben said , as he saw his young friend rush into the room in terror . The motion of the left side was gone . He asked to be taken up , but returned quickly to bed again . The agony continued . By six he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day that a physician could be procured . He was still breathing , and for a while sensible . Remedies were applied , and with a momentary gleam of hope . Then he became unconscious , though breathing still . The night wore away , with occasional returns of convulsions , but none of consciousness . The stout frame which had borne up so vigorously against cold and hunger , against sleepless nights and days of toil , struggled painfully with death . The faint breathing alone told that he was yet alive . Towards noon , it grew fainter and fainter , and at half past twelve of the second day he ceased to breathe . North had been sent for also ; but the roads were so bad that all was over before he came . Mulligan had made most of the preparations for the funeral ; and as the two mourners talked them over , they remembered that their friend had once pointed out a hemlock-tree on the north of the house as a good burial-place . There , then , they had a grave dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to keep it clear ; and thither , on the next day about noon , the neighbors , some thirty in all , joining with them , they bore him in silence and laid him down to his rest . Alas that for this wearied and war-worn frame it should not have been the last rest ! But early in the present century the town , which had outgrown the memory of its highest honor , wanted a road , and the engineer who laid it out ran it over Steuben 's grave . The coffin was laid bare , remaining exposed for some days to idle gazers and the chances of the weather . It is even said , and we fear with too much truth , that some one , a little more daring in sacrilege , broke it open and tore off a piece of his military cloak . At last the shameful story reached the ears of Colonel Walker , who , hastening to the spot , had the coffin taken up and removed to a neighboring hillside , where , // under the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and within sound of a little brook whose waters chime sweetly with the music of the winds and the birds , a simple slab still bears the name of Steuben . In the military history of our Revolution , if we class men according to their services , no one after Washington and Greene stands so high as Steuben . For the services which Lafayette rendered , important as they were , were rather the effects of influence and position than of individual superiority . All that Steuben owed to position was the opportunity of action : the action itself was the fruit of his own strong will and thorough knowledge of his science . He was the creator of our regular army , the organizer of our military economy . The impress which he made upon our military character remained there long after his land was withdrawn . The system of drills and manoeuvres which in 1779 lie drew up in German to pass through bad French into English , continued to be the system by which all our regulars and militia were formed , until new modifications had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Revolution . Upon this point the testimony of Washington , Greene , Knox , Hamilton , Pickering , Peters , is uniform and decisive . He claimed nothing to which his claim is not fully borne out by what they wrote and said . His system of reviews , reports , and inspection gave efficiency to the soldier , confidence to the commander , and saved the treasury not less than six huiidred thousand dollars . The private life of a man , so large a portion of whose life was passed in the performance of public duties , affords little room for the growth of distinctive characteristics . There was a slight haughtiness in his manner , which would appear to have been the reflection of his military habit of command , rather than the product of arrogance or unbecoming pride . His pride never seems to have degenerated into vanity , that unbecoming mantle in which so many great men have more than half enveloped their greatness , but was a soldierly pride throughout , founded upon the consciousiiess of what he had done and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advantage , - particularly in that test of true refinement , the society of ladies ; and if his bow savored somewhat of formality , his vein of compli // ment and humor was always happy . " Ah , madam , " said he , bowing-low on being presented to a beautiful Miss Sheaf , and studiously mispronouncing the name , " I have always been cautioned to avoid mischief , but I never knew till to-day how dangerous she was . " Of his generosity innumerable anecdotes have been preserved . Like Goldsmith , he could not withhold even the last penny in his purse when want or suffering asked for it . How often lie shared it with the destitute , how bitterly lie felt the ungenerous conduct of Congress , which made it impossible for him to give as freely as his heart dictated , how munificently he employed his opportunities as a landholder to provide some old soldier with a home , are things which his contemporaries well knew , and which posterity should not forget . @        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
