VOL . V.-MAY , i868. - No. * . THE BLACK BESS . A MAN who loves from his boyhood her who becomes his fate , hardly knows the nobility of his love , as does he who , from a lonely condition of which he thought well enough before , suddenly finds himself plunged into a new element and living the life of those already blest . With the first one , his love has grown as he has grown , and his weaknesses with him . It may be that love seldom conquers those weaknesses ; but with the other love comes a heavenly tyrant and usurps the place of everything less noble ; his heart is clean swept and garnished  --  a shrine for the object of his worship ; he has undergone a purification , a sanctification that is scarcely less than that of a sacrament . It was so with me , I know , at least , when I first thought of wooing Margaret for my wife , and possession of her promise never made it otherwise . To say that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence ; and just as impossible would it be for me to set down any categorical description of her loveliness ; of the large , fair , pale face ; the eyes , so gray and dark that they grew on you as you gazed , like the shades of evening from which the stars look out ; of the features , which would have been sculptured had they been less instinct with pulsing and dilating life ; of the tresses of finest , darkest hair , sweeping down the temples in countless curves ; of the unspeakable sweetness of the smile-that smile which seemed to fill your heart and soul with sunshine and warmth . Never was there such another woman made as Margaret . Her mind , too , was no less peerless than her person . It had a trait like light itself , and gave color and vitality to every object that it rested on . Of humble birth , and with no means of education beyond those afforded by the village school and the church library , she had nevertheless cultivated herself to a point beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and breathing the atmosphere of art . It has always made me wonder , my relation with her , what she could have seen in me so to bestow herself as she did . I , myself , though still so young , was not entirely a boor ; indeed , being a poor man , I was thought eccentric , perhaps because I was not a fool ; but , though now sitting at my ease , a tolerably well-read man of wealth , having climbed easily by others ' help , speculated largely and daringly , studied where I could and as I went , yet then I was only the master of an engine on the Great Interior Railway , running a night train across the State , and earning my living by the sweat of fny brow , in soot and grime and smoke , and all in the midst of a wild relish of danger . // It is a singular fact that the human mind can become liabituatcd to any experience . Though I shall never forget the night when F first drove my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route , dreading the darkness and the responsibility , tremulous , indeed , with a thousand tremors , yet now , were it twice as many years since I laid ha*id on lever or signalled for a station , I could take her out to-night , over marsh and meadow and drawbridge , up the long mountain grade , across the terrible trestle-work , round that curving precipice , one side sheer rock up into the stars , the other nothing but black darkness and an empty gulf of dizzy depth , through the thick , reverberating tunnels , down the long incline , and whistle for the brakes at Babylon , with as much nonchalance as when I took the reins from my groom this morning and gave my brown beauties their head for a breezy bit of business down the Park . She was a rusher , that engine of mine , the Black Bess-they had not begun calling them then for the successful candidates  --  and would do her mile a minute if you asked it ; though I 've known the time , of a rainy five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wheels made their revolutions and she stood still ; and , to get her along the slippery side of an up-grade , both fireman and myself jumping off , had to walk by her panting side and sprinkle the wet rails with sand to toll her on . But , although I 've owned since then as choice specimens as ever stepped the turf , I never cared for any thoroughbred of them all as I did for the Black Bess , and I stabled her as carefully , and , in early days , handled her as daintily , as though she were the expected winner of a handicap . Perhaps I loved my iron steed all the better for the dangers through which she had passed , since there are few whose affections are not drawn to their companion in peril ; and the Black Bess and I had had it out one night , just as , clearing the Waterwey suburbs , we put on all speed for the long run across the marshes . The train was frill , the steam was up , the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a feather , the Black Bess went as if she trod the air . Suddenly , with a sharp turn of the course from the shelter of a young thicket , we came out on a low cross-country road  --  a kind of causeway raised upon the meadows , and cutting diagonally across the railway track . So unfrequented was this road that I could not remember ever having noticed a vehicle on all its long and winding sweep ; but at this moment an enormous load of hay , tilting heavily down on one side , rested directly across the track and blocked the way , not only for an instant 's time , but was fixed there . I can see it here , if I close my eyes , with such a weird distinctness in every line as might be if a grave-light had stamped it on the plate of some supernatural camera  --  the four great steaming oxen , in the glow of the head-light , rising like a projection from the darkness , with wild eyes and interlocked horns , and trampling and tugging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the drunken teamster , half hidden in its piliowy masses , asleep , and with his jug beside him . In vain my touch upon the bell-rope or the rod ; in vain the short , sharp shrieks of Black Bess ; while I reached my hand to reverse the engine we should scatter all to finders . One second the face , the face of that sleeping man , branded in on my brain as if by a searing-iron ; the next , a wild thought of Margaret , a great blow , and dumb darkness . The man and his load were dust together , the Black Bess was off the track and above her wheels in meadow mud , and I lay stunned and senseless . When a person recovers from a concussion of the brain , it would sometimes be better if he had d ' *ed . I learned this to my cost one day ; but I did not think so on first getting about after my long illness , through which I had ever been // conscious of the tender face of Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which had been a singular confusion of her face with that of the man asleep in the mountain of meadow hay . The world was in the full , deep flush of Summer ; life seemed so good , love was so sure ; Margaret was constantly beside me , the Black Bess was ready for me , and Christmas Day , when it should come wrapped in its soft snows , was to give me my wife forever . I got up quickly , too quickly-too quickly by half ; a long convalescence would have acted like a buffer to the shock I had received , and deadened its effect on all my system ; but every month 's salary was precious to me now ; it was so much more added to that already laid up for the enriching of the humble little home whose prospect then was heaven ; and before October had reddened her parallels , I drove the Black Bess again by night out of Waterwey . Meantime my head was far from right . I knew that by the dull ache that sate upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes stabbed my eyeballs , as if needles were in the entering rays of light . Often , too , when people were speaking with me , their words sounded dully a long way oft ; and if I roused myself to some manner of enforced attention , I paid for it by a fresh assault of blinding pain . When in this condition , I went through many of my duties by mere mechanical routine , and I think my faithful fireman , George Rowe , did more at such times toward running the train on time than did its engineerunless the Black Bess were herself gifted with that sort of wizardry and more than human power which I sometimes fancied belonged to her . All this annoyance of mine , however , was but intermittent ; had it been otherwise , had it been constant , I should not live to remember it ; and gradually I began to believe that it was wearing off never dreaming that it was but assuming a new form . My spirits had been greatly depressed during the period when I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became as much too buoyant when I found that my natural strength and vigor were conquering the recurrence of the attacks . I had fully realized how wrong and how impossible my intended marriage with Margaret would be under such circumstances , and only when I found myself able to look the rising sun in the face , and to drive from twilight to twilight , from the gray of evening to the gray of dawn , without an extra throb in my temples , did I dare to dream fresh dreams of my long-desired home and its delights . The only trace of trouble that appeared to be remaining with me , at last , was a slightly-impaired eyesight , so that what once I could distinctly see in detail when at the distance of a friile , now became but a blur , and rendered me , on more or less seldom occasion , subject to some optical delusion . However , this did not interfere with my business , and , as I said , I went and came in such an atmosphere of expectation and assurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one transfigured and walking in a nimbus . Things were in this state with me , when , one night , as usual , I took the Express out of Waterwey . It was a somewhat heavier train than my ordinary one , and in the safe of the special car that went through with us was a large amount of coin and valuables . Remembering some daring robberies , in which trains had been thrown from the track by means of obstacles placed there by the villains who subsequently rifled them , I resolved on an even more particular look-out than common ; I told the Black Bess , as I mounted , that she must spring to it , for there was work to do , and she answered to my hand like a live creature . I heard them sounding the irons down our long length-then the word was given , and our quivering carrier , starting well in hand , soon warmed to her work , and bounded along as if she meant to be the victor of some demoniacal race . // I have often thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that man 's sense of mastery whose hand it is which gives the first motion to some long train crowded with hustling life and tumult . All those beings , their joys , their fears , their expectations , their very futures and existences , are his , hang on the falling of his eyelid , on the turning of his finger . There is not such a potentate as he the earth over . But , when I drove an engine myself , I thought of no such thing ; were my wheels oiled , my boiler fed , my valves right , were we well wooded , was I on time , should I earn my pittance a day-my fancies seldom took a higher flight . But this is aside . It was at the close of a dark and stormy day , soon deepening into a black Autumn evening , of which I was about to speak . No stars in heaven , no lights on earth . The air was that fresh , wet coolness so delightful to breathe even when you got it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools of water , everywhere on our way , waked up to flash like moons in our light as we left them ; little new-made brooks were chasing each other beside us ; woody places kept up a perpetual dripping and dropping ; and the whole earth was soaked in running rivers of rain . The long perspective of the track , with its rails glittering in moisture , rose by all its length into heaven , and seemed to hang up shiningly before us like a ladder of light , the only fixed thing in all the changing , shimmering , calendered darkness . As we appeared to wind our path up this splendid highway , suddenly what had been but a blot of blackness upon it a long way ahead , resolved itself to my vision into a less indistinct body , and I fancied some laborer , returning from his day 's work , had fallen asleep beside the track , had , perhaps , in his slumber , rolled over upon it . Such stupid recklessness was not uncommon . I sounded the whistle to warn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put down the brakes . We had a full head of steam on , and were rushing forward with hardly-abated progress , and , straining my gaze , I discovered that the thing I had taken for a man now , by the size of the dark spot it filled , must be a woman , with her drapery blown loosely abroad by the breeze . I snatched my field-glass , and , steadying it for a moment , a face flashed in the disc  --  a single moment  --  and then , my horror-stricken eves blinded , my tongue cleaving to the very roof of my mouth , with a mighty shock , I reversed the engine , and , the wheels revolving the other way , we slipped slowly up by our impetus , and paused within a yard of the actual place . I leaped off to search the spot . George Rowe , likewise , leaped after me . There was nothing whatever on the track , save the shadow of a clump of bushes breaking the long glitter of its steel . I look*d about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no real object lay there . I heard the car windows rattling up , and turned about to see the passengers ' heads thrusting out , and all the brakemen , as well , bending forward and peering into the darkness for the cause of our stand-still , and the shock that had thrown these from their seats , and those from their feet . Directly afterward , at sound of the conductor 's voice , I seized an old log lying beside the ends of the sleepers , and lifted , pushed , and shoved one extremity of it as if I had just thrown it out of our path . George Rowe stared at me , but said nothing . The conductor seized on the intimated occurrence with avidity , wondered and gaped about him for an explanation of such a disaster being prepared for us , bade me run slowly , and returned with something to gossip over in every carriage of them all . But , as for me , far from heeding him the least , I increased the pressure to some such point as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breathing of my lungs , and the Black Bess ran as if the fires of hell were blazing beneath her boilers. .11 was the face of Margaret that I had seen ! // I lost no time , on that next day , in seeking Margaret . She was away from home , visiting at Brookford , a little town which was a watering station of all the trains along my own route . A shudder , foolish to the pitch of idiocy , seized me at the intelligence . If that were not verily Margaret 's face , how nearly it might have been - for Brookford was but a mile behind the place wh&amp;e last night I had brought our train to a pause . I telegraphed to her , and she came down , with a companion , to meet me in the evening as I returned . I saw her sweet face shining under the lamps as we drew up  --  but so fearfully like my vision of the night before that I hardly dared to think it real . In answer to my hurried inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous night , returning with her friend from a house where they had called , had stumbled and fallen across the railway , but had picked herself up , and was safe and dry beneath the roof-tree long and long before either down-train or up-train passed that way . She jested me on my clairvoyance , then laughed that she filled up my eye so completely . I saw her standing there while we backed down to switch off again on the main track , gazing and smiling after me , standing so securely with her light , rustling figure , airy and supple as some glad young white-birch in the breezethen we thundered by with our terrible tread , and I lost her ! If there had been a score of faces on the track as we drove along I should have seen none of them that night , for brooding over and caressing in my happy thought the pure and perfect face that I really saw beneath the flaring station lamps . I had almost forgotten this incident of my nightfaring-I mean , of course , the vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing occurred . It was a soft , starry night of the Indian Summer , this time . There was a ceaseless glimmer of harmless sheet-lightnings through the sky , the horizon lifting every few moments with the innocent reflection of some deadly storm in the meridian beneath it . We were making about our ordinary running , when , like a quick illumination , directly in our path , the same obscurity , the same resolving-there lay the Face ! 1 knew as well now that it must be an illusion as that I was a breathing being . I did not essay any motion by which it should be suffered to impede our progress , but I stared at it with a fascinated gaze . The beautiful face ! - its great gray eyes gleaming so softly up as the belching monster pounded down to dazzle them blind with its fierce and blazing head-light , to crush them from their sockets with its remorseless wheels . I could no more help my hands lifting then than my heart 's beating . In another instant the train was shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , searching the place-on again , aware of my folly ; and we spun straightway along the track as if let loose from a meteor . I heard George Rowe muttering at me in amazement , but I made him no reply . At Brookford the conductor harangued me stormily , and bade George Rowe have a charge over me . He thought that I was a drunken man , and well he might , for I felt my face so flushed , and my eyes so pained , that the latter may have glowed like flames in a bed of coals , while my brain burned and boiled , and bubbled , till it seemed like bursting . I was , indeed , well nigh beside myself . I wrote to Margaret of this second occurrence , and asked her what it meant . Was I really becoming out of my head ? Was I even out of my head already ? She replied in much the same strain as before , jesting and cheerful ; but it was like a transparent mask , and I could clearly detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her playful petition not to turn her into a grave-light // and Will-o ' - the- Wisp , nor to connect her personality with such diabolical things as the flames of the St. Elmo 's fire that every sailor sees on his topmast , and which I had , doubtless , a thousand times beheld running before me on my rails . I determined then that unless my mind were really affected I would take no more notice of any renewal of this apparition than I would of the copper cents and brass pins which adventurous schoolboys were in the habit of placing upon the track for the wheels to flatten out into nothingness . My resolutions , I need not say , were as worthless as the flattened pins , and quickly became paving stones of that region where asphalt was primevally found in use . For the Face haunted me-haunted me so that I wonder at myself now , and believe that only the grace and goodness of Heaven kept me from the endless perdition of hating the original . It never came twice in immediate succession , but at intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accumulated power to expend , and , under circumstances of ingenious devilishness , it made its appearance . In many instances I was fortunate enough to have some ready excuse on hand for our delay , but sometimes the prodigy vanished before I slackened speed , and then no excuse was needed ; but when that was not the case , as most frequently it happened , and I was abandoned to my own devices , and the bewilderment and consternation of the train , it began to be believed among the employees that I had become a hard fellow . Shortly following upon that I was summoned by the superintendent , and reprimanded for my intemperance-I , who had never drunk a drop in my life-doggedly promised him better tlishions , for had I explained things , what director of them all , I asked myself , would have suffered a crazy man to take out the Night Express from Waterwey ? Meanwhile , owing solely to these affairs , my marriage had been indefinitely postponed ; for , of course , while liable to these hallucinations and visitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new bonds and duties . Margaret remained as she had ever been-an angel of mercy ; she soothed me , solaced me , and we took counsel together how best to overcome my difficulties ; but , finally , when all our expedients seemed futile , she imperatively bade me resign my situation , for she felt that we were murderers , a thousand times multiplied , in continuing to hold so many lives in risk with the possibilities to which I might be driven by my mad fantasies . This command and entreaty of hers was after a time when I had seen the flice more vividly than before , more beautiful , more human , more piteo*is . We were coming along an inclined plane , with the brakes down ; at the foot of it the track ran curving over the mighty trestle-work of the Windriver Valley . It was impossible to stop the train , for it descended already without steam ; and ahead of us lay the long , slow curve of the trestle-work , as  --  a sheer abutment of two hundred feet , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields that slept , all purple and peaceful , in the silver flood of moonlight at that fearful depth beneath us . There was but a single alternative ; I could throw the Black Bess and her train from the track as we touched the curve , and we should be dust before the valley could feel us or the river cover us ; or , with the face before me , I must crash over and through that one dear thing of all my heart . I knew , in an intimate and under consciousness , that I was deceived ; but , do what I would , it came to me as if I were experiencing it myself all the annihilating terror that must overwhelm the sufferer as that black monster and its re&amp; hot eye advanced with the thundering tread , and shook her frame bodily and her soul with vast fear . I heard , in my fancy , her shrill shrieks , as she struggled // vainly to rise , and escape , and flee , and knew that it was vainly . I felt-almost with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinding of the bone , and then-I should have done it-I had reached out my hand to do itwhen , suddenly , the fair , pale face rose from the way like a dew-cloud , the floating garments of the late prostrate form were gathered together , all had disappeared-and we slid gently upon the trestle-work , and wound our way over its spider line , till kindly woods beyond took us into safety and shelter . I stood , then , powerless , and could not have lifted my hand to my face to wipe off the beads of cold sweat there . It seems , perhaps , in the rehearsal , a little thing to have endured ; but I can tell you that it was the tortures of the damnecP The men and women who had given their lives into my hand that night , never knew how , for one moment , that hand , loosening its grasp , hesitated , and held them over the precipice and gulf of death , while they gazed out and down , and admired the beauty of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was then Margaret said I must leave the railroad ; I had no right longer to play at fast and loose with the destinies of others ; each time I stepped upon my platform was a sin . The wear and tear of travel , and night travel at that , she said , had broken up my nervous system , which , added to my previous shock already sustained , might produce irreparable misfortunes , if I did not leave everything , and come down and rest with her at her mother 's . This last was pleasant enough-rest in that happy house , the low-roofed old farmhouse , standing on its verdant knoll , that always shone like some broad carpet of greenest velvet embroidered wits all the golden sunshine of Summer , the house where everything was ordered to the music of peace and quietness  --  but then , by-and-bye , there was the time for that . Was it a devil driving me on to stay ? or was it my natural manliness refusing to yield to a devil and begging for one more trial ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my train out of Waterwey . I was so thoroughly myself on every other topic , that I could not believe in a monomania upon this one . I invented an apology to myself for every time that I yielded to my pursuer-the reflection of the moon in some ditch of still water , the lantern of a crossing in the woods , the round , white signboard of a switch , the signal-balls upon a drawbridge-I affirmed that in similarly deceptive lights and shadows they would have affected every man in the same way as that in which I was affected . But , at last , the tormentor grew insupportable ; it followed me from station to station , as some great , winged , stinging thing pursues a racer , its play on my emotions being all the more forcible that I could never entertain any sentiment of anger toward it-for there it always lay , lovely , appealing , and piteous , only the face of Margaret . It grew plain to me , and , reluctantly , I was forced to acknowledge either that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring in my mechanism had become loosened . I determined then , at last , that I would consult a physician , to see if there were any balms in Gilead for my healing . I shudder now at remembrance of my selfish criminality-for I reasoned that I could do this the more readily , as I knew that , by the laws of his profession , he would be obliged to keep my application secret , and could make no report to my employers . I needed not have feared , as it ended . Old Dr. Blanchard had no time for mischief and had , moreover , such a professional curiosity and searching into things , that , if my symptoms had been at all anomalous , he would have suffered me to launch a loaded train of my fellow creatures into eternity , in order that he might study their development . However , he assured me that it was a very simple and frequent // form of disease with which I was afflicted ; one taking its variation according to the idiosyncracies of the patient ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine to reach it but my own will . This was cheerful , after my experience . If my spiritual identity , he said , was weaker than that of my body , it must succumb into hopeless insanity ; but , could I rouse its flagging courage and whip it into action , all was safe and sure . The one , the only thing , for me to do was , when the next time I saw the Face before me , to run over it , boldly and without a **26;828;TOOLONG , if I could , but to run over it  --  and I should be well . It was an easy thing to order-but , then , the face was Margaret 's . Dr. Blanchard professed himself interested in the case which I had exhibited to him , and would not take any fee . I went out from his presence , half comforted , somewhat strengthened , and resolved that I would do as he bade . I began , in the first place , by fortifying myself daily with a simple tonic , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , it was on finding me so resolved that the subtle apparition feared a fresh encounter-so many weeks went by without its reappearance  --  the Winter , which I had once so looked forward to for its promised home and joy , having shifted into Springthat I was fairly drawing fresh breath and fancying myself free-and , being off my guard one night , there it lay . It was a starlit midnight , with a thick haze catching the starbeams and weaving them into a kind of fleece over the heavens , so that what light there was had a strange and supernatural effect , at best . With this , a wild , high wind was roaring on behind us , like the tramp of a ghostly legion on high , and blowing up some salt , tough gale from the seaboard . Owing to this great wind in our favorwhich favoring wind has something as much to do with a railway carriage as with a ship , while pressing from the rear and destroying atmospheric resistance in face-we had made remarkable time , and were ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of slowing , when a white-winged night bird , startled by our approach , rose from its covert beside the track , and flew away toward the woods . In another moment something else rose , too , as if a slumbering wayfarer there had lifted head to gaze after the flying shadow , and then it lay back again-and , looking at it intently , I saw the face once more . Now was my time . What if I should shut my eyes , and , not seeing it , drive on ? But no , that would be cowardly-neither would it effect the object , neither could I do it . Moreover , were I able , in so doing I might fail to observe some real obstacle , and so plunge my whole train to destruction . Therefore , I gazed . And gazing , it took the strength out of me  --  the sweet , wide-open eyes ; the tender , trembling mouth ; the half-fainting rose upon the cheek . As the storm swoops and snaps a bending tree , I sent a blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering drag of the brakes , and then , in spite of myself the throttle valve had done its work , and we were gently slowing , and should have paused at a point several rods from the appealing sight-should have pausedbut we did not . It was as though some mighty and invisible hand , mightier than the breath of steam or the temper of steel , mocking my own , had seized us and was drawing us on at its wicked will . My heart refused to beat-stood still with horror ; the shiver that ran even through the roots of my hair hardened there ; we were close upon the place , grinding with all our hefty iron over it ; we had passed it , and we paused . The wind had dragged the whole train for that distance . If you doubt me , // the books of my profession will tell you that it is no remarkable instance , for a sudden flaw of contrary wind has been known to do so much as to bring to a stop a train under full headway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing one cruel day for me ! We had passed the place then . Till I could rouse me from the benumbing faintness , could draw a breath , and then could steady my voice , I did not attempt to move . But the instant I mastered myself I went through my customary drama on these occasions-was ofl running behind and swinging my lantern over the vacant track , finding nothing , back again , and leaning on my handles before the conductor had reached me . I told him then that we were ahead of time by reason of the wind , and I was waiting on the side-track for the downtrain to pass . Fortunately , facts upheld me , or my flushed face and shaking hands would have betrayed the truth , or the falsehood , behind . I questioned with myself now if the ghost was laid . Yet how could it be ? We had run over the face , it was true , but by no volition of mine . Indeed , I had decided exactly the opposite ; I had refused to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cowed and conquered-not yet had it pricked the bubble of this phantasm and caused it to explode into empty and innoxious air . It would be idle to rehearse the passing of the Summer and the coming of the Winter , with their continued visitations that then , indeed , came more seldom , but every time with increased power . I had struck work for a season , and had been up resting with Margaret , at her mother 's , for two delicious monthsresting , just closing my eyes in peace . I had begged her then , before I came away , to marry me ; for I thought if I had the dear real face my daily companion , to come home to , to go out from , the fictitious one would perforce die a natural death . But , even had Margaret herself entirely consented , her mother had too many scruples to suffer her only child to leave her for such precarious protection as mine might be . So I went back to solitary life again . My trouble had now become so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their results , were extraordinary , I took no serious note of them ; only the possibility of their future coming , and the actuality of their past , hung over me like a black , suffocating cloud , awake or asleep . In fact , though , I had no sleep that deserved the beneficent name . In place of the sweet oblivion and rest of forgetfulness that other men knew , I had for my part a long and living nightmare . In all this time I had failed to find sufficient strength to obey the physician 's order , to cut through the cursed thing that was killing me , with the sharp flange of my wheels , and annihilate it . But Dr. Blanchard had found me out , although in consulting him I had given no name , and one afternoon he accosted me in the street , on my way to the station , not to ascertain what progress I had madefor that was visible enough in my haggard and jaded appearance  --  but to ask me if I was to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on hearing my reply , he said , gently , that he should have the pleasure of trusting himself to my guidance for that trip , and , if I had no objection , and could find room for him , he would be my companion upon the Black Bess . Of course I perceived his intention sufficiently well ; and perhaps it was an unwise thing for him to propose , for his mere presence was more likely to conjure up the appearance than to help me overcome it . If , now , I tell the rest of the story as it appeared to me then , and as my troubled brain received it , it is because remembrance is nearly as vivid as the suffering , and I can hardly say to-day where reason ends and phantasms begin* // We had a snowy night for this excuision of Dr. Blanchard 's , so much is certam ; not like that great , white , whirling storm in which the face , all wrapped in folds of bridal lace , flitted before me and rested till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's use could then have advanced the snowed-up train an inch ; but a night of gusty flaws , when a light down dropped on the track and was gone , and velvety flakes draped spray and twig of the woodland and shook off showeringly as we passed , and snow-squalls dashed blindingly across our path and vanished , and all the sky was a gray and dazzling bewilderment . I knew that , whatever the weather was , Margaret would not fail me at the station , and then I told the doctor , as we neared Brookford , what sight there was in store for him at that place , and remarked that it was , may be , fortunate for me that night that Margaret had really to cross the track in order to reach the spot where she was to await us , as in looking out that no danger befell herself I should be less likely to encounter that wraith of hers , nor could I see them both together . But Dr. Blanchard shook his head , and bade me mind my own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe her capable of taking care of herself . And looking out into the wavering whiteness lit by the glare of the head-light , while he shouted forth his gruff advice , all at once- " There / There I , ' I cried . " There it is I , , " Where ? " demanded the doctor , springing to gaze over my shoulder , as if his untrained vision could have discerned so much as an outline in that thick air . " Damn it ! Do n't be a fool ! Drive on ! " * " Where ? " I answered . " There ! right before us . A woman walking . See ! she has turned her head ; she sees us ; she did not hear us in that gust , we have frightened her ; she stumbles , she falls , she is lying on the track , she can not get up-that face , that white face-it is Margaret 's !

" he replied , before I had finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you there is not a single object before us till we reach the Brookford lights there , a mile away ! " I hardly heard him . I had stretched out my hand to pull up , when I caught a sidelong glimpse of him , brandishing an iron bar above my head . " Touch that handle , " he cried , " and I will knock you down ! " And then he interposed himself between my hand and it . " You are mad , " I said , calmly , and believing what I said . " Do you suppose I fear your billy ? While I am master of the Black Bess she does not run down a woman-least of all that one . " The whole of this was so hurried that not even George Rowe , who stood staring and gaping and hearkening with all his might , could make out a syllable . " Very well , " said the doctor then , reversing his method , and yelling out his words in my ear till he must have been purple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as both your fireman and I myself can assure you that we see nothing there , you must feel equally convinced that it is your pursuing phantom , as you call it . Now , then , is the time to put an end to it . Destroy it . Exert your will . You have only to fold your hands behind you . Nothing else in the world to do . Give them here to me . The engine will do the rest Be a man now-remember that , this once done , all your peace begins-Margaret and marriage-home and happiness . There is nothing there ! Drive on !

Ah ! how many times before had they gazed into mine with long and lovely looks  --  and now for the last time-had I returned their gaze with all the protestations of passion  --  and standing here to bray them into nothingness-oh , all the meetings and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear embraces of those arms never to be felt again , the warm , full kisses of the meeting mouthand I myself blotting all out ! To save me the vexing sting of a gadfly I was crashing down on the best-beloved thing of the world with all the mighty revolutions of my ponderous , red-hot iron , with dropping coals and the blasting breath of steam , with all the murderous purpose of this jumping , plunging fiend that I alone controlled , with a shrouding , deafening fury that to the waiting victim drowned the universe in its roar . All these horrors came one by one before my mind , and dropped into my resolve like grains into the weighing-scale . I suffered agony . My knees were shaking under me . I doubt if I could have lifted my hand-I did not try ; it hung nerveless by my side ; the life was dying out of me . I only stared through my window , along the track , at the woman 's face with the fright hardening into it , the blank terror there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socket and mangling flesh , that in one instant would have their hellish grip on every live nerve and spurting vein . Then my ears were ringing with shrieks-I fancied that even through the hot roar and reverberation of our flight I heard the rest . When would the last car be over , the last wheel turned ? was that swift hiss the severing of a tress upon the rail ? It was passed . We rolled into Brookford station ; George Rowe 's hand had slipped before me and slowed the Black Bess to her usual point . We stopped Then the blood boun&amp;d back to my heart , to my throat , to my face , the strength of an army to my single hand . I seized Dr. Blanchard by the shoulder as if he had been made of card-board . " Come back with me ! ' , I hoarsely yelled . " If we find nothing , I am well once more  --  but if it is as I am sure it is , then you are dead ! " And , regardless of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I rushed back with him to the spot where the highway crossed the track , and where I swore some torn , crushed thing must lie . Never , never had I been so sure  --  and there-yes , yes-sob and strangle , you fool ! - oh , God ! oh God ! - it was Margaret ! Four whitewashed walls , and a clank of chains , and a fair devil going and coming about me , and night and day and night speeding by in whirling flame . And still the phantom face , fixed on the wall , on the trencher , on the floor , if I climb to my grated window , a seal and blotch on all the wide blue heaven ! And then it grows into reality , and hides itself in flesh , it lays a cool hand on my burning brow , it puts water to my parching lip , it sings me songs which , somewhere , I fancy , that once long ago I have heard ; and it smiles till it almost       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
