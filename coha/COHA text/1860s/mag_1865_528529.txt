txt ALL of us children were sent to the public school as soon as we were old enough . There was no urgency required *o get us off in the morning , as we were too fond of books and reading to be found lagging as to time , neither were we often caught at the tail of a class . Fred was particularly smart in his studies , and was generally so much in advance of myself as to be able to give me great assistance in things that I did not fully understand , and there was so much affection between us that he was always ready to play the teacher to us at home . When fifteen years old , I was taken from school , - my education was finished , - that is to say , I had received all I was to get , and that was supposed to be enough for me : I was not to shine in the world . Though far short of what the children of wealthy parents receive at fashionable establishments , yet it was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected me to rise above . I had not studied either French or music or dancing , nor sported fine dresses or showy bonnets ; for our whole bringing up was in keeping with our position . Was I not to be a sewing-girl ? - and how improper it would have been to educate me with tastes which all the earnings of a sewing-girlwould be unable to gratify ! I presume , that , if we had had the means , notwithstanding our peculiarly strict training , we should have been indulged in some of these superfluities . I know that I could easily have learned to enjoy them quite as much as others do . But we were so taught at home that the desire for them was never so strong as to occasion grief because it could not be gratified . I think we were quite as happy without them . As soon as I had left school , my mother installed me as her assistant seamstress . She had at intervals continued to work for the slop-shops , in spite of the low prices and the discourteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her regular helper , I saw and learned more of the trials inseparable from such an employment . I had also grown old enough to understand what they were , and how mortifying to an honorable self-respect . But I took to the needle with almost as great a liking - at least at the beginning - as to my books . The desire to assist my mother was also an absorbing one . I was as anxious to make good wages as she was ; for I now cDnsumed more stuff for dresses , as well as a more costly material , and in other ways increased the family expenses . It was the same with Fred and Jane , - they were growing older , and added to the , general cost of housekeeping , but without being able to contribute anything toward meeting it . A girl in my station in life feels an honorable ambition to clothe herself and pay for her board , as soon as she reaches eibhteen years of age . This praiseworthy desire seems to prevail universally with those who have no portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been of the right character . It does not spring from exacting demands of either father or mother , but from a natural feeling of duty and propriety , and a commendable pride to be thus far independent . If able to earn money at any reputable employment , such girls eagerly embrace it . They pay their parents from their // weekly wages as punctually as if boarding with a stranger , and it is to many of them a serious grief when dull times come on and prevent them from earning sufficient to continue these payments . So unjustly low is the established scale of female wages , that girls of this class are rarely able to save anything . They earn from two to three dollars per week , and in thousands of cases not more than half of the larger sum . It is because of these extremely small wages that the price of board for a working-woman is established at so low a figure , - being graduated to her ability to pay . But low as the price may be , it consumes the chief part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparel in which every American woman feels a proper pride in clothinb herself She must dress neatly at least , no matter how the doing so may stint her in respect of all bodily or mental recreation ; for , with her , appearance is everything . - A mean dress would in many places exclude her from employment , - while a neat one would insure it . Then , if working with other girls in factories , or binderies , or other places where girls a*re largely employed , and where even a fashionable style of dress is generally to be observed , she feels it necessary to maintain a style equal to that of her fellow-workers . Thus the tax imposed upon her by the absolute necessity of keeping up a genteel appearance absorbs all the remainder of her little earnings . Not so with the servant-girl in a family . She pays no board-tax , - her earnings are all profit . But thus having more to spend on dress , she clothes herself in expensive fabrics , until she generally outshines even her mistress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high are their wages , and so uniformly do they spend their earnings in costly goods of foreign manufacture , all now paying an excessive import duty , that I am half inclined to think these foreign cooks and chambermaids may even be depended on to pay the interest of the public debt , if not the great hulk of the debt itself . Their consumption of imported fabrics on which a high duty is levied is very large , and no increase of price seems to prevent them from continuing to purchase . Whoever shall inquire of a shopkeeper on this subject will be told that this class of women generally buy the most expensive goods . Indeed , one has only to observe them in the street to see that they all have silks as essential to their outfit , with abundance of laces and other foreign stuffs . The change from the low wages , the hard work , and the mean fare in Ireland to the high pay , the light work , and the abundant food of the kitchens in this country , seems to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them as they land upon our wharves , all of them in the commonest attire , the very coarsest shoes , many without bonnets . Mark the contrast in their appearance which only a few months ' employment as cooks or chambermaids produces . Every thread of the cheap home-made fabrics in which they came to this country has disappeared ; and in place of them may be seen flashy silks or equally flashy chintzes or delaines , all the product of foreign looms . Every dollar they may have thus far earned has been spent in personal adornment . At home , extremely low wages and scanty employment made money comparatively unattainable . Here , high wages and an active competition for their services have put money into their hands so plenteously as to open to them a new life . They see that American women generally dress extravagantly ; that even their own countrywomen whom they meet on their arrival here are expensively attired ; and the power of these pernicious examples is such , that , when aided by that natural fondness for personal decoration which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin their new career by imitating them . At home , public example taught them to be saving of their money ; here , it teaches no other lesson than to spend it . There , it came slowly and painfully , and was consequently valued ; here , it comes i66 February , // readily and for the asking , and is parted with almost as quickly as it has been earned . I have never been the victim of this common infatuation , to spend my last dollar on a dress that would not become my station ; I have been the architect of my own bonnets ; I have never been the owner of a silken outfit . The idea of this class of women being large enough to pay the interest on our public debt , in the shape of duties on the imported goods which they consume , will of course excite a smile in all to whom it is suggested . It will be a wonder , moreover , how the attention of a quiet sewing-girl like myself should have been drawn to a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know t ) *iat the nation has been feeling the pressure of a universal rise of prices . When any woman comes to buy the commonest article of dry goods for the family , she finds that foreign fabrics are generally much higher in price than goods of the same quality made in this country . On askin* the reason for this difference , she is told it is owing to the tarifi to the gre*tly enhanced duty that has been put on foreign goods , and that those who buy and consume them must pay this duty in the shape of an increase of price . I have resolutely refused to purchase the imported goods , and preferred those made at home , thus unconsciously becoming a member of the woman 's league for the support of domestic manufactures . But it is not so with the army of foreign servant - girls amonb us . They choose the finest and most expensive articles , loaded as they are with a heavy duty . There are millions of American women who purchase in the same way . This craving after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute inability to indulge in it . But I suppose there must always be somebody to purchase and consume these imported goods . And perhaps , after all , it is well that there should be ; for if the nation is to pay a great sum every year for interest out 167 of its import duties , it could hardly raise the means , unless there were an army of thoughtless American women and Irish servant-girls to help it do so . If they are willing to undertake the task , I am sure they have my consent . If the reader should be surprised at the idea of the interest on the public debt being paid from the extravagance of one class of women , he will be more so at the assertion made by a speaker in the highest deliberative body in the country , that another class would be able to pay the debt itself . He said our dairy-women alone were able to do it , - that in ten years they would churn it out , - because within that short period they would produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all true ; for how should I know the number of cows in this country , or the disposition of the dairy-maids ? But I presume he had not consulted them as to whether they were willing to milk cows and churn butter for a term of ten years for the sole benefit of the nation . I am inclined to think they would make no such patriotic sacrifice , except on compulsion . But with tawdry servant-girls and equally tawdry ladies , the case is widely different ; the latter pursue their great task voluntarily ; indeed , it would seem that they rather enjoy it ; so that the more one reflects on the idea , th' less absurd does it appear . It is very certain that the Irish who come among us have for many years been sending home millions of dollars to pay the passage hither of friends whom they had left behind . When these friends arrive here , and have earned money enough , they repeat the process of sending for others whom they in turn have left . The most limited inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another has become . Thus the stream of remittances swells annually . The millions of money so transmitted proves the ability of this class to achieve great pecuniary results in a certain direction . That they thus exert themselves is strong evidence of the intense affec Needle and Garden . // tion existing among them . There are innumerable instances of the father of a large family of children coming out as a pioneer , then sending for the most useful child , and their joint savings being devoted to sending for others , until finally the amount becomes large enough to bring the mother with the younger children , - the latter being meanwhile generally supported at home from savings remitted with affectionate punctuality from this country , until the happy day when they , too , receive the order for a passage . Many times the entire family of a widowed mother , with the mother herself , has been thus transferred to our shores from the savings of the son or daughter who first ventured over . I refer to this remarkable trait in the Irish character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remit only a fraction of their total earnings , yet that fraction constitutes a very large sum . The remainder , which so many of them spend principally in dress , must be enormous . I have neither the taste nor the talent for reducing it to figures ; but the more one looks at this question , the more reasonable does the idea seem that the Irish servant-girls , together with the flash women of this country , have deliberately undertaken to pay the interest on our great national debt . How much it costs to clothe one of these gaudy creatures I can not say ; but the silks and finery worn by them are known to every shopkeeper as expensive articles . As I have never been able to indulge , in such , I have been content to admire them as they flirted by me in the street , or swept up the aisles of our church on Sunday . It is so natural for a woman to admire ornament in dress , that I could not avoid being struck with the finish of an exquisite bonnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of an elegant collar . All these were paraded through the streets and in the church , as much to my gratification as to that of the wearers . They felt a pride in making the display , and I a pleasure in beholding it . I was like the poor lodger in the upper story of an old house , the windows of which overlooked a magnificent garden . The wealthy proprietor had lavished on his domain all that taste and art and money could command to make it gorgeous with shrubbery and flowers . The poor lodger , equally fond of floral beauties , beheld their glories , and inhaled their soft perfumes , as fully and as appreciatively as the owner . No *ffiotion of envy disturbed her , - no longing to possess that of which she enjoyed gratuitously so abundant a share . Her mere oversight was all the possession she desired . It was ever thus with me when the fine dresses of others swept by me over the pavement . I confess that I admired , but no repining thought ever came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume . It was no grief to me to be unable to indulge in these luxuries . I saw them all , which was more than even the wearers could say . They wore them for the gratification of the crowd of lookers-on ; and if the crowd were gratified , their mission was fulfilled . But I did sometimes think upon the cost of these expensive outfits , - how some girls equally poor with me must toil and struggle to obtain means for an indulgence so unbecoming their position , - how others , the wealthy ones , who , having never earned a dollar , knew nothing of its value , clothed themselves with all the lavish finery that money could command , while the meek sewing-girl who passed them on her way to the tailor 's might perhaps be kept from starving by the sums expended on the rich silks which hung round them in superfluous flounces , or the costly brilliants which depended from their ears . It was said by Solomon , that " every wise woman buildeth her house . " It was averred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family must furnish it with brains , and that he never knew a man or woman of large capacity who had a foolish mother . It is historically true that the great men of all ages have been the children of wise and careful mothers . Such women understand the // art of skilfully managing the whole machinery of the family . Taste and manners come to such by nature . They cultivate the heart , the mind , and the conscience . They moderate the aspirations of their daughters , and purify and elevate. those of their sons . It is from the influence which such mothers exercise over the household that respectability and happiness result . My mother taubht us moderation in our views , and conformity to our position in life , especially to avoid overstepping it in the article of dress . She was at the yery foundation of our house ; it may be said that she built it . While , therefore , our appearance was uniformly neat and genteel , none of us were at any time dressed extravagantly . Thus educated from childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel no envious longings at the display which others made . But curiosity could not be repressed . It was always interesting to know the cost of this or that fine article which others wore . There was little difficulty in obtaining this information as to the outfits of our neighbors . The fine lady invariably told her acquaintances how much her cloak or bonnet cost , and from these the information was communicated to the servants , whence it quickly radiated over the entire neighborhood . The pride seemed to be , not that the new bonnet was a superb affair , but that such a fashionable artist produced it , and that it cost so much money . Had it been equally beautiful at half the cost , or the handiwork of an obscure milliner , it would have been considered mean . Thus , instead of a necessity for being extravagant , it struck me there was a desire to be so , and principally in order that others , when they looked on the display , might be awed into deference , if not into admiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shoulders of the fashionable butterfly . This boastful parade of information as to how much one expends in this or that article implies an undertone of vulgarity peculiar ' to ehose who have nothing but money to be proud of . The cultivated and truly genteel mind is neVer guilty of it . Yet it somehow prevails too extensively among American women . Display is a sort of mania with too many of them . A family in moderate circumstances marries off a daughter with a portion of only two or three thousand dollars , yet it is all laid out in furnishing a house which is twice as spacious as a first start in lire can possibly require . Not a dollar is saved for the future . The wedding also has its shams . Costly silver plate is hired in large quantities from the manufacturer , and spread ostentatiously over tables , to which the weddingguests are invited , that they may admire the pretended presents thus insincerely represented as having been made to the bride . When the feast is over , it is all returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter must be had , no matter what may become of the foi*ier . As I was animated by the common ambition of all properly educated girls in my position , to pay my own way , so I worked with my needle with the utmost assiduity . I worked constantly on such garments as my mother could obtain from the shops , goin , with her to secure them , as well as to deliver such as we had made up , each of us very frequently carrying a heavy bundle to and fro . Should the tailor sell the cheapest article in his shop , sc*cely weighing a pound , he was all courtesy to the buyer , and his messenber would be despatched half over the city to deliver it . . Not so , however , with the sewing-women . There was no messenger to wait on them ; their heavy bundles they must carry for themselves . The prices paid to us were always low . As the character of the work vaned , so did the price . Sometimes we brou , ht home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes pantaloons at a trifle more , and sometimes vests at a shilling . No fine lady knows how many thousand stitches are required to make up one of these garments , because she has never thus employed her fingers . But I know , be1865.1 169 // cause I have often sat a whole day and far into the night , * making a single shirt . No matter how sick one might feel , or how sultry and relaxing the weather , the work must go on ; for it must be delivered within a specified time . I have seen the most heartless advertisements in the newspapers , calling on some one , giving even her name and the place of her residence , to return to the tailor certain articles she had taken to make up , with a threat to prosecute her , if they were not returned immediately . But the poor sewing- girl thus publicly traduced as a thief may have been taken ill , and been thus disabled from completing her task ; she may have lived a great distance from the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her illness , so as to account for the non-delivery of the work ; yet in her helplessness the stigma of dishonesty has been cruelly cast upon her . One of my schoolmates , the eldest child of a widow who had five others to provide for , had just hegun working for a shop situated a full mile from her mother 's residence . She was a bright , lively , and highly sensitive girl of sixteen . The day after bringing home a heavy bundle of coarse pantaloons , she was taken down with brain-fever . It was believed that she had been overcome by the effort required of her young and fragile frame in carrying the great hurd* under a hot noonday sun . She languished for days , hut with intervals of consciousness , during which her inability to finish the work at the stipulated time was her constant anxiety . Her mother soothed her apprehension by assurances that a delay of a few days in the delivery could he of no consequence ; and so believing , in fact , she sent no message to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her task . A week of suffering thus passed . Saturday came and went without the work being delivered to her employer . But the poor girl was better , even convalescent ; * another week would probably enable her to resume the needle . On Sunday I went to see her . She was quiet , and in her right mind , hut still anxious about her failure to be punctual . I volunteered to call the next morning and inform the employer of her illness . I did so . He was in a mean shop , whose whole contents had been displayed in thick festoons . of jackets , shirts , and pantaloons , on the outside , where a man was pacing to and fro upon the pavement , whose vocation it was to accost and convert into a purchaser every passer-by who chanced even to look at his goods . I was most unfavorably impressed with all that I saw ahout the shop . When I went in , the impression deepened . There sat the proprietor in his shirt-sleeves , a vulgarlooking creature , smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to puff when I accosted him . Why should he ? I was only a sewing-girl . I told him my business , - that my friend had heen ill and unable to complete her work , hut that she was now recovering , and would return it before many days . Putting on a sneer so sinister and vicious that it was long before I ceased to carry it in my memory , he replied , - " It s of no consequence , - I ye seen to it . She s too late . " Though the man 's manner was offensive , yet I attached no particular meaning to his words . But on reaching home , my mother showed me an advertisement in a widely circulated pennypaper which we took , warning the poor sick sewing-girl to return her work immediately , on pain of heing prosecuted . There wa* her name in full , and the number of the house in the little court where she lived . My mother was almost in tears over the announcement . We knew the family well ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the mother was a model of patient industry , with so deep a sense of religious obligation that nothing hut her perfect reliance on the wisdom and goodness of God could haVe supported her through all her multiplied afflictions . Her hushand had been for years a miserable drunkard , as well as dreadfully abusive of his wife and family . The daughter had sat next to // me at school , to and from which we had been in the daily habit of going tOT gether . I had a strong affection for her . It was natural that I should be overwhelmed with indignation at the man who had perpetrated this wanton outrage , and excited with alarm for my poor friend , should she be made acquainted with it . All day I was in an agony of apprehension for her . It was impossible for me to go to her , as she lived a great way oW and we , too , had work on our hands which was pressingly required at the end of the week . But that evening I stole off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the narrow court than it was apparent that something had gone wrong . There was a group of neighbors gathered round the door , conversing in a subdued tone , as if overtaken by a common calamity . They told me that my poor young friend was dying ! Some one , at the very hour when I was in the shop of the unfeeling tailor , excusing the delinquency of his sick sewing-girl , had incautiously gone* up into her chamber with the morning paper , and , in the absence of her mother , had read to the unfortunate girl the terrible proclamation of her shame . The effect was immediate and violent . The fever on her brain came back with renewed intensity , and absolute madness supervened . All day she raved with agonizing incoherency , no medical skill availing to mitigate the violence of the attack . As evening came on , it brought exhaustion of strength , with indications of speedy dissolution . When I reached the bedside , the poor body lay calm and still ; but the yet unconquered mind was breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking round the group at her bedside , she exclaim-ed ,  --  " A thieg mother ! I am not a thief ! Oh , this death-bed - the first that I had ever seen - was axvful ! But my nervous organization enabled me to witness it without trepidation or alarm . Love , sympathy , regret , and indignation were the only emotions that took possession of m* heart . I even held in my own the now almost pulseless hand of this poor victim of a brutal persecution , and felt the lessening current of her innocent life become weaker and weaker . For three long hours - long indeed to me , but far longer to her - we watched and prayed . Suddenly the restlessness of immediate dissolution came over her . Turning to her mother , she again exclaimed , as if perfectly conscious , - " Dear mother , tell them I was not a thief ! " Oh , it was grievous unto heart-breaking to see and hear all this ! But it was the last effort , the last word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I looked into her face ; I saw that respiration bad ceased ; I saw the lustre of the living eye suddenly disappear : her gentle spirit had burst the shackles which detained it here , and winged its flight , we humbly trusted , to a mansion of eternal rest . Not until then did a single tear come to relieve me . We sat by the poor girl 's bedside in weeping silence . No heavier heart went to its pillow that night than mine . I have related this incident as an illustration of the hazards to which needIe-women are exposed when dealing with the more unprincipled employers . I will not say that tragedies of this character are of frequent occurrence , - or that the provocation to them has not been too often given . There have no doubt been frequent instances of employers being defrauded by sewing-women who have dishonestly failed to return the work taken out , even giving to them a fictitious name and residence . In such cases , an effort to obtain redress by public exposure , the only apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vexatious , yet , as the utmost that a sewing-girl could steal would be of small value , the resort to newspaper exposure seems to be a very harsh mode of obtaining restitution . It appears to me that vengeance , more than restitution , is the object of him who hastily adopts it . It may lead to sad and even // fatal mistakes , - fatal to life itself ; as well as to the purest reputation , the only capital which too many sewing . women possess . My weekly earnings with the needle , while a girl , never reached a sum more than enough to board and clothe me . But I felt proud of being able to accomplish even what I did . When any little sum for recreation was want ed , it was cheerfully handed out to me , but our recreations were rare and cheap , for we selected those which were moderate and homely . My father taught me to work in the garden ; and there I spent many odd hours in hoeing among the vegetables and flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and even . This employmen was beneficial to health and appetite , and afforded an excellent oppbrtunity for reflection . He taught me all the botanical names that he had picked up from the gentlemen for whom he worked , having acquired an amusing fondness for remembering and repeating them . I learned them all , because he desired me to do so , and because I saw it gratified him for me to take an interest in such things . I do not think this kind of knowledge did him much good ; for he was unable to give reasons when I inquired for them . But the use of these sonorous designations for common things was a sort of conversational hobby with him . I can not say that he was unduly proud of the little draughts of learning he had thus taken at the neighboring fountains , but rather that it became a sort of passion with him , yet regulated by a sincere desire to impart to his children all the knowledge he had himself acquired . There was great merriment among us when he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did so with the utmost gravity of countenance , which only increased our amusement . I remember one summer evening he told Fred , on leaving the supper-table , to go out and pull up a Pkytolacca that was going to seed just over the gardenfence . Fred stopped in amazement at hearing so strange a word ; and I conNeedle and Garden . February , fess that it bewildered even me . Then followed the very explanation which father had intended to give . He told us it was a poke-bush . " Oh , said Fred , with a broad laugh , " is that all ? " But the word was forthwith written down , so as to impress it on our memories , and none of us have yet forgotten it . It was singular , moreover , how the imitative faculty gained strength among us . We children acquired the habit of speaking of all our garden-plants by such outlandish names as father then taught us , - not seriously , of course , but as a capital piece of fun . We knew no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these names much as parrots repeat the chance phrases they sometimes learn ; still , the faint glimmerings of knowledge thus early shed upon our minds came back to us in after life , and , explained and illustrated by study and observation , now serve as positive lights to the understanding . I thus learned a great deal by working in the garden , and at the same time became extremely fond of it , taking the utmost delight in planting the seeds and watching the growth of even a cabbagehead , as well as in keeping the ground clear of interloping weeds . I even learned to combine the useful with the beautiful , which some have declared to be the highest phase of art . Fred did all the digging , and in dry times was very ready to water whatever might be suffering from drought . My mother encouraged these labors as aids to health . The time they occupied could be spared from the needle , as the garden required attention but a few months , and only occasionally even then , while the needle could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family earnings were not all absorbed by our weekly expenses . We had no ' rent to pay , and there was nothing laid out in improvements . Hence a small portion of father 's earnings was carefully laid by every week , - not enough to make us rich , but still sufficient to prevent us , if continued , from ever becoming poor . // While thus industriously working with the needle , we began to feel the effect on female labor which the introduction of sewing - machines had occasioned . The prices given by the tailors were not only becoming less and less , but our employers were continually more exacting as to the quality of the work , and evidently more independent of us . In very busy seasons , when they really needed all the clothing we could make up , they were courteous enough , because they were then unable to do without us . But the introduction of sewing machines seemed to revolutionize their behavior . As every movement of the machine was exactly like every other , so there was an astonishing uniformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first stitch neatly , all the succeeding ones must be equally neat . Hence the beautiful regularity of the work it turned out . It looked nicer than any we could do by hand , though in reality not more substantial . Its amazing rapidity of execution was another element of superiority , against which , it was believed , no sewing-woman could successfully contend . Heretofore , I had noticed that our employers had , on numerous occasions , set up the most frivolous pretexts for reducin* our wages . In all my experience they never once advanced them , even when crowding us so hard as to compel us to sew half the night . The standing cry was that we must work for less , but there was never a lisp of giving us more . At one time the reason was - for reasons were plenty enough - that the merchant had advanced the prices of his cloths ; at another , that a new tariff had enhanced the cost of goods ; at another , that the men in their employ had struck for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition on us was foolish and unsatisfactory , and to most women , who know so little of merchandise and tariffs , quite incomprehensible . The whole drift was , that , as others laid it on the tailors , the latter must lay it on the sewing-women . But all the reasons thus set before us I turned over in my mind , and thought a great deal about . I never had the uncomplainin* timidity of my mother , when dealing with these men , - and so , on more than one occasion , was bold enough to speak out for our rights . It struck me , from the various pretexts set up for cutting down our scanty wages , that they were untrue , and had been trumped up for the sole purpose of cheapening our work . Some of them were so transparently false that I wondered how any one could have the impudence to present them . Those who did so must have considered a sewing-woman as either too dull to detect the fallacy , or too timid to expose and resent it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailor who was considered to be of a better class , - that is , one who kept shop in a fashionable street , and sold a finer and better description of goods than were to be foi*nd in the slop-shops , - and while making up a dozen fine vests , were congratulating ourselves on having advanced a step in our profession . The man was very civil to us , and had justly acquired the reputation , among the sewing-womeI* , of dealing fairly and courteously with those he employed . When our first dozen vests were done , we took them in . There was decided commendation as to the excellence of the work , - it was entirely satisfactory , - the price was paid ,  --  but if we wanted more , he would have to pay us so much less . This was at the very beginning of the season , when such vests would be in demand . Had it been at the close , when sales were dull and little work needed , I could have understood why a reduction was demanded , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now I could not , and felt mortified and indignant . My mother said nothing . On such occasions she invariably submitted to the imposition without remonstrance . It is the misfortune of most sewingwomen to be obliged to bear these hard exactions in silence . Continued employment is with them so great a necessity as to compel them to do so . But // not feeling this urgency myself , and being now grown a little older , and no doubt a little bolder , I ventured to address the tailor in reply . " Why do you ask us to take less for our work , Sir ? " " Goods have gone up ; Miss , " he responded . " The importers charge us twenty per cent more . " " Do you require them to take less , as you do us ? " " Oh , " said he , " they re very independent . We may buy or not , they say , just as we please . Everybody wants these goods , - they are very scarce in the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then , " I added , " if the goods are so scarce and desirable , the vests made of them oubbt to be equally so , and thus command a corresponding advance from the consumer. ** " Certainly , " he quickly replied , " we put the advanced cost on the buyer . " " Then the same reason holds good to make him pay more and us to take less , " I replied , with an impetuosity of tone and manner that I could not resist . " . lf you get the advance out of him , why do you take it off of us ? " I saw that my mother was growing restless and uneasy , but I continued , - " Do you consider the reason you have given for reducing our scanty wages to be either just or generous ? You require us to sit up half the night to get this work done , that you may supply customers who , by your own statement , will pay you as good a profit on our next week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered . You advance your own prices , but cut down ours . By the money paid us you see that we have made only four dollars in the week , and now you ask us to work for three . Can two women live on three dollars a week ? You might " - I was so fully under way , that there is no knowing what more I might have said , had not my mother stopped me short . But my indignation was roused , and I was about to begin again , when the tailor interposed by saying , - " Do as you please , Miss , - that s my price , - and yours too , or not , just as you choose. ** Just then the man 's wife came into the shop , and called off his attention from us . I noticed that she was dressed in the extreme of the fashion . There were silks , and laces , and jewelry in abundance , the profits of the unrequited toil of many poor sewing-women . I told my mother we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look for a new employer , and started to go out . But she , being less excitable , lingered , asked for a second bundle , and came out with it on her arm . I carried it home , but it weighed heavily on my hands . We made up the vests , but the otherwise pleasant labor of my needle was embittered by the reflection of how great a wrong had been done to us . The sting of this imposition continued to rankle in my heart so long as we were the bondwomen of this particular man . This persistent tendency to a reduction of wages acquired new strength from the intro4uction of sewing-machines . As they came gradually into general use , we found the cry raised in all the shops that machine-work was so much better than hand-work , that nothing but the former was wanted , - customers would have no other . I am satisfied that this also was to some extent a mere pretext to accomplish a fresh reduction of prices . The work may really have been better done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops would continue to employ us at hand-work , if we would do it at the same rate with the machine-work . It was thus evident that it was not a question as to the quality of the sewing , but simply one of price . Machinery had been made to compete with muscle , and we were fairly in a dilemma which occasioned us an amount of uneasiness that was truly distressing . I did not attempt to fly in the face of this state of things by argument or repining . I saw the result - at least I thought so - from the beginning . To satisfy my doubts , I first went to see the machines while in operation . How they // could possibly overcome the mechanical perplexities of needle and thread I could not imagine ; neither , when Isaw them performing their work with such beautiful simplicity , could I clearly understand how it was done . But my curiosity was gratified , and my doubts resolved , - the great fact was made manifest . It struck me with a sort of dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was quite as much discouraged as myselg for her darling theory of the supremacy of the needle had been blown to the winds . She would be compelled to admit that hereafter the machine was to be paramount , and the seamstress comparatively obsolete . It could not be denied that the machines were capable of doing work as beautifully as it could be done by needle-women . Then we were confounded by the amazing rapidity with which they made the stitches . We saw that it was vain to expect our slow fingers to compete with the lightning-like velocity attained by simply putting the foot upon a treadle . I have no doubt that thousands of sewing-girls , all over the country , were equally astonished and disheartened , when they came to be assured of the success of these machines . They must have seen , as we did , that prices would speedily go down . Indeed , all who were in immediate communication with the tailors became aware , at a very early day , of the downward tendency . I confess that no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance the call upon us was not entirely a pretext of the tailors , but a necessity forced upon them by a new agency suddenly introduced into their business , which they must immediately counteract or embrace , or else give up their occupation . The first tailor who bought a dozen machines found no difficulty in having as many girls taught to operate them . The makers saw to it that no impediment to their sale should occur from girls of ordinary intelligence being unable to use them ; so the first sewers were taught either by the inventors themselves or by the skilled mechanics who constructed the machines . As the girls learned quickly , so , when only a small number had become expert at using them , they served as teachers to others . Thus the operatives were multiplied almost as rapidly as the machines . It was quite as difficult , at the first introduction , to obtain the machines as it was to procure operators , so immediately was the invention recognized by a vast industrial interest as the forerunner of a complete revolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first tailor who bought machines was able to set them at work directly . As one machine would perform about as much in a day as ten women , the saving in the labor of the nine thus dispensed with enabled him to reduce the price of his manufactured goods to a figure so low that he could undersell all others in the trade . Cheapness being everywhere the cry , he who sold at the lowest rates was able to dispose of the most goods . It is not likely that he gave his customers the full benefit of all the saving made by discharging nine girls out of ten . This was large ; for , while he saved their wages , he made little or no advance in those of the remaining girl , who now did on a machine as much work as the whole ten had previously done with their needles . The only difference to her was , that she dropped the needle , and employed a machine . She was , in either case , a mere sewing-girl ; and if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough . She had never made more : why should she be permitted to do so now ? It would have been altogether contrary to usage to permit such a hand to have any benefit from any general improvement or economy in the employer 's great establishment . The men are frequently able to exact it , but the women never . A tailor thus underselling all others , and yet making greater profits than ever , invited imitation and competition . All who were able to procure machines 1865 . I 75 // did so as fast as the inventors could supply the demand . This became so enormous and pressing that new manufactories were speedily established , and rival machines came into use by scores . Clothing - shops and other establishments went into operation with a hundred machines in each , throwing multitudes of sewing-women out of employment . Steam was called in to take the place of female fingers . The human machine was suddenly discarded , - turned ofi ; without notice or compunction , to seek other occupation , or to suffer for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when such a prospect as this was seen opening itself before us . Neither is it to be wondered at that prices broke down as the revolution progressed . I was confounded at the low rates to which wages fell . The price for making a shirt was reduced one half . Fine bosoms , crowded with plaits and full of seams , were made for a few cents per dozen . Even the mean slop-shop work was so poorly paid , that no woman , working full time , could earn much more than a dollar a week . If ill , or with a family of children to look after , her case was apparently hopeless . How all the sewing-women thus suddenly reduced to idleness were to gain a livelihood I could not comprehend . A cry of distress rose up from the toiling inmates of many a humble home around us . The privilege to toil had been suddenly withdrawn from them . Even my mother , as I have said , began to wake up from the delusion under which she had hitherto labored , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for here was a revolution that had not entered into her imagination . Though not at any time impoverished or even straitened by it , yet she saw how others were ; and it led her to think that women might be not only usefully employed at many new things , but that they ought to be qualified by education for even a variety of occupations , so that , when one staff gave way , another would remain to lean up on . I suggested that the reason why so many were at that time idle was , that all of them had been brought up to do the same thing , - to sew , - and that they did not seek employment in other pursuits because their industrial education had not been sufficiently diversified ; they were not qualified , and consequently would not be employed . A woman can become expert at the needle only by proper training through a regular apprenticeship . If necessary in that instance , it is equally so in all others . Every great city abounds in employments for which women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are shut out from them only for want of proper training , and the deplorable absence of available facilities for acquiring it . The boy is apprenticed , serves out his time , and secures remunerative wages . Why not give a similar training to his sister ? If girls were properly instructed , they would be profitably employed . It has been so with the seamstress : Why should it be otherwise in a different sphere ? At no time had we been in the habit of telling my father the particulars of our experience with the tailors . He heard only incidentally how little we earned , while our greatest grievances were rarely spoken of before him . The truth is , that he had a very poor opinion of the craft . I am sure , that , if he had known as much of them as we did , it would have been even more unfavorable . But here was an entirely new trouble to be met and ov&amp;rcome , requiring the utmost wisdom of the whole family to master it . As to our ceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , to be kept at it . Our consultations and discussions were consequently frequent and long . My father joined in these with great interest , but could suggest no remedy . I had noticed that our penny paper was crowded with advertisements for girls who understood working on a sewing-machine ; and I learned from several of my acquaintances that not only was the demand for such operatives unlimited , but that an expert hand was able to earn quite as much as // with the needle formerly , while some were earning much more . It struck me that I had overlooked the important fact that all the sewing for the public was still to be done by women , even though machines had been invented on which to do it : in our first depression , we had innocently supposed that in future it was to be done by men . It was obvious , then , that our only course was to get machines , - one for my mother , and one for myself . I knew that I should learn quickly , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . My mother entered heartily into the plan , as it held out to us the certainty of continued employment . We explained the case to my father , and he also approved of the project , and agreed to buy us a machine . He thought it better to begin with only one , to see whether we could understand it , and find a sale for our work , as well as how we liked it . Besides , when these machines were first made , the inventors exacted an exorbitant price for them , - they , too , in this way levying a cruel tax on the sewing-women . The cost at that time was from a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty dollars . My father could manage to provide us with one , but the expense of two was more than he could assume . I was then within a few weeks of being eighteen ; and it was arranged that I should devote the intervening time to learning how to operate a machine , by attending one of the schools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new purchase should be my birthday present . So , paying ten dollars for instruction , and agreeing to work eight weeks without wages , I took my position , with more than a dozen others , as a learner at the sewing-machine .
