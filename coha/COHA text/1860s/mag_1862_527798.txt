txt WAR AND LITERATURE . IT would be a task worthy of a volume , and requiring that space in order to be creditably performed , to show how war affects literature , at what points they meet , where they are at variance , if any wars stimulate , and what kinds depress the intellectual life of nations . The subject is very wide . It would embrace a discussion of the effects of war when it occurs during a period of great literary and artistic splendor , as in Athens and in the Italian Republics ; whether intellectual decline is postponed or accelerated by the interests and passions of the strife ; whether the preliminary concen tration of the popular heart may claim the merit of adding either power or beauty to the intellectual forms which bloom together with the war . These things are not entirely clear , and the experience of different countries is conflicting . The Thirty Years ' War , though it commenced with the inspiration of great political and religious ideas , did not lift the German mind to any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nation sank away from it into a barren and trivial life , although the war itself occasioned a multitude of poems , songs , hymns , // and political disquisitions . The hymns of this period , which are filled with a sense of dependence , of the greatness and awfulness of an invisible eternity , and breathe a desire for the peaceful traits of a remote religious life , are at once a confession of the weariness of the best minds at the turmoil and uncertainty of the contest and a permanent contribution of the finest kind to that form of sacred literature . But princes and electors were fighting as much for the desi*nation and establishment of their petty nationalities , which first checkered the map of Europe after the imperial Catholic power was rolled southwardly , as they were for the pure interest of Protestantism . The German intellect did eventually gain something from this political result , because it interrupted the literary absolutism which reigned at Vienna ; no doubt literature grew more popular and German , but it did not very strikingly improve the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generously nourishing enthusiasm , and the great ideas of the period became the pieces with which diplomatists carried on their game . The Volkslied ( popular song ) came into vogue again , but it was not so fresh and natural as before ; Opitz , one of the best poets of this period , is worth reading chiefly when he depicts his sources of consolation in the troubles of the time . Long poetical bulletins were written , in the epical form , to describe the battles and transactions of the war . They had an immense circulation , and served the place of newspapers . They were bright and characteristic enough for that ; and indeed newspapers in Germany date from this time , and from the doggerel broadsides of satire and description which then supplanted minstrels of whatsoever name or guild , as they were carried by post , and read in every hamlet. * But the * Newspapers proper appeared as early as 1615 in Germany . But these rhymed gazettes were very numerous . They were more or less bulky pamphlets , with pithy sarcastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut prefixed . A few of them were best of these poems were pompous , dull , and tediously elaborated . They have met the fate of newspapers , and are now on file . The more considerable poets themselves appeared to he jealous of the war ; they complained bitterly that Mars had displaced Apollo ; but later readers regret the ferocious sack of Magdeburg , or the death of Gustavus Adolphus , more than the silencing of all those pens . On the other hand , Spain , while fighting for religion and a secure nationality , had her Cervantes , Lope de Vega , and Calderon , all of whom saw service in the field , and other distinguished names , originators of literary forms and successful cultivators of established ones . They created brilliant epochs for a bigoted and cruel country . All that was noble or graceful in the Spanish spirit survives in works which that country once stimulated through all the various fortunes of popular wars . But they were not wars for the sake of the people ; the country has therefore sunk away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have become , if she had been fortunate enough to represent , or to sympathize with , a period of moral and spiritual ideas . Her literary forms do not describe growth , but arrested development . A different period culminated in the genius of Milton , whose roots were in that golden age when England was flowering into popular freedom . lie finally spoke for the true England , and expressed the vigorous thoughts which a bloody epoch can not quench . Some of his noblest things were inspired by the exigencies of the Commonwealth , which he saw " as an eagle nursing her mighty youth , and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam . " The Dutch people , in their great struggle against Philip II. , seemed to find a stimulus in the very exhaustions of war . The protesting ideas for which they fought of Catholic origin , and one , entitled Pest-Bote , ( The Express , ) is quite as good as anything issued by the opposite party . // drew fresh tenacity from the soil , wet with blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every death . Here it is plain that a milder conflict , carried on by intrigue and diplomatic forms alone , for peaceable separation from the Catholic interest , would not have so quickened the intelligence which afterwards nourished so many English exiles and helped to freight the Mayflower . And we see the German mind first beginning to blossom with a language and a manifold literature during and after the Seven Years ' War , which developed a powerful Protestant State and a native German feeling . Frederic 's Gallic predilections did not infect the country which his arms had rendered forever anti- Gallic and anti-Austrian . The popular enthusiasm for himself , which his splendid victories mainly created , was the first instinctive form of the coming German sense of independence . The nation 's fairest period coincided with the French Revolution and the aggressions of the Empire . " Hermann and Dorothea " felt the people 's pulse , which soon heat so high at Jena and Leipsic with rage and hope . The hope departed with the Peace of 1815 , and pamphleteering , pragmatic writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creative genius , whose flowers did not wither while the fields ran red . A war must be the last resort of truly noble and popular ideas , if it would do more than stimulate the intelligence of a few men , who write best with draughts of glory and success . It must be the long-repressed understanding of a nation suffused with strong primitive emotions , that flies to arms to secure the precious privilege of owning and entertaining its knowledge and its national advantages . And in proportion as any war has ever been leavened with the fine excitement of religion or humanity , however imperfectly , and though tyrannized over by political selfishness , we can see that the honest feeling has done something to obliterate the traces of violence , to offer the comforL*f worth in the cause to wounded lips . When the people themselves take to fighting , not for dynastic oh to secure the succession of an Infant to the throne , to fix a Pope in his chair , or to horse a runaway monarch around their necks , not to extort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional balance of power , but to drive back the billows of Huns or Turks from fields where cities and a middle class must rise , to oppose citizen-right to feudal-right , and inoculate with the lance-head Society with the popular element , to assert the industrial against the baronial interest , or to expel the invader who forages among their rights to sweep them clean and to plant a system which the ground can not receive , then we find that the intense conviction , which has been long gathering and brooding in the soul , thunders and lightens through the whole brain , and quickens the germs of Art , Beauty and Knowledge . Then war is only a process of development , which threatens terribly and shakes the locks upon its *sgis in the face of the brutes which infest its path . Minerva is aware that wisdom and common sense will have to fi*ht for recognition and a world : she fends blows from her tranquil forehead with the lowering crest the shield is not always by her side , nor the sword-point resting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious intelligence ? The pen , thus tempered to a sword , becomes a pen again , but ilows with more iron than before . But the original intellectual life begins while the pen is becoming tempered in the fires of a great national controversy , before it is hard enough to draw blood . Magnetic streams attract each slender point to a centre of prophesying thought long before the blood-red aurora stains suddenly the midnight sky and betrays the influence which has been none the less mighty because it has been colorless* Sometimes a people says all that it has in its mind to say , during that comfortless period while the storm is in the air and has not yet precipitated its cutting crystals . The most sensitive minds are // goaded to express emphatically their moral feeling and expectation in such a rude climate , which stimulates rather than depresses , but which is apt to fall away into languor and content . This only shows that the people have no commanding place in history , but are only bent upon relieving themselves from sundry annoyances , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position , from ethnical or political disability , to develop . Such is all the Panslavic literature which is not Russian. * But sometimes a people whose intellect passes through a noble pre-revolutionary period , illustrating it by impetuous eloquence , indignant lyrics , an ( 1 the stern lines which a protesting conscience makes upon the faces of the men who are lifted above the crowtl , finds that its ideas reach beyond the crisis in its life into a century of * Some cultivated Bohemians who can recall the glories of Ziska and his chiefs , and who comprehend the value of the tendency which they strove to represent , thisik that there would have grown a Bohemian people , a great centre of Protestant and Slavonic influence , if it had not been for the Battle of Weissenherg in 1620 , when the Catholic Imperialists defeated their King Frederic . A verse of a popular song , The Patriot 's Lament , runs thus , in Wratislaw 's translation - " cursed mountain , mountain white ! Upon thee was crushed our might What in thee lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a Bohemian people , preserving a real vital tendency . the Battle of the White Mountain would have resulted differently , even had it been a defeat . Other patriots , cultivated enough to be Panslavists , indulge a more cheerful vein . They see a good time coming , and raise the cry of Hej *Slovani ! " Hey , Slavonians ! our Slavonic language still is living , Long as our true loyal heart is for our nation striving ; Lives , lives , the Slavonic spirit , and t will live forever : Hell and thunder ! vain against us all your rage shall shiver . " This is nothing but a frontier feeling . The true Slavonic centre is at St. Petersburg ; thence will roll a people and a language over all kindred ground . power and beauty , during which its emancipated tendency springs forward , with graceful gestures , to seize every spiritual advantage . Its movements were grand and impressive while it struggled for the opportunity to make known the divine intent that inspired it ; but when the fetters burst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movements become unbounded , yet rhythmical , like Nature 's , and snsite , or flow , or penetrate , like hers . To such a people war comes as the disturbance of the earth 's crust which helps it to a habitable surface and lifts fair slopes to ripen wine and vram . After all , then , we must carefully discover what a war was about , before we can trace it , either for good or for evil , into the subsequent life of a nation . There can be 510 such thing as exhaustion or deterioration , if the eternal laws have won the laurel of a fight ; for they are fountains of youth , from which new blood comes rushing through the depleted veins . And it soon mantles on the surface , to mend the financial and industrial distress . Its blush of pride and victory announces n* heady passion . It is the signal which Truth waves from the hearts of her children . If we wish directly to consider the effect of war upon our own intellectual development , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our copious use of the word Country . What a phrase is that - Our Country - which we have been accustomed for eighty years to use upon all festivals that commemorate civic rights , with flattering and *0lfl*0U5 hopes ! We never understooti what it meant , till this moment which threatens to deprive us of the ideas and privileges which it really represents . We never appreciated till now its depth and preciousness . Orators have built up , sentence by sentence , a magnificent estimate of the elements which make our material success , and they thought it was a patriotic chord which they touched with the climax of their fine periods . It was such patriotism as // June , thrives in the midst of content and satisfactory circumstances , which loves to have an inventory made of all the fixtures and conveniences and the crude splendor of a country 's housekeeping , - things which are not indeed to he despised , for they show what a people can do when cast upon their own resources , at a distance from Governmental interference , free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business , in charities , in the cause of education , in the explorations which lay open new regions to the emigration of a world , in the inventiveness which gives labor new pursuits and increases the chances of poor men , in the enterprise which has made foundries , mines , workshops , manufactories , and granaries of independent States . We have loved to linger over the praises of our common schools and our voluntary system of congregational worship , to count the spires which mark every place that man clears to earn his living in . It has been pleasant to trace upon the map the great arteries of intercommunication , flowing east and west , churned by countless paddle-wheels , as they force a vast freight of wealth , material , social , intellectual , to and fro , a freshet of fertilizing life to swell every stream . We love to repeat the names which self-taught men have hewn out in rude places , with the only advantage of being members of Mankind , holding their own share in the great heart and soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fortune . Every element of an unexhausted soil , and all the achievements of a people let loose upon it to settle , build , sow , and reap , with no master but ambition and no dread but of poverty , and a long list of rights thrust suddenly into their hands , with liberty to exercise them ,  --  the right to vote , to speak , to print , to be tried by jury , - all this margin for unfettered action , even the correspondlug vastness of the country itself ; whose ruggedest features and greatest distances were playthings of the popular energy , - to love and extol these things were held by us equivalent to having a native land and feeding a patriotic flame . But now all at once this catalogue of advantages , which we were accustomed to call " our country , " is stripped of all its value , because we begin to feel that it depends upon something else , more interior and less easy to appraise , which we had not noticed much before . Just as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be and effective gifts of every member , of whom we were proud and expected great things , and whom we took unlimited comfort in calling our own , there appears the solemn intention of a soul to use this fine body to express its invisible truth and honor , a wonderful revelation of a high mind filled with aspirations which we had not suspected , - a sudden lifting of the whole body like an eyelid before an inner eye , and we are astonished at the look it gives us so this body of comfort and success , which we worshipped as our country , is suddenly possessed by great passions and ideas , by a consciousness that providential laws demand the use of it , and will not be restrained from inspiring the whole frame , and directing every member of it with a new plan of Unity , and a finer feeling for Liberty , and a more generous sense of Fraternity than ever before . Lately we did as we pleased , but now we are going to be real children of Liberty . Formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured the payment of our debts , and made us *I ) l ) C** formidable abroad while it corrupted and betrayed us at home ,  --  a Union of colporteurs , and caucuses , and ( Irumulers of Southern houses ; not a Union , but a long coffle of patriotic laymen , southerly clergymen , and slaves . Now the soul of a Deinocracy , gazing terribly through eyes that are weeping for the dead arid for indignation at the cause of their clyi ug , holds the thing which we call Union , and determines to keep its mighty hold till it can be informed with Unity , of which justice is the prime condition . See a Country at last , that is , a Republican Soul , making the limbs of free states shiver with the excitement of its great ideas , turning all // our comfortable and excellent institutions into ministers to execute its will , resolved to wring the great sinews of the body with the stress of its awakening , and to tax , for a spiritual purpose , all the material resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our native land . A people in earnest , smarting with the wounds of war and the deeper inflictions of treachery , is abroad seeking after a country . It has been repeating with annual congratulations for eighty years the self-evident truths of the document which declared its independence ; now it discovers that more evidence of it is needed than successful trading and building can bring , and it sends it forth afresh , with half a million of glittering specialities to enforce it doctrines , while trade , and speculation , and all the ambitions of prosperous men , and delicately nurtured lives , and other lives as dearly cherished and nursed to maturity , are sent out with an imperative commission to buy , at all hazards , a real country , to exchange what is precious for the sake of having finally what we dreamed we had before , - the most precions of all earthly things , - a Commonwealth of God . Yes , our best things go , like wads for guns , to bid our purpose speak more emphatically , as it expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of our war , or is it only an ideal picture of what the war might be ? That depends solely upon ourselves . Our soldiers kindle nightly their bivouac fires from East to West , and set their watch . They are the advance posts of the great . idea , iv hich is destined to make a country as it advances southwardly , and to settle it with republicans . If we put it in a single sentence , " Freedom of industry for hand and brain to all men , " we must think awhile upon it before we can see what truths and temporal advantages it involves . We see them best , in this night of our ( listress and trial , by the soldiers ' watch-fires . They encroach upon the gloom , and open it for us with hopes . They shine like the stars of a deeper sky than day affords , and we can see a land stretching to the Gulf , and lying expectant between either sea , whose surface is given to a Republic to people and civilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whoever comes here , brought by poverty or violence , an exile from misery or from power , and whatever be his ethnological distinction , is a republican of this country because he is a man . Here he is to find safety , cooperation , and welcome . His very ignorance and debasement are to be welcomed by a country eager to exhibit the plastic power of its divine idea ,  --  how animal restrictions can be gradually obliterated , how superstition and prejndice must die out of stolid countenances before the steady gaze of republican good-will , how ethnic peculiarities shall subserve the great plan and be absorbed by it . The country no longer will have a conventional creed , that men are more important than circumstances and governments : we always said so , but our opinion was at the mercy of a KnowNothing club , a slaveholding cabal , a selfish democracy : it will have a living faith , born with the pangs of battle , that nothing on earth is *o precious as the different kinds of men . It will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go looking for them through all the neglected places of the world , to invite them in from the by-lanes and foul quarters of every race , expressly to show that man is superior to his accidents , by bringing their bodies into a place ivhere their souls can get the better of them . Where can that be except where a democracy has been waging a religious war against its own great evil , and has repented in blood for having used all kinds of men as the white an ( l black pawns in its games of selfish politics , with its own counti-y for the board , and her peace and happiness lying in the pool for stakes ? Where can man be respected best except here , where he has been undervalued most , and bitterness and blood have sprung from that contempt ? This is the first truly religious war ever waged . Can there be such a thing as a // religious war ? There can be wars in the interest of different theologies , and mixed wars of diplomacy and confessions of belieg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a book , wars of Puritans against the divine right of kings in the Old World and the natural rights of Indians in the New , in all of which the name of God has been invoked for sanction , and Scripture has been quoted , and Psalms uplifted on the battle-field for encoura , em ent . And it is true that every conflict , in which there are ideas that claim their necessary development against usage and authority , has a religions character so far as the ideas vindicate God by being good for man . But a purely religious ivar must be one to restore the attributes and prerogatives of manhood , to confirm primitive rights that are given to finite souls as fast as they are created , to proclaim the creed of humanity , which is so far from containing a single article of theology , that it is solely and distinctively religious without it , because it proclaims one Father in heaven and one blood upon the earth . Manhood is always worth fighting for , to resist and put down whatever evil tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy soul conscious of rights and duties , owning its gifts , and valuing above everything else the liberty to place its happiness in being noble and rood . Every man wages a religious war , when he attacks his own passions in the interest of his own humanity . The most truly religious thing that a man can do is to fight his way through habits and deficiencies back to the pure manlike elements of his nature , which are the ineffaceable traces of the Divine workmanship , and alone really worth fighting for . And when a nation imitates this private warfare , and attacks its own gigantic evils , lighted through past deficiencies and immediate temptations by its best ideas , as its human part rallies against its inhuman , and all the kingly attributes of a freeborn individual rise up in final indignation against its slavish attributes , then commences the true and only war of a people , and the only war of which we dare say , though it have the repulsive features that belong to all wars , that it is religious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win and keep the unity of a country for the great purposes of mankind , a place where souls can have their chances to work , with the largest freedom and under the fewest disabilities , at the divine image stamped upon them ,  --  to get here the tools , both temporal and spiritual , with which to strike poverty and misery out of those glorious traces , and to chisel deep and fresh the handwriting where God says , This is a Man ! Here is a sufficient ground for expecting that intellectual as well as political enlargement will succeed this trial of our country . It is well to think of all the am proaching advantages , even those remote ones which will wear the forms of knowledge and art . For it is undeniable , that a war can not be so just as to bring no evils in its train ,  --  not only the disturbance of all kinds of industry , the suppression of some , the difficulty of diverting , at a moment 's notice , labor towards new objects , - not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming debt , - not the maiming of strong men and their violent removal from the future labors of peace , nor the emotional suffering of thousands of families whose hearts are in the field with their dear ones , tossed to and fro in every skirmish , where the balls slay more than the bodies which are pierced : not these evils alone , - nor the feverish excitement of eighteen millions of people , whose gifts and intelligence are all distraught , and at the mercy of every bulletin , - nor yet the possible violations of private rights , and the overriding of legal defences , which , when once attempted in a state of war , is not always relinquished on the return of peace . These do not strike us so much as the moral injury which many weak and passionate minds sustain from the necessity of destroying life , of ravaging and burning , of inflicting upon the enemy politic distresses . There will be a taint in the army and the community which will en ( lure in the relations of pacific life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have tasted the fierce joy of battle , have suffered the moral privations and dangers of the cami ) , are to be returned suddenly to us , and cast adrift , with no hope of finding immediate employment , and hankering for some excitements to replace those of the distant field . If little truth and little conscience have been at stake , these are the reasons which make wars so demoralIzing : they leave society restored to peace , but still at war within itself , infested by those strange cravings , and te mptedbya new ambition , that of waging successful wars . This will be the most dangerous country on the face of the earth , after the termination of this war ; for it will see its own ideas more clearly than ever before , and long to propagate them with its battIe-ardors and its scorn of hypocritical foreign neutralities . We have the elements to make the most martial nation in the world , with a peculiar combination of patience and impulse , coldness and daring , the capacity to lie in watchful calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if ever the voice of our brother , crying out to us from the ground of any country , shall sigh among the drums which are then gathering dust in our arsenals , the long roll would wake again , and the arms would rattle in that sound , which is part of the speech of Liberty . But it is useless to affirm or to deny such possibilities . It is plain , however , that we are organizing most formidable elements , and learning how to forge them into bolts . The spirit of the people , therefore , must be high and pure . The more emphatically we declare , in accordance with the truth , that this war is for a religious purpose , to prepare a country for the growng of souls , a place where every element of material success and all the ambitions of an enthusiastic people shall only provide fortunate circumstances , so that men can be educated in the freedom which faith , knowledge , and awe before the Invisible secure , the better will it be for us when peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurts of war . Spiritual vitality will throw off vigorously the malaria which must arise from deserted fields of battle . It must be our daily supl ) lication to feel the religious purport of the truths for which we fight . We must disavow vindictiveness , and purge our hearts of it . There must be no vulgar passion illustrated by our glorious arms . And when we say that we are fighting for mankind , to release souls and bodies from bondage , we must understand , without affectation , that we are fighting for the slaveholder himself , who knows it not , as he hurls his iron disbelief and hatred against us . For we are to have one country , all of whose children shall repeat in unison its noble creed , which the features of the land itself proclaim , and whose railroads and telegraphs are its running-hand . How often we have enumerated and deprecated the evils of war ! The Mexican War , in which Slaver ) r herself involved us , ( using the power of the Republic against which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extol the benefits of peace , and to draw up a formidable indictment against the spirit which lusted for the appeal to arms . We have not lusted for it , and the benefits of peace seem greater than ever ; but the benefits of equity and truth seem greater than all . Show me justice , or try to make me unjust , - force upon me at the point of the sword the unspeakable degradation of abetting villany , and I will seize the hilt , if I can , and write my protest clear with the blade , and while I have it in my hand I will reap what advantages are possible in the desolation which it makes . yAmong these advantages of a war wa*ed to secure the rights of citizenship to all souls will be the excitement of a national intellectual life , which will take on the various forms of a national literature . This is to be expected for two reasons . First , because our arms will achieve unity . By this is meant not only that there will he a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual agreement in great political and moral ideas , but also that this very consent ivill bring the diA // ferent characteristic groups of the country so near together , in feeling and mutual appreciation , and with a free interchange of traits , that we shall begin to have a nationality . And there can he no literature until there is a nation ; when the varieties of the popular life begin to coalesce , as all sections are drawn together towards the centre of great political ideas which the people themselves establish , there will be such a rich developmerit of intellectual action as the Old World has not seen . Without this unity , literature may be cultivated by cliques of men of talent , who are chiefly stimulated to express themselves by observing the thought and beauty which foreign intellects and past times produced ; but their productions will not spring from the country 's manifold life , nor express its mighty individuality . The sections of the country which are nearest to the intelligence of the Old World will furnish the readiest writers and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World by its unity , and inspires the best brains with the collected richness of the popular heart . Up to the period of this war the country 's most original men have been those who , by protesting against its evils and displaying a genius enianc ipated from the prescriptions of Church and State , have prophesied the revolution , and given to America the first rich foretaste of her growing mind . The thunder rolled up the sky in the orator 's great periods , the lightning began to gleam in the preacher 's nioral indignation , the glittering steel slumbered uneasily and showed its half-drawn menace from the subtle lines of poets and essayists who have been carrying weapons these twenty years ; their souls thirsted for an opportunity to rescue fair Liber - ty from the obscene rout who had her in durance for their purposes , and to hail her accession to a lawful throne with the rich gifts of knowledge , use , and beauty , a homage that only free minds can pay , and only when freedom claims it . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have furnished convenient food for the people : there has been no lack of books , nor of the ambition to attempt all the intellectual forms . Some of this pabulum was not good for a growing frame ; the excuse for offering it may he found in the exir*encies of squatter-life . We are a notable people for our attachment to the frying-pan , and there is no doubt that it is a shifty utensil : it can he slung at the saddle-bow or carried in a valise , it will bear the jolting of a corduroy road , and furnish a campmess in the minimum of time out of material that was perhaps but a moment before sniffing or pecking at its rim . A very little blaze sets the piece of cold fat swimming , and the black cavity soon glows and splutters with extemporaneous content . But what dreams howl about the camp-fires , what hideous scalping-humor creeps from the leathery supper into the limbs arid blood of the adventurous pioneer l No better , and quite as scrofulous , has been the nourishment furnished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all directed against the highest good of the country 's mind , to offer sweets to its crying conscience , and draughts of fierce or languid cordials to lull the uneasy moods of this fast-growing child of Liberty . Such men are fabricators of smooth speech they have brought their gilding to put upon the rising pillars of the country , instead of strength to plant them firmly in their places and to spread the protecting roof . This period of storm will wash off their dainty work . When the clean grailite stands where it should to shelter the four-and-thirty States as they walk the vast colonnades together , intent upon the great interchanges of the country 's thought and work , this tinsel will not be missed ; as men look upon the grave lines that assure them of security , they will rejoice that the time for the truly beautiful has arrived , and hasten to relieve the solid space with shapes as durable as the imagination which conceives . There must be a great people before there can be a great character in its // books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is prophesied only in part by what is said and thought while the people is becoming great , and the molten constituents are sparkling as they run into their future form . We have been so dependent upon traditional ideas that we suppose an epic , for instance , to be the essential proof that a people is alive and has something to express . Let us cease to wonder whether there will ever be an American poem , an American symphony , or an American INovum Organon . It is a sign of weakness and subservience : and this is a period crowded with acts of emancipation . We can not escape from the past , if we would ; we have a right to inherit all the previous life of men that does not surfeit us and impede our proper work , but let us stop our unavailing sighs for Iliads . The newspaper gathers and circulates all true achievements faster than blind poets can plod round with the story . Th*e special form of the epic answered to a state of society when the harper connected cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went . Vibrations travel faster now ; men would be foolish to expect that the new life will go journeying in classic vehicles . When the imagination becomes free , it can invent forms equally surprising and better adapted to the face of the country . There is no part of this country which has not its broad characters and tendencies , different from anything ever seen before , imperfect while they are doomed to isolation , during which they show only a maimed and grotesque vitality . The religious tendency is different ; the humor is different , the imagination differs from anything beyond the Atlantic . And the East differs from the West , the North from the South ; and the Pacific States will have also to contribute gifts peculiar to themselves , as the silt of the Sacramento glitters unlike that of the Merrimac or the Potomac . We are not yet a People ; but we have great , vivid masses of popular life , which a century of literary expression will not exhaust . All these passionate characters are running together in this general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea in common , they are pervaded by their first really solemn feeling , they issue the same word for the night from East to West . The nationality thus commenced will introduce the tendency to blend in place of the tendency to keep apart , and each other 's gifts will pass sympathetically from hand to hand . The heightened life of this epoch is another cause which shall prepare a great development of intellectual forms . Excitement and enthusiasm pervade all classes of the people . All the primitive emotions of the human heart - friendship , scorn , sympathy , human and religious love - break into the liveliest expression , penetrate every quarter of society ; a great river is let loose from the rugged mountain-recesses of the people ; its waters , saturated with Nature 's simple fertility , cover the whole country , and will not retire without depositing their renewing elements . A sincere and humble people is feeling the exigency . A million families have fitted out their volunteers with the most sumptuous of all equipments , which no Government could furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses and farewells , and prayers more heaven - denying than a time of peace can breathe . What an invisible cloud of domestic pathos overhung for a year the course of the Potomac , and settled upon those huts and tents where the best part of home resided I what an ebb and flow of letters , bearing solemnity and love upon their surface ! what anxiety among us , with all its brave housekeeping shifts , to keep want from the door while labor is paralyzed , and the strong arms have beaten their ploughshares into swords ! What self-sacrifice of millions of humble wives and daughters whose works and sorrows are now refining the history of their country , and lifting the popular nobleness : they are giving all Ikat they are to keep their volunteers in the field . The flag waves over no such faithfulness ; its stars sparkle not like this sincerity . // The feeling and heroism of the women are enough to refresh and to remould the generation .
