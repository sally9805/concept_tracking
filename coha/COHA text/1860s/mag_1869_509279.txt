txt GRANT ON THE BATTLE-FIELD . TIlE empire of Jefferson Davis , in the autumn of 1861 , seemed as firmly established and as powerful as if it had endured for centuries . It rose like an exhalation , and dazzled or blinded the eyes of Europe , if not America . Its territory reached from the Potomac to the Rio Grande ; it was larger than any European kingdom except Russia . All over this magnificent domain a fertile soil produced two great staples of the world , and it was confidently expected that Norfolk and New Orleans would soon be filled with the fleets of every land . Its people , linked together by a terrible bond , were believed to be united . Its armies , well appointed and armed , and flushed with victory , with the capture of Sumter , the easy fall of Norfolk , the battle of Bull Run , hung like a cloud over the border , and threatened Baltimore and St. Louis . Except the North , it had no enemy . The western powers of Europe opened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave a hearty welcome to the new-born nation . They evidently believed that the days of chivalry and tyranny were come again . Can- // ada and Mexico lent it a natural sympathy . And even in the divided North there were thousands who rejoiced in the success of its Sontliera rival , who strove to confound the Northern plans , to hum New York , to surprise Washington , and awaken a terrible anarchy in the loyal fragment of the Union . It is not wonderful , therefore , that a sense of exultation and of security at this moment filled the councils of the conspirators ; that they presumed to treat as equals with the Court of the Tuileries and the Cahinet of Washington . For the latter , indeed , they entertained only a dignified contempt . Youthful Talleyrands from South Carolina , demi-savages from the backwoods of Mississippi , repudiators from Virginia , hrigands from Texas , united in looking with polished scorn upon the fallen Government at Washington . Even to sagacious hut timid men the contest seemed already hopeless ; to European thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they exclaimed , " can your armies , even had you an army , hope to subdue a country of such an immense extent , occupied hy a united and hostile people , filled with strong strategical positions , and defended hy some of the best soldiers in the world ? How can you presume to hlockade thousands of miles of sea-coast with your insignificant navy ? or whence can your bankrupt and creditless Government , whose bonds are unsalahle in London and Paris , obtain the vast resources of money or material necessary to an offensive war It seemed , indeed , a most perilous undertaking . Our soldiers , fresh from the labors of peace , were to encounter dangers and trials seldom equaled in the annals of warfare . They were to make marches longer than that of Hannibal to Italy or Napoleon to Moscow . They were to encounter a climate , in their campaigns and sieges , which was thought malarious and fatal even to the natives . They toiled amidst swamps and fens on the coast of south Carolina and the banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever hospital or the negro hut . They were about to invade a powerfnl nation and conquer it upon its own soil . Yet it was asserted that no free people had ever been effectually subdued , and that the South would prove as obstinate and unconquerable as Switzerland had been to Austria or Spain to Napoleon . The project of blockade seemed even less likely to prove successful . Our fleet was then chiefly a collection of merchant vessels , many of them only fitted for river navigation , many altogether unseaworthy . Our brave soldiers and seamen ventured out upon the ocean in frail steamers that must sink in the first storm , or be disabled by a random shot . Was it credible that England would recognize such a blockade ? England was then in all the pride of her maritime strength . She ruled the waves almost as in the days of Rodney or Nelson . Her immense fleets hung threateningly over our shores , and no one could foresee that in the course of a few short months the invention of a gifted engineer was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and a thousand other discouragements the question arose all over the land , " Can we conquer the rebellion ? " He who aided more than any other man in giving a satisfactory reply was General Grant . Yet it would be improper not to admit that the preservation of the Union in those dark and hopeless days rested in great part upon the firmness and discretion of President Lincoln , Mr. Seward , and their admirable coadjutors . To these men the people looked with confidence and affection ; to theta the nation intrusted cheerfully its boundless treasures of men and money ; in their hands it confided its destiny . And never was a trust better fulfilled . Honest of purpose , true of heart , Lincoln and his Cabbiet labored through the darkest hours of the war in almost hostile Washington , surrounded by traitors and assassins , weighed down by cares and toils , yet always cheerful , hopeful , corpposed . When others faltered they stood firm ; when many desponded they were ever full of hope ; they ruled ' the whirlwind and controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearts of their countrymen . But to Grant was committed the executive part of the undertaking . lIe was to direct the immense power of the nation to the final suppression of the rebellion . He was the first to break through the imaginary frontier of the great Confederacy ; to prove its weakness or to test its strength ; to check the vainglorious exultation of the rebels by a series of disastrous defeats ; to pass on from victory to victory ; to find all his plans fulfilled by pertinacity and vigor ; with Sherman and Sheridan , Thomas and M'Pherson , and many another brave companion in arms , by sea and land , to conquer a country more extensive than the empire of Napoleon in its proudest days ; often more wild and difficult of access than was Gaul to the legions of C*sar ; to answer , in fact , to the satisfaction of Europe and America , the question , " Can the Union be restored . ? " At the opening of the war Grant* , who had already won distinction on the battle-fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was soon made Colonel ' of an Illinois regiment . He was next placed in command at Cairo , an important post at the junction of the Ohio and the Mississippi , having been commissioned as Brigadier - General of Volunteers . His first military act in this command was one that was attended by a most important result : it secured Kentucky to the Union side . This powerful State had at first professed a haughty neutrality . Its rebel Governor rejected with scorn the appeal of President Lincoln for aid in suppressing the rebellion ; and the conspirators no doubt counted upon *tting the control of Kentucky , and thus commanding the navigation of the Ohio . General Polk , the warlike bishop , entered the State , began to fortify Columbus and Hickman , and // qwq at will , and suffered the successful invaders to retire unharmed . Grant 's men were proud of their victory , of their leader , of themselves ; and the " Belmont men , " as they were called , were ever afterward distinguished for daring in the Western campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time was that it prevented the enemy at Columbus from sending aid to the rebels in Missouri . They felt that in the presence of their active assailant at Cairo they could not venture to diminish their own forces . Once more the Union armies were in comparative inaction . McClellan commanded at Washington , Halleck had succeeded the brave Fremont at St. Louis ; and these excellent tactitians were inclined to a policy of delay . They wished to provide for every contingency . But Grant , the people , and the President were eager for action . The rebels , too , were by no means idle . Around Richmond and along the approaches to the Potomac they had collected a powerful army , commanded by an able and experienced chief ; and from their capital , which was now full of gayety , triumph , expectation , they looked with confidence to the approaching struggle . In the West they were equally hopeful . With a force of nearly a hundred thousand men they occupied a strategic line reaching from Columbus on the west to Bowling Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east . Columbus was defencied hy a strong force , and mounted one hundred and fifty guns on its powerful earth-works . It could only be taken by a long siege . At Bowling Green was gathered one of the finest armies of the Confederacy ; it threatened and almost commanded all Western Kentucky . In the centre of the rebel line ran two large rivers , the Cumberland and the Tennessee , which , coming from the heart of the rebel district , flow into the Ohio . About fifty miles below that river the Cumberland and the Tennessee approach within twelve miles of each other , near the Tennessee line ; and to guard their waters , as well as to preserve the connection between Columbus and Bowling Green , the Confederates had here erected two strong forts . On the banks of the Tennessee was Fort 1-lenry , with a lesser work , Fort Heiman , on the opposite side of the river . At a distance of twelve miles , on the Cumberland , was the still more powerful work , Fort Donelson . Both these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bowling Green and Columbus . The Union force destined to assail this line , collected under Halleck at St. Louis , Grant at Cairo , and Buell in Eastern Kentucky , can not in effective strength have been much superior to that of their opponents . Its commanders had the choice of three modes of attack : They might besiege Columbus ; they c7uld mass their strength against the Confederates at Bowling Green ; they might attack the forts on the rivers . Grant pressed the adoption of the latter plan . " With permission , " he telegraphed to Halleck on the 28th of January , 1862 , " I will take and hold Fort Henry . " Commodore Foote seconded his request , and on the 1st of February the necessary permission arrived ; on the 2d the expedition left Cairo . It consisted of seven gun-boats , partly ironclad , under Commodore Foote , and a land force of seventeen thousand men under General Grant . The rivers were swollen by the rains , and a large part of the country was under water ; the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the condition of the country ; the iron-clads , fierce monsters protected by their metallic hides from shot and shell , pressed up the hostile river , startling its banks with the hoarse panting of their engines , and arrived first before the fort . It was a series of field-works , the strongest being on the east side of the river , and mounting seventeen heavy guns . A garrison of twenty-eight hundred men , under the command of General Tilghman , defended the post . General Grant passed up in a steamer nuder the enemy 's fire to try the range of their guns , and then returned to hasten the advance of his army . Tilghman , in the mean time , fearful of being surrounded , had resolved to abandon his position , but awaited the attack of the navy in Fort Henry with just enough men to manage his gnus . Grant had ordered an immediate attack ; and on the 6th January at eleven o'clock his forces began to move up the river to the fort . While they were on their way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gun-boats under Commodore Foote steamed up and commenced a rapid fire upon Fort Henry* Tilghman 's guns replied with great vigor and effect ; a shot disabled the Essex , wounded its commander , Porter , and killed and wounded twenty-nine men . But very soon the fire of the fort was silenced ; Tilghman surrendered at discretion ; the greater part of the garrison escaped to Fort Donelson ; and when Grant arrived , half an hour afterward , he found himself the master of the powerful work . His plan having been thus far successful he next determined to take the companion fort on the Cumberland , and telegraphed at once to Halleck : " Fort Henry is ours ! I shall take and destroy Fort Donelson on the 8th . " But he was deceived . . The winter rains fell heavily ; the whole country was under water ; his army scarcely saved their baggage from the flood ; and it was not until the 12th that his main body of fifteen thousand men , the weather having cleared up , could move toward Donelson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that the enemy were gathering all their strength in defense of the fort . Foote led his shattered navy up the Cumberland , and a little after mid-day of the 12th Grant drove in the enemy 's pickets . His movement might seem almost rash in its daring . He was in the centre of the enemy 's grand strategic line . Behind him was Colnmhus , before him Donelson , // sustained by the abundant resources of Bowling Green . The force in the fort itself was greater than his own , and he was about to besiege a garrison superior to bis own army in *trength , defended by long lines of works that gave them every advantage for an attack . To an inexperienced eye Donelson would have seemed impregnable ; it was a series of intrencbments on the west bank of the Cumberland , seated on hills and rugged ground often over a hundred feet high , surrounding a lofty central fort that covered a hundred acres of ground . Fifteen heavy guns , with some carronades , armed this work ; below it , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrison numbered nearly , if not quite , twenty-one thousand men , and they were in open communication with Bowling Green , the centre of the rebel armies . Few , therefore , whether , military or civilian , thought iDonelson assailable in that period of doubt ; no one would have been surprised had Grant 's attack pi*oved another Ball 's Bluff and Edwards'sFerry . Meantime his brave soldiers , chiefly from Illinois , sat down in excellent order before the fort ; but at first all was disaster . A gallant attack had been made upon a rebel battery , without Grant 's orders , which failed . Brave Commodore Foote assailed the fort from the river with his shattered fleet , and was driven back with severe loss ; his gun-boats were rendered incapable of further service , and he himself was wounded . Grant looked eagerly for reinforcements that did not come . Suddenly the winter appeared in all its severity ; the nights were intensely cold ; men froze to death in the lines ; sharp tempests of sleet and snow on the night of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare ground , without tents or blankets , afraid to light fires lest they might prove marks for the enemy 's sharp-shooters . Yet , such was their ardor in their cause , their confidence in their commander , that men who had never slept out of comfortable homes , or felt the hardships of a campaign , now lay cheerfully on the frozen ground , with their arms at their side , and when the enemy attacked met them with the calm courage of veterans . At two o'clock in the morning of February 15 , 1862 , an eventful day , Grant was summoned by a message from the wounded Commodore to meet him on his flag-ship . He went before daylight . The force of the besiegers had been considerably reinforced , and now amounted to about twenty-one thousand men ; and the long line of Union troops lay on their arms , expecting a difficult siege , and looking almost hopelessly upon the well-fortified heights before them . But Grant 's energy and the increase of his army had filled the rebels with alarm . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pillow , Forrest , their chiefs , had met in council and planned to cut their way through the Union lines on this very morning when Grant was on the river . In the chill winter dawn the rebels massed their forces in one corner of their fort , and leaped down fiercely upon M'Clernand 's division , which was nearest the river bank on the south ; they hoped to break through the line by an overwhelming attack . But the Union troops , although surprised and driven back , behaved with singular resolution ; new regiments came up to the aid of their fellows ; a large part of the army was engaged ; and by nine o'clock the rebels , who had fought with the vigor of despair , had ceased to attack . Then Grant came riding in , and at once ordered an assault . C. F. Smith gallantly led the famous Iowa Second Infantry in two lines up a steep and thorny bill , broke the rebel lines at point of bayonet , ' and took possession of a position within their intrenchments that decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the works , M'Clernand and Wallace led their weary troops in a fresh charge against the enemy , recovered the ground they had lost in the morning , and closed up the avenue of retreat . Night came , and the battle ceased . The weary soldiers sank ha the cold ground to slumber . Smith and his companions slept on the frozen hill they had won ; Grant in a negro hut . But on that memorable night there was no repose for the rebel chiefs . They met in a secQnd council in their powerful strong-hold to debate , with fierce regrets and vain recrimination , the best planof escape . Floyd and Pillow resolved to abandon their troops and save themselves ; they made their way down the river in the night . Forrest waded through a half-frozen stream with his cavalry , and reached Nashville . Buckner was left in command , raised a white flag on Donelson , and sent a messenger to Grant asking for terms . Grant made his memorable reply : " No terms except unconditional surrender can be accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then Buckner yielded , and Donelson fell . Fourteen thousand prisoners , sixty-five guns , and a vast amount of stores and small-arms came to the victors , the command of two great rivers , and a pathway to the centre of the rebellion . A cheer rang out over the exultant North when the news flashed over the land . The spell of ill success seemed broken , and the name of Grant was a sound . of good omen . There had prevailed , indeed , among many at the North a superstition , coming down from the Middle Ages , that the industrial classes did not make good soldiers ; that men coming from the farm or the factory were incapable of self-defense ; that they must be the natural prey of the wild chivalry of the South , who had been accustomed to handle the bowie-knife or the pistol from boyhood , , and who , in their halfsavage country , had ruled over their fellowCitizens by brutal violence and noisy as*umption . It was this class that had driven the South into the war ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had conquered at Bull Run , and since then had never ceased / // GRANT ON THE BATTLE-FIELD. its vainglorious boasting . But now the gallant regiments just gathered from the farms and factories of Illinois and Iowa , led by one of their own men , had met the boasting chivalry ou less than equal terms , besieged a larger force than their own in a powerful fortress , beaten them in a moment of surprise , stormed their works , and forced them to surrender or to a disgraceful flight . It was the triumph of moral and mental vigor over vain pretense . It proved of what Northern soldiers were capable when well commanded . It showed that the vast preparations of the nation for suppressing the rebellion would not be in vain . But the results of the fall of Donelson still further awakened the enthusiasm of the people . They were such as no civilian could have anticipated . As Grant had foreseen , he had broken the enemy 's great strategic line : a chain of fortresses fell with Donelson . Bowling Green was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow ; Columbus , the impregnable fortress which commanded the Mississippi and threatened the Ohio , was deserted by its garrison ; Missouri was made secure ; Kentucky was freed from its invaders ; and the great State of Tennessee , larger than many a European kingdom , was again restored to the Union . Grant was now made a Major-General of Volunteers by President Lincoln and Secretary Stanton , and placed in command of a department that was not limited in extent to the southward . The nation looked to his future career with new hope . Several other successes meantime had increased the general confidence . In January , before the fall of the two forts , General George H. Thomas had won the battle of Mill Spring . General Butler and Commodore Striugham hnd begun a series of naval victories by a successful expedition against Hatteras Inlet ; Buruside captured Roanoke Island ; and finally Farragut and Butler , in April , 1862 , entered New Orleans . Again the North rang with hearty cheers as the gallant exploit of Farragut was told from man to man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churches offered thanksgiving , and peace seemed near . Grant 's next battle was at Shiloh ; a victory so signal that if he had been permitted to follow it up Vicksburg would have fallen , and the War might have had a speedier close . Yet such were the misrepresentations that were long allowed to hang over the result of this contest that many believed , both at the time and afterward , that Shiloh was an actual defeat of the Union army . Eager to press upon the enemy in the centre of their strength , Grant , at the head of a force of about thirty-three thousand men , had placed himself , in the first days of April , on the lower side of the Tennessee River , at Pittsburg Landing , near Shiloh . He knew that a superior force of the enemy was on his front , commanded by two of their best officers , A. S. Johnston and Beauregard , and had sent orders to General Buell to hasten up with his division to his aid . lie was eager to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive . On the 5th Buell 's forces , delayed on their march , had not yet arrived . The , enemy , who knew Grant 's weakness , resolved to crush him by a vigorous attack before his reinforcements came . The position of the Union army had been carefully selected ; it was protected on either side by two small rivers running into the Tennessee , and also on one of the sides by a deep ravine ; in front the ground was broken and thickly wooded , and here the enemy would be obliged to make his attack . Sherman 's division , and those of M'Clernand and Prentiss , were in advance , and on them the first fury of the battle fell . About daybreak of Sunday , the 6th of April , 1862 , Johnston , with from forty to fifty thousand men , threw himself upon the Union line , with a courage and resolution unturpassed in the history of the war . Ably led and managed , the enemy 's charge had all that spirit and fire which a bold attacking force always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press back the Union line almost by their physical strength alone . It happened , unfortunately , that Sherman s division was composed chiefly of new recruits who had never heard a shot fired in battle , and many of whom , as the danger drew near , fled shamefully in a panic*stricken.throng to the landing . A , part of Prentiss 's division also gave way ; and nothing but Sherman 's courage and skill could have atoned for this disaster . Wounded and feeble , he still rallied his faithful regiments , and , aided by M'Clernand , W. Wallace , Prentiss , and the other division commanders , presented a bold front to the foe . Slowly the Union , lines were driven back toward the river ; the carnage on both sides was fearful ; it was the most terrible fighting , Sherman said , that he had ever seen ; the brave rebel general , Johnston , fell on the battlefield , and Beauregard took his place ; but the Union lines were never broken , and as they retreated toward the river their faces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last fierce assault upon the ravine ; they saw their prey escaping , and they rushed with fierce shouts against the last defenses ; but the Union line stood unshaken ; the gun-boats from the river poured in their fire upon the foe , and they retreated . The battle lasted from daybreak until about five in the afternoon , during all which time Grant , Sherman , and their brave commanders and soldiers knew no repose . Grant was struck by a ball but not injured ; Sherman was slightly wounded ; General W. Wallace was killed ; General Prentiss , who acted with signal courage , was taken prisoner . The loss of the rebels was nearly if not quite equal to that of the Union army , except that the latter lost several thousand prisoners . It is a remarkable fact in the history of the first day 's battle that two divisions , numbering many thousand men , who were scarcely five miles from the battle-field , and who were or- // qwq armies of the Confederates , who kept open its communications and aided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi two other powerful and well-fortified posts-Grand Gulf and Port Hudson-also seated on high bluffs , formed part of its defenses , and the three fortresses mutually aided each other in commanding the navigation of the river and opening a connection with the western shore . On one point alone was Vicksburg vulnerable . Its supplies came chiefly from the interior of the State of Mississippi ; it was connected hy railroad with the capital , Jackson ; and if Grant could interpose his forces between that city and the fortress it must he starved into surrender . Hence his chief object in his long and painful campaign against Vicksburg was to bring his army below the city , destroy Jackson and the railroad , defeat the hostile forces , and approach Vicksburg from the south . Yet he seems not to have decided definitely upon this plan until he had fairly tested the strength of its fortifications on the upper side , and in December , 1862 , a combined attack was planned , by which Grant and Sherman were to advance in two strong columns from the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take it by assault . It is possible that under two such leaders such an attack might have proved successful . Grant advanced rapidly toward the rear of Vicksburg , and drove the enemy under Van iDorn before him ; Pemherton had fallen hack to Canton , a few miles above Jackson ; Grant sent orders to Sherman to move , when suddenly there occurred one of those unaccountable disasters in military affairs which so often disconcert the wisest plans . Holly Springs , a town on Grant 's line of communication in his rear , although carefully fortifled and garrisoned by a thousand men , was surprised and captured by a cavalry force of the enemy nuder Van Dorn . Colonel Murphy , its commander , a.lthough he knew of the approaching dander , made no preparations for resistance . He was afterward dismissed the army for his misconduct , but his cowardice had defeated for the time the plan of a combined assault . An immense amount of stores had been destroyed at Holly Springs ; the subsistence of the army was cut off ; for nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , and he was obliged to move hack to Holly Springs , where , by December 23 , he established his head-quarters . When Pemberton , the rebel general , heard of Grant 's retreat he threw himself into the defenses of Vicksbtirg and awaited the approach of Sherman . This bold leader , at the head of about forty thousand men , descended the Mississippi from Memphis , hoping to take the fortress by assault while Pemberton 's army was employed in opposing Grant ; and he little suspected , as he prepared to make his vigorous charge against the fortified bluffs on the Yazoo , that they were defended by a force as large , if not larger than his own . His brave soldi&amp;s landed hopefully in swamps and quicksands ; amidst deep ravines , wild shrubbery , and a region overflowed by the rising river ; threw themselves with Western energy against the fortified hill-sides ; waded fighting to the enemy 's intrenchments through bayous three feet deep , with bottoms of shifting sand ; captured several positions ; fell thickly before the crossfire of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn in calm array . It was another " charge of the six hundred . " The attempt was hopeless , and on the second of January , 1863 , Sherman led his shattered expedition to the transports and passed out of the Yazoo . Nothing could now exceed the joy of the rebels . To foil Grant and Sherman , whose merits they at least had perceived ; to drive back the famofis Western soldiers whose vigor they had so often felt from Donelson to Juka ; to prove the invincibility of their great fortress in the West , completed that proud self-confidence with which they had beheld the discomfiture of the Army of the Potomac , and the terror with which Bragg 's march to Louisville had filled Ohio and Pennsylvania . The close of the year 1862 left the Confederates victors on every field . In politics the opposition party had won the elections at the North , and seemed ready to embarrass the Government by its unfriendly policy . European writers , in laborious essays in leading reviews , showed with the utmost clearness that the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a benefit to mankind ; France stretched out a velvet hand to save Mexico from the general conflagration ; England greiv rich by blockade-running , privateers , and the splendid prospects of the Confederate Loan ; while her wonderful Lancashire operatives starved rather than lend aid to the cause of slavery , and thus saved us a decade of war ; and again embassadors from Richmond were in close correspondence with the busy diplomatists of western Europe . At this moment of confusion in our national affairs , when the Government was unpopular and tottering , the country divided , the national credit nearly gone , all our armies retreating , the enemy on the advance , whose hand could stay the wave of ill success ? Statesmanship was no longer of any avail ; it could create but not command armies . Poetry , oratory , history , philosophy , were powerless to avert the ruin of a nation . Intellect had ceased to be sufficient , except intellect of the rarest form . We wanted an Epaminondas rather than a I ) emosthenes  --  a Scipio rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword . Grant still hovered over Vicksburg . If his attack had failed in the north he had still various other plans by which to assail the haughty fortress . His aim from January , 1863 , was to turn its batteries , to transport his fleet and army to the south , to cut off Vicksburg from its resources , and inclose it with his gallant troops . In all his laborious efforts to accomplish this design he was assisted with unfaltering energy by Coinmodore // Porter and his admirable officers and crews . He had , too , ever at his side Sherman and M'Pherson , his devoted aids ; and his gallant army , disciplined by trial , moved with the precision of a machine in every path of duty . From January , 1863 , to July 4 the campaign against Vicksburg was pressed with a resolution that , in the face of a thousand difficulties , finally led on to success . The first method proposed for getting below the city was the famous canal . Opposite the bluffs of Vicksburg the Mississippi pursues so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula , hardly more than a mile in width , projecting far into the river . It was plain that if a canal could be cut across this neck of land , beyond the reach of the guns of the fortress , the stream might be turned from its usual channel , Vicksburg be left far in the front , and Grant 's army be carried down the river in transports to any point below that might afford a favorable landing . The design seemed very attractive . President Lincoln was anxious to have it tried . Grant never had approved of it ; but in order to keep his soldiers from idleness he consented to go on with the work . Thousands of men were employed in January and February in enlarging or improving the canal begun by General Williams ; the river was rising , and tall levees were raised to protect the workmen ; the canal slowly advanced . It struck the general attention . New York and Washington watched its slow progress . The rebels in Vicksburg ridiculed it , and sometimes threw shells among thc laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising new batteries on the Yicksburg shore that wholly commanded its outlet . At length , on the 8th of March , a rapid rise in the river took place ; the embankments on the peninsula g4ve way ; the waters flowed in wild inundation over the western shore ; and workmen and soldiers fled in terror to the higher ground . The famous canal had now perfectly failed . Several other projects for opening a free navigation through the low and marshy country around Vicksburg were tried by Grant and his accomplished engineer , M'Pherson , chiefly , probably , for the purpose of giving employment to his men during the season of high water , when no movement of the army could be made across the inundated lowlands . One was the Lake Providence route , which was intended to unite all the bayous , rivers , and swamps on the west side of the Mississippi through Louisiana , and thus to divert the course of the river to a new channel which would have left both Vicksburg and New Orleans far in the inland ; another , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior rivers . But Grant had little confidence in any of these projects . He had already resolved upon a bold plan for his future campaign , which all these apparently uselcss labors served to cover from his opponents . Meantime various daring and successful attempts had been made by Coinmodore Porter 's naval force to pass the batteries at Vicksburg , which were of signal service in producing the fall of the city . On the night of the 16th of April the fleet was prepared for a general attcmpt to get below the enemy . Porter 's seven iron-clads were to engage the batteries , while a fleet of river steamers , protected by cotton-bales , and manned by volunteers from the army , were to run the gauntlet of fifteen miles of continuous fire . The night was dark ; the flotilla nioved silently down the river ; Porter , in the Benton , led the way . Grant watched the movement from a transport above the bend . But suddenly the enemy discovered the leading vessels , and a shower of shot and shell poured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed into the awful pass . The river was lighted up by the flash of an incessant cannonade ; the enemy set fire to houses on the shore in order to guide their aim , and the light , bright as day , streamed over the waters . Every object was visible , and the brave voyagers saw as they passed the soldiers in Vicksburg training the guns that were to hail death and wounds upon their helpless vessels . At length , about midnight , the ships were opposite the centre of the city , and here every shot from the hostile shore took effect . Every vessel was struck in the awful rain of the most destructive missiles ; the sides of the strongest iron-clads were crushed in ; rigging was torn to pieces , smoke-pipes riddled , vessels pierced from side to side ; the transport Henry Glay took fire and floated down the river , a blazing beacon of evil omen to the army encamped below . For two hours and forty minutes the fleet was exposed to the merciless fire ; but slowly the shattered vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempt was successful beyond expectation ; the blazing fires burned out ; the batteries ceased to roar ; and silence and darkness once more settled upon the beleaguered city . Not long after this brave exploit a number of barges and steamers made their way past the batteries ; yet it is certain that there never was a bolder act than the attempt to pass the cannon of Vicksburg . Grant , thus aided by a po*verful flect , had now unfolded the plan of his campaign . lie was about to move his army down the Louisiana side of the Mississip*ii , cross the river at some favorable point , and throw himself in the midst of the enemy 's country . But in the mean time his long and apparently useless delay before Vicksburg had sunk him low in the public esteem . His slow movements , the failure of his canals and other devices , disappointed the people . They looked for rapid succes , and could not wait for the slow progress of a great design . President Lincoln , too , seems to have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that he had ivasted his fine army in useless labors , and that its strength and hope were gone . It was even proposed to remove this unlucky commander , and put M'Clernand , Hunter , Fremont , or MeClel // lan in his place . But now Grant pursued a course of conduct which seems to have been still less in accordance with the usual tactics of the time . lie led his fine army , with infinite toil , through the swamps and wild-woods of Louisiana , on the . west side of the Mississippi ; crossed again below Grand Gulf to the Mississippi shore , and , with a force of only thirty thousand men , vuarched into the hostile country . But of these thirty thousand every man was a soldier , bound to his chief by the subtle bond of perfect trust . Sherman and M'Pherson were with him ; and he did not fear to encounter twice his own numbers ; he was now certain of success . It would he impossible to enumerate all the rare achievements of this band of heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the corn and beef of the fertile country . They were in perfect health and vigor , and felt as if they could march over Vicksbnrg , said one of them , to the Mississippi . They threw themselves between two powerful armies ; defeated them separately ; turned and captured the powerful works at Grand Gulf ; took and destroyed Jackson , the capital of Mississippi ; routed Pemberton at the well-contested battle of Champion 's Hill ; and finally drove his dismayed and shattered army within the walls of Yicksburg . All this was done within twenty days . Haines 's Bluff and the strong defenses of the rebels on the Yazoo fell . into Grant 's jhands , and his triumphant army of heroes advanced at once upon Vicksburg itself . The true siege of the city now began . High over the attacking army arose a range of hills fortified with a skill seldom equaled in the annals of war : covered with cannon , lined with a maze of intrenchments , inclosing three lofty fortifications , each in itself apparently an impregnable castle . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its rear was so protected by deep ravines , gullies , and sandy precipices that no force could approach it except in scattered parties . It was defended by a garrison of more than thirty thousand men , who had resolved to give their lives to the preservation of a post which now seemed the keystone of the Confederacy . Never were there braver men , never more devoted women , than those who now occupied the fated city . Johnston , after the loss of Haines 's Bluff , had ordered Pemberton to abandon Vickshurg ; but the latter refused to obey . His soldiers were confident that they could maintain their position until they had received aid from the Eastern armies . Pemberton , resolved to stand a siege , gave directions to the inhabitants to leave the city ; but they said they desired to remain and share in all the dangers of bombardment and assault . Grant , hoping to take the city by storm , had ordered a general attack on the 19th of May , which failed . On the 22d , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet . The vessels opened a bombardment which lasted through the morning ; the land batteries encircled the city with a girdle of fire . At length Grant 's whole army , led by its brave chiefs , advanced up the hills and strove to break the enemy 's lines ; but each corps recoiled before the fatal strength of the rebel position , and was forced to retire with great loss . It was a most disastrous check , and the commander had evidently counted too much upon the dismay and discouragement of the rebels . It was evident that they were about to fight with the vigor of despair for the command of the Mississippi . Grant , therefore , prepared for a long siege . His army , weak in numbers , but not disheartened , began to erect a line of intrenchments around Vicksburg , reaching from Haines 's Bluff on the Yazoo , once so formidable to Sherman , to the Mississippi and Porter 's fleet on the south . The hot summer came on ; the land was parched and dusty ; the weary soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised success . But their labors were redoubled by the danger that threatened their rear . It should be remembered that at the moment when Grant entered the hostile country around Vicksburg the Confedei ate ar mies were triumphant in the East . Bragg , is true , slowly retreated before Rosecrans , but it was only to fix himself at Chattanooga ; he was luring his opponent to his destruction . On the Potomac all was ruin and disaster to the Union arms . Lee was pressing on toward Pennsylvania ; each Union commander had suffered some severe defeat , and the public had lost confidence in its armies ; the crisis of the war was at hand , and many discouraged Unionists even talked of submission and peace . At such a moment Grant was in the heart of the Confederacy , surroupded by a hostile population , besieging a fortress garrisoned by a force not much less than his own , far from his supplies , cut off from a retreat , and conscious that he must enter Yicksburg or suffer a disastrous defeat . Meanwhile in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their best Generals , who was ready for any desperate effort to break the siege . Grant felt that his position was full of danger . A combined attack from the fortress and the skillful Johnston might at any moment be looked for ; Davis might send on from triumphant Richmond a force sufficient to overwhelm him ; Bragg might defeat Roseerans and rush to the aid of Vicksburg . All around him the enemy were stirring . Milliken 's Bend was attacked ; in Louisiana hostile forces threatened the opposite shore ; and Grant , although his army had gradually increased to sixty thousand men , had yet drawn in his rear a powerful line of intrenebments , extending from Haines 's Bluff to Black River , that shielded him from sudden attack . Like the Romans at Capun , he was inclosed in a series of wonderful works equally formidable both in front and rear . Johnston never ventured to attack him , and lingered , like Hannibal , vainly hoping for an unguarded moment or a strategical mistake . // qwq of the rebels . Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range encircling Chattanooga on the south and east ; while on the west he had seized upon Lookout Mountain , a high peak piercing the clouds , that inclosed in that direction the unfortunate Union army . Below this mountain ran the Nashville Railroad , the only line of communication open to Rosecrans , and this Bragg commanded by his guns on Lookout , and held with his troops . From his post on Missionary Ridge the rebel chief looked down exultingly on his prey below , now and then threw shell into their enca*pment , hut resolved to await the effect of famine and starve them into surrender or flight . The only means by which Rosecrans could obtain any supplies was a rude mountain road over the Tennessee hills in front , hut this was soon found to he almost impassable . The Union soldiers were reduced to half-rations ; famine preyed upon them , and they awaited faint and feeble for the inevitalde moment of surrender . A general exultation filled the South when the news of the impending fate of the invading army was told . Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jefferson Davis came down from Richmond to gaze with joy from Missionary Ridge upon the starving army at his feet . New York and Washington watched with helpless alarm the condition of their brave troops , and dreaded a disaster that would more than atone for ' the fall of Vicksburg and the conquest of Mississippi . One man alone was thought capable of saving Chattanooga . As in the days of romance , when some single knight of rare renown rode into the gallant tournament , and by his sole address and vigor , restoring the victory to his fallen colors , heat down aFtont de Bceuf or a Bois de Guilbert , so men instinctively believed that if Grant were ' in the beleaguered lines the starving army might yet he saved . But he to whom the nation thus turned in its distress was now lying maimed and bruised upon a bed of pain . At a review at New Orleans Grant had been thrown from his horse and severely injured ; He spoke , indeed , of his accident with his usual hopefulness ; he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of his country . But for twenty days he was confined ta his bed ; and when , in the pressing need of the moment , he came too early from his chamber he was still a cripple , scarcely able to move . He was now at the head of all the armies west of the Alleghanies , and his weary brain and feeble frame were weighed down by the care of a nation 's destiny . Grant , as soon as he could act or move , seat word to Thomas not to give up Chattanooga . " I will hold it , " replied the modern Ajax , " until I starve . " Soon Grant came to East Tennessee , pressed down with a small attendance to the mountains , and in his crippled state made his way over the almost impassable defiles . Often he was carried in the arms of his men over ravines and broken places ; often the faithful soldiers bore in their arms not C*usar 's destiny but that of freedom . At length he entered Chattanooga . The rain fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in pain ; and when he came to the camp he was met by throngs of famished and despoading soldiers who had long lost hope . Above him rose the line of encircling mountains , apparently too steep for even the curious traveler to ascend ; along their top he saw the flags and pickets of an army greater than his own . His provisions , notwithstanding all the economy used , were nearly gone ; ammunition was scarce ; he was hemmed in on every side ; his horses and mules were nearly all dead ; his artillery useless ; and his feeble soldiers , pallid with fevers , hunger , and despair , seemed wholly incapable of making a last effort for safety . The maimed commander , the famished army , were objects of ridicule and almost pity to their triumphant enemies on Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge . Why Bragg did not attack while his opponents were thus enfeebled can scarcely be im ' - agined . Ho might , one would suppose , have swept them easily from their low ground with his superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in awe . Perhaps he shrank from coming down to meet the two renowned leaders on equal terms . But his opportunity was soon to slip from his grasp . Grant saw at once that his soldiers must have food . Three days after his arrival , on the 26th of October , a flotilla of sixty pontoon boats sailed in the dark and foggy night down the Tennessee . They were to seize the Lookout Valley , and strike the enemy in an unguarded point ; Hooker co-operated with the hold movement ; every link in the strategic sally was well preserved , and after a fierce battle with Longstreet at Wauhatchie the valley was won  --  the army was safe . Supplies at once poured in , and the baffled enemy saw with rage and amazement his blockade completely broken by a brilliant stroke of strategic skill . Grant 's army was now gradually reinforced until it amounted to sixty thousand men . Hooker had brought ten thousand tried soldiers from the battle-fields of the Potomac , eager to prove their courage in a new campaign . Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas had . thirty thousand . They were soldiers unsurpassed in any land ; they were led by men who had no superiors in the art of war ; and Grant , who knew their merits , now resolved to test them by an unprecedented effort . He proposed to charge the enemy on their mountfiins , to clamber up the precipitous sides of Lookout and Missionary Ridge , in the face of powerful intrenchmeats , long lines of artillery , the fire of countless muskets  --  to fight a battle of giants on the top of the Cumberland range . Fortunately Bragg , secure in his powerful works and his inaccessible position , had never suspected that his opponent would venture upon so hopeless an attempt . He had even weakened his army by sending off a large force to aid in crushing Burnside , who was now hard pressed // in Eastern Tennessee . He had but forty-five thousand left , but he no doubt supposed that the advantages of his situation were a full compensation for the superior numbers of his foes . What commander , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great army on their tops ? The attempt would be madness ; a hundred men on Missionary Ridge seemed equal to a thousand on the plain below . Grant seized upon the fortunate moment and prepared to profit by the error of his adversary . Hooker was to scale the rough sides of Lookout , Sherman to attack the north extremity of Missionary Ridge , and Thomas , in the centre , to advance up the mountain to the heart of the enemy 's defenses . On the morning of the 23d of November Thomas moved out of the Union lines at the head of twenty thousand men , and so little did the enemy look for any hostile movement that they gazed down with curiosity and admiration at the splendid array of the Union forces on the plain below , believing it to be nothing more than a morning parade . All around the magnificent amphitheatre of mountains and crags the rebel pickets leaned on their muskets and watched at case the glittering host as it passed beyond its intrenchments . Suddenly the rattle of musketry roused them from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first lines and captured all theh* defenses below Missionary Ridge . Sheridan *s there , now for the first time fighting undd* 1Grant 's eye ; Thomas had planted himself firmly on the front ; and alt bough the cannon roared " from the hostile heights , and sharp showers of musketballs fell on either side , yet the Union forces intrenched themselves safely in the lines they had won , and that night slept on their arms , prepared for a wonderful achievement the next morning . Meanwhile Sherman had led his forces along the opposite side of the river , hidden in a kind of ambush , had toiled through unlooked-for difficulties in that wild region , crossed safely over to the north side of Missionary Ridge , driven in the enemy 's advance , and by the evening of the 24th had fixed himself firmly on the coveted position . A thick mist hid his movements in a friendly veil until his right had formed a connection with Howard 's corps of the central army . Thus the Union forces on the morning of the 25th formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrenched on Missionary Ridge and threatened Bragg 's right wing . But in the interval a wonderful contest had been going on along the declivities of Lookout Mountain . It was the Battle among the Clouds . hooker on the 24th led out his forces from the Lookout Valley . lie had ten thousand men , partly from the Army of the Potomac . It was their appointed part in the great drama to climb the precipitous sides of the Eagle 's Nest , now defended by a force of seven thousand of the encray , and to plant their flag upon its topmost peak ; they performed it without a single repulse . The mountain is steep , thickly wooded , and broken by huge crags that project like battlements amidst the masses of rich foliage . Half-way up its side is a plateau of amble land which was defended by redans , rifle-pits , and all the resources of military art . Its peak shoots up a huge crest of rock , the favorito signal post of the enemy . Heavy mists hung around the mountain as the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to sight from the plain below , and only the flash and rattle of musketry breaking through the clouds announced their gradual advance . At length Geary , who led the Potomac men , creeping over ledges and boulders , breaking their way through wild forests never troilden by human* step , often under the muzzles of the enemy 's guns , emerged on the plateau where the rebel intrenebments were strongest . A sharp battle at once began ; the enemy were driven on all sides ; and at length , about two o'clock , when a dense mass of clouds had enveloped the combatants in darkness , Hooker could announce to his commander that the mountain was won . Yet all night long the flashes of musketry glittered along the wild sides of Lookout , and the rebel signal-fires on the peak , which had not been occupied , were seen announcing to Bragg their danger and defeat . In the night they abandoned the mountain . The next morning ( the 25th ) broke bright and cold , and the November sun shone over the mountains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary Ridge . Before him rose the tall mountain range , on which could he seen , glittering in the sunlight , the ba*onets of nearly fifty thousand practiced soldiers , trained in mountain warfare . In the centre was Bragg 's head-quarters , along the crest of the hills ran lines of earth-works and felled trees ; and the open mouths of thirty heavy cannon , besides lesser artillery , threatened death to the bold assailant who should . attempt to climb the height . The Union army , the rebel works no longer hid in mist , came out in bold distinctness on that fair November day , and the two commanders watched each other 's motions from their elevated stations , prepared for the final shock . Meantime at dawn Sherman 's guns were heard on the northern side of the Ridge , and from daylight until noon that active leader was slowly pressing on along the mountains to cut Bragg off from his base of supplies at Chickamauga . He was as yet fighting the , battle alone ; for Hooker had not arrived to attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the centre nuder Thomas had not stirred , Bragg about three o'clock weakened his centre by sending a large force to cut off Sherman . Grant saw the opportunity . hooker was now coming up , and the commander , swift to seize his moment of attack , ordered a general charge up the hill . Never was there such a charge . The Army of the ' Cumnberland , which had all day been chained behind its intrenchinents like a dangerous mastiff , and had heard with impatience the bold advance of Sherman , now broke into a run up the steep // declivity , swept over intrenchments and riflepits , drove the frightened enemy out of their defenses , and with a wild shout followed them so closely that they had no time to pause . Sheridan , who led the way , looked hack and saw a huge mass of hayonets glittering in the sunlight , and swelling like a wave up the mountain-side . Even he describes the spectacle as terrific . But to the enemy the charge was fatal . In vain they poured down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel ; in vain their musketry flashed from every side . The thick hue of the Army of the Cumberlaud never wavered nor paused ; where they could not run they climbed or crept ; they refused to stop even at the command of their officers , and , moved hy the instinct of victory , drove the enemy in wild flight before them to the very crest of the Ridge . Here they swept over the powerful intrenchments , shot down the gunners at their cannon , captured whole regiments of panic-stricken soldiers , and broke in six places those lines which had so long frowned upon them in the valley of the Eagle 's Nest . There was now victory all along the line . Hooker , Sherman , Thomas , had been successful . Bragg fled , leaving six thousand prisoners and all his guns , and was closely pursued by Sheridan aud Sherman . The news of the great victory was flashed over the country ; again the name of Grant was uttered with gratitude by every loyal tongue ; thanksgiving was offered in the churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged an immediate advance on Mobile , and again was rebuked for his imprudence . But the people now acknowledged their leader ; they began to reflect upon Belmont and Paducab , Donelson , Shilob , Vicks-. burg , Chattanooga , and they felt that a military genius had arisen who saw what other men could not see , and who possessed the intellect , force , and ingenuity necessary to carry out his own conceptions . The President sent Grant his honest congratulations ; Congress voted him thanks ; Buruside was saved ; the cotton States lay open to the Union forces ; and at length nothing remaiued of the rebellion hut that central power which had so long ruled at Richmond , sustained by the military skill of Lee . The contest now grew in epic interest as those two renowned commanders , who had been for three years giving battle successfully to their various opponents , and who had been almost equally victorious in every encounter , who were the acknowledged leaders of the North and the South , and on whose single prowess seemed to rest the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their last campaign . General Grant had been placed at the head of all the Union forces , and now directed the movements of an army of nearly one million of men . But from this number onethird must be subtracted for absences , sickness , and various other causes , leaving the whole number of Union forces on duty not far from seven hundred thousand . Of these he had about one hundred and fifty thousand for offensive operations against General Lee at Richmond , besides the forces in Western Virginia and North Carolina . This immense army was well supplied with arms , food , and all the last improvements in the military art ; it wa* admirably officered by Meade , Hancock , Warren , and Sedgwick . Sheridan commanded a fine body of ten thousand cavalry ; and the army which General Grant led out from Washington in May , 1864 , has scarcely been surpassed in efficiency by that of any commander in history . It was the magnificent result of the direction of all the energies of the people of the North to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had but sixty thousand men . His soldiers were no doubt excellent , but he had no subordinate officers equal to Meade and Hancock , Sheridan and Sedgwick . He was probably limited in his supplies of the munitious of war , and the succession of disasters to the Confederate arms had thrown a shade of discouragement over those gallant spirits who still sustained with desperate courage their falling cause . Yet Lee had his own peculiar advantages . It is a well-known principle in warfare that an army within a range of fortifications is held to be capable of resisting a force greatly superior to itself for an unlimited period ; indeed , the only mode of conquering an intrenched army , well-commanded , is by turning its flank and cutting off its supplies . But with so brilliant and daring a strategist as Lee this would necessarily prove a most difficult and hazardous operation , since he might at any moment choose his mode of attack , and direct all his strength against any weak point in the advancing line of his opponent . The country around Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . It was in many places a thick wilderness , covered by almost impenetrable woods ; in others protected by rivers , swamps , ahd morasses overgrown with wild vegetation . The Confederate leader was familiar with all the paths that led through this difficult country , and was prepared to strike his foe when he was least conscious of his danger ; nor could any hostile army approach Riehmond without being broken up by the nature of the ground into separate detachments , and exposed to the irresistible onset of an active assailant . Thus , while Grant had the advantage of superior numbers and greater resources , his opponent retained a certain superiority in his almost impregnable position . Richmond was , in fact , assailable only from the south , where ltly its lines of supplies ; and so long as these remained open it could defy any force that might attack it on any other side . Grant 's plan , therefore , from the first had been to cross the James River , and place himself below the hostile city ; but before doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to drive him into his intrenchments . He thought that by striking the // hostile army a succession of blows he might so weaken it as to prevent it from assuming the offensive in future , or of interfering effectually with the proposed siege . Viewed in this light the various battles that he delivered against Lee 's army during the early part of  --  the campaign had very important results ; since , although attended with great loss to the Union army , they were in proportion far more injurious to the foe . Grant lost about 60,000 , Lee 30,000 ; but the loss of the latter in comparison to his numbers was one-half , Grant 's loss onethird of the disposable forces . Nor does the Union loss seem excessive when we consider the magnitude of the contest , or compare it with the waste of life in other wars . In the Dutch struggle for freedom Mr. Motley tells us that one hundred thousand men laid down their lives at a single siege . At Canute the Roman dead were estimated at sixty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spanish Armada must have lost twenty thousand men . The army of the Potomac had but eight thousand killed , the rest of its loss being wounded or prisoners ; and if we compare Grant 's whole campaign with any one of Marlborough 's , or with Wel- ' lington 's Spanish exploits , we shall find that it was not marked by unusual loss-that it was comparatively merciful to friend and foe . On the 4th of May , 1864 , the army set out through Virginia for a final effort to conquer peace . Here , while embarrassed in the rough region known as the Wil&amp;erness , Lee struck it a severe blow-such as he had been accustomed to deliver with fatal success in his former campaigns . Now , however , although he inflicted a severe loss , his own was so considerable as to prevent him from checking the onward movement . Grant , with his usual perseverance , sought at once to turn his enemy 's flank by advancing to Spottsylvania , and again a second battle took place , in which , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nearly equal . The Union army next moved to the North Anna , where it was once more repelled by the skillful movements of Lee ; and Grant , still pursuing his design of turning the enemy , pressed on to Cold Harbor , where he made a general assault upon Lee 's intrenchments , which was altogether unsuccessful . But the enemy was much enfeebled by his various and incessant efforts , and Grant seems to have felt that as his own army was now reinforced to its original numbers he was at liberty to choose his own point of attack . Thirty-seven days of fighting had passed since he had entered the Wilderness . After some repose , on the 14th of June the army began to cross the James . It was the same strategy with which Grant had thrown himself below Vicksburg , in the heart of the enemy 's country ; had maintained himself at Corinth surrounded by foes ; had pierced the grand strategic line at Donelson , or chained Columbus at Belmont . He at least saw that Richmond could only be captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication lay open it was only an intrenched camp , as impregnable as the heights of Torres Vedras . The plan was new and difficult of execution ; the country looked on with doubt , and even alarm ; some thought that Grant would be crushed by a sudden movement of his indomitable assailant , who had struck him severe blows at the Wilderness and Cold Harbor ; some that Lee would seize the moment of his absence to march upon Washington and levy contributions on the prosperous North . But Grant knew that his enemy 's resources were swiftly diminishing ; that the late battles had already destroyed his capacity for offensive movements ; that Richmond was badly supplied with provisions and stores ; and that the time had come when the wisest policy was to sit down before the citadel of rebellion , and crush the rebel army , Government , President , nation , by the slow but fatal operations of the siege . Yet it was evident to all that it must be a prolonged one ; for Grant was at first able only to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Singularly enough , to the north and west Richmond was never invested : there its bold leaders swept the valley with their active cavalry , and beat back the Union truops to the mountains ; were often threatening Washington , and at one moment had nearly entered the hostile capital and driven its Administration into exile . It was almost a renewal of the siege of Troy , for wherever Grant was not Lee was certain to conquer ; the modern but modest Hector ruled over the field triumphant unless opposed by a humane Achilles . One striking trait in this bold plan was that it involved the siege of an army rather than a town . In all other investments of fortified towns the garrison has usually been far inferior to its assailants . Marlborough , in all his great achievements , never ventured to besiege an army . Napoleon , at Ulm , forced his enemy to a battle that proved decisive . But owing to Lee 's fortunate situatiOn , having various lines of access open to him , and possessing a force not much less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to threaten , any single point in Grant 's works with superior strength , and he was constantly assuming the offensive on the north side of Richmond , while his enemy was slowly and painfully turning his flank upon the south . A clear proof of the difficulty of the siege is seen in the affair of Petersburg . That important post had been left ' nndefended until Grant had crossed the James River , but no sooner did he attempt to seize it than Lee , aided by the hesitation of several Union commanders , filled it with his best troops , beat back the assailants , and soon surrounded it with lines of earth-works that made it invulnerable to a sudden attack . Like Todleben at Sebastopol , Lee and his active engineers created a powerful fortress in the face of the foe . His numerous forces enabled him to retain a garrison at Richmond capable of repelling the Union troops // on the north , and yet to throw so large an army into Petersburg as to check the progress of his besieger . Grant was therefore compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus to offer a still feebler front to any united attack of his active foe . Lee 's intrenchments began at Chapin 's Bluff on the James River , about ten miles below Richmond . From thence they extended , except where the river supplied their place , quite around to the west side of Petersburg ; and here they were gradually advanc'ed , as those of Grant made it necessary , until they had reached far on toward the Southside Railroad . His chief supplies came by the Weldon and Southside railroads , and it was for the possession of these that Grant was to struggle for more than nine months . The siege began on the 18th of June , 1864 , and continued until April , 1865 . Grant 's important attacks were all made at the extreme western end of his line , where he constantly strove to turn the enemy 's flank or to seize his railroads , and where various fierce battles took place in which Grant 's army lost largely , l ) ut was still slo*vly enveloping its struggling foes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then the long chain of earth-works was pushed cautiously on toward the Southside ; and then Grant lay quiet in the winter , after one or two apparently unsuccessful attacks , calmly improving his defenses and covering himself with impregnable earth-works . Meantime the nation grew weary of the slow movement of the siege , and could not understand why its immense army failed to crush its comparatively feeble foe . Curious visitors came trooping from the Northern cities to inspect Grant 's admirable lines , and returned from their holiday excursion to wonder why so little was done ; the summer had passed away , the autumn came , winter drove the troops into their comfortable camp ; spring was near again , and yet nothing had been told except that Grant was building earth - works and that Lee was building opposite him . Both armies seemed contending only with their spades ; why might they not build sand-hills opposite to each other forever ? Grant , however , saw that the moment had nearly come for the completion of his grand design . He had watched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locked in his iron grasp its powerful frame had withered and slowly faded into weakness . Its last army , half fed and never paid , must soon abandon Richmond or surrender ; Sheridan had swept the valley of Virginia , and rejoined his chief at Petersburg ; Wilmington , from whence Lee had obtained his foreign supplies of food and arms , was fallen ; the long lines of the besiegers were approaching the Southside Railroad , and when that fell the contest would be over . his chief fear now was that Lee would be able to escape from Richmond by some sudden flight , join Johnston 's army in North Carolina , and thus , at the head of a hundred thouVoa . XXXIX. - No. 230. - iS sand men , prolong the war in some distant quarter . At length , in the end of March , he wrote to Sheridan , " I wish to finish this thing , " and a grand attack was made on the extreme end of the enemy 's line . It was the decisive battle of the Five Forks . Sheridan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , aided by Warren , crushed a whole division of the enemy ; the line was turned , the disaster was irreparable ; and Lee felt that Richmond and Petersburg were no longer tenable . His only hope for the future was by a rapid flight to join his forces to those of Johnston . Meanwhile an assault had been made on Petersburg , and Wright , at the head of the famous Sixth Corps , broke through the strong intrenchments . On Sunday morning , April 2 , when the churches at Richmond were filled with worshipers , and Jefferson Davis was kneeling in his pew , a not.e was placed in his hand informing him of the great disaster . He left the church broken in spirit , if never before , to prepare for a hasty flight . The news soon spread , and the gay and hopeful city was filled with a terrible consternation . All was disorder , confusion , despair ; the President , his Cabinet , and the army fled hastily from their capital ; on every side were heard the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the streets and plundered the houses of the citizens ; and Ewell set on fire the finest quarter of the town , and reduced the wealthiest portion of Richmond to ashes . Meantime a wild chase was going on , in which the huntsman Grant pursued with relentless activity the flying forces of Lee . That able chief , never desponding , had obtained a start of twenty miles , with forty thousand men , and was moving rapidly along the north side of the Appomattox River , hoping to reach the Danville Railroad ; Sheridan and Grant swept yet more rapidly along the south side , and soon began to cut off the stragglers and assail the rear of the luckless foe . Still Lee might have escaped had not the complete failure of his food forced him to pause to give his men rest , and checked him in his rapid flight . He was overtaken , and nothing remained but surrender . He yielded gracefully . The two great Generals met at the little hamlet of Appomattox Court House , and for the first time saw each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met before during the Mexican War , when Grant was a young lieutenant , promoted for courage , and Lee already a distinguished officer  --  the chief favorite of his commander . Grant consented to honorable terms ; his labors were over , and peace had come . And never was a peace more gladly welcomed than this . Grant and his gallant leaders had mourned , in the midst of their triumphs , the sufferings which a misguided faction had brought upon their common country , and to none was the gentle voice of Peace so sweet an ( l welcome as to the heroes of the Great Rebellion .
