ART . IV . -1 . Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs . Washington . 1863. 2 . History of the Sioux War . By I. V. B. HEARD . New York : Harper and Brothers . 1863 . IT was our privilege to visit Western Minnesota a few weeks before the Indian massacre of 1862 . The journey was made at leisure , so that we had ample * , to note the wild beauty of this Western border . It had lost none of the poetry of the wilderness , although the log-cabins of the frontiersmen marked the tidal line of American civilization . The few scattered fields of golden grain which bent low for the reaper were like so many gems set in the flowery prairie . There was a generous freshness in the rude hospitality of these pioneers which won our hearts , and made us rejoice that their lines had fallen in such pleasant places . A few weeks later we heard on this border such a wail of agony as we pray God that we may never hear again . Many scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping in nameless graves . Minnesota was for two hundred miles one track of blood . Husbands and fathers were murdered in the harvest-fields , and mothers and children massacred in their homes . Eight hundred of the most generous people on the earth perished by savage violence . Every village in Minnesota became the refuge of the homeless . It was a tale of horror to curdle one 's blood , and if the world had not been watching with breathless anxiety the greatest rebellion of history , it would have moved all hearts to pity . Sufficient time has elapsed to calm the outburst of passion , and enable men to examine dispassionately the causes which have brought such anguish and desolation to our new homes . A great crime has been committed , and for that crime some one is responsible to God and to man . We believe that this massacre was the legitimate fruit of our Indian system , which is conceived in folly and carried out by fraud . Two facts in this regard stand out unmistakably in American history ; - first , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the commencement , end in serious difficulty , and often lead YOL . XCIX. - NO. 205. 29 // to murders and Indian wars ; second , that every Indian tribe which has entered into treaty relations with the American government has either perished or sunk into a state of brutishness unknown to their heathen fathers . It is because we believe that these fearful results are due to blunders and crimes , that we propose to examine our Indian system . We have witnessed one massacre , and would spare others this sad fate . We confess that , as believers in Christianity , we are unable to look upon the degradatioi* and destruction of a heathen race without emotioiis of pity . " We shall write plainly , for these are not the days when men can afford to cover up iniquity . A nation trembling on the brink of anarchy and ruin should not trifle with God . The first inquiry which we propose is this , - Is our Indian system calculated to secure peace and safety to the pioneers on the border ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded as men or wild beasts , self-interest demands that our policy shall secure peace and restrain all savage violence . Our first dealing with these savages is one of those blunders which is worse than a crime . We recognize a wandering tribe as an independent and sovereign nation . We send ambassadors to make a treaty as with our equals , knowing that every provision of that treaty will be our own , that those with whom we make it can not compel us to observe it , that they are to live within our territory , yet not subject to our laws , that they have no government of their own , and are to receive none from us ; in a word , we treat as an independent nation a people whom we will not permit to exercise one single element of that sovereign power which is necessary to a nation 's existence . The treaty is usually conceived and executed in fraud . The ostensible parties to the treaty are the government of the United States and the Indians ; the real parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowed purpose of the treaty is for a Christian nation to acquire certain lands at a fair price , and make provision that the purchase-money shall be wisely expended , so as to secure the civilization of the Indians . The real design is to pay certain worthless debts of the Indian // traders , to satisfy such claims , good or bad , against the Indians , as have been or may be made , and to create places where political favorites may receive their reward for political service . The hereditary chiefs are men who feel jealous of our encroachments upon their territory . They often demand an exorbitant price for their lands , in order to prevent the sale . Those chiefs who can not be bribed or deceived by false interpretations have in some instances been deposed , and more pliable tools appointed in their place . The interpreters who carry the heads of the commissioners and the chiefs on their shoulders are frequently men who can be bribed , and thus the two parties to the treaty are ignorant of each other 's views . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these treaties . The Indians said to the commissioners that " they desired to sell their land to their Great Father , but that , if they did sell it , they wished to receive the money themselves , and would not pay the bad debts of the traders , which they did not owe . " This was interpreted : " The Indians say that many years ago good white men visited our people and sold them goods which they were too poor to pay for ; these debts are honest , and have long laid heavy on our hearts : we will sell the land , if the first money can go to pay our honest debts . " We ourselves have known a treaty made with the Indians , and ratified by the United States Senate , which one half of the chiefs denied having signed , and a majority of them were ignorant of its provisions . There is always a large amount of fair speech and smooth words , for the Indians are told of the love of their Great Father , of his desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of schools and implements of husbandry , and of the bright future which is sure to await them if they will listen to their Great Father 's words . They feel their helpless condition , for their traditions tell them how other Indian tribes have perished . The offer of help from a superior race seems to give them a pledge of safety , the sums of money offered are to them almost fabulous , and they hope still to hunt the game over the unoccupied lands : they believe the lying words of the white man , and the treaty is ratified . The Indians now find that large claims have absorbed the first payment . Indian chiefs have told us that , having made a treaty // to sell their lands , they were asked to sign a supplementary one in order to make its provisions plain . A few of the chiefs did sign this supposed supplementary treaty . They were told by a friend that they had been deceived , and that this paper provided that all of their first payment should be paid to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; then certain white men bribed these chiefs to sign the amended treaty , paying them large sums of money . After they had signed it , they were made drunk , and while drunk the same white men who had bribed them stole from their blankets the very money which had been paid them as a bribe . In Mr. Heard 's book , pages 35 to 41 , there is an account of the Sioux treaty of 1851 and 1852 , which lifts the curtain a little to reveal the iniquity practised in Indian treaties . On page 42 of Mr. Heard 's book , and page 280 of the Report of the Commissioner , are descriptions of a similar treaty . In 1858 , the Sioux sold the government about eight hundred thousand acres of their reservation , for which the Upper Sioux were to receive two hundred and forty thousand dollars , and the Lower Sioux ninety-six thousand dollars . Up to the time of the massacre the Indians had not received one single cent , except fifteen thousand dollars in goods , many of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of Canadian belts . At the time of our visit to the Sioux country , immediately before the massacre , we heard many bitter complaints of the shameless dishonesty of both of these treaties . After the completion of the treaty , the Indians are placed under our Indian Bureau . The agents who are selected to guide a savage heathen people , and the employees who are to act under their direction , receive their places as a reward for political services . These places are eagerly sought after , because there is a tradition on the border that by some Aladdin 's lamp the pittance of salary will be multiplied into a fortune by the end of four years . If the agent is an honest man , whose sole desire is to elevate a degraded people , he will be powerless ; most of his employees will be forced upon him by the Superintendent , by some member of Congress , or the influence of party . He has no authority to make laws , and no power to enforce them . The // traders may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hireling of some Indian claimants ; he can not explain or redress the past robberies of his wards , nor prevent them in the future . The claims secretly deducted from Indian annuities , and the dishonesties in lessening the Indian goods purchased by the Department in Washington , are things for which he can not apologize . At every step his wisest plans will be thwarted , and , knowing that at the end of four years he must give place to a successor , he has little inducement to learn the laiiguage of the Indians , study their character , or inaugurate any plans for their improvement , so that even at best the Indians are three years out of every four under incompetent agents . If the agent is a mere political place-hunter , he enters upon his duties with only one thought , and that is plunder . Under his administration dead men 's names are placed upon the pay-rolls , and it is certified upon oath that they have received the annuity . The school is a miserable sham , the agricultural funds are wasted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchase or by theft after they are received , and the implements of husbandry are worthless . We have seeii cast-iron side-hill ploughs sent to the Indians to plough prairieland , so that even these savages asked with astonishment if their Great Father thought that all Indians were born left-handed . The employees of the Superintendent will be men who wink at crime , and who by their evil lives teach the Indians that blasphemy , adultery , drunkenness , and theft are not sins . We must add to this catalogue of evils , that on the border outside of the reservation there are a multitude of harpies worse than devils , who furnish the Indians with the most deleterious and deadly whiskey . These men ply their trade on the ceded lands , and as the reservation is under United States laws , and the ceded lands under State law , they have always managed to escape the penalty due to their crimes , on account of the conflict of jurisdiction . The Indians ' hunting-grounds are now gone , their annuities wasted , their people left subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the good or punish the bad . Disease will soon rest in every village , and the poor and wretched people sink into a state of brutishness unknown to their fathers . // The most fatal mistake in this chapter of evils is the lack of government . The Indians have been placed under conditions where their rude patriarchal government is destroyed or can not be exercised . We have recognized them as an independent nation , and them left them without a vestige of government or law . The chief has no power to make or to execute laws . In their wild state the office of a chief is only advisory , for he can not protect the innocent or punish the guilty : the Indians ' law of redress is savage vengeance . The only human being in the United States who has none of the restraints or protection of law is the treaty Indian . He has no protection in person , property , or life . Every motive which could influence him to become civilized is taken away . His crops may be destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only redress is private revenge . If he turns thief and steals from his white neighbors , the Department , with its usual wisdom , deducts the value of the theft from the annuity of the tribe , so that by thi6 means the guilty party makes a profit out of his crime . Those who embrace Christianity , or who desire to follow the pursuits of civilized , life , are left , by the government 's neglect , to suffer from the bitter hostility of their heathen neighbors . There is a deeply rooted antipathy between the habits , religion , and customs of a savage race , and the pursuits and teachings of civilization . The first step in the change from barbarism to civilization must be so distinct and marked that it will admit of no return . The civilized Indian consents to have his hair cut after the fashion of the white man . He knows that in the estimation of his people the loss of the scalp-lock is the public and open renunciation of the war-path and the chase . It is a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that henceforth he can not wear the warrior 's feather , which is the highest mark of savage ambition , and that he will meet at every step the insults and reproaches of his people . These civilized Indians have had their crops destroyed , their fences torn down , and even their lives have fallen a sacrifice , and yet the government has never given them protection . In many of the treaties provision is made that these men shall have a patent for their land , and that it shall no longer be the property // of the tribe ; but no patent has been issued , for , while it might give manliness to one who had something that he called his own , it would stand in the way of the removal of the Indians whenever the greed of white . men clamored for their land , or the Department-agents and traders wished to make another attack on the public treasury . Wabashaw , an aged chief , at whose request we had written a letter to the President to ask for reform in these particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart glad . You have spoken for me as a father speaks for the child whom he loves well . You have often come to see us , and you know that the Indians are not like their white brothers . They have not your ways , nor have you our ways . Our Great Father at Washington bought our hunting-grounds , and promised to help us to become like our white brothers . He said to me , Go home , and try to live like a white man , and I will help you more than I have ever done . Four winters have passed since he said these words , and the fifth is nigh at hand ; we think our Great Father has forgotten his red children , and our hearts are very heavy . The agents he has sent us seem to forget his words before they get here , for we think they disobey what he told them . You said you were sorry to see so many of our young men engage in foolish dances . I am sorry . I wish they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old customs hang around them like a garment of their wild life , because their hearts are sick . They do not know whether these lands are to be their home . They have seen the red man 's face turned towards the setting sun , and are afraid there are many long journeys for themselves and their children . This makes them uneasy , and they do not try to be different . If the great Council at Washington would do as they promised , then my people would see they meant as they said . The good Indian would be like the white man , and the bad Indian would seek another home . I have heard of your wise words to our Great Father , and you tell me that to those who live like the white men he will give , as he promised , deeds for our land . My heart is glad . You have none of my blood in your veins , but you have been a true friend of the Dacotah . I will repeat your wise words to my people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to me , and be like music to my heart . " The poor chief never realized his dream . Although innocent of any connection with the massacre , he was removed to the Missouri to die of a broken heart . A chief of another tribe once said to us : " I opposed this treaty , because , if I am an Indian , I am not a fool . When I sell to the white man my father 's hunting-grounds , if I remain a wild man I have dug my grave . This treaty has no oxen , no houses , no seed , no clothing , no schools ; it does not help us to become like our white brothers . It has some money for the 6 traders , and takes away my hunting-grounds and leaves me by a grave . " He then said , " My father , have you children ? " The reply was , " Yes . " " How would you feel if they were going to die ? " " Very sorrowful , " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to die ; will you help me save them ? " This artless eloquence of a poor and wretched people must move every heart with indignation against the Indian system . In this history of mistakes and robbery we must not overlook the fact , that no mark of disapprobation is placed upon the savage and pagan customs of the Indians . We have known the Governor of the State , on an official visit , to hire Indians to engage in a savage dance for the amusement of a gaping crowd . They have without let or hinderance followed the war-path upon our own territory , they have fought and murdered each other beside our villages , and when they returned , glutted with savage vengeance , our citizens have watched the brutal scalp-dance as a holiday pastime , not knowing that underneath there were dark brooding passions which some day would bring desolation to our own firesides and homes . These savage customs are calculated to keep alive every feeling of resentment for real or fancied wrongs . The dishonesties of the treaties , the thefts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian women sometimes accompanied by violence , are sure to be spoken of in the council and soldier 's lodge , to be repeated from wigwam to wigwam , until they become the great tradition of wrong and hatred which on the first opportunity will break out in murder and massacre . The trade in Indian claims has become one great means of dishonesty , and is the real reason for the frequent removal of the // Indians . So long as the government has no relations with the Indians , the trader is their friend . The Indians dare not refuse payment for the goods , lest the trader should refuse to give them an outfit for their hunt , and the traders dare not oppress the Indians , lest they should lose their debts . Under the treaty , the government offers a bounty for dishonest claims . The trader is permitted to add up all his bad debts and those of his fathers , and these individual debts are recognized by the government as a claim against the patrimony of the tribe . This system is perpetuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay large premiums and percentage to have them allowed . We have been informed by persons in whose word we have confidence , that on one occasion a person who found that his claims were unpaid was told that , if he would hand ten thousand dollars to a person designated , all these claims would be settled . The sum was larger than he could afford , but he did place five thousand dollars in an envelope and handed it as he was directed , and soon after received the money for every claim . If the Indian reservation is anywhere in the path of civilization , no plea of mercy , justice , or humanity can save this hapless people for an hour . Either the fears of the white settlers will be aroused , or their cupidity excited , until the removal is effected . Often the vagabond habits which the Indians have learned under government tutelage make it a necessity . When the removal takes place , humanity and fear of God are forgotten ; for the Indians are often removed at the point of the bayonet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a question of time when they shall perish . The Winnebagoes and friendly Sioux were thus removed in 1863 , and we learn , in the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , the character of the country to which they were taken . In a letter of General Sully , written from motives of humanity to the Department , he says : " I find both tribes very discontented , and if troops are not constantly kept here , I think there will be trouble . The Winnebagoes I find hard at work making canoes , with the intention of quitting the agency and going to join the Omahas , or some other tribe down the river . I held a council with them yesterday , in which they said they // had been promised , when they left their last reservation , to be settled on the Big Sioux . They also stated that nothing will grow here . They dare not go out to hunt , for fear of other tribes , and they said they would should all starve to death . This I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all the time . " Subsequently he addressed another letter to the Department , describing in the strongest terms the miserable character of the country , and said that his opinion was not formed from its present appearance , but from his former knowledge of it. * Under date of August 12 , 1863 , j the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs writes to the agent of the Winnebagoes , that representations had been received at the Indian office that the site of the new reservation was an unsuitable one , and requests him to assure the Indians that they should be removed . Since that time we know that the Department has been informed that nearly one thousand of these Indians have died during the past year from disease and hunger , and the officer who made the reconnoissance of the country , one of the most honored generals in our army , has certified that it was incapable of successful cultivation ; but no change has been made . And yet the government is expending money by thousands in this worthless country , and we wonder why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any due provision for their wants , leaves upon their minds , and the minds of all Indians near them , a deep feeling of resentment , sure to end in blood . A young warrior of the Chippewas once startled us as he said : " I hear the white man will remove us from our country . Tell your great Father I have one hundred warriors , and their shadows are falling on their graves . " We have thus briefly described some of the features of our Indian policy , and to our mind they give the secret history of the terrible Minnesota massacre so vividly described in Mr. Heard 's book . Their agent , Mr. Galbraith , whom we believe to be an honest man , says , in his report of 1863 , speaking of the treaties : " It was a perpetual source of wrangling , dissatisfaction , and bitter , * Commissioner 's Report , pp. 322 , 323. t Ibid. , p. 324. // even threatening complaints on the part of the Upper and Lower Sioux . " Mr. Heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fearfully augmented by the failure of the government to make their annual payment , which had heretofore taken place in June ? and by the traders refusing their credit when they needed it most . When an Indian would ask for credit , they would retort , Go to the soldiers ' lodge and get credit , ' and the Indian would angrily reply , Yes , if I kept your squaw I could get all the credit I wanted . ' On one occasion a large number appeared before a trader 's store , saying , You have told us that you will give us no more credit , that we might starve this winter , or eat hay or dirt ; now , since you will not give us credit , when you want wood or water , do not get it on our reservation . ' To this the trader replied , Ho ! all right ! when you are cold this winter , and want to warm yourself by our stove , I will put you out of doors . ' " Agent Galbraith was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delay in the payment . The true reason has never been given by the Department . The delay was caused by the fact that the Commissioner had paid a number of claims out of their annuities . The Superintendent and Agent were not willing to make a part payment , knowing it would precipitate an Indian war . At the last moment this deficiency was made up out of other funds , as the warrant on the treasury will show . Two months of precious time had elapsed , the money reached Fort IRidgely at 12 M. the 18th day of August . The massacre had already commenced : it was too late ! The next question that we shall ask is , " Are the Indian races of North America capable of receiving a Christian civilization ? " We answer , unhesitatingly , Yes . It would impugn the goodness of God and the power of the Christian religion to say that Christianity was not adapted to the wants and woes of all the children of sin , shame , and sorrow . The North American Indian is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will compare favorably with any race in the same condition . He is one of the very few heathen men who is not openly an idolater . He recognizes a Great Spirit , and although he speaks of the spirit in the woods , the brooks , and // Oct. the storm , he is not a pantheist . He has , for a heathen , a warm attachment to his family , kindred , tribe , and country . In his wild state , before coming in contact with the white man , he is more truthful , virtuous , and honest than most uncivilized races . His religion is the grand medicine which recognizes a Great Spirit , and existence after death . In his early youth he is taught to fast until in his sleep he sees the figure of some animal . He is then to hunt for that animal , fasting until he kills it . The skin is carefully prepared and ornamented by the squaws , and given to him as a medicine-bag , to be his charm through life . He is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests . Of these there are four degrees , each professing to teach some hidden knowledge of medicine , charms , or poisons , whereby he may gain the love of his friends and punish his enemies . Of worship , strictly speaking , there is none ; the feasts connected with the grand medicine are mere occasions of sensual enjoyment . The few customs of purification which still remain have survived all the teaching which at one time was probably connected with them . In sickness , or times of great danger , the conjurers of the grand medicine are consulted , and they resort to their rattles , drums , and dances to drive away the evil spirits who threaten their peace and safety . The Indians possess warm affection for their children . Upon the death of a child , the mother takes everything which belonged to the child , and often everything she had which would please the child , and makes a little bundle of the size of an infant , which she carefully ornaments with bead-work or porcupine quills , and carries this memento of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mourning , all gay clothing and ornaments are laid aside , and the hair is left uncombed , so that everything in the outward appearance shall show the sorrow for the dead . The penalty among the Chippewas for adultery was to have the nose bitten off . The Sioux held an annual maidens ' or virgins ' feast . On one occasion we witnessed this feast among the Lower Sioux . Nearly one thousand Indians , in every variety of holiday costume , were assembled on the prairie . An old medicine-man went to and fro in the camp , announcing // that the virgins and braves were now called to the virgins ' feast . A sacred stone , painted with bright colors , and gayly ornamented with feathers , was placed in the centre of the circle formed by the Indians . The old crier stood beside it , and called all the virgins to the feast . A mother led her daughter , a girl of perhaps fifteen , and neatly dressed , up to the stone , and deposited beside it her offering for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up to the sky , which was regarded by all present as a solemn oath that she was a virtuous maiden . When all the girls who desired had taken the oath , the old crier announced that any brave who had taken a scalp before he had made love to a woman was entitled to eat with the virgins . One by one the young braves , with their war-paint and feathers , entered the circle , and , having touched the stone , related the history of their following their enemy on the war-path , and where it was that they had overtaken and slain him . When this part of the festival had ended , the old crier called upon the people to come forth and challenge any one who had made a false statement , or was unworthy of these honors . A young man , amid breathless silence , entered the circle and laid his hands on one of these girls , and accused her of being unworthy . The accusation and defence were very brief , and then there rose from a thousand voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of shame . We have been permitted to examine many letters of the agents of the Northwest Fur Company , and have made inquiries of old men who have spent their whole lives in the Indian country ; and we are satisfied that a very great deterioration has come to this people since their treaty relations with the government . Governor Sibley and Senator Rice , both of whom spent many years in the employ of the Fur Company , testify to the honor , honesty , and fidelity of the Indians . The best evidence of the mistakes of our policy is found in the fact that the English government in Canada has never had an Indian war , and no lives have been lost by Indian massacre . Their Indians live in peaceful relations with their white neighbors and friends , and wherever there was an Indian tribe there // is now a Christian Indian village . They have not expended one dollar where we have spent thousands . The whole secret is , that England carries her government and laws wherever she extends her civilization . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended its conquests without extending its government , or that permits human beings to live within its territory without being subject to its laws . We have known among this people too many instances of the power of Christian faith , to doubt their ability to accept the Christiaii religion and embrace its civilization . All that sheds light on the horrible scenes of this bloody massacre is due to the Christian faith . The only men who dared to stand up against it were men who had been under missionary influence . Paul Ma-za-ku-tu-ma-ne , Taopi , Wakeau-was-t6 , Other Day , Wabashaw , and others no less our friends , proved that friendship at the risk of their lives . Other Day rescued sixty persons and led them to Henderson . Taopi and others delivered two hundred captives to General Sibley , at Camp iRelease . Paul made a speech in the Indian council which exhibits the truest bravery . " I want to know if you lower Indians are crazy ; you might as well fight the thunder and lightning as to fight the whites . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy them . You say you will make a treaty with the English . It is impossible . They are white men . They are ruled by a petticoat , and she has the tender heart of a squaw I am going to shake hands with the whites . I hear some of you boast , I have killed so many women and children ' ; that is not brave , it is cowardly . " Amid cries of " Kill him ! kill him ! " he said : " Bluster away . I am not afraid . I am not a woman . I shall not die alone ; there are others who will die with me . " Even the farmer Indians who were heathen were throughout opposed to the war , and the few who for self-preservation joined the tribal Indians in their raids are believed to have taken no active part in the warfare . Major Joseph R. Brown , who has lived for forty years in Minnesota , and during this time sustained intimate relations with the Indians as trader and agent , was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the most severe battles of the war . He says in a published // letter , speaking of the farmer Indians : " During the attack upon Fort IRidgely many balls were fired into the roofs of the houses , and during the battle of Birch Cooley the tops of the Sibley tents were riddled with balls . I am too well aware of the precision with which an Indian uses his gun to believe they would have shot so wildly at short range if it was not done intentionally . " These men , who were the deliverers of our captive friends , and others who were acquitted by the military court , are the Sioux who were sent to the Missouri to starve . We admit cheerfully that very little has been done to civilize or Christianize the Indian race ; but we are not willing to see this poor people dragged down to death , and then hear men with their mock piety plead God 's decrees as an excuse for their own guilt . We have heard a high Indian official declare , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many wise men *ho thought the best policy was to exterminate the Indians , " and we ventured to tell him plainly , that " no one but Almighty God could exterminate , and that , if he would remember that within three years more white men of our own citizens than all the Indians on the continent had been exterminated , he might perhaps learn that the American people had to do with a God who was not blind . " It would extend this article beyond its proper limits to do more than point out a remedy for these evils , and to give the details of a more perfect Indian system . The only remedy is to give the Indians the protection of law , to treat them as our wards for whom we are responsible , to give them individual rights in the soil and the means to cultivate it , to guard them from the low vagabonds who would sell an Indian 's soul for a pittance of coin , and secure to them agents to guide them out of their heathen darkness who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to lie and steal . The agents and employees of the Indian Department should be placed beyond the reach of political removals . They should be men of the highest character , receiving good salaries , and holding their office during good behavior . It is now many years since we looked into the iniquity of this atrocious system ; many a time , as we have heard the pitiful plea of the helpless , we have wept // in very bitterness . But that which has been the most terrible to bear was to witness day after day the gathering of a stormcloud of savage hate and ferocity ; to hear its low mutterings ; to plead with a woman 's love and a man 's earnestness for help only to be refused , and then with a bruised heart to watch the anguish and desolation which guilty apathy had permitted to settle over border homes . This year the people will again express their voices at the ballot-box , and instruct their agents as to their duty . Would God that they might demand , in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redressed . Ours is a generous people ; there is a great , manly heart in American breasts , which is always ready to help the wretched . The government has never been parsimonious , it has always had the kindest intentions , and poured out its money like water to help its Indiaii wards . It will cost time , it will cost money , it will cost abuse and hatred to any man who attempts to reform this Indian system ; but it will cost more to cover up iniquity and anger God . The war in Minnesota has kept seven thousand brave soldiers put of the field , it has cost fifteen millions of dollars a year . The two waves of population between the Atlantic and the Pacific are soon to meet , and we must right these wrongs , or enter upon an Indian war which will cost a hundred millions of dollars and the sacrifice of thousands of precious lives . We dare not be silent . Our beloved country is filled with anguish and woe , and we look with awe and fear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
