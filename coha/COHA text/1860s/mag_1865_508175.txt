IT was during the fight of May 6 , in the YirI ginia Wilderness , while taking an order to General Owen , whose command held an advanced position , immediately after the Second Corps had been flanked by Longstreet and compelled to fall hack to the ground it occupied in the morning , that I was made a prisoner .

VOL . XXXI. - No. 182. -K out of the question-directed principally by the sound of musketry , which was rapidly increasing , upon rising a slight knoll I was greeted by the whiz of half a dozen musket-halls , all of which , most fortunately , passed overhead , and the requests to " Surrender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , the meaning of which could not be mistaken , some couched in terms more expressive than elegant .

The firing momentarily increased , and almost immediately afterward was continuous along the whole line through which I had just l ) assed . After finding the provost marshal the guard turned me over to him . My name , rank , and position were noted down , after which a series of questions were asked as to the movements of our troops , etc. , hut finding me rather taciturn , I was soon left to my own reflections , which were not of the pleasantest . Stretched at the foot of a tree , under guard for the first time in my life , I tried to realize my position . It matters not under what circumstances a man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect before him ; and while consoling himself with the thought that it is one of the misfortunes of war , will immediately look around for an opportunity to " slope . None presented itself to me ; but an individual did , as I lay cogitating the chances , with the query , " How much for them spurs , Mister , you wo n't want em no more ? " I turned and saw a surly-looking officer , to whom-feeling the sarcasm of his remark and the necessity of having as much money as possible-I replied , " Ten dollars . " lie offered five , and , much as it was against my nature to compromise with a rehel , the bargain was closed . here , in connection with my first sale , let me say that these men excel any Connecticut Yankee I ever met in driving a sharp bargain , and every prisoner is haunted from his entrance into until his exit from the Confederacy to know if he has not this or that article to sell or to trade . Knowing their peculiarity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and afterward , at Lynchburg , sold my watch , a common silver one , which would not run , for one hundred and fifty dollars . Staff officers could sell their buttons at the price of two dolJUST CAPTURED . ars and a half each , and the gold lace from their trowsers at corresponding rates . Fortunate are those who fall into such hands as permit them to sell , instead of robbing them of every thing they possess , as is most frequently the case . Prisoners , both officers and men , continued to be brought in , until a sufficient number were collected , when we were ordered to fall in , and were marched further to the rear under a strong guard . Never shall I forget that short march of four miles . Tired and exhausted from the continued exertions of the three previous days , by excitement and hunger , with clothes torn and face scratched , I plodded along the dusty road , under a scorching sun , subjected every where to the abuse and remarks of lines of rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's store , where were the head-quarters of General Lee and General Stuart , we were added to the number of those previously captured , and I was accosted by a Confederate officer , who desired to hear of some acquaintances in our army . I knew several of them , which led to further conversation , and an acquaintance which never will be forgotten . This officer was Major Fitzhugh , of General Stuart 's steW and he was shortly joined by Major Richardson . They kindly invited me to their quarters , and shared with me their soldiers ' fare and their blankets ; and that night , on the bosom of mother earth , I was oblivious of friends and of foes . I was furnished with breakfast on the following morning by these gentlemen , and remained with them until noon ; but among all those with whom I was that morning brought in contact I heard no discourteous word , no remark designed to give or at which I could take offense . At noon of that day ( the 7th ) we started for Orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed a horse at my disposal , sending an orderly to brin , him back ; introduced me to Captain Bro* , who was to have charge of us ; and , as if all this was not enough , inquired if I needed money , and offered to loan me whatever I might require . Fortunately this latter proof of his generosity it was not necessary for me to accept ; hut the horse was most thankfully taken ; for a march of five-andtwenty miles on such a day would have been for me an impossibility , especially as I found that I had received a severe bruise on the thigh on the previous day , and was quite lame . Major Fitzhugh had himself been a prisoner in our hands , had been kindly treated , and was desirous to reciprocate . Certainly nothing which I can say can express my gratitude to him for his hospitality and kindness . All // were offered as only a true gentleman can offer them , with such tact as to cause me to forget for the time being the relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be in my power , after this war is over , to reciprocate , or at least to meet with him and express my appreciation of his acts . Captain Brown was disposed to make the march to Orange Court House as comfortable as possible , halting often to give the prisoners rest and allow them to get water . At a house where we stopped a lady brought out to the Captain a pitcher of ice-water . I heard the pleasant sound of the ice rattling against the vessel , and longed to place my lips and draw a draught therefrom , looking with envy at him as lie drank . Perhaps the lady saw the longing in my eyes ; at any rate she said , " We must be kind to the Yankees when they are prisoners . Ask some of the officers to have some . ' That cup of cold water will not grow cold in my memory . May it bring its reward ! We reached our destination at ten o'clock that night , and upon entering the office of Major Bridgeford I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seymour . Both had been made prisoners during the day . This meeting was for me a most fortunate one , as from that time until June 10 we were companions in misery , and to them I am indebted for much which rendered my captivity more endurable . That night we shared one blanket in a corner of the old court-house . The next morning , the 8th , rations of bacon and hard-tack were issued to us , but through the courtesy of Surgeon Claggit , of the Confederate army , we had a breakfast of " soft " bread and coffee . On the morning of the 9th we were ordered once more to " fall in , " and were marched to the dip6t , where occurred an incident worthy of note . Around the building many poor fellows were lying wounded , one wearing a cap which bore the badge of one of our corps . An officer , taking him for one of our men , stooped and spoke to him , whereat one of the " relief committee " present , seizing the cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volley of invective at the wounded man as utterly amazed us , telling him he would kick him out of the house if he had any thing Yankee about him . We were packed in cattle-cars , and after waiting two long hours started on our rough trip to Gordonsville , and , arriving there , were placed in a barn . A handful of meal and two small fish were furnished each of us , which , without facilities for cooking , were rather inappropriate rations . So instead of supper we consoled ourselves by making the old rafters riiig with " Rally round the Flag " and the national airs , much to the disgust of the " Johanies , " whose orders to " dry up " we did not see fit to regard . At 9.30 r.am . we were turned out and marched to the d6p6t , put into very comfortable passenger-cars , and arrived at Lynchburg about ten o'clock the following morning , where , in a warehouse on the principal street , we found about one hundred officers lodged in one room , dimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which overlooked a small yard , where we were permitted to go during the day . Eleven of us were assigned to the front-room , affording us a view of the street , some amusement , and plenty of air . The week we were detained here was devoid of interest . We existed merely . The bread and bacon were barely eatable . We succeeded in exchanging some greenbacks , at the rate of one dollar for ten of Confederate currency , and making some purchases , among which were a towel for eight dollars and a comb for five . On the evening of the 17th we were started for Macon . The trip was made in passenger , box , and cattle cars , packed to their utmost , and those who could not be jammed inside were put on the top . The time occupied in changing cars and waiting at the different stations were the only relief we had from this close confinement-the only chances to stretch our cramped limbs and get breaths of*fresli air ; yet even then we could not always procure water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied six days , one day and night being passed in the Danville prison , and one night in Charlotte , where we were turned into a vacant lot , ten feet below the level of the street , all over which the water stood in pools . In the morning I was refreshed both in body and in spirit by the gift of fresh bread , with a cup of milk , from a lady , who remarked , " I wish I had enough for all . " The little kind - nesses , trifling though they may seem , are the bright spots in the prisoner 's life , the oasis in his desert , showing him the sun through the black cloud over his head . As a companion picture , let the reader imagine the lady-for such she doubtless was considered , judging by her surroundings-who stood upon the piazza of her house , and testified to her love by shaking both her fists at us as we were marched through the town . We made a short stay at Augusta , and through the kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maryland  --  a few of us were permitted to go into the city , where we made a few purchases , besides indulging in the luxury of green peas , fresh bread and butter , and a taste of the " ardent , " for which we paid seventy dollars . At the dip6t a number of gentlemen , former acquaintances of the Generals , hearing of their presence , called ; among , , them was ex-Governor Cummings of Utah . Arriving at Macon we were taken to the office of Captain Tabb , commandant of the prison , where the date of our capture was registered , with our names , and our pockets gone through with in a very unceremonious* manner . Our self-constituted banker permitted us to draw on him once a week to the amount of ninety dollars ( Confederate ) , taking our greenbacks at the rate of one dollar for four and a half Confederate scrip . On entering the prison , which is situated on the old fair grounds , we were surrounded by // its inmates , who were anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to hear the news . As my eyes roved over the motley crew , hatless , coatless , shoeless , in every stage of shabbiness , and heard the cry of " Fresh fish ! " as they surged around us , I could scarcely believe that they were officers , and that we , who were now comparatively well clothed , might become like unto them . The cry of " Fresh fish , " which is raised upon the entrance of every new lot of prisoners , originated , I believe , in Libby , and is probably a Shaksperian quotation from Henry the Eighth , and occurs in the dialogue between the old lady and Anne Bullen . " And you ( 0 fate ! ) a very fresh fish here . " The prison grounds comprise about three acres , surrounded by a high fence , outside of which a pldtform runs around , upon which the sentinels are posted every ten feet . Inside , about three yards from the fence , is another , called the " dead line , " which prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being shot . There is but little shade ; but excellent water was supPlied by pumps , and a spring filled sunken tubs , at the lower end of the grounds , where we bathed and did our washing . Our shelter consisted of sheds , or rather roofs of boards , from fifty to a hundred feet in length by twenty wide , which had been built by the prisoners , who were provided with the requisite tools , nails , and lumber . One structure , a little better than the rest , was used , when necessary , for a hospital , and one end partitioned off for general officers . To facilitate the drawing of rations , the getting of wood and water and our letters , the prisoners divided themselves into squads of one hundred each , under charge of the senior officer , who was assisted by an adjutant and commissary . These squads were subdivided into messes , each having a commissary , the cooking being done by the members in turn . The ration here consisted of bacon and corn meal , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few brown beans , with occasional issues of salt , molasses , and vinegar in homeopathic doses . From the sutler we could purchase a few articles , berries , and vegetables at exorbitant prices . For cooking utensils the following were given each squad of a hundred men : eight skillets ( orDutch ovens with covers ) , thirteen mess-pans , four wooden buckets , and four camp-kettles ; and much ingenuity was displayed in the building of chimneys and ovens . Corn pones and cakes were the standard dishes ; and if practice makes perfect , every officer there can ring all the changes on corn meal , from hasty-pudding down , and put Parker to the blush . Cooking out of doors in the INSIDE THE STOcKADE , MACON . FRESH FISH . // hot sun , the rain , or the wind , every soldier knows is not conducive to amiability ; but there for the first time I learned it by experience , and henceforth have no s* npathy for cross cooks with home facilities . How many times have I laughed to see my mess-mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wipe the perspiration from his face , and give vent to his opinion of green wood , rice which would not boil , and meat which would never grow tender ; * and how often has he had his revenge as I poked over fires which would not burn , scorched my fingers , or smouched my only shirt ! If an occasional pan was kicked over , and the remains of yesterday 's dinner was produced for to-day , the mess understood it , and sympathized with instead of scolding the cook . The number of prisoners increased while I was in Macon , but unfortunately the accommodations did not ; consequently many were compelled to go without any shelter . The commandant , Captain Tahb , had neither energy nor principle , was addicted to the use of spirits , at which times he was more arbitrary than ever , and was , in fact , utterly unfitted for the position . He once , at the request of a prisoner , took a watch and chain to sell for four hundred dollars-not less . After a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had sold them for two hundred dollars ; and upon being asked how he came by the chain , which he was then wearing , said the purchaser gave it to him . After such an explanation the officer demanded the return of his property , or the four hundred dollars , threatening to expose the affair unless it was complied with ; upon which Captain Tabb abused him most shamefully , and then had him " bucked " for several hours , after which the articles were restored . We were all very glad when we were relieved from the petty annoyances to which he subjected us , by his being superseded by Captain Gibbs , a gentleman , who , although very strict , made us no promises he did not intend to fulfill . An incident occurred shortly after Captain Gibbs assumed command which did not encourage us to hope we had fallen into better hands . Just at dark of the 11th of June an officer of the Forty-fifth New York Volunteers , returning from the spring where he had been bathing , was shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . Those who were near could assign no reason for the act hut the intention to commit a deliberate murder , as he was not near the " dead line . " The senior officer in camp wrote Captain Gibbs , requesting an investigation of the circumstances , and the communication was returned with the following indorsement , " Such investigation as may by me he deemed proper will be made in this case ; and it shall be more complete than in the cases of Confederate officers murdered by negro troops at Fort M Henry and elsewhere . " Cooking , eating , washing , and mending occupying but a comparatively small portion of the day one seeks in every direction for amusewAsuine. mont or occupation , and Macon was in these respects like the other places in which I was subsequently confined . The papers were soon read ; and filled , as all Southern papers are , with stupid invective , pompous bombast , or garbled accounts of battles , they were not very amusing . Later in the year , while Sherman was on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news good or had , the papers *vcre withheld from us . Books , whether strangers or old friends , were always welcome . Some took up the study of the languages , some tried to rub up mathematics , some sketched or gave lessons to others , some practiced music , formed glee clubs , or bought violins and flutes with which to accompany the singers . All the games of cards , chess , etc. , were the quiet pastimes , while the more active were cricket , wicket , quolt-pitching , gymnastics , and wood-splitting , which , owing to the crowded condition of the ground , were more rarely indulged in . There were three chaplains among us , and services were held on Sunday and once at least during the week , which were well attended . Captain Tabb was once so impudent as to request that the prayer for the President of the United States would be omitted ; hut no notice was taken of the insult . Our surgeons , of whom there were a number , examined and prescribed for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent in from the hospital outside the stockade , or the seriously ill were sent there . The scarcity of surgeons and of physicians is very much felt in the South , and the supply of medicines , even among their own soldiers , entirely unequal to // the demand . At our request one of our number , Dr. W- , was allowed to take charge of our prison hospital-just alluded to  --  a building capable of accommodating forty patients , together with the nurses and attendants , who were volunteers from our number . Application was made for the parole of some of our enlisted men for this duty , but it was refused , and the volunteers from among the officers did the duty nobly and faithfully . A small shanty was built for a cook-house , an oven in which wheat-bread was baked every day , and such supplies as could be obtained were procured through the rebel surgeon , who was nominally in charge . Sometimes for a week there would not be medicines of any kind in the hospital . The most plentiful was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barks , which was considered a good tonic , and a kind of opium was also manufactured by the women . Whisky was occasionally to be had ; quinine , worth $400 the ounce , very seldom ; in short , many a life was lost there , which , under ordinary circumstances , would have been prolonged could proper drugs have been obtained . The prevailing diseases were dysentery , malarial fever , typhoid , and scurvy ; the first , in all its varied forms , existed to a fearful extent ; and it is safe to say that two-thirds of our number were suffering from it , in many of whom it assumed a chronic form , which only change of air and diet can cure . It was always a matter of surprise to me that we escaped contagious sickness ; for our low diet , want of vegetables , and the bad air consequent upon our crowded condition , seemed to supply all the requirements and make that type of disease inevitable . Unsupplied as the hospital was with the necessities which the ills of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , with cotton beds raised from the ground , and for these reasons a haven of rest for the sufferers . I speak from experience , for an attack of fever compelled me to become an inmate during the month of July . Before entirely recovering from my indisposition I left the hospital in company with many others , some of whom were scarcely able to bear the change , in order to make room for some twenty of our enlisted men who were suffering from wounds , and had been brought from some other hospital and laid in the open space before ours . Only a few days previous a lot had been sent off to Andersonville , of whom Dr. Parker remarked at the time that it would be the means of their death . And yet he sent them away . I must not forget the Fourth of July which we spent in the Macon prison . We welcomed it with hearty cheers and the national airs , and at ten o'clock AM , assembled in and around the main building-sung the Star-Spangled Banner , after which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we were singing a tiny American flag , which some one had evidently carried as a keepsake , was raised over the crowd , and , after the chorus , was greeted with nine cheers as hearty as ever came from the throats of those who have fought under its stars and stripes . While Colonel - was in the midst of his remarks he was interrupted by the officer of the day with orders from Captain Gibbs for us to disperse . Immediately he was seen some one cried , " Put that flag out of sight ! " To which Colonel - replied , " Do n't touch that flag I " In response to which remark a murmur of approbation rose from every one present , as they glanced from the flag to the officer , who , after delivering his order , looked up at it for an instant , hesitated , then turned about and retired to bis quarters . I do not think it would have been safe for him to have attempted to take it down , and he certainly had good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Northern Copperhead could have heard the remarks of loyal men there that day . Many of them had been for more than a year in Southern prisons and dungeons-some for a part of the time in close confinement and irons ; yet they uttered no words against the integrity of the Government , spoke not of compromise , breathed no complaint ; but counseled the same patriotism which led them into the field , the same submission , even unto death if necessary , in the full assurance that , whether death came to them there , or in the thickest of the fight , they would be remembered among those who laid their lives on Freedom 's altar . Toward the latter part of July it was rumored that we were to be removed to Charleston and Savannah , and soon a lot was sent away . About this time Stoneman made his famous raid , and another lot were started on the 29th inst. , but brought back for fear he would recapture them . Great was the excitement among us about this time , which was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Stoneman and his staff were added to our number . On the 11th of August , in company with about six hundred others , I was started for Charleston . Packed in box cars , fifty officers and five guards in each , we suffered intensely from heat and thirst . One of the best plans that was perhaps ever matured by a company of prisoners was arranged to be carried into operation on a train that went a few days before ours . A secret society was organized , with initiation oaths , pass-words , and grips ; the members divided into companies and squads , with proper officers , and maps of the country were obtained , to be ready when opportunity offered for escape . Such an opportunity , it was decided , was to be found while being taken to Charleston , and the work of each squad was determined upon and matured . At a preconcerted signal , to be given at some way-station , the guards inside and outside the cars were to be seized , their arms and ammunition secured ; while another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to secure the engineer , fireman , and guard on the locomotive , and anothel ' look out for the artillery , in case there should be a gun on a platform car in rear of the train , as was customary . The overpowering of the sentinels in and upon the cars was a very easy matter , for they were // Georgia militia , many of whom would not even have made a show of resistance , and some of them did that night lie down and sleep , leaving their muskets at the disposal of any one ; and I am informed that , in several instances , their cartridges were emptied from their boxes in anticipation of the work . The train , in event of success , was to have been stopped near Pocotaligo Bridge , from which General Foster 's lines might easily have been reached , being then only ten or twelve miles distant . But the signal never was given . Why it was not I have never heard explained ; hut it is said that some word or act put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the train at the top of its speed , without a stoppage , directly to the city . The thoughts which are always uppermost in a prisoner 's mind are of exchange and escape ; and could the many projects which are discussed or put in train he successful , the Confederacy would have few besides the sick prisoners to guard . At Lynchburg two , to my knowledge , procured rebel uniforms , walked out past the guard , and safely reached our own lines . While . en route to Macon several escaped by cutting holes through the bottom of the car and jumping out . At Macon one blacked his face and passed out as a negro workman ; another bribed the colored driver of the sutler 's wagon , and was taken out in a box ; while a third clung under the body of the same wagon , and succeeded in getting away . It was quite safe to brihe any of the guards and procure a gray uniform , and quite as easy to get outside the prison grounds , but the trouble only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place of safety being very great . Men were compelled to seek somewhere for food ; and unless they could meet some of the slaves-who were almost invariably friendly , and ready to lend all the assistance in their power-were liable to be betrayed ; besides which , the news of all escapes were spread throughout all the region round , and men turned out with blood-hounds to hunt the game , delighting in the sport ; so that of all who started but a very few succeeded in accomplishing their object . Tunneling was tried to a great extent . In all I presume eight or ten were commenced , and three were projected at one time-all to come out at different points . The work , of course , was only carried on at night , and as the tools used around camp in the day were carefully removed at dark , the only implements were knives , spoons , tin cups , and the hands . Only one could work at a time ; and it may be imagined that , in a hole two feet square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but light work . The mouth of the tunnel was in some one of the sheds , and easily covered during the day , while the dirt taken out was scattered about in the various dirt-heaps , or where the wells were then being dug , or thrown into the brook . Two of these tunnels were brought to completion , so that they might have been used any night ; but it was deemed safe to wait until the third and largest was finished , and we confidently expected that in a few mornings some seven hundred of us would be running at large , when some one , to obtain favor with the commandant of the prison , revealed the plot , and we were all suddenly called off to one end of the camp , a guard thrown across , and search was made which unmasked our work , and dashed our hopes of weeks to the earth . The traitor did his work well ; we hope his reward was all he asked . Of exchange I may as well say something here . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand tongues was ever busy among us . Even the wildest and most improbable of stories were not unworthy of discussion , and even the breathing of the word , if it was but to ask some one to exchange a pair of trowsers for a pair of shoes , would bring the cry-which would be taken up far and near " Louder on exchange ! " In Charleston the excitement was greatly increased by the exchange of fifty general and field officers in August-that of the surgeons and naval officers in September , as well as the arrangement between General Sherman and Hood . Once at Macon , and again at Charleston , attempts were made by certain men to get up petitions , asking Mr. Davis to allow a committee to he paroled and sent North , to represent to our Government the " fearful condition of our enlisted men " confined in Southern prisons . I am proud to record that both were failures ; that the majority refused to petition on the ground that their faith in our Government was sufficient for them to believe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macon was forwarded on a minority  --  a very small minority-of names , it was never heard from . At Charleston the second attempt originated with . an officer whose term of service had expired ; but at a meeting called he and his friends had some home truths thrust upon them , and were informed , if they were previously ignorant , of certain duties which , as officers of the army , they owed to their country  --  the result of which was that no more petitions were heard of . Here the majority testified in something more weighty than words to their loyalty , to their willingness to remain , to end their lives in captivity , if those who were at the head of affairs thought it best for the cause that there should be no general exchange , or if one could not be arranged without conceding a point to the enemy . On " special exchanges " the feeling was almost universal in their condemnation . Not that any of us were not glad to get away under that rule , but we could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had seen tens , twenties , and thirties leave them -- -men who had not been there perhaps thirty days . The same principle is involved in the exchange of fifty as of fifty thousand ; and why then should not those who have been so long sufferers be taken in preference to those just arrived ? We reached Charleston on the morning of // August 13 , and were kept waiting a long time in the street , when I procured some fresh figs , bread , and milk , and , seated on the curb-stone , made an excellent breakfast . We were marched to the work-house , " counted in , " and as the heavy grated doors closed behind ns , I realized for the first time what it was to he in durance vile . Th* work-house ( from the outside ) is a fine-looking building , built on three sides of a square , with two towers which give it quite an imposing appearance . It is built entirely of brick . My curiosity never prompted me to wander through its labyrinth of corridos:s , staircases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and dungeons below ground , a little of that style was sufficient . Turn with me from the main entrance , ascend a dark , narrow , spiral staircase - admitting the passage of but one at a time  --  to the second-floor , and into the cell with heavily grated windows , which is the space allotted to four Yankee officers , constituting " one mess . " There is neither chair nor table , the floor is both our seat by day and our bed by night . Here we passed seventeen days , and wretched days they were . Our only cooking utensils were a small tin pail , which one of our number fortunately brought with him , and an old hoe which we picked up , and fried both cakes and meat upon . The water was scarce and bad , with poor facilities for washing and bathing , while the yard was so filthy that we cared not to avail ourselves of the permission to enter it . The sutler charged exorbitant prices for every article , and little chance for purchasing outside was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had , amusement of all kinds seemed denied , and I was always glad when night came that I might seek oblivion in sleep , although to seek was not always to find , for myriads of mosquitoes and oppressive heat generally kept me tossing until , worn out , I slept from exhaustion . Well remembered are the nights passed upon that floor , with the beautiful harvest moon pouring her light through the gratings , shining ever quietly , no matterwhetherl smoked and thought , tossed and fretted , or slept and dreamed . Near by the work-house is the jail , into the yard of which we could look , from the left wing , and the sight of the three hundred and odd prisoners there assured us that our lot was not the hardest , and afforded a trifle of consolation . They were associated with characters of all descriptions , thieves , assassins , prostitutes-both black and white ; many living in tents in the yard , many without any shelter , and those with whom we communicated complained of short rations , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called sufficient , and of fair quality , including frequent issues of meat . Three hundred of our officers were in the Marine Hospital , on the same square , which rumor proclaimed to be a very nice place , and as many more were at the Roper Hospital , where I was anxious to go that I might meet and be with my friends . Not receiving any reply to numerous applications for my removal , I had about given up the hope of change , when the welcome order JAIL-YARD , cOAsILESTOx. // caine , and the evening of September 4 found me within its walls . The Roper Hospital is a brick structure , finished in mastic , on the corner of Queen and Marych streets , is three stories in height , with a tower at each end , and one on either side of the centre door . A garden extends the entire front of the building , is inclosed by an iron fence , and gave evidence of former care and cultivation ; but weeds and plebeian shrubs were fast crowding upon the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Insane Asylum , where some officers were quartered , and of which we had full range ; and on the right is the Medical College . We were permitted to burn the gas until nine o'clock z*.m , which luxury we fully enjoyed and appreciated , serving as it did to make the eveningpass quickly and pleasantly . I shoald not omit to speak of the long piazza at the front , on which I have spent so many hours with my pipe for my companion . zorza HOSPITAL , CHARLESTON . woRK-HousE , cHAELESToN. // qwq ginia ready to run to the store , or take the clothes of those who reveled in more than one suit out to the washer-woman ; and " see me quick and le'me go , " as the old thin-faced black wench , who was always cross and in a hurry was called , because of her frequent exclamation ?

Some prisoners , to increase their income , took up the trades : and there w* s a tinman , who stripped all the gutters off the building to make un pails ; a tailor , who sowed tares and reaped wheat in the form of bread ; a shoemaker , who cared for our soles-for a consideration ; and a barber , who beautified our other extremityall of whom were very useful and valuable members of the community . We received our mails more regularly , another inexpressible comfort . When I weut there no letters had reached me from home since my capture , and others had been many months in anxious expectation and suspense , knowing there must be letters lying somewhere in the Confederacy for them . Ab , those letters ! Can any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those short pages of love , of consolation , of condolence ? One little page ! hut to him it contains more than is written thereon with the pen . It brings the touch of the father , the voice of the mother , the breath of the beloved , perhaps the prattle of children , or it may bring volumes of sadness . In answer , the little you are permitted to write seems of no use ; and when you remember that there can be no privacy about it , no respected seal , one great charm is removed , and confining yourself to plain matter of fact you feel it scarcely worth while to send it when finished . The cry , " Fall in for the mail ! " was the first intimation we ever had of their arrival , and then came a rush . Books , games , mending , cooking , and eating were left unfinished and uncared for ; drowsy sleepers are aroused by their companions ; and all clustered around the door where stood the man with the precious documents in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the names , to which every fortunate man there present cried Here ! and in response to others some one would answer " in work-house , " " the hospital , " or " the jail , " and not unfrequently came the reply-half-stifled- " dead . " The letters all distributed , the happy men turn away to find some quiet place in which to read theirs , and to talk over the news with some friend , and the disappointed ones to hook , work , or sleep , to chew the bitter cud and nurse a hope for better luck next time . About the first of October the yellow-fever made itself known in our midst . That we should 1 ) 0 instantly moved not humanity alone but the sanitary condition of the city demanded , and I i1*77* DEalvEalNO TuE MAIa. // immediate steps were taken toward that end . The order was to me unwelcome , for I knew another place could not be found where so much comfort could be had , so much kindness shown us , as in the Roper Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were ordered to hold ourselves in readiness to move , and immediately a busy scene commenced , for every one was determined to take away every article of property he possessed . Fortunate it proved that we did so . The market-women turned out en masse when they got wind of the proceeding , and , as we made our last bargains , we were greeted with , " I'se right sorry you'se gwine , massa , " or " Old aunty done used up now , innssa , " and similar expressions of regret ; and well they might regret our departure , for our stay had been no small profit to them . Certainly no such motley crew as ours ever passed through King Street before . Movingday in New York is not to he spoken of in comparison . Every thing we had purchased , or that had been given us , in the line of furniture and of cooking utensils , were brought along . Chairs , stools , tables , kettles , pans , and pots , were strung upon poles , or thrown over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been impressed and loaded for the occasion , and in the rear of the column followed two wagons loaded with " sundries . " At the d6p6t we were packed in box-cars after the usual manner  --  the whistle shrieked , and we were " off from Charleston . " Many made their escape that night by jumping out the doors , or knocking the boards off from the ends of the cars . Early the next morning we arrived in Columbia , and were corralled near the d*p6t , exposed to a scorching sun , from which we could find no shade . Most of us had no rations , and naturally were quite hungry , rushing eagerly after every lot of bread brought for sale . One young lady , who was looking at us from a house near by , seeing our desire for something to eat , burst out crying , exclaiming , " Poor fellows , they are so hungry 1 " God bless her for a kind , sympathizing heart ! I saw in a box-car near by a family of refugees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ( two of them young ladies ) , and an aged grandmother . The furniture and neatness of their poor shelter , as well as their conversation and manners , gave evidence that they were people of refinement who had seen happier days . I afterward found that theirs was no unusual case , and saw a train of thirty cars occupied by the same class of unfortunates . In the afternoon we were moved a short distance , and placed under the guard of the cadets from the military school , who , although boys , were well-drilled soldiers , reminding me more of our own men than any I had seen in the South . One of our number received a severe illustration of their discipline in the shape of a bayonet wound in the back , for passing outside the line to get a melon . At night a severe rain storm came up , and we were soon soaked through , and remained so , unable to sleep , but consoling ourselves with song until the morning , when one hard-tack was issued to each man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was thankful ) , and that was our breakfast . At about 10 A.M. we were marched three miles beyond the town , and turned into a lot of about five acres of what had been a pine grove , but most of the trees had been cut down . The guard and artillery-two pieces-were posted , and we were in our new camp-an open field without shelter or . means of providing it ; many without coats or blankets , and here we looked forward to the winter-especially those in ill health-as a cheerless , hopeless prospect . There was neither wood nor water to be had in camp , and only six were permitted to go out at a time for either , and the same rule applied to attending the calls of nature ; and when it is remembered that there were some 1500 prisoners , the harshness of this rule will be evident . Later , the guard was thrown out so as to take in the brook and wood . At first we had to pick up all the wood we burned ; but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of all , which were found very useful , although the l2rgest portion had not strength enough to use them very effectually . Some , who were very sick , were taken to the hospital in the town , where for a time they were well cared for ; but one afternoon they were turned out to make room for some of their own wounded , marched the three miles to the camp , and turned in among us to endure or to die ; which , I think , our captors little cared . To provide shelter was naturally the desire and work of every one , bringing into play Yankee ingenuity , and what in the army surpasses even that in the architectural line-soldier 's ingenuity , which resulted in the erection of shanties above ground and shanties below ground , of boughs , of limbs , of bark , of blankets-if men were lucky enough to have them to spare-and of old bedticks from the Roper , all thrown together promiscuously , presenting a singular although not unpicturesque appearance , and forming a labyrinth through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for a man to find his way after dark . I should not omit to say that there were a few huts , built substantially of loss , by men able to use and understanding how to use the axe , in which were fire-places and chimneys built of mud and sticks , but they were few  --  the palaces of the city of poverty . The shanty of " my mess " was a bedtick arranged over a pole in the form of a tent , the sides and back thatched with pine boughs . It was a well-ventilated chateau , and would leak when it rained ; when we would rob our bodies of blankets to protect ourselves from the droppings-thinking cold alone was preferable to cold and wet together-turn in , and lie close to keep up the warmth , and , as we " let it rain , " ponder the remark of Mrs. Partington , " This is a checkerberry life . " // We saw but little of people from the outer world , or heard but little from it . Never were we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below par , and only the freshest " fish " invested . " Escape stock " was lively , and np to November 5 , 301 officers realized on it . Many mare bad tried their fortunes , but had been recaptured ; in fact , they were escaping and being brought back every day . The chances of reaching our lines were very small , for the distauce was very great and the people on the alert with l ) lOOd-hOunds ever ready for the scent ; and for a man in poor health it was an undertaking not lightly to be entered upon , even though the pr*e sought was freedom , escape from the jaws of death . Yet ahuost every one pondered it inure or less , and had sketches and maps , more or less finished , of the surrounding country . All the old dodges heretofore alluded to were tried ; and many ran the guard at night , so that it was no uncommon thing to hear sharp firing at some part of the line for a few moments any dark night . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one night they wounded two of their own men . Our favorite method of escape was for men , who had not taken parole , to go for wood , to mix in with those who had done so , and after getting in the woods , their friends would cover them with boughs or with leaves , and there secreted they would remain until after dark . I have known a hundred officers to go out in one day in that way , provided with rations and blankets , their parties and plans all made up . This led to the *trengthening of the guard and the extension of their beats , making their distance from the " dead line " so great that to russ the gauntlet was next to impossible . The following order was also communicated to us : " HSAD-QcAaTEas , s. c. , CRORGIA , AND FLORIDA , cHARLESTON , November 17 , 1864 . Ualaael Means , commanding Federal prison s at Galoembia . " The Lieutenant-General directs that you report tothese head-quarters the name of every officer and man wha escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal officers that they incest gice their parole not to attempt to escape , or they will be confined in a pen , in tile oamo manner the privates now are . " Very respectfully , yaur obedient servauc , " R. C. GeLenaisT , " AcIg Asat . Adjt. - Oea'l . " No attention was paid by the officers to this remarkable order , for we knew that although their power to abuse , as well as their disposition so to do , was limitless , they could not compel us to take such a parole , and we did not , although we knew nothing hut the want of a " pea " would prevent the execution of the threat . Our rations consisted of three pints of meal , half a pint of rice , one pint of bran or grits , one table-spoonful of salt , and a pint of sorglsum for five days , and while ostensibly for five days it had to last into the sixth , and sometimes the seventh , or we went hungry . Went hungry ! that will convey no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I should say , we had to do without . Of meat I saw not an ounce during my stay . They gave us two ounces of soap for twenty days , and as I have lately seen a communication fiom a Confederate officer in our hands who complained of not being furnished with candles , I desire to throw some light on Southern customs , and say tlsat , except when burning the gas at Roper , we knew no light save that which the common Father gives alike to the prisoner and the free . For a steady diet , day after day , for breakfast , dinner , and supper , corn meal and sorghum is not the most palatable of food . It was enough to make the well sick , for the sick it was almost sure death . Imagine a man sick with fever or diarrhea eating a piece of corn bread , or a dish of mush and molasses ! And yet it was this or nothing , for althougis , as elsewhere , there was a sutler , we never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , and of course could not patronize him for any luxuries . The treatment rec&amp;ived by our prisoners at the hands of our enemies , although presented to the public in the papers of the day , has never been portrayed in colors sufficiently vivid , and the fiendisls natures of those men who are set to kill thorn by inches , to torture them to death . have never been set forth in words . In fact , I doubt if language is capable of conveying the horrors of the sufferings of many . Our soldiers in the field say , and say truly , that those at home can never comprehend their hardships ;
