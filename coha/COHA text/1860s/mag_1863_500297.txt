TOUCHING THE SOUL . READER , did it ever strike you that there are many theories touching this soul of ours which arc generally accepted as truths , without any thought whatever on the subject ; so universally accepted , indeed , that it is considered a waste of time to think upon them af all ; but which , upon a thorough investigation , might possibly lose some of their old-time infallibility , and the consideration of which might well repay the trouble , by opening a field of thought at once interesting and in-structive ? Such there are , and in this province alone are we of this day and generation entirely controlled by the opinions of those over wliose dust centuries have rolled . We may speculate freely upon religion , and , while all must acknowledge that true religion is not progressive , new schemes of salvation spring almost daily into life from the brains of heretical thinkers , in their bold presumption stamping with error the simple faith of the primitive Christians . We may peer into the arcana of science and boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may exhaust our mental powers upon points of political economy and the science of government ; and even the domain of ethics may be fearlessly invaded and crowded with doubt . But into the unpretending pathway that leads to the secret nooks of the soul , to the foundations of all spiritual excellence , few feet may stray , and even those only to follow the beaten track worn by the feet of those olden thinkers whose very names have long since passed into oblivion , lest by their deviations they should outrage some of those universal prejudices , whose only claim to consideration is their traditionary origin . And this path is but little trodden in our day , for two reasons ; first , because , to the careless eye , it possesses few attractions , and its claims are lost in those of a more exciting and more eminently practical course of thought ; secondly , because it seems to have been so thoroughly explored that we have only to read the writings of those who have gone before , and listen to traditionary speculations , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our very existence , and , indeed , the only true existence . Two great mistakes . The dying philosopher , one of the wisest the world has ever known , declared that all the knowledge he had gained was but as a grain of sand upon the seashore . So all that is known to-day about the soul is but a drop in the ocean of that great revealing which shall one day dawn upon man 's spiritual existence . There is an infinite field yet unexplored-a very terra incognita to even those who pride themselves upon being learned in the mysteries of the soul . And to him who ventures upon this seemingly lowly path , so far from proving unattractive , it becomes * very Eden of thought . Unlooked-for beauties spring to light on every side ; the very essence of music and poesy float around him as he advances ; while above , around , and through all , sounds the magnificent diapason of everlasting truth . True , there may be little of practical benefit-as the world defines practicality-in searching out the causes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now raising us to the summit of bliss , now plunging us into the depths of despairlittle of practical benefit in endeavoring to analyze the soul itself into its constituent elements , and to bring ourselves face to face with our better , nobler selves , and with the Mighty Power which created us and all things . // But there is , in this inner life , a pleasure higher and more lasting than those evanescent ones which the world can afford , and which elevates and purifies as they do not . And aside from mere pleasure , there is in such a study a practicability-taking the word in a broader and nobler sense-which puts to the blush man 's busy schemes for wealth and honor . The beauties and sublimity of nature may indeed fill us with awe at the omnipotence of the mighty Architect , and with love and gratitude for His goodness , but it is only in the presence of the soul-His greatest work-that we realize the awful power of the Creator ; it is only when threading the secret avenues of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communion with God , and bow in adoration before Him who doeth all things well . ' Therefore , I maintain that he whose meditations run most in this channel is not only the happiest , but the purest man ; that his views of life are the broadest and noblest ; that he it is who is most open to the appeal of suffering or of sorrow ; who is most ready to sacrifice self and work for the good of his fellow beings , and to discharge faithfully his duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call him . But I am digressing into a prosy essay , which I did not intend , and neglecting that which I did intend , namely , to jot down a few theories which have crept into the brain of one not much given to musing . For even I  --  a poor marching sub ' - sitting here by a cheery coal grate , and watching the white smoke as it curls lazily up from the bowl of my meersehaum , have theories touching the soul-theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke wreaths , but , unlike them , growing more and more voluminous as they ascend , till I am like to be lost in the ocean of speculations which my own musings have summoned up . I heard , to-night , a strain of weird , unearthly music , sweet and sad beyond expression , but distant and fleeting . Yet long after it had ceased , the chord that it awakened in my heart continued to vibrate as with the echo of the strain which had departed . An unutterable , indescribable longing filled my soul  --  a vague yearning for something , I knew not what . My whole spiritual being seemed exalted to the clouds , yet restrained by some galling chain from the heaven it sought to enter . And then I asked myself ; What is the secret of this mysterious power of music ; where shall we look for the cause of those undefinable yet overwhelining emotions which it never fails to excite ? A hopeless question it seemed , one which the philosophers of all ages have failed to solve , perhaps because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and again , perhaps it has baffled them as it has me , and tens of thousands of others of the humbler portion of humanity . And so I fell to dreaming after this wise : The soul of man is created perfect , so far as regards the presence of every faculty necessary for its development , for its happiness , or misery , in this world or the next . Circumstances may alter it in degree , but in its constituent elements never . The same yesterday , to-day , and to-morrow , at the moment of its creation and a thousand ages to come . Not even its passage from the body into its future and eternal home can endow it with a single new faculty , or eradicate one of the old . Yet each one of these faculties , capabilities , or sensibilities , is capable of development to an infinite degree . And in this development lies the soul 's progress to perfection ; it is to go on , through all the ages of its eternal existence , constantly approaching the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two parallel lines , which mathematicians bisect to infinity . Certain of these faculties , of the very existence // of which even the soul itself is unconscious , are those whose province lies purely in the world beyond , to which we all are tending . Never exerted in this life , with which they have nothing to do , though all the earthly existence they sleep quietly in their hidden cells ; but when once the silver cord is loosed , andthe freed spirit mounts into itsnative atmosphere , then these dormant powers and susceptibilities are awakened from their slumbers , and take the lead in the march of development , outstripping all others in the race , and soon becoming the ruling powers of the soul . These are they which shall listen to the music of heaven-these are the spiritual senses which shall hear and see and taste and feel those ineffable glories , of which our earthly pilgrimage has no appreciation , and which , if presented to us in the body , we could not perceive , nor , perceiving , comprehend . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of Omnipotence , and drinking in and pouring out the full stream of divine and never-failing love and gratitude . Reader , did you ever listen to the sympathetic vibrations of a musical string ? Place in the corner of your room a guitar-it matters not if it have but a single string , that alone is sufficient for the experiment-then , sitting at some distance from it , sing , shout , or play upon some loud-toned instrument , or , beginning at the foot of the chromatic scale , sound , round and full , each semitone in succession and at separate intervals . The instrument is mute to every note until you strike the one to which the guitar string is attuned ; then indeed , the spirit of melody imprisoned within the musical string recognizes its kindred sound , and springs sweetly forth to meet it . You pause , and a low , sweet strain sighs softly through the room , as if a zephyr had swept the string , dying gently away like the faintest breathing of the evening breeze . Repeat the note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpart replies , swelling higher than before , as if in gentle remonstrance that you should deem it necessary to call again to that which has already replied . Even so it is with these hidden faculties or susceptibilities of which I have been speaking . In the notes of witching music , in the numbers of poesy , in the sight of beauty , either of nature or of art , either aesthetic or moral , these silent powers recognize a faint approximation to that beauty with which they will have to do in that world where they shall be called into action : they too recognize the kindred spirit , and , springing forward to meet it , vibrate in unison with the chord . But yet , restrained by their prison of clay , bound down by the immutable law which bids them wait their time , their great deep is but troubled , and while , from their swaying and surging , a delicious emotion spreads over the soul , filling the whole being with indescribable joy , it is an emotion which we can not fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we enjoy . To each and all of us the doors of heaven are closed for the present ; we never have heard the songs of the celestial spheres , and how should we recognize their echo here on earth , even though that echo is swelling through our own hearts l And the sadness and yearning which such e*otions invariably produce , may they not be the yearning for heaven 's supernal beauty , and sadness for the chains which bar us from its full realization ? Or is it the reflex of the struggles and the disappointment of that portion of the spirit which I have assigned as the mover of the emotion itself ? Carry still further the parallel of the vibrating string , and we shall illustrate the different degrees of emotion . It is only by sounding a note in exact unison with that to which the string is attuned that we get the full force of the sympathetic vibration , which is more or less distinct according as we approach or depart from the keynote , till // Touching t/*e Soul . we reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even so do our emotions increase in exact proportion as the exciting cause approaches perfection-according as the beauty heard or seen or felt approaches the heavenly keynote . A simple ballad awakens a quiet pleasure , while the magnificent symphonies of Beethoven or Mozart fill the soul with a rapture with which the former feeling is no more to be compared than the brooklet with the ocean ; for the latter is inexpressibly nearer to its heavenly modeL Carry out the theory to its legitimate result , and we shall see that if it were possible to produce , here on earth , music equal to that which rings through the celestial arches-if it were possible here to create beauty in any form , which sliould fully equal that which shall greet the freed spirit on its entrance into that better world , then indeed would our emotions reach their highest possible climax ; then indeed should we hear and see and feel , not with the bodily senses , but with the senses of the soul ; then would there be no vagueness , no sadness in the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our knowledge , comprehending all spiritual things . Then would our heaven be here on earth , and we should desire no other . Wisely has a great and merciful God thrown an impenetrable veil between the soul and its future belongings , and clipped its wings lest it soar too soon . So much for a simple strain of music . A trifling matter , perhaps you will say , to make so much talk about . Not quite so trifling as you may think , however ; for a single musical chord is a more important and complex thing than to the careless ear it would seem . Who ever cares to study a single chord of music ? And yet how few are there who know that it is composed of not three or four but a myriad of separate and distinct sounds , appreciable in exact proportion to the cultivation of the ear ? The uncultivated ear perceives but the three or four primitive or fundamental notes of the chord , while , to the nicer perception , the more delicate susceptibility of the ear trained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come harmonic above harmonic , sounds of melody above , beneath , and beyond the few prime motors which act as the nucleus to the gush of tiny harmony which fills the earsounds clear and distinct , yet blending in perfect order and symmetry with their fundamental notes , and partaking so much of their character and following with such unerring certainty their direction as to become voiceless to the ear unskilled . And why should this not be so ? Is it not *reasonable to suppose that the current of undulations in the atmosphere producing these united sounds should communicate its agitation in some degree to the circumambient air , creating thousands of delicate ramifications branching off in all possible directions from the main channel , yet all partaking of its peculiar character , and becoming in themselves separate sounds , yet consonant and harmonious ? Ah ! could we but see the vibrations of the atmosphere which a single musical chord produces  --  the rolling bass , the gliding alto , the sweeping soprano , and the soaring tenor , rolling onward in one broad channel of harmony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its curling , twinkling , shifting , blending , soaring mists of delicate-toned harmonics , how would our enjoyment of music be enhanced ! how would both eye and ear be delighted , enraptured with the poetry of motion , the harmony of sound , the eternal and indestructible order and concord and consonance of both sight and sound ' ! But this is reserved for the experience of pure spirit-this is reserved to enhance the beauty of the celestial realm . Some day we shall see and hear and know it all-some day in that heavenly future , when the soul of man shall converse and praise and // adore in one blended strain of resthetic beauty , which shall contain within itself the essence of all music and poesy and enraptured sight . Thinking thus earnestly about the soul , one comes naturally to speculate upon the question of the spirit 's return to earth after its final departure from the body . It is a beautiful belief that the souls of our departed friends are permitted to hover around us here on earth , watching all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrows , mourning over our transgressions , and rejoicing at our good deeds-in a word , acting the parts of guardian angels . And there are many , even in our ( lay , who hold such a faith . Yet it is a belief founded in imagination and poetic ideas of beauty , rather than in sober truth either of reason or of revelation . The strongest argument I have ever heard against this belief is contained in the remark of a poor old English peasant . Sir , ' said he , I doan*t believe the speerits can come back to us ; for if they go to the good place , they doa n't want to come back ere again ; and if they goes to the bad place , why God woa n't let em . ' There was more philosophy in the remark than he knew of ; and I have not yet found the philosopher who did not stagger under it . But there is another view of the subject . I hold that the bodijy senses can only perceive material things , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual presence of disembodied spirits , neither could we perceive them , nor they us , as material bodies . They might , indeed , perceive the souls within us , but could only be cognizant of our actions as those of pure spirit ; while we , blinded by the impenetrable screen of the body , would be debarred of even this recognition . For through only three of the bodily senses-sight , hearing , and feelinghave the boldest of so-called spiritunlists dared to attempt the proof of their doeTouching the Soul . trine . To begin with the latter , the essential quality of the sense of feeling is resi8tance , without which there can be no perception . And what is resistance ? In one class of cases it is simply the ViS inertice of matter : in the other and only remaining one , the opposition of some material matter to the force of gravity . Even the perception of the lightest zephyr depends upon the resistance of the atmosphere . Does spirit possess this quality of resistance ? The argument on this head is closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual . If the wave theory of light and sound be correct  --  and it is so generally accepted that few writers dare risk their reputations in the defence of any other-the senses of sight and hearing come , for the purposes of this argument , in the same category . Nothing can affect the ear which is not capable of producing vibration in the atmosphere , which may be considered , in comparison with pure spirit , a material substance . Here again the argument is clinched by the mere distinction between matter and spirit , the one being the very antipodes of and incapable of acting upon the other . Natural science tells us that the white light of the sun is composed of the seven colors of the spectrum in combination , which colors may be readily separated by the refraction of the prism . All objects possess , in a greater or less degree , the power of decomposing light and absorbing colors . Now a ray of sunlight falling upon any given object is in a measure decomposed , a portion of its integral colors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the eye , producing by their combination what we call the color of the object . Thus , a ray thrown upon a pure white object is absorbed not at all , but wholly reflected as it came , and the consequence is the proper combination upon the retina of all the colors , producing  --  a white object . On the contrary , a // ray falling upon what we call a lilacic object , is wholly absorbed , and the consequence is a total absence of light , or blackness . So a red object absorbs all the orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , and violet of the sunlight , reflecting upon the eye only the red , which is perceived as the coloi* of the object . And so on through all the combinations of the spectrum . Only material substances can either absorb or reflect : therefore is spirit again excluded ; for how can it act upon the eye save through those agencies with reference to which the eye itself was constructed , and which , as we have shown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole argument in a single sentence , the physical senses are dependent , for their perceptions , entirely upon the action of matter , and hence spirit , which is not matter , can in no way affect them . But here we are met by the record of Holy Writ , which declares that in those former times spirits did often appear to men . Aye ! and so there were miracles in those days . But all these things are done away with . Moreover did not those spirits find it necessary in every case to clothe themselves with the image of some living form in order to make themselves perceptible to human eyes ? So that it was really the form within which the spirit was ensconced that was perceived , and not the spirit itself . And how shall we know what gases of the physical world these spirits were permitted , through a special interposition of the Deity and for the furtherance of His divine ends , to assemble together into a concrete form for their temporary dwelling and as a medium through which to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that God would now , in these days , give spirits special permission to return to earth and take upon themselves such forms for the mere purpose of tipping tables and pianofortes , rapping upon doors , windows , and empty skulls , misspelling their owa names , and murdering Lindley Murray , and performing clownish tricks for the amusement of a gaping crowd ? But whence arises this great delusion ? Simply from our total lack of knowledge of the glory of that heaven upon which we all hope to enter . Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither hath it entered into the imagination of man to conceive ' the glory of God , the splendor , the magnificence , the supernal beauty of the Celestial . We know indeed that we shall enter upon a w*ld whose immensity , whose sublimity , whose awful beauty shall far surpass the experience of man ; but not even the wildest imagination , fed by all the knowledge that astronomers have gained of world beyond world , and system beyond system , of spheres to which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whizzing comets sweeping their way with the speed of thought for thousands of years through planet-teeming space-not even such an imagination , in its farthest stretch , is able to conceive the glory of that dwelling place which shall be ours . If to-day we were permitted to peer but for a moment into that heavenly abode , then should we see how impossible , to the soul which has once entered upon that beatific state , would be a thought of return to this grovelling earth . There their aspirations are ever upward and onward toward the Great White Throne* with no thought for the things left behind , even were there not a great gulf fixed ' between earth and heaven . And how often do we hear the opinion expressed that the souls of the just do pass , in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , ' from the things of earth to the full burst of heavenly beauty and sublimity , shooting like the lightning 's flash from its prison house of clay to the presence of its God . Reasoning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and revelation are dumb , is the only basis we can rest upon , such a passage would be to the soul instant annihilation ; the // shock would be too great for even its enlarged susceptibilities . It must become gradually accustomed to the new sights and sounds , and so pass slowly up from one stage of perception and knowledge to another in regular gradation , to the climax of its revelation . Reader , did you ever come suddenly from a darkened room into the full blaze of noonday ? In such a case the eye is dazzled , blinded for a moment , arni must gradually accommodate itself to the unaccustomed light before its gaze can be clear and steady . So , too , the ear long shut up in profound silence is deafened by an ordinary sound . Even so the soul , suddenly entering upon the unaccustomed and stupendous sights and sounds of the spiritual world , would be blinded , dazzled , as I have said , to annihilation . It is necessary that its newly awakened faculties , which during its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be too suddenly called into action , lest they be overpowered by the awful revelation . Like the bodily senses , they require time and gentle though steadily increasing action to develop them , and assimilate them to their new surroundings in their new field of action . And this is my theory . The soul , when freed from the body , floats gently upward , dectf , dumb , and blind-paralyzed , as it were , into a state of neutral existence . Splendid sights may spread around it , wave after wave of eternal sound may roll in upon it , but it sees not , hears not , feels not , not having yet acquired the new faculties of perception . After a certain space of timewhich may be days or weeks or months in duration-through its secret chambers steals a thrill of sentient emotion ; it recognizes its own existence , and the dawn of that eternal life for which it was created . Slowly one sight after another begins faintly to glimmer before it , as objects emerge from the gloom of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . Anon , low , faint murmurs of sound steal in upon it , far distant at first , but gradually swelling as it approaches , till at last , around the freed spirit peals the full orchestral glory of eternity . And so it goes on , * passing slowly from stage to stage , apprehending new sights , new sounds , and comprehending new truths . And so it shall go on , through all the cycles of eternity , constantly approaching nearer to the Godhead , yet never to become God . Do you ask me how can these things be ? Let us draw an illustration from nature . The science of acoustics tells us that an organ pipe of a certain length gives forth the deepest , or as musicians would say , the lowest sound that art can produce ; that all beyond this given length is nothingness , and gives out no sound . What shall we say then ? that doubling the length of the tube destroys the vibration of the imprisoned air ? Nay , verily , the air still vibrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the gamut of the natural ear , which was created to comprehend only sounds within a certain compass : its capacity goes no farther , and any sound pitched either above or below that compass we can not perceive . In proof of this is the simple fact that a cultivated ear-that is , an ear of enlarged capacity , can readily catch , the faintest harmonics of a guitar , to which others are totally deaf . Again : I have stood by the Falls of Niagara , and listened in vain for that deep , unearthly roar of which so much has been written and sung . The rush and the gurgle of the Waters was there , the sweeping surge of the mighty river , but Niagara 's hollow roar was absent . Again and again my ears were stretched to catch the awful sound , till the effort became almost painful , but in vain . And yet the sound was present , ay ! eternally present , but the note was just beyond the gamut of my ear . Standing thus for some moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through her hidden laws , // wrought a miracle in my person . The long-continued strain enlarged the capacity of the ear , even as the muscles of the arm are strengthened by frequent and energetic action , or as a faculty of the mind itself is developed by exercise . Lower and lower sank the scale of my aural conceptions , till , as it approached the keynote of the cataract , a low murmur began to steal in upon me , deeper than the deepest thunder ' tones , and seemingly a thousand miles distant . Louder and louder it swelled , nearer and nearer it approached as the hearing faculty sank downward , till the keynote was reached , and thenthe rush and gurgle of the waters was swept away , and in its place resounded the awful tones of earth 's deepest basso j2rofundo . Then for the first time I kealized the terrible sublimity of Niagara-the voice of God speaking audibly through one of the mightiest works of His creation . And as , musing , I moved away from the appalling scene , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments might be that of the soul when entering upon the sublimities of the future state . Hence my theory , which may go for what it is worth , or , as the Yankees would say , is good f'or what it will bring. * Reader , do you never feel an intense longing to live over again the scenes of your youth ? to begin at some certain period long gone by , and taste again the sweets that have passed away forever ? It is one of the bitterest feelings of the heart that years are slipping away from us one by one ; that the delights of our youth have gone , never to return , and that we shall not look upon their like again ; ' that the days are fast coming on when we shall say we have no pleasure in them , and that we are rapidly verging upon the lean and slippered pantaloon . ' Were there any future rejuvenation , when we might stand again upon the threshold of life and look over its fair fields with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ? * its dreariness , and become but a brief though painful pilgrimage through which we were to pass to joy beyond . But since this can never be , old age is the rust which dims the brightness of every earthly joy , and is looked forward to by youth only with a shudder . Hundreds of bold and daring navigators have left their bones to whiten amid the snows and ice of the arctic regions , lured thither by the thirst of fame or of knowledge , in the pursuit of science , and in search of the Northwest Passage . But suppose some more fortunate adventurer should discover there , even at the very pole itself a veritable fountain of youth and beauty , ' whose rejuvenating waters could restore the elasticity of youth to the frame of age , smoothing away its wrinkles , and imprinting the bloom of childhood upon its cheeks , bringing back the long-lost freshness and buoyaney to the soul ; would not the navigators of those dangerous seas be multiplied in the ratio of a million to one ? Should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , submitting to every privation , sacrificing wealth , fame , everything , in quest of the precious boon ? What a hecatomb of mouldering bones would bestrew those fields of ice I For though not one in ten thousand might reach the promised goal , the hegira would still go on till the end of time , each deluded mortal hoping that he might be that happy , fortunate one . As the dying millionnaire would give all that he possesses for one moment of time , so would all mankind throw every present blessing into the scale , in the hope of drawing the prize in that great lottery . There is a fountain of youth and beauty open to every soul beneath the sun : there is a rejuvenation both to soul and body , which shall not only restore all the freshness of the bygone days , but also the joys of the past , a thousandfold brighter and dearer , and that by a process which will not need // repeating , for that youth will be eternal . I am using no metaphor now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is such a fount , but not here : it gushes in the courts of that house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens . For the soul , at the moment of its separation from the body , enters upon a new life , whose course shall be exactly the reverse of that of earth , for it shall constantly increase in all the attributes of youth . There will be no dimming of the faculties , but a continual brightening ; no grieving over an irrecoverable past , but a constant rejoicing over joys present and to come . There will be no past there , but a present more tangible than this , which is ever slipping from us , and a future far brighter and more certain than any that earth can afford . Strange that men should fail to look at heaveti in this light ! For thoughtless youth , to whom the world is new and ' bright , and pleasure sparkles with a luring gleam , there is some little palliation for neglect of the things of heaven ; but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound , for whom all giddy pleasures have lost their glow , and nought remains but the cares and anxieties of life ? Of what worth is earthly pleasure to him who has already drained its cup to the dregs ? Of what worth is wealth and honor to the frame that has already begun to descend the slope of time ? All these baubles would be gladly sacrificed for the return of that youth which has passed away ; and shall they not be given up for that eternal youth which shall not pass away ? We mourn for departed loved ones , but what would be our grief and despair if death were annihilation - if we knew that we should never meet them again in all eternity ? But we feel that in heaven the olden love shall be renewed ; that the forms that now are mouldering in the dust shall be recognized and greeted there , and that the friendships created here shall ripen there in close companionship through never-ending cycles ; and thus is death robbed of half its terrors . But the way to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few there be who find it . ' Alas ! how unsatisfactory are even the choicest blessings of life ! Wealth brings only care , and the millionnaire toils all his life for-his food and clothes and lodging ; dies unregretted , and is soon forgotten . Honor brings not content , and does but increase the thirst it seeks to assuage . The poor and the unknown are generally happier than the wealthy and famous . Vanity of vanities , saith the preacher , all is vanity and vexation of spirit ; ' and what was true of human nature when the preacher ' wrote , is true to-day . Admit that life is but a succession of pleasures that can never pall , and the world one vast Elysian field , and that the care of the soul requires the abnegation of every delight , and spreads a gloomy pall over all the brightness of earth ; yet even in that case , a life wholly devoted to spiritual interests were but a weary , temporary pilgrimage , which we should gladly endure for a season , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world beyond , could we but look upon the future life in the light of r lity . Ah ! there is the difficulty , for we are of the earth earthy , ' and , although we may fervently believe , can not comprehend , can not recdire eternity . To too many Christians of the present day eternity , heaven , God , are not a tangible reality , but rather a poetic dream , floating in the atmosphere of faith , but which their minds can not grasp . Hence they worship an idea rather than a reality . The noblest pleasures of life , in fact the only real , permanent , exalting , and , I might add , developing pleasures , are divided into two classes those of the heart , and those of the intellect . Yet both , though different in their action , spring from the same central truth . Touching the Soul . // The happiest man is he whose life is spent in doing good , seeking no other reward than the gratification of beholding the true happiness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he only is the true Christian of our day and generation . For he who so ardently loves his fellow men can not but love his God . The pleasures of the intellect can never pall , but do constantly increase and brighten , becaMse in them the soul enters its native province and acts in that sphere which is its own for all eternity . Yet how do they all lead the mind up to its great Creator ! Not a single disco very in science , not an investigation of the simplest law of nature , not aa examination of the most insignificant bud or flower or leaf ; and , above and beyond all , not an inquiry in the great truths of morals , of ethics , of religion , or of the very constitution of the mind itself but at once , and in the mo* natural consequence , reveals the power and the goodness of Godbrings God himself as clearly before us as he can be manifested to our fettered souls . Yet if these pleasures too were but temporary , if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings , the pursnit of them would but beget disgust and discontent , and they would be classed with the fragile things which awaken no feelings of awe , nor enhance the glory of the soul . But thank God ! they will endure forever . Truth is eternal-its origin is coeval with the Creator , and , like H im , it shall have no end . - Hence all real pleasure is from God himself , and leads directly back to him again . And he who , appreciating the truest joy of existence here , makes auch themes his study , should and will seek the only prolongation of those delights which shall carry them alone of all life 's blessings with him across the dark river , in the worship and adoration of that omnipotent Being from whose hand these gifts descend , who alone can perpetuate them when time shall have passed away-that God who doeth all things well .
