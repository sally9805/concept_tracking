INTRODUCTION DAVY CROCKETT , or be sure you 're right , then go ahead Davy Crockett , by Frank Hitchcock Murdoch , is probably the best-known of the American frontier melodramas , a popular type to which Across the Continent ! may also be said to belong , by virtue of its last act . Apparently the play was written by Murdoch specifically for the well-known actor , Frank Mayo . The manuscript on which this version is based was supplied to Mr. Clark by Professor Arthur Hobson Quinn , who secured it from a member of the Mayo family . Both Professor Quinn and Mr. Clark had access to another manuscript of the same play , which was shorter and otherwise less satisfactory than the one here printed . Murdoch , who was acting in Philadelphia at the time , did not see the original production of his play by Mayo at the Opera House in Rochester on September 23 , 1872 . This original production was by no means a success , but Mayo believed in the play and continued to work over the script . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences as he toured from place to place . On February 24 , 1873 , Mayo brought the piece to the Park Theatre in Brooklyn , and played it with the regular Park Theatre company . In this production Blanche Mortimer played the rle of the heroine , Eleanor Vaughn , opposite Mayo in the title rle ; J. Z. Little played the villain . Mayo 's faith in the play was gradually being justified , but the real success of the piece and its long run began with the first Manhattan production at Wood 's Museum on June 2 , 1873 , starring Frank Mayo and Rosa Rand in the leading rles . The following is a transcript of the cast of characters and the program of the presentation at Wood 's : Davy Crockett , aged twenty five Mr. Frank Mayo Eleanor Vaughn , aged sixteen Miss Rosa Rand Major Hector Royston , aged forty Mr. T.

" After the successful production at Wood 's Museum and after having played it in various other cities . Mayo again brought Davy Crockett to New York City . On March 9 , 1874 , he opened a successful run at Niblo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rles . The other rles were played by the regular members of Niblo 's company . This production , which ran continuously to April 18 , further established the success of the play and justified Mayo 's faith in it . From this time on until his death on June 8 , 1896 , Mayo continued to play Davy Crockett throughout the United States with continuous popular success and acclaim . One June 9 , 1879 , he began an English tour with the play at the Alexandra Theatre in Liverpool . Mayo kept count of the number of times he appeared in the play up to his two thousandth appearance , but after that he states that he lost count . He gave his last performance of the play at the Broadway Theatre in Denver on June 6 , 1896 , just two days prior to his death from heart disease . PROPERTY PLOT ACT I.
