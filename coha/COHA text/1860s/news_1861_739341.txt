txt The Inquirer has the following from Fortress Monroe , derived from rebel sources : In anticipation of the arrival of the great ex pediflon , the rebels have been engaged in erecting batteries upon a point at Hilton 's Head , and opposite the neck of land . The principal fortification on Hilton 's Head was denominated " Fort Walker , " and situated on low land , and partially concealed by trees and underbrush . Adjoining it were other batteries of smaller size , but so constructed as to prove a formidable bar to the entrance of vessels . Fort Beaufort was of considerable importance , having been mounted with heavy guns . The garrisons are supposed to have been South Carolina regiments , assisted by additional regiments which were sent from Richmond . The batteries at Bay Point , opposite Hilton 's Head , were equally as formidable . Inside of Port Royal entrance , and behind the batteries , lay the fleet of Commodore TATNALL , which consisted only of small vessels , carrying a few heavy guns , but principally light ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these remained-outside the mouth of the entrance until the arrival of our fleet , when they formed in miniature line of battle in the position already stated , ? behind the guns of their own forte , and across the entrance . : On the morning of Thursday last the United /Rates fleet , consisting of forty-two vessels , headedlii.itte ? flag-ship , approached the mouth of Port Royal entrance . This was at half past 9 . o'clock . Several of the transports remained off the coast . The approach of the great fleet created a great stir in the rebel batteries . Upon arriving at a suitable position , the guns of the fleet opened a continuous Ere upon Forts Walker and Beauregard , . as wed as those upon Bay Point . Under cover of this fire an effort was made to run the gauntlet of The batteries , the result of which was eminently satisfactory . A number of the vessels passed through the shot and shell from the shore batteries with very trifling injuries . At least fifteen of them succeeded in passing up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union fleet sailed up , tile Musquito fleet of Commedore TATNALL opened fire , but seeing the impossibility of making any resistance , soon dispersed , and some were forced to run on shore , while others were driven up the inlets , almost out of sight . Commodore TATNALL went on shore with his teen to assist in working the batteries and to use , there against the vessels of the Union fleet , which were endeavoring to follow the advance Union force . It must not tie imagined , however , that the pas safe Of the fleet through the channel was the work of a moment . It was not accomplished until the firheg had continued from 94 o'clock in the morning .10 nearly 5 o'clock in the evening . During the fight ; one of the Union gunboats is believed to have lbeen burned and three steamers disabled . It is acknowledged by the enemy that they had twenty linen killed in Fort Walker ; but it Is linpossitile to state what their loss was at the other batteries , although very doubtless great , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns being well aimed and of heavy calibre . No sooner did our vessels go past the batteries at Port ' loyal entrance , and slide into what is termed Bread River , than they made for the mouths of the inlets leading to Beaufort , Savannah and Charleston . These they immediately blockaded , although not in time to prevent the escape of some small rebel vessels . Not one of the National vessels was sunk , and the only one believed to have been destroyed by the fire was the gunboat referred to above . The burning of this is described as being a grand spectacle , the guns going off as the flames reached them , and throwing the shell far into the woods on shore . The crew are said to have passed through a murderous fire to another yes . sel , but they escaped with very little , if any , loss . Union vessels acted under special instructions in at once blockading the inlets which lead to most important points , and which afforded loop-holes of escape to the enemy . While a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four ships mads at once for Beaufort , and at 3 o'clock on Thursday these vessels were in sight of the town . A dispatch dated Beaufort , Nov. 7 , to the Charleston Mercury , says that at the time designated the Union forces were preparing to effect a landing , evidently with the design of throwing up intrenchments and attacking the town . We have no means of knowing the exact loss of the Union forces , but the rebels confess that their own firing was very bad , and their artillerymen badly in want of practice . They declare , mom cover , that the guns in the forts were not properly mounted . When Corn . TATNALL went to assist the men in the forts , he found that many of their cannon were actually dismounted by their own rebound . To this fault the rebel journals attribute their defeat , and loudly call upon the Confederate Government to find out where the blame rests . A telegraphic dispatch which left Richmond on Saturday last , stated that there was nothing particularly important on the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government has prohibited any further information from coming north of Richmond , and this course implies that they have suffered a heavy defeat . The Charleston Mercury , of the 8th inst. , after summing up the result , says : " In the promiscuous chase the Yankees seem to have driven Commodore Textual:6 mosquito fleet up the creeks leading to Savannah , and cut off all water communication with Charleston by hermetically sealing Skulk Creek . Although the Yankees have effected as yet no landing , it is certain that they have made some progress , and it behoves us immediately to send such reinforcements as may be needed to checkmate any movements they may make towards gaining even the smallest foothold upon our soil . If the invaders can take Charleston with 25,000 men , let them have it , as we would be unworthy to possess it , and it will be a fit memorial  --  laid in ashes ? of our own Southern im becility .

The practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence the successful passing of seven of the enemy 's men-of-war . Their transports are . still outside . The loss on our side thus far has been very slight , and the troops are in good heart . The firing of the Yankee war vessels was very accurate . Hilton 's Head and Bay Point , as at first reported , received the brunt of the attack , Our failure to sink any of the vessels which passed our batteries is owing to the Door practice of the artillerists . " ' The enemy 's ships , which have passed our batteries , can be distinctly seen from Beaufort . Forts Walker - and Beauregard are still firing . The enemy has lost one gunboat , which was burned . Shells can be seen front here bursting in the woods . Our lines of communication are completely cut off , unless more troops are sent here with artillery and cavalry . Four ships are now in sight over the land and up as far as Skulk Creek .
