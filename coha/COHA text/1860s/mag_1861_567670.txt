ARTICLE X.-DR . BUSHNELL 'S " CHRISTIAN NURTURE . " Chri8tian Nurture . By HORACE BUSHNELL . New York : Charles Scribuer. 1861. l2mo. pp. 407 . ABOUT fourteen years ago Dr. Bushnell published two discourses under the title of Ckri8tian Narture , which , like some other productions of this original and gifted writer , awakened considerable thought and theological discussion . These were afterwards republished , with other articles on subjects " adjacent thereto , " in a volume under the same title . This book met a want in the Christian mind , especially of this country , deeper and wider , and more practical , than almost any other since the days of Edwards ; a want of which the church itself was but indistinctly conscious until this awakening word was spoken . Few persons trained in the New England theology , and partaking the current religious notions of the times , were aware of the intense individualiem into which they had been imperceptibly drawn by the prevalence of these notions . The divine idea of the Family , as an institution ordained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly for the propagation and conservation of piety in the world , having an organic life and unity , which may as truly become the channel and inhabitation of grace , as of depravity , transmitting religion or godliness in the line of natural descent-this idea was well nigh lost out of the Christian consciousness ; and the family was regarded as little more than a collection of individual and independent wills , each poised on its own center of responsibility , and forming its own character , which character was totally and hopelessly evil , until the sovereign grace of God renewed it by some sudden stroke of conversion coming to it from without . That a child might grow up in piety from its earliest years , or that there could be any converting grace in the unconscious influences and atmosphere of a Christian home-that the Spirit of God might so inform and sanctify // these influences as to make them regenerating and sanctifying powers around the soul of the child from the first dawn of consciousness ,  --  was a conception too remote from the prevalent theories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence the main reliance and hope , as regards the increase of the church , was in revivals of religion , whose accepted theory was that they had no regular or systematic place in the divine economy , or none whose laws could be ascertained , but were abnoi*mal developnients or restorations of spiritual power which ought never to have been lost ; and the effect of which , as thus depended on , was to place the extraordinary above the ordinary means of grace , and in the same degree to discourage ill efforts and expectations on the plane of domestic every-day duty and ordinary Christian living . In a word , the idea of parental re8pon8ilrility for the conversion and Christian character of their children , and their duty to train them up as Christians , in the nurture and admonition of the Lord , was almost ignored under the all prevailing individualism of the day . It was not strange , therefore , that a book aiming to restore this idea , and to hold up this duty in all its bearings and connections , should awaken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not propose to revive a discussion which has had its day . Whatever prejudices or misapprehensions were awakened by the original discourses on Christian Nurture have long since passed away . The Christian mind has begun to recover from the extreme individualism into which it had been led or driven , and is in a condition more favorable for the apprehension and candid weighing of the truths and arguments contained in the book before us . The present work is not a republication of the former , as its title might lead many to suppose , but a substantially new treatise , of nearly twice the size , and containing the author 's more mature and complete views on the subject . Its relation to the first may be seen in a few words from the author 's preface . " In preparing it , " he says , " I could not easily consent to lay aside , or pass into oblivion , the two discourses above // referred to , for under the fortune that befel them they had become a little historical . In this fuller treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand , requiring the additions made to take their shape or type . Thirteen new essays , in the form of discourses , though never used as such , but written simply for the discussion 's sake , are thus added ; and the volume which virtually covers the ground of a treatise , takes the form of successive topical discussions , or essays , on so many themes included in the general subject . . . I need offer no apology for retaining the old title , in a volume that is virtually new ; or for reasserting with more emphasis and deliberation , after an interval of years , what the years have only established , and made firm in my Christian convictions . " The work is divided into two parts ; the first of which treats of the Doctrine , the second of the Jifiode . In the first part the author discusses what Christian Nurture is , or unfolds the true idea of Christian Nurture in distinction from that which is not Christian ,  --  eliminating the many false and crude and even barbarous notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious education . As fundamentally connected with this idea , he proceeds to treat of the Organic Unity of the Family ; Infant Baptism , its first development and its apostolic authority ; the Church Membership of children ; and the outpopulating power of the Christian Stock . Among the topics discussed , in the second part , is the question , When and where the Nurture begins ; Parental Qualifications ; Physical Nurture as a means of grace ; Family Government ; Plays and Pastimes ; The Christian Teaching of Children ; Family Prayers , &amp;c . From this outline of topics discussed , it will be seen how large and important is the sphere embraced in the book . But this mere surface view will suggest little , especially to those unacquainted with the genius of the author , of the wealth of thought and wisdom that makes up its substance . It is the most instructive book , we venture to say , that can be put into the hands of a parent , touching the twofold sacred relationship // he sustains to God iLud his children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of the other . No Christian parent , especially , can read this book as it should be read , without rising from its perusal a wiser and a better man ; without a deeper and more trembling sense of responsibility for those young immortals whose character and destiny he holds in his hand . If there is anything glorious , yet fearful , to contemplate , it is the soul of a child , as it comes fresh from the hand of its Creator , to receive and unfold a character in this world . What that character shall be ; what capacities lie folded within it , or may descend upon it ? What destinies of good or evil , of blessedness or woe , wait before that frail and innocent being ? - are questions that may well thrill the soul of a parent as he looks on his infant child . And when the thought rises upon him , calmly and solemnly , growing into a full-orbed conviction , that he is to be the parent of that future character as truly as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , it is given , consciously or unconsciously , to mold and fix the character , and shape the destiny of his child forever ,  --  what words can measure the power of the motives here brought to bear upon him , so to live and so to be , as such a momentous consequence requires ? In this view the book before us is one of the most eloquent and powerful arguments for Christian living that has ever been furnished . If Dr. Bushnell had made no other contribution to Christian literature than this , the church might well thank him in the name of all her children ; and future generations , we are sure , will rise up and call him blessed . Our limits do not permit any extended or elaborate review ; the most we shall attempt at present is to lay before our readers such an idea of the book and its contents as will enlighten , if not increase , their desire to peruse it for themselves . In the first two discourses-which are really but one discourse in two parts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire book has grown  --  the author discusses the question , what Christian Nurture is ; or unfolds what he von . XIX. 31 // conceives to be the true idea of Christian Education . This he defines as follows : " That the child is to grow up a Christian , and never know himself as being otherwise . In other words , the aim , effort and expectation should he , not as is commonly assumed , that the child is to grow up in sin , to he converted after he comes to a mature age ; but that he is to open on the world as one that is spiritually renewed , not remembering the time when he went through a technical experience , but seeming rather to have loved what is good from his earliest years . " It is not strange , at first view , that an idea so high above the current notions and ordinary experience of the church , should be questioned a little before being admitted to a place among recognized and established truths . And yet , in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so beautifully consistent with all that is revealed in the Bible concerning the method of God 's grace to man , and with the manifest design and constitution of the family , should ever be questioned . The more we look at it , and into it , and through it , to the results at which it aims , and the Christian fidelity it supposes and requires on the part of parents in order to its realization , the more convinced we are that it is a true and divinely inspired thought . If there be any such thing as ( itristiau nurture in distinction from that which is not Christian , this is it . We most sincerely thank Dr. Bushnell for depositing in , or rather restoring to , the Christian consciousness of this age an idea so inspiring to faith and fidelity , and which had so nearly perished out of it . With its full , practical restoration , we look to see restored not only the primitive piety of the Apostolic age , but a piety as much deeper and more stable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inbred in the Christian stock . As this idea of Christian nurture is fundamental to the whole book , upon which all its arguments and illustrations rest , or out of which they grow , we shall be pardoned for dwelling a little on the elucidation and vindication of it against the objections which may be felt by some on its first presentation . We shall not confine ourselves strictly to the thoughts or method of the author , though the arguments are eubstantially his . // And first , is the practical objection arising from the almost universal failure to realize this idea . But what Christian doctrine or precept would not be disproved or rendered nugatory by such a test ? Take that grand and all inclusive precept of the Saviour , " Be ye perfect even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect . " What is further from a practical realization in the world , or by the church , than this precept ? And yet who will deny the truth and reality of the obligation here announced ' ? Nay , more ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sublime idea and aiim of all duty , with the inspiration which such a precept carries with it , involving as it does the grandest of all aims , perfection ; the highest of all motives , likeness to God ; and the most blessed of all encouragements , the implied truth that the grace of God is sufficient for its real and utmost attainment else it would not have been commanded . Who can estimate the power of such an ideal held up thus over the aspirations and endeavors and struggles of the Christian , even though it should never be realized in this life ? So this idea of Christian Education were a most potent and blessed truth , though it were only an ideal , never to be actually realized . But it is not merely this . Children have been so trained as not only never to remember the time when they began to be religious , but so as to evince that religion or piety was in them from the beginning , and have " opened on the world as children spiritually renewed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authenticated facts in Christian biography , and even the testimony of Scripture in regard to some at least who have been called and sanctified from the womb . If it be said that these are sporadic or exceptional cases that have come to pass by divine sovereignty , and not by any law of parental or religious nurture , this is pure assumption , which a closer study of facts would doubtless disprove . Infant regeneration , we have every reason to suppose , is as closely connected with means of grace appropriate to that age and condition as the conversion of adults ; and when these " means " are better understood and more faithfully applied , as they will be in the millenium , if not before , the exceptions will // be on the side of non-conversion , or growing up in sin ; showing the law of Christian nurture to be that the child of parents really Christian shall grow up a Christian , inheriting spiritually the faith and piety of his parents . But there are other theoretical objections to this idea , or objections lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception , and of course lie in the way of its realization . Chief among these is the almost universal expectation that children , all children , are to grow up in sin , and are not to be converted till after a certain age . Nothing could more certainly ensure such a result than such an expectation , whether we consider its effect on the parent or child . And the wonder is , considering how widely and potently such a notion has prevailed , that a child ever was converted , or found its way to the Saviour through such a bristling guard of prejudices to fence it away . Nothing but the voice and call of Jesus heard above the rebukes and opposition of his disciples , and penetrating the child 's heart between the arms that should have brought , but really held it away from him- " Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not , " could have overcome such an unnatural and formidable barrier . We well remember hearing from maternal lips what a literal taking up of the cross it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child of Christian parents who wanted to be a Christian , to avow such a precocious desire ; what an audacity of boldness and even heroism of faith was required for such an one to present herself to the deacon or the minister for admission to the church ; and the " examinations " in doctrine and experience that followed , as if it were a court of inquisition , or a foreign port into which some alien vessel had entered , and must undergo the most rigid scrutiny and quarantine before it could be admitted . And how many a timid child , of a shrinking and sensitive spirit , has repressed such a desire , and violated its religious instincts and convictions for long years , through fear of encountering the hedge of thorns through which it must pass in order to get within the fold , and which not Christ but the church has erected , to keep out not the wolves // oniy , but the very lambs of the flock ! True , there is not the same degree of difficulty now , when Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones , and be as it were a vestibule to the larger fold . The expectation of the church is not so wholly exclusive of children as formerly , but yet it is only enlarged by one step lower down , and does not coincide with the mind of Christ or the real provisions of his grace , so as to include infants and little children . It is a most significant sign when the religious desires of children forerun the expectations and aims of their parents , which ought rather to awakeu and elicit these desires . It shows how much before the faith of the church is the readiness of God to bless and convert her children , and how much larger and more abundant is the gift of grace than most Christians are able to conceive . An expectation so dishonoring to the grace and promises of God , so cruel to the child , and so incongruous with the professed desire and aim of Christian education , must have some ground or theory to rest upon . Let us look at its supposed grounds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One basis of such an expectation , and another theoretical objection to the idea of Christian nurture held up by our author , is certain unwarranted notions respecting depravity ; not the doctrine of depravity as the Scriptures and an enlightened theology represent it , but certain notions that are rather- accretions upon the doctrine . Children inherit a depraved nature , a nature inclining them to sin from the very beginning of moral agency . True ; but this depravity is not of so hardened and desperate a type as to exclude the possibility of divine grace dwelling with it , and overcoming its evil inclinations . It is not so " total ' * that it must needs reign alone , and the child be abandoned to its power , until it is old and wicked enough to be converted . This were to make those of whom the Saviour said " Of such is the kingdom of heaven ' * worse , and worse off than those who have grown old in sin ; for these , at least , have the privilege of repenting and being converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should grow up in sin in order to make good the doctrine of de // pravity , any more than the , y should always continue in sin , to prove the same doctrine . And if grace and true piety may consist with a degree of natural corruption in older persons , why not in children , and that , too , from their earliest years ? In the words of our author : " Why should it be thought incredible that there should be some really good principle awakened in the mind of a child ? For this is all that is implied in a Christian state . The Christian is one who has simply begun to love what is good for its own sake , and why should it be thought impossible for a child to have this love begotten in him ? Take any scheme of depravity you please , there is yet nothing in it to forbid the possibility that a child should be led , in his first moral act , to cleave unto what is good and right , any more than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , only a child converted to good , leading a mixed life as all Christians do . The good in him goes into combat with the evil , and holds a qualified sovereignty . And why may not this internal conflict of goodness cover the whole life from its dawn , as well as any part of it ? And what more appropriate to the doctrine of spiritual influence itself , thafi to believe that as the spirit of Jehovah fills all the worlds of matter , and holds a presence of power and government in all objects , so all human souls , the infantile as well as the adult , have a nurture of the Spirit appropriate to their age and their wants ? What opinion is more essentially monstrous , in fact , than that which regards the Holy Spirit as having no agency in the immature souls of children who are growing up , helpless and unconscious , into the perils of time ? " pp. 16 , l ' 7 . One more objection or obstacle to the idea of Christian nurture , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the prevalent theory or notion respecting conversion , as if it necessarily implied a certain mental process , or technical " experience , " such as is common to adult persons . The remarks of our author upon this point are so wise and truthful , and aim so effectually to correct an error which is all but universal , that we cite them at some length : " He ( the child ) can not understand , of course , in the earliest stage of childhood , the philosophy of religion as a renovated experience , and that is not the form of the first lessons he is to receive . He is not to be told that he must have a new heart , and exercise faith in Christ 's atonement . We are to understand that a right spirit may be virtually exercised in children , when , as yet , it is not intellectually received as a form of doctrine . Thus , if they are put upon an effort to be good , connecting the fact that God desires it , and will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very early age , they can receive ; and that includes everything ,  --  repentance , love , duty , dependence , faith . Nay , the operative truth necessary to a new life , may possibly be communicated through and from the parent , being revealed in his looks , manners , and ways of life , before they are of an // age to understand the teaching of words ; for the Christian scheme , the gospel , is really wrapped up in the life of every Christian parent , and beams out from him , as a living epistle , before it escapes from the lips , or is taught in words . And the Spirit of Truth may as well make this living truth effectual , as the preaching of the gospel itself . " pp. 21 , 22 . Again : " Many true Christians fall off , unwittingly , from the humanly parental modes of nurture , in taking up notions of conversion that are mechanical , and proper . only to the adult age . They make a merit of great persistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual birth ; not perceiving under what varieties of form that change may be wrought . The soul must be exercised , they think , in one given way , viz : by a struggle with sin , a conscious self-renunciation , and a true turning to Christ for mercy , followed by the joy and peace of a new life in the Spirit . A child , in other words , can be born of God , only in the same way as an adult can be . There is no quickening grace , or new creation of the Spirit , proper to him as a child , if he dies in infancy , God may , it is true , find some way , possibly , to save him , but if he stays among the living , he can not be a Christian till he is older . He is therefore left , in this most tender , and beautiful , and pliant age , in a condition most of all unprivileged , and most sadly unhopeful . The necessity of a great spiritual change is upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Whnt other being has the good Lord and Father of the world left in a condition as pitiful as this of a human child ? Even the most wicked and hardened of men have , at least , the gate of conversion left open . And yet there are many Christian parents , living an outwardly decent and fair life , who consent , without difficulty , and with a kind of consciously orthodox merit , to this very unnatural and truly hard lot of childhood , and fall into easy coi*formity with it . Their practically accepted notion of Christian nurture , in which they mean to be piously faithful , is , that they are to bring up their children outside of all possible acceptance with God , till such time as their conversion may be looked for , in a church-wise form . And their whole scheme of treatment corresponds . They indoctrinate them soundly , in respect to their need of a new heart ; tell them what conversion is , and how it comes to pass with grown people ; pray that God will arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the manner ; drill them , meantime , into all the constraints , separated from all the hopes and liberties of religion ; turning all their little misdoings and bad tempers into evidences of their need of regeneration , and assuring them that all such signs must be upon them till after they have passed the change . Their nurture is a nurture thus of despair , and the bread of life itself , held before them as a fruit to be looked upon , but not tasted , till they are old enough to have it as grown people do , finally becomes repulsive , just because they have been so long repelled and fenced away from it . And so religion itself , pressed down upon them till they are fatally sored by its impossible claims , becomes their fixed aversion . How plain is it that such kind of nurture is unnatural , and though it be not so intended , unchristian ! It makes even the loving gospel of Jesus a most galling chain upon the neck of childhood ! this and nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ductile and hopeful , as regards all new implantings // of good , it really proposes nothing but to have the depravated nature grow , and the plague of sin deepen its bad infection . " pp. 13-4 . Closely connected with this false notion respecting conversion , and another hindrance to the tine idea of Christian nurture , is the narrow and restricted view which many Christians entertain respecting the grace of God , its freedom and fulness , its diversity of method and operations , and its manifold adaptedness to all human wants , ages , and capacities . What is there , either in the nature of the Divine Spirit , or of the soul of an infant , or in the power and willingness of God , to prevent an approach to that soul , both directly and through the same means and influences which the parent employs to form and unfold its character ? When the soul of the child lies open to every look , and word , and tone of the parent , to every external influence , as a flower to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to its character , what shall hinder the grace of God from inhabiting and operating , through that look , or word , or tone , upon that open soul , to form it unto goodness and piety ? What but the absence of a divine element from these demonstrations , through want of faith and vital godliness in the parents themselves ? If they live in the Spirit , they will carry the Spirit , and breathe its divine and transforming power , in their very manners and motions , and their children will be converted , not as by some sudden stroke of divine power , like Saul of Tarsus , or those on the day of Pentecost , but by the converting element of the grace they live in . " Were they really to live so as to make their house an element of grace , the atmosphere of their life an element , to all that breathe it , of unworldly feeling , and all godly aspirations , their mechanical doctrine of conversion would scarcely suffice to keep away the saving mercies of God from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before the permissible time , and burst up through the poor detentions of their bad doctrine , to cover it with blessed confusion . But , alas ! it requires but a very little of genuine living godliness in the house , to bring up children for a future conversion ! " * * * * * * * " How different the kind of life that is necessary to bring them up in conversion , and beget them anew , in the spirit of a loving obedience to God , at a point even prior to all definite recollection . This is Christian nurture , because it nurtures Christians , and because it makes an element of Christian grace , in the house . It invites , it nourishes hope , it breathes in love , it forms the new life , as a holy , // though beautiful prejudice in the soul , before its opening and full flowering of intelligence arrives . Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not , ' translates tbe very economy of the house , and has in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for of such is the kingdom of heaven , ' wears no look of violence ; for the kingdom of heaven is there . The children grow up in it , as being configured to it . The family prayers have a sound of gladness , and they sing the family hymns with glad voices . The worldliness of the glittering , bad world without is set off and made fascinating , by no doom of repression with in . A firm administration is loved , because , like God 's , it is felt to be the defense of liberty . Truth , purity , firmness , love to Jesus , all that belongs to a formal conversion , and more , is centralized thus in the soul , as a kind of ingrown habit . The children are all converted , by the converting element of grace they live in . And so it is proved that there is a conversion for children , proper and possible to their age . They are not excluded , walled away from Christ , by a mechanical enforcement of modes , proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a converting ordinance . " Such are some of the more obvious and prevalent objections against the idea of Christian nurture , as defined by Dr. Bushnell , which are potent obstacles in the way of its practical realization . We have not reviewed all , but only the chief ; and the influence of these notions , to say nothing of radical defects of character and wisdom in the training of children , must run through and fatally iiupair the whole system of religious education . So that the question , why , if this idea be tine , is itso seldom realized , is sufficiently answered . Turning now to the more positive arguments in support of this idea , the first is that drawn from the known character and dispositions of God , as revealed in the Bible . Since goodness , or the production of goodness , is the supreme end of God , we know , on first principles , that He desires on his part , that children should grow up in piety , as earnestly and even more so , than the parent can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bestow whatsoever spiritual grace is necessary to the moral renovation of childhood , and will do it , unless some collateral reasons in his plan , involving the extension of holy virtue , require him to withhold . " " Thus if nothing were hung upon parental faithfulness and example , if the child were not used , in some degree or way , as an argument to hold the parent to a life of Christian diligence , then the good principle in the parent might lack the necessary stimulus to bring it to maturity . Or , if all children alike , in spite of // the evil and unchristian example of the house , were to he started into life as spiritually renewed , one of the strongest motives to holy living would be taken away from parents , in the fact that their children are safe , as regards a good beginning , without any carefulness in them , or prayerfulness in their life , and their own virtue might so overgrow itself with weeds , as never to attain a sound maturity . " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early conversion of children , unless the want of faith and fidelity on the part of the parents prevent it ; just as he desires that all men should repent and be saved , and will secure this result , except as they resist and defeat the drawings of his grace . The words of the Saviour are explicit on this point , " Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not ; for of such is the kingdom of heaven , " implying that they already belong , by affinity , to the kingdom of heaven , and will infallibly enter it , or come to Christ , unless they are withheld or forbidden by those who are responsible for their character and destiny . And in this view , we may see a merciful provision in that mystery of Providence , which withdraws so large a proportion of infants from the false training of parents , which would so often prove a hindrance to their salvation , that they may come more directly into his gracious and heavenly nurture . Another argument which Iills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that law of organic connection between the parent and child , by virtue of which the character of the parent is or may be transmitted to the child , by a kind of natural inheritance . This law is recognized and palpable enough , as respects the transmission of depravity ; and what shall hinder it from being so taken possession of and sanctified by the Spirit of God , as to ensure the transmission of a good or regenerate character ? There is no need here of confounding physical with moral laws , or of supposing that piety , or a gracious character , can be literally propagated or transmitted , physically , in the blood . Moral depravity is not thus transmuitted ; but a depraved or corrupted nature ( itself produced by sinful habits , originating in the will ) is transmitted to the child , which furnishes the 8tocle , with its innate evil tendencies , or dispositions ,  --  " the flesh , " of Saint Paul , " with its // affections and lusts , " - out of which the evil character grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same law which produced the corrupt nature in the first instance , aided in its development by all the corrupting moral influences of example , &amp;c. , operating on him from without . It is useless to deny the power which body , or physical nature , has over the spiritual . If the moral character does not inhere in the nature which one inherits , but in the will , which is above nature , it is yet , to a great degree , determined and shaped by this nature , so that a depraved nature infallibly produces , or rather induces , a depraved will ; and the natural character of a person can be almost infallibly known from his physical temperament , and the blood which he inherits . Thus the natural depravity of the race is transmitted from generation to generation , by a strictly organic law . If we understand Dr. Bushnell , all that he means to assert , is , that this same law , which is so potent for the propagation of depravity , and the growing up of the child in sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original design , as to be not simply a law of sin and death , but of goodness as well , favoring the development of a holy character , as it now favors or induces a sinful one ; or , at least , holding a qualified and subordinate power of evil in the subject , with the law of the Spirit of Life . In other words , the nature that is transmitted , becoming less and less of a corrupted nature , as the race becomes sanctified , the new being is started into life , with less of damage and predisposition to evil , and more pliant to good , though still needing regeneration , or the ingrafting of a divine life ; so that the seeds of piety falling into this good soil , from the very first , through a preventive Christian nurture surrounding and brooding over it , as an atmosphere of grace , may get the advantage of the weeds of sin , and quicken into godliness , as it were , spontaneously , without any need of conversion , in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , is not the less born of the Spirit , though the spiritual birth be simultaneous with the natural , and grows up in the Spirit shed upon him , through the enfolding nurture and Christian atmosphere he lives in , which is thus most truly a nurture of the Lord . // How this lnay be , and how the propagation of piety , in this sense , is consistent with the highest supernaturalism , may be seen in the following passages in the discourse , entitled " The Ontpopnlating Power of the Christian Stock . " " Consider a very important fact in human physiology , viz : that qualities of education , habit , feeling , and character , have a tendency to grow in , by long continuance , and become thoroughly inbred in the stock . We meet humble analogies of this in the domestic animals . . . The same thing is observable on a large scale , in the families of mankind . A savage race is a race bred into low living , and a faithless , bloody character . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one generation to another . It is not merely that laws , social modes and instrumentalities of education descend , and that so the new sprung generations are fashioned after birth , by the forms and principles and causes into which they have been set , but it is that the very type of the inborn quality is a civilized type . The civilization is , in great part , an inbred civility . There is something functional in them , which is itself configured to the state of art , order , law and property . " pp. 202-3 . " Now if it be true that what gets power in any race , by a habit or a process of culture , tends by a fixed law of nature to become a propagated quality , and pass by descent as a property inbred in the stock ; if in this way whole races of men are cultivated into properties that are peculiar-off into a savage character , down into a servile or a mercenary , up into civilization or a high social state-what to be the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the successive generations of a family ? What can it be but a general mitigation of the bad points of the stock and a more and more completely inbred piety . The children of such a stock are born not of the flesh only , or the mere natural life of their parentage , but they are born , in a sense most emphatic of the Spirit also ; for this parentage is differed , as we are supposing , age by age , from its own mere nature in Adam , by the inhabiting grace of a supernatural salvation . Physiologically speaking , they are tempered by this grace , and it is all the while tending to become , in some sense , an inbred quality . Hence the very frequent remark- ' How great a privilege and order of nobility to be descended of a pious ancestry ! ' It is the blessing that is to descend to the thousandth generation of them that love God and keep his commandments . " In this view it is to be expected , as the life of Christian piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God obtains a living power , in the successive generations , more and more complete , that finally the race itself will be so thoroughly regenerated as to have a genuine and populating power in faith and godliness . By a kind of ante-natal and post-natal nurtnre combined , the new-born generations will be started into Christian piety , and the world itself over-populated and taken possession of by a truly sanctified stock . This I conceive to be the expectation of Christianity . Not that the bad heritage of depravity will cease , but that the second Adam will get into power with the first , and be entered seminally into the same great process of propagated life . And this fulfills that primal desire of the world 's Creator and Father , of which the prophet speaks- ' that he might have a godly seed ! ' And let no one be offended by this , as if it supposed a possible // in-growth and propagation of piety , by mere natural laws and conditions . What higher ground of supernaturalism can be taken , than that which supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrate our faller . nature , at a point so deep as to cover the whole spread of the fall , and be a grace of life , traveling outward from the earliest , most latent germs of our human development . It is only saying , with a meaning- ' My substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth . ' Or , in still another view , it is only conceiving that those sporadic cases of sanctification from the womb , of which the Scripture speaks , such as that of Samuel , Jeremiah , and John , are to finally become the ordinary and common fact of family development . " In such cases , the faith or piety of a single pair , or possibly of the . mother alone , begets a heavenly mold in the predispositions of the offspring , so that , as it is born of sin , it is also born of the heavenly grace . If then we suppose the heavenly grace to have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to finally work the general stock of parentage into its own heavenly mold , far enough to prepare a sanctified offspring for the world , what higher , grander fact of Christian Supernaturalism could be asserted ? Nor is it anything more of a novelty than to say , that where sin abounded , grace did much more abound . ' The conception is one that simply fulfills what Baxter , hopkins , and others , were apparently struggling after , when contriving how to let the grace of God in our salvation match itself by the hereditary damage , or deprivation , that descends upon us from our parentage , and the organic unity of our nature as a race . " pp. 204-6 . The last argument for this idea or doctrine of Christian nnrtnre , is that derived from Infant Baptism- " a rite which snpposes the fact of an organic connection of character between the parent and child ; a seal of faith in the parent applied over to the child on the ground of a presnmption that his faith is wrapped up in the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning . " If there be any meaning whatever in infant baptism , it is that the child thus baptized is presumptively a Christian , and is expected to grow up a Christian , as certainly as time circumcized child of Jewish parents was expected to grow up a Jew . If the practice and propriety of infant baptism is to be vindicated at all , it must be vindicated on the truth of this idea ; and all outside arguments derived from historical usage , the Abrahamic Covenamit , the relation of baptismuto circumcision , however important and valid as corroborative proofs , concern merely the shell , and touch not the real substance of the rite , or of its informing or essential idea . Once admit the organic connec // tion of character between the parent and child , by virtue of which the faith of the former includes and presumptively secures the faith and piety of the latter , and the meaning of God 's Covenant with Abraham and his seed after him becomes apparent ; the import too and beauty of infant baptism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same organic law , becomes also apparent . The ordinance vindicates itselg aside from any express Scriptural or historical authority , and becomes one of the most significant and appropriate rites of the Christian Church . But deny this organic connection and unity of the family , or its sanctity as an appointed channel of divine grace ; isolate the faith and character of the parent from all connection with that of the child ; and adopt th' dry and barren theory , that grace is a perfectly independent and arbitrary gift to certain elect individuals or units , owning no special and domestic relationships , and the Baptist is right in his narrow interpretation of the text , " He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved . " In such a theory there is no place for the idea which underlies the rite , and of course no propriety or significance in the practice of it . hence we regard the idea of Christian nurture set forth by our author as the most potent and really unansxverable argument for pedobaptism against the objections of our Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases the rite on the impregnable foundation of a divine law , which needs no express divine word for its authentication . There is one idea connected with the act of infant consecration in baptism , which is not directly mentioned by Dr. Bushnell , but which we think of supreme importance to the highest validity of the ordinance , and the securing of what is presumptively implied in it  --  the actual regeneration of the child ; - viz , the vicariousness of the parent 's faith , as a power with God for its conversion and sanctification . That the faith of one person does avail for divine blessings upon others , both temporal and spiritual , no believer in revelation , or observer of the ways of God , can doubt . Witness the centn // non , in the gospel , believing for his servant , and Jairns for his little daughter ; and both receiving according to their faith . Witness also the many signal conversions constantly occnrring in answer to the prayer of faith of others in their behalf . If such be the vicarious efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believer , what may it not be when the subject is an infant and a pare , as it were , of the life of the parent ? Hannah consecrating the child Samuel to God , before its birth , and the answer of God in accepting and sanctifying him from the womb , is an example in point . Is it not the privilege of every Christian parent not only to offer his child to God in baptism , and so seal it as presumptively a Christian , but to believe for it so vitally and effectually , to consecrate it so really to God , that the act shall be accepted for the benefit of the child , and so such spiritual influences be secured , that it shall be born simultaneously of water and of the Spirit , as the rite of baptism itself signifies . In other words , does not even the phrase baptismal regeneration symbolize an important truth , if the regeneration is understood to be wrought not by the act of the priest through the application of water , but by the Spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Christian nurture of the child , or the unfolding of its piety , would be only the fulfilling of the vows made in its behalf ; and the result , as regards character , would be , according to the fidelity of the parent , the same as with the individual believer . The historical development , and apostolic authority of infant baptism , form the topic of two most instructive chapters , which every one who wishes to study this question in all its bearings , should not fail to read . The relation of baptism to circumcision , is thus clearly and happily stated : " Circumcision comes to our aid as another and distinct evidence . For it was given to be a seal of the righteousness of faith , ' and the application of it , as a seal , to infant children , involves all the precise difficulties-neither more nor less-that are raised by the deniers of infant baptism . Let the point here made be accurately understood . The argument is not that infant baptism was directly // substituted for circumcision . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have been made without remark , discussion , oppositions of prejudice , and the raising of contentions that would have required distinct mention , many times over , in the apostolic history . But the argument is this : that the Jewish mind was so familiarized by custom with the notion of an inclusive religious unity in families , ( partly by the rite of circumcision ) , that Christian baptism , being the seal of faith , was naturally , and by a kind of associational instinct , applied over to families in the same manner . Not to have made such an application would have required some authoritative interposition , some dike of positive hindrance , to turn aside the current of Jewish prepossessions . And if there had risen up , somewhere , a man of Baptist notions , to ask , where is the propriety of applying baptism , given as a rite for believers , to infants , who we certainly know are not old enough to believe , lie could not even have begun to raise an impression by it . Was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and has it not been applied from his time down to the present , in this way-applied to infant children eight days old ? True , it is the doctrine of Christ , he that believeth and is baptised , shall be saved , ' and our apostles , too , are saying , if thou believest with all thy heart thou mayest . ' So we all say and think , as relating to adult persons ; but do we not all know that what is given to the father includes the children , and that his faith is the faith of the house ? Nothing , in short , is plainer than that every argument raised to convict infant baptism of absurdity , holds in the same manner , as convicting circumcision of absurdity , and all the religious polity of the former ages . Every such argument , too , mocks the religious fe cling and conviction of all these former ages , in a way of disrespect equally presumptuous . " pp. 147 , 148 . The church membership of baptised children is discussed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light upon this obscure and difficult question . The following is our author 's conception of it : " The conception of this membership is , that it is a potentially real one ; that it stands , for the present , in the faith of the parents , and the promise which is to them and to their children , and that , on this ground , they may well enough be accounted believers , just as they are accounted potentially men and women . Then , as they come forward into maturity , it is to be assumed that they will come forward into faith , being grown in the nurture of faith , and will claim for themselves the membership into which they were before inserted . " Nor is this a case which has no analogies , that it should be held up as a mark of derision . It is generally supposed that our common law has some basis of common sense . And yet this body of law makes every infant child a citizen ; requiring as a point of public order , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the rescue , or the redress of his wrongs , when his person is seized or property invaded by conspiracy . This infant child can sue and be sued ; for the Court of Chancery will appoint him a guardian , whose acts // shall be the child 's acts ; and it shall be as if he were answering for his own education , dress , board , entertainments , and the damages done by his servants , precisely as if he were a man acting in his own cause . Doubtless it may sound very absurdly to call him a citizen . What can he do as a citizen ? He can not vote , nor bear arms ; he does not even know what these things mean , and yet he is a citizen . in one view he votes , bears arms , legislates , even in his cradle ; for the potentiality is in him , and the state takes him up in her arms , as it were , to own him as her citizen . In a strongly related sense , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the church . There is no unreality in the position assigned him ; for the futurition of God 's promise is in him , and , by a kind of sublime anticipation , he is accepted in God 's supernatural economy as a believer ; even as the law accepts him in the economy of society to be a citizen . lie is potentially both , and both is actually to be , in a way of transition so subtle and imperceptible that no one can tell when he begins to be , either one or the other . " pp. 167 , 8 . In this connection let us refer our readers to what the author says in another chapter , entitled " The Treatment that discourages Piety , " concerning the holding back of children from an early recognition of their membership in the church , and an admission to the Lord 's table ; the discouraging and often fatal effect of this practice , and the proper remedy for it . The passage is too long for quotation here , but we hope that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ponder it . The idea of Christian nurture , as thus unfolded , does not concern merely the conversion and salvation of children ; its scope is not to be limited to the family or time church as a visible institution ; but reaches out in its relations and bearings into the whole vast sphere of the divine economy towards this world , and embraces in its results the future destiny arid glory of humanity . It furnishes the best , if not tile only solution of one of the darkest problems of human existence- " the vindication of God in sin , suffering , punishment , and all evil pertaining to the race . " " How constantly is the question raised , why God , as an infinitely good and gracious Father , should put on foot such a scheme of existence as this ; one that unites such oppressive disadvantages , and is to be such a losing concern ? We begin life , it is said , with constitutions depraved and poisoned , and come thus into choice with predispositions that are damaged even beforehand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this manner , from age to age , and the vast majorities of the race , rotting away thus into death under sin , are being // all the while precipitated into a wretched eternity , which is their end ; for they go hence in a state visibly disqualified for the enjoyment , either of themselves or God . " This dark picture , which has driven many good men , besides John Foster , into Universalism or something worse , is greatly relieved by the prospect opened by the doctrine in question , " of a grand , over-populating righteousness , which is finally to change the aspect of the whole question . " In the words of our anthor : " We are not to assume , with many , that the world is now just upon its close , but to look upon it as barely having opened its first chapter of history . Its real value , and what is really to come of it , probably does not even yet beam to appear . When its propagations cease to be mere propagations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become propagations of sanctified life , and ages of life ; when the numbers , talents , comforts , powers of the immense godly popw lations are increased to more than a hundred fold what they now are ; and when , at some incomputable distance of time , whose rate of approach is only hinted by the geologic ages of the planet , they look back upon us as contemporaries almost of Adam , and forward through ages of blessing just begun , beholding so many worlds full of regenerated mind and character , pouring in from hence to overpeople , as it were , eternity itself ; they will certainly have a very different opinion of the scheme of existence from that which we most naturally take up now . Then it will be confessed that the nurture of the Lord has meaning and force enough to change the aspect of every thing in God 's plan . Our scheme of propa. gated and derivative life is no longer a scheme of disadvantage , but a mode of induction that gives to every soul the noblest , safest beginnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal reason why we are so often deficient in character , or outward beauty , is , that piety begins too late in life , having thus to maintain a perpetual and unequal war with previous habit . If it was not true of Paul , it is yet too generally true that one born out of due time will be found out of due time , more often than he should be afterwards-unequal , inconsistent with himself acting the old man instead of the new . Having the old habit to war with , it is often too strong for him . To make a graceful and complete Christian character , it needs itself to be the habit of existence ; not a grape grafted On a bramble . And this , it will be seen , requires a Christian childhood in the subject . Having this , the gracious or supernatural character becomes itself more nearly natural and possesses the peculiar charm of naturalness , which is necessary to the highest moral beauty . " p. 219 . We have confined our review thus far to that portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only because it is the first in order , but the first in importance . The second part , which treats of the m*ode in which this idea is to be realized , is more practical , and therefore more interesting // to the generality of readers . It is the Epistle to the Corinthians , coining after that of Paul to the iRoinans . It deals in specific thoughts and directions as to the true method of Christian education and training , or of applying the principles already laid down . With wonderful discrimination and delicacy of handling , the author puts his finger on just those points which most vitally concern the character of the child , as it is affected by the character and treatment of the parent , and which are most apt to be overlooked even by those who are most careful and solicitious for the spiritual well-being of their children . It covers , in fact , though not formally , the whole ground of Christian education as a practical nurture and discipline , from the period before birth , or what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forming periods of infancy and childhood , showing what parental qualifications are requisite for so holy and tender a charge ; how even physical nurture may be a means of grace ; what treatment discourages , and what encourages and assists piety in children . The subject of family government is treated with rare judgment , showing the wisdom not of a theorist , but of " one that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity . " The nioral economy of Plays and Pastimes , Holidays and Sundays , is not overlooked ; which , together with a chapter on the Christian teaching of children ; and another on that ordinance sacred to the memory of Home , and indispensable to every Christian household , Family Prayers ,  --  completes the book . We had marked many passages in this second part for quotation , but we have already transgressed the limits assigned to this Article , and must reluctantly close . We do so requesting our readers not to be content with the impressions we have endeavored to give , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after a re-perusal , to hand it to their neighbors . We bespeak for it a place in every Christian household , beside or upon the family Bible , believing as we do that no better hand-book for parents , at once religious and domestic , can be found outside the Christian Scriptures .
