txt CONCERNING DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE . " ON the whole , it was very disagreeable , " wrote a certain great traveller and hunter , summing up an account of his position , as he composed himself to rest upon a certain evening after a hard day 's work . And no doubt it must have been very disagreeable . The night was cold and dark and the intrepid traveller had to lie down to sleep in the open air , without even a tree to shelter him . A heavy shower of hail was falling , - each hailstone about the size of an egg . The dark air was occasionally illuminated by forked lightning , of the most appalling aspect ; and the thunder was deafenin , , . By various sounds , heard in the intervals of the peals , it seemed evident that the vicinity was pervaded by wolves , tigers , elephants , wild-boars , and serpents . A peculiar motion , perceptible under a horse*cloth which was wrapped up to serve as a pillow , appeared to indicate that a snake was wriggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that it was a very venomous one , as indeed in the morning it proved to be ; but he was too tired to look . And speaking of the general condition of matters upon that evening , the hunter stated , with great mildness of language , that " it was very disagreeable . " Most readers would be disposed to say that disagreeable was hardly the right word . No doubt , all things that are perilous , horrible , awful , ghastly , deadly , and the like , are disagreeable too . But when we use the word disagreeable by itself , our meaning is understood to be , that in callin* the thing disagreeable we have said the worst of it . A long and tiresome // sermon is disagreeable ; but a venomous snake under your pillow passes beyond being disagreeable . To have a tooth stopped is disagreeable ; to be broken on the wheel ( though nobody could like it ) transcends that . If a thing be horrible and awful , you would not say it was disagreeable . The greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to write ID . D. after his name , he drops all mention of the M. A. borne in preceding years . Let this truth be remembered , by such as shall read the following pages . We are to think about disagreeable people . Let it be understood that ( speaking generally ) we are to think of people who are no worse than disagreeable . It can not be denied , even by the most prejudiced , that murderers , pirates , slave-drivers , and burglars , are disagreeable . The cutthroat , the poisoner , the sneaking blackguard who shoots his landlord from behind a hedge , are no doubt disagreeable people ,  --  so very disagreeable that in this country the common consent of mankind removes them from human society by the instrumentality of a halter . But disagreeable is too mild a word . Such people are all that , and a great deal more . And accordingly they stand beyond the range of this dissertation . We are to treat of folk who are disagreeable , and not worse than disagreeable . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be remembered that there are people who in the main are good people , who yet are extremely disagreeable . And a further complication is introduced into the subject by the fact , that some people who are far from good are yet unquestionably agreeable . You disapprove them ; but you can not help liking them . Others , again , are substantially good ; yet you are angry with yourself to find that you can not like them . I take for granted that all observant human beings will admit that in this world there are disagreeable people . Probably the distinction which presses itself most stron*ly upon our attention , as we mingle in the society of our fellow-men , is the distinction between agreeable people and disagreeable . There are various tests , more or less important , which put all mankind to right and left . A familiar division is into rich and poor . Thomas Paiiie , with great vehemence , denied the propriety of that classification , and declared that the only true and essential classification of mankind is into male and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , to his mind , by far the most interesting and thorough division of our race is into such as have been hanged and such as have not been han0-ed : he himself belonging to the former class . But we all , more or less , recognize and act upon the great classification of all human beings into the agreeable and the disagreeable . And we begin very early to recognize and act upon it . Very early in life , the little child understands and feels the vast difference between people who are nice and people who are not nice . In school-boy days , the first thing settled as to any new acquaintance , man or boy , is on which side he stands of the great boundary-line . It is not genius , not scholarship , not wisdom , not strength nor speed , that fixes the man 's place . None of these things is chiefly looked to : the question is , Is he agreeable or disagreeable ' ? And according as that question is decided , the man is described , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or as " a beast . " Yet it is to be remembered that the division between the agreeable and disagreeable of mankind is one which may be transcended . It is a scratch on the earth ,  --  not a ten-foot wall . And you will find men who pass from one side of it to the other , and back again , - probably several times in a week , or even in a day . There are people whom you never know where to have . They are constantly skipping from side to side of that line of demarcation ; or they even walk along with a foot on each side of it . There are people who are always disagreeable , and disa0reeable to all men . There are people who are agreeable at some times , and dis // agreeable at others . There are people who are agreeable to some men , and disagreeable to other men . I do not intend by the last-named class people who intentionally make themselves agreeable to a certain portion of the race , to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not take that trouble in the case of the remainder of humankind . What I mean is this : that there are people who have such an affinity and sympathy with certain other people , who so suit certain other people , that they are agreeable to these other people , though perhaps not particularly so to the race at large . And exceptional tastes and likings are often the strongest . The thing you like enthusiastically another man absolutely loathes . The thing which all men like is for the most part liked with a mild and subdued liking . Everybody likes good and well-made bread ; but nobody goes into raptures over it . Few persons like caviare ; hut those who do like it are very fond of it . I never knew but one being who liked mustard with apple-pie ; but that solitary man ate it with avidity , and praised the flavor with enthusiasm . But it is impossible to legislate for every individual case . Every rule must have exceptions from it ; but it would be foolish to resolve to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man who likes Mr. Snarling ; and to that man Mr. Snarling would doubtless be agreeable . But for practical purposes Mr. Snarling may justly be described as a disagreeable man , if he he disagreeable to nine hundred and ninety-nine mortals out of every thousand . And with precision sufficient for the ordinary business of life we may say that there are people who are essentially disagreeable . There are people who go through life , leaving an unpleasant influence on all whom they come near .. You are not at your ease in their society . You feel awkward and constrained while with them . That is probably the mildest degree in the scale of unpleasantness . There are people who disseminate a much worse August , influence . As the upas-tree was said to blight all the country round it , so do these disagreeable folk prejudicially affect the whole surrounding moral atmosphere . They chill all warmth of heart in those near them ; they put down anything generous or magnanimous ; they suggest unpleasant thoughts and associations ; they excite a diverse and numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people lies in this : that they tend powerfully to make other people disagreeable too . And these people are not necessarily had people , though they produce a bad effect . It is not certain that they design to be disagreeable . There are those who do entertain that design ; and they always succeed in carrying it out . Nobody ever tried diligently to he disagreeable , and failed . Such persons may , indeed , inflict much less annoyance than they wished they may even fail of inflicting any pain whatever on others ; but they make themselves as disgnsting as they could desire . And in many cases they succeed in inflictiu* , a good deal of pain . A very low , vulgar , petty , and uncultivated nature may cause much suffering to a lofty , noble , and refined one ,  --  particularly if the latter he in a position of dependence or subjection . A wretched hornet may madden a noble horse ; a contemptible mosquito may destroy the night 's rest which would have recruited a noble brain . But without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are those who worry and torment you . It is through want of perception , - want of tact , - coarseness of nature , - utter lack of power to understand you . Were you ever sitting in a considerable company , a good deal saddened by something you did not choose to tell to any one , and probably looking dull and dispirited enough ,  --  and did a fussy host or hostess draw the attention of the entire party upon you , by earnestly and repeatedly asking if you were ill , if you had a headache , because you seemed so dull and so unlike yourself ? And did that person time after time return to // the charge , till you would have liked to poison him ? There is nothing more disagreeable , and few things more mischievous , than a well-meaning , meddling fool . And where there was no special intention , good or bad , towards yourself , you have known people make you uncomfortable through the simple exhibition to you , and pressure upon you , of their own inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while you felt disgusted with everything , and above all , with those people themselves . Talking to them , you felt your moral nature being rubbed against the grain , being stung all over with nettles . You showed your new house and furniture to such a man , and with eagle eye he traced out and pointed out every scratch on your fine fresh paint , and every flaw in your oak and walnut ; he showed you that there were corners of your big mirrors that distorted your face , - that there were bits of your grand marble mantelpieces that might be expected soon to scale away . Or you have known a man who , with no evil intention , made it his practice to talk of you before your face as your other friends are accustomed to talk of you behind your back . It need not be said that the result is anything but pleasant . " What a fool you were , Smith , in saying that at Snooks 's last night ! " your friend exclaims , when you meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , that what you said was foolish ; but there is something grating in hearing your name connected with the unpleasant epithet . I would strongly advise any man , who does not wish to be set down as disagreeable , entirely to break off the habit ( if he has such a habit ) of addressing to even his best friends any sentence beginning with " What a fool you were . " Let me offer the like advice as to sentences which set out as follows - " I say , Smith , I think your brother is the greatest fool on the face of the earth . " Stop that kind of thing , my friend ; or you may come to be classed with Mr. Snarling . You are probably a manly fellow , and a sincere friend ; and for the sake of your substantial good qualities , one would stand a great deal . But overfrankness is disagreeable ; and if you make over-frankness your leading characteristic , of course your entire character will come to be disagreeable , and you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through malignant intention , and throuTh deficiency of sensitiveness , there are other people who are disagreeable through ure ill-luck . It is quite certain that there are people whom evil fortune dogs through all their life , who are thoroughly and hopelessly unlucky . And in no respect have we beheld a man 's ill-luck so persecute him as in the matter of making him ( without the slightest evil purpose , and even when he is most anxious to render himself agreeable ) render himself extremely disagreeable . Of course there must be some measure of thoughtlessness and forgetfulness-some lack of that social caution , so indispensable in the complication of modern society , which teaches a man ( so to speak ) to try if the ice will bear him before venturing his entire weight upon it ,  --  about people who are unlucky in the way of which I am speaking . But doubtless you have known persons who were always saying disagreeable things , or putting disagreeable questions , - either through forgetfulness of things which they ought to have remembered , or through unhappily chancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoughtless , but quite good-natured man , begin at a dinner-table to relate a succession of stories very much to the prejudice of somebody , while somebody 's daughter is sitting opposite him . And you will find the man quite obtuse to all the hints by which the host or hostess tries to stop hire , and going on to particulars worse and worse , till , in terror of what all this might grow to , the hostess has to cxclaim , " Mr. Smith , you wo n't take a hint : that is Mr. Somebody 's daughter sitting opposite you . " It is quite essential that any man , whose conversation consists mainly of observations not at all to the advantage of some absent acquaintance , // should carefully feel his way before giving full scope to his malice and his invention , in the presence of any general company . And before making any playful reference to halters , you should be clear that you are not talking to a man whose grandfather was hanged . Nor should you venture any depreciatory remarks upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tolerably versed in the family-history of those to whom you are talking . You may have heard a nian very jocular upon lunatic-asylums , to another who had several brothers and sisters in one . And though in some cases human beings may render themselves disagreeable through a combination of circumstances which really absolves them from all blame , yet , as a general rule , the man who is disagreeable through ill-luck is at least guilty of culpable carelessness . You have probably , my reader , known people who had the faculty of making themselves extremely agreeable . You have known one or two men who , whenever you met them , conveyed to you , by a remarkably frank and genial manner , an impression that they esteemed you as one of their best and dearest friends . A vague idea took possession of your mind that they had been longing to see you ever since they saw you last , - which in all probability was six or twelve months previously . And during all that period it may be regarded as quite certain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a manner has a vast effect upon young and inexperienced folk . The inexperienced man fancies that this manner , so wonderfully frank and friendly , is reserved specially for himself , and is a recognition of his own special excellences . But the man of greater experience has come to suspect this manner , and to see through it . He has discovered that it is the same to everybody ,  --  at least , to everybody to whom it is thought worth while to put it on . And he no more thinks of arguing the existence of any particular liking for himself , or of any particular merit in himself , from that friendly manner , than he thinks of believing , on a warm summer day , that the sun has a special liking for himself , and is looking so beautiful and bright all for himself It is perhaps unjust to accuse the man , always overflowing in geniality upon everybody he meets , of being an impostor or humbug . Perhaps he does feel an irrepressible gush of love to all his race : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loves him more than all the oth-ers ? Yet it is to be admitted that it is always well that a man should be agreeable . Pleasantness is always a pleasing thing . And a sensible man , seeking by honest means to make himself agreeable , will generally succeed in making himself agreeable to sensible men . But although there is an implied compliment , to your power , if not to your personality , in the fact of a man 's taking pains to make himself agreeable to you , it is certain that he may try to make himself so by means of which the upshot will be to make him intensely disagreeable . You know the fawning , sneaking manner which an occasional shopkeeper adopts . It is most disagreeable to right-thinking people . Let him remember that he is also a man ; and let his manner be manly as well as civil . It is an awful and humiliating sight , a man who is always squeezing himself together like a whipped dog , whenever you speak to him ,  --  grinning and bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you on the earth , and begging you to wipe your feet on his head . You can not help thinking that the sneak would be a tyrant , if he had the opportunity . It is pleasant to find people , in the humblest position , blending a manly independence of demeanor with the regard justly due to those placed by Providence farther up the social scale . Yet doubtless there are persons to whom the sneakiest manner is agreeable ,  --  who enjoy the flattery and the humiliation of the wretched toady who is always ready to tell them that they are the most beauti // ful , graceful , witty , *veil-informed , aristocratic-looking , and generally-beloved of the human race . You must remember that it depends very much upon the nature of a man himself whether any particular demeanor shall he agreeable to him or not . And you know well that a cringing , toadying manner , which would he thoroughly disgusting to a person of sense , maybe extremely agreeable and delightful to a self-conceited idiot . Was there not an idiotic monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to him , affected to veil their eyes with their hands , as unable to hear the insufferable effulgence of his countenance ? And would not a monarch of sense have been ready to kick the people who thus treated him like a fool ? And every one has observed that there are silly women who are much gratified by coarse and fulsome compliments upon their personal appearance , which would be regarded as grossly insultin* by a woman of sense . You may have heard of country-gentlemen , of Radical polities , who had seldom wandered beyond their paternal acres , ( by their paternal acres I mean the acres they had recently bought , ) and who had there grown into a fixed belief that they were among the noblest and mightiest of the earth , who thought their parish-clergyman an agree able man , if he voted at the county-election for the candidate they supported , though that candidate 's politics were directly opposed to those of the parson . These individuals , of course , would hold their clergyman as a disagreeable man , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their wishes into account in exercisIng the trust of the franchise . Now , of course , a nobleman or gentle man of right feeling would regard the parson as a turncoat and sneak , who should thus deny his convictions . Yes , there is no doubt that you may make yourself agreeable to unworthy folk by unworthy means . A late marquis declared on his dying bed , that a two-legged animal , of human pretensions , who had acted as his valet , and had aided that hoary reprobate in the gratification of his peculiar tastes , was " an excellent luau . " And you may remember how Burke said , that , as we learn that a certain Mr. Russell made himself very agreeable to Henry VIII. , we may reasonably suppose that Mr. Russell was himself ( in a humble degree ) something like his master . Probably , to most rightminded men , the fact that a man was agreeable to Henry VIII. , or to the marquis in question , or to Belial , Beelzebub , or Apollyon , would tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the guarded way in which the writer laid down his general principle as to pleasantness of character and demeanor . I said that a sensible man , seeking by honest means to make himself agreeable , will generally succeed in making himself agreeable to sensible men . I exclude from the class of men to be esteemed agreeable those who would disgust all but fools or blackguards . I exclude parsons who express heretical views in theology in the presence of a patron known to be a freethinker . I exclude men who do great folk 's dirty work . I exclude all toad-eaters , sneaks , fiatterers , and fawning impostors , - from the school-boy who thinks to gain his master 's favor by voluntarily bearing tales of his companions , up to the bishop who declared that he regarded it not merely as a constitutional l ) rinciple , hut as an ethical fact , that the king could do no wrong , and the other bishop who declared that the reason why George II . died was that this world was not good enough for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he mi*ht be the right man in the right place . Such persons may succeed in making themselves agreeable to the man with whom they desire to ingratiate themselves , provided that man be a fool or a knave but they assuredly render themselves disagreeable , not to say revolting , to all human beings whose good opinion isworth the possessing . And though any one who is not a fool will generally make himself agreeable to people of ordinary temper and nervous system , if he wishes // to do so , it is to be remembered that too intrusive attempts to be agreeable often make a man very disagreeable ; and likewise , that a man is the reverse of agreeable , if you see that he is trying , by managing and humoring you , to make himself agreeable to you , - I mean , if you can see that he is smoothing you down , and agreeing with you , and trying to get you on your blind side , as if he thought you a baby or a lunatic . And there is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish in man or woman to he agreeable , and this diplomatic and indirect way . No man likes to think that he is being managed as Mr. Rarey might manage an unbroken colt . And though many human beings must in fact be thus managed , - though a person of a violent or a sullen temper , or of a wrong head , or of outrageous vanity , or of invincible prejudices , must be managed very much as you would manage a lunatic , ( being , in fact , removed from perfect sanity upon these points , ) still , they must never be allowed to discern that they are being managed , or the charm will fail at once . I confess , for myself , that I am no believer in the efficacy of diplomacy and indirect ways in dealing with one 's fellow-creatures . I believe that a manly , candid , straightforward course is always the best . Treat people in a perfectly frank manner , - with frankness not put on , but real ,  --  and you will be agreeable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . My reader , I am now about to tell you of certain sorts of human beings who appear to me as worthy of being ranked among disagreeable people . I do not pretend to give you an exhaustive catalogue of such . Doubtless you have your own black beasts , your own special aversions , which have for you a disagreeableness beyond the understanding or sympathy of others . Nor do I make quite sure that you will agree with me in all the views which I am going to set forth . It is not impossible that you may regard as very nice people , or even as quite fascinating and inthralling people , cer August , tam people whom I regard as intensely disagreeable . Let me begin with an order of human beings , as to which I do not expect every one who reads this page to go along with me , though I do not know any opinion which I hold more resolutely than that which I am about to express . We all understand the kind of thing which is meant by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble and excellent thing to make people discern that a good Christian need not be a muff ( pardon the slang term : there is no other that would bring out my meaning ) . It is a fine thing to make it plain that manliness and ( lash may coexist with pure morality and sincere piety . It is a fine thing to make young fellows comprehend that there is nothing fine and manly in being and , and nothing unmanly in being good . And in this view it is impossible to value too highly such characters and such biographies as those of Hodson of Ilodson 's horse and Captain Hedley Vicars . It is a splendid combination , pluck and daring in their highest degree , with an unaffected and earnest regard to religion and religions duties , - in short , muscularity with Christianity . A man consists of body and soul ; and both would be in their ideal perfection , if the soul were decidedly Christian , and the body decidedly muscular . But there are folk whose admiration of the muscularity is very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are captivated by the dash and glitter of physical pluck ; they are quite content to accept it without any Christianity , and even without the most ordinary morality and decency . They appear , indeed , to think that the grandeur of the character is increased by the combination of thorough blacknuardism with high physical qualifications : their gospel , in short , may be said to be that of Unchristian Muscularity . And you will find various books in which the hero is such a man : and while the writer of the book frankly admits that he is in // strict morality an extremely bad man , the writer still recalls his doings with such manifest gusto and sympathy , and takes such pains to make him agreeable on the whole , and relates with such approval the admiration which empty-headed idiots express for him when he has jumped his horse over some very perilous fence or thrashed some insolent farmer , that it is painfully apparent what is the writer 's ideal of a gran ( I and imposing character . You know the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the muscular blackguard , - and you remember what are his unfailing characteristics . He has a deep chest . TIe has huge arms and limbs , - the muscles being knotted . He has an immense moustache . He has ( God knows why ) a serene contempt for ordinary mortals . He is always growing black with fury , and bullying weak men . On such occasions , his lips may he ohserved to be twisted into an evil sneer . He is a seducer and liar : he has ruined various women , and had special facilities for becoming acquainted with the rottenness of society : and occasionally he expresses , in language of the most profane , not to say blasphemous character , a momentary regret for having done so much harm , - such as the Devil might sentimentally have expressed , when he had succeeded in misleading our first parents . Of course , he never pays tradesmen for the things with which they supply him . He can drink an enormous quantity of wine without his head becoming affected . He looks down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as made for inferior beings . As for any worthy moral quality , - as for anything beyond a certain picturesque brutality and bull-dog disregard of danger , not a trace of such a thing can he found about him . We all know , of course , that such a person , though not uncommon in novels , very rarely occurs in real life ; and if he occur at all , it is with his ideal perfections very much toned down . In actual life , such a hero would become known in the Insolvent Court , and would frequently appear before the police magistrates . He would eventually become a billiard-marker ; and might ultimately be hanged , with general approval . If the man , in his unchipped proportions , did actually exist , it would be right that a combination should be formed to wipe him out of creation . He should be put down ,  --  as you would put down a tiger or a rattlesnake , if found at liberty somewhere in the Midland Counties . A more hateful character , to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be imagined . And it need not be shown that the conception of such a character is worthy only of a baby . however many years the man who deliberately and admiringly delineates such a person may have lived in this world , intellectually he can not be more than about seven years old . And none but calves the most immature can possibly sympathize with him . Yet , if there were not many silly persons to whom such a character is agreeable , such a character would not be portrayed . And it seems certain that a single exhibition of strength or daring will to some minds be the conipendium of all good qualities , or ( more accurately speaking ) the equivalent for them . A muscular blackguard clears a high fence : he does precisely that , - neither more nor less . And upon the strength of that single achievement , the servants at the house where he is visiting declare that they would follow him over the world . And you may find various young women , and various women who wish to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a like enthusiasm for the muscular blackguard . I confess that I can not find words strong enough to express my contempt and abhorrence for the theory of life and character which is assumed by the writers who describe such blackguards , and by the fools who admire them . And though very far from saying or thinking that the kind of human being who has been described is no worse than disagreeable , I assert with entire confidence that to all right-thinking men he is more disagreeable than almost any other kind // of human being . And I do not know any single lesson you could instil into a youthful mind which would be so mischievous as the lesson that the muscular blackguard should be regarded with any other feeling than that of pure loathing and disgust . But let us have done with him . I can not think of the books which delineate him and ask you to admire him without indignation more bitter than I wish to feel in writing such a page . And passing to the consideration of human beings who , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be laid down as a general principle , that any person , however good , is disagreeable from whom you feel it a relief to get away . We have all known people , thoroughly estimable , and whom you could not but respect , in whose presence it was impossible to feel at ease , and whose absence was felt as the withdrawal of a sense of constraint of the most oppressive kind . And this vague , uncomfortable influence , which hreathes from some men , is produced in various ways . Sometimes it is the result of mere stiffness and awkwardness of manner : and there are men whose stiffness and awkwardness of manner are such as would freeze the most genial and silence the frankest . Sometimes it arises from ignorance of social rules and proprieties ; sometimes from incapacity to take , or even to comprehend , a joke . Sometimes it proceeds from a pettedness of nature , which keeps you ever in fear that offence may be taken at the most innocent word or act . Sometimes it comes of a preposterous sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose standing and importance are very small . It is quite wonderful what very great folk very little folk will sometimes fancy themselves to he . The present writer has had little opportunity of conversing with men of great rank and power ; yet he has conversed with certain men of the very greatest : and he can say sincerely that he has found head-stewards to he much inure dignified men than dukes ; and parsons of no earthly reputation , and of very lim ited means , to he infinitely more stuckup than archbishops . And though at first the airs of stuck-up small men are amazingly ridiculous , and so rather amusing , th ey speedily become so irritating that the men who exhibit them can not be classed otherwise than with the disagreeable of the earth . Few people are more disagreeable than the man who , while you are conversing with hini , is ( you know ) taking a mental estimate of you , more particularly of the soundness of your doctrinal views ,  --  with the intention of showing you up , if you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice , if you be right . Whenever you find any man trying ( in a moral sense ) to trot you out , and examine your paces , and pronounce upon your general soundness , there are two courses you may follow . The one is , severely to shut him up , and sternly make him understand that you do n't choose to be inspected by him . Show him that you will not exhibit for his approval your particular views about the Papacy , or about Moral Inability , or about Pelagianism or the Patripassian heresy . Indicate that you will not he pumped : and you may convey , in a kindly and polite way , that you really do n't care a rush what he thinks of you . The other course is , with deep solemnity and an unchanged countenance , to horrify your inspector by avowing the most fearful views . Tell him , that , on long reflection , you are prepared to advocate the revival of Cannibalism . Say that probably something may be said for Polygamy . Defend the Thugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no doubt black is white , and twice ten are fifty . Or a third way of meeting such a man is suddenly to turn upon him , and ask him to give you a brief and lucid account of the views he is condemning . Ask him to tell you what are the theological peculiarities of Bunsen ; and what is the exact teaching of Mr. Maurice . He does not know , you may be tolerably sure . In the case of the latter eminent man , I never met anybody // who did know : and I have the firmest belief that he does not know himself . I was told , lately , of an eminent foreigner who came to Britain to promote a certain public end . For its promotion , the eminent man wished to conciliate the sympathies of a certain small class of religionists . He procured an introduction to a leading man among them , - a good , hut very stupid and self-conceited man . This man entered into talk with the eminent foreigner , and ranged over a multitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end the foreigner was astonished by the good , but stupid man suddenly exclaiming ,  --  " Now , Sir , I have been reckoning you up : you wo n't do : you are a " - no matter what . It was something that had nothing earthly to do with the end to be promoted . The religious demagogue had been trotting out the foreigner ; and he had found him unsound . The religious demagogue belonged to a petty dissenting sect , no doubt ; and he was trying for his wretched little Shibboleth . But you may have seeu the like , even with leading men in National Churches . And I have seen a pert little whipper-snapper ask a venerable clergyman what he thought of a certain outrageous lay - preacher , and receive the clergyman 's reply , that he thought most unfavorably of many of the lay-preacher 's doings , with a self-conceited smirk that seemed to say to the venerable clergyman , " I have been reckoning you up : you wo n't do . " People whom you can not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeable . There are men whom you feel it is vain to speak to , - whether you are mentioiming facts or stating arguments . All the while you are speaking , they are thinking of what they are themselves to say next . There is a strong current , as it were , setting outward from their minds ; and it prevents what you say from getting in . You know , if a pipe be full of water , running strongly one way , it is vain to think to push in a stream running the other way . You can not get at their attention . You can not get at the quick of their mental sensorium . It is not the dull of hearing whom it is hardest to get to hear ; it is rather the man who is roaring out himself and so who can not attend to anything else . Now this is provoking . It is. a mortifying indication of the little importance that is attached to what we are saying ; and there is something of the irritation that is produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inert matter . And there is something provoking even in the outward signs that the mind is in a non-receptive state . You remember the eye that is looking beyond you , - the grin that is not at anything funny in what you say , - the occasional inarticulate sounds that are put in at the close of your senteiices , as if to delude you with a show of attention . The non-receptive mind is occasionally found in clever men ; but the men who exhibit it are invariably very conceited : they can think of nothing hut themselves . And you may find the last-named characteristic strongly developed even in men with gray hair , who ought to have learned better through the experience of a pretty long life . There are other minds which are very receptive . They secum to have a strong power of suctioii . They take in , very decidedly , all that is said to them . The best mind , of course , is that which combines both characteristics , - which is strongly receptive when it ought to be receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be giving out . The power of receptivity is greatly increased by habit . I remember feeling awe-stricken by the intense attention with which a very great judge was wont , in ordinary conversation , to listen to all that was said to him . It was the habit of the judgment-seat , acquired through many years of listening , with every faculty awake , to the arguments addressed to him . But when you began to make some statement to him , it was positively alarming to see him look you full in the face , and listen with inconceivable fixedness of attention to all you said . You could not help feeling that really the // small remark you had to make was not worth that great mind 's grasping it so intently , as he might have grasped an argument by Follett . The mind was intensely receptive , when it was receiving at all . But I remember , too , that , when the great judge began to speak , then his mind was ( so to speak ) streaming out ; and he was particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that might be suggested to him . It is extremely disagreeable , when a vulgar fellow , whom you hardly know , addresses you by your surname with great familiarity of manner . And such a person will take no hint that he is disagreeable , - however stiff , and however formally polite , you may take pains to he to him . It is disagreeable , when persons , with whom you have no desire to be on terms of intimacy , persist in putting many questions to you as to your private concerns , - such as your annual income and expenditure , and the like . No doubt , it is both pleasant and profitable for people who are not rich to compare notes on these matters with some frank and hearty friend whose means and outgoings are much the same as their own . I do not think of such a case , - but of the prying curiosity of persons who have no right to pry , and who , very generally , while diligently prying into your affairs , take special care not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , while making a pretence of revealing to you all their secrets , will often tell a very small portion of them , and make various statements which you at the time are quite aware are not true . There are not many things more disagreeable than a very stupid and ill-set old woman , who , quite unaware what her opinion is worth , expresses it with entire confidence upon many subjects of which she knows nothing whatever , and as to which she is wholly incapable of judging . And the self-satisfied and confident air with which she settles the most difficult questions , and pronounces unfavorable judgment upon people ten thousand times wiser and better than herself , is an insufferably irritating phenomenon . It is a singular fact , that the people I have in view invariably combine extreme ugliness with spitefulness and self-conceit . Such a person will make particular inquiries of you as to some near relative of your own ,  --  and will add , with a malicious and horribly ugly expression of face , that she is glad to hear how very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence several times , laying great emphasis and significance upon the very muck improved . Of course , the notion conveyed to any stranger who may be present is that your relative must in former days have been an extremely bad fellow . The fact probably is , that he has always , man and boy , been particularly well-behaved , and that really you were not aware that lie needed any special improvement , - save , indeed , in the sense that every human being might he and ought to be a great deal better than he is . People who are always vaporing about their own importance , and the value of their own possessions , are disagreeable . We all know such people : and they are made more irritMing by the fact , that their boasting is almost invariably absurd and false . 1 ( 10 not mean ethically false , but logically false . For doubtless , in many cases , human beings honestly think themselves and their possessions as much better than other men and their possessions as they say they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country-town , you may be sure that each of the thirty families in its secret soul looks down upon the other twenty-nine , and fancies that it stands on a totally different level . And it is a kind arrangement of Providence , that a man 's own children , horses , house , and other possessions , are so much more interesting to himself than are the children , horses , and houses of other men , that he can readily persuade himself that they are as much better in fact as they are more interesting to his personal feeling . But it is provoking , when a man is always obtrud // ing on you how highly he estimates his own belongings , and how much better than yours he thinks them , even when this is done in all honesty and simplicity ; and it is infuriating , when a man keeps constantly telling you things which he knows are not true , as to the preciousness and excellence of the gifts with which fortune has endowed him . You feel angry , when a man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty , all as nearly as possible alike , tells you with an air of confidence that he has gpt the finest house in Scotland , or in England , as the case may be . You are irritated by the man who on all occasions tells you that he drives in his mail-phaeton " five hundred pounds ' worth of horse - flesh . " You are well aware that he did not pay a quarter of that sum for the animals in question : and you assume as certain that the dealer did not give him that pair of horses for less than they were worth . It is somewhat irritating , when a man , not remarkable in any way , begins to tell you that he can hardly go to any part of the world without being recogni zed by some one who remembers his striking aspect or is familiar with his famous name . " It costs me three hundred a year , having that picture to look at , " said Mr. Windbag , pointing to a picture hanging on a wall in his library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand pounds for that picture ; which at five per cent . would yield the annual income named . You repeat Windbag 's statement to an eminent artist . The artist knows the picture . He looks at you fixedly , and for all comment on Windbag 's story says , ( he is a Scotchinan , ) " HOOT TOOT ! " But the disposition to vapor is deep-set in human nature . There are not very many men or women whom I would trust to give an accurate account of their family , dwelling , influence , and general position , to people a thousand miles from home , who were not likely ever to be able to verify the picture drawn . It is hardly necessary to mention among disagreeable people those individuals who take pleasure in telling you that you are looking ill ,  --  that you arc falling off , physically or mentally . " Surely you have lost some of your teeth since I saw you last , " said a good man to a man of seventy-five years : " I can not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And so obtuse , and so thoroughly devoid of gentlemanly feeling , was that good man , that , when admonished that he ought not to speak in that fashion to a man in advanced years , he could not for his life see that he had done anything unkind or unmannerly . " I dare say you are wearied lvi ' preachin ' to-day : you see you re gettin ' frail noo , " said a Scotch elder , in my hearing , to a worthy clergyman . Seldom has it cost me a greater effort than it did to refrain from turning to the elder , and saying with candor , " What a boor and what a fool you must be , to say that ! " It was as well I did not : the boor would not have known what I meant . lie would not have known the provocation which led me to give him my true opinion of him . " How very bald you are getting ! " said a really good-natured man to a friend he was meeting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part made by men who , in good faith , have not the least idea that they are making themselves disagreeable . There is no malicious intention . It is a matter of pure obtuseness , stupidity , selfishness , and vulgarity . But an obtuse , stupid , selfish , and vulgar person is disagreeable . And your right course will he to carefully avoid all intercourse with such a person . But besides people who blunder into saying unpleasant things , there are a few who do so of set intention . And such people ought to be cracked . They can do a great deal of harm ,  --  inflict a great deal of suffering . I believe that human beings in general are more miserable than you think . They are very anxious ,  --  very careworn ,  --  stung by a host of worries ,  - -  a good deal disappointed , in many ways . And in the case of many people , worthy and able , there is a very low estimate of themselves and their abilities , and a sad tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind word said to such is a real benefit , and a great lightener of the heart , an ingenious malignant may suggest to such things which are as a stunning blow , and as an added load on the weary frame and mind . I have seen , with burning indignation , a malignant beast ( I mean man ) playing upon that tendency to a terrible apprehensiveness which is horn with many men . I have seen the beast vaguely suggest evil to the nervous and apprehensive man . " This can not end here " : " I shall take my own measures now " : " A higher authority shall decide between us " : I have heard the beast say , and then go away . Of course I knew well that the beast could and would do nothing , and I hastened to say so to the apprehensive man . But I knew that the poor fellow would go away home , and hrood over the beast 's ominous threats , and imagine a hundred terrible contingencies , and work himself into a fever of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the vague threatener counted on all that , and wished it , and enjoyed the thought of the slow torment he was causing , that I choose to call him a beast rather than a man . Indeed , there is an order of beings , worse than beasts , to which that being should rather be referred . You have said or done something which has given offence to certain of your neighbors . Mr. Snarling comes and gives you a full and particular account of the indignation they feel , and of their plans for vengeance . Mr. Snarling is happy to see you look somewhat annoyed , and he kindly says , " Oh , never mind : this will blow over , as other things you have said and done have blown over . " Thus he vaguely suggests that you have given great offence on many occasions , and made many hitter enemies . lie adds , in a musing voice , " Yes , as MANY other things have blown over . " Turn the individual out , and cut his acquaintance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your neighborhood . Of all disagreeable men , a man with his tendencies is the most disagreeable . The bitterest and longest - lasting east - wind acts less perniciously on body and soul than does the society of Mr. Snarling . Suspicious people are disagreeable ; also people who are always taking the pet . Indeed , suspiciousness and pettedness generally go together . There are many men and women who are always imagining that some insult is designed by the most innocent words and doings of those around them , and always suspecting that some evil intention against their peace is cherished by some one or other . It is most irritating to have anything to do with such impracticable and silly mortals . But it is a delightful thing to work along with a man who never takes offence , - a frank , manly man , who gives credit to others for the same generosity of nature which he feels within himself , and who , if he thinks he has reason to complain , speaks out his mind and has things cleared up at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you without paying the postage , - leaving you to pay twopence for each penny which he has thus saved . The loss of twopence is no great matter ; but there is something irritatin in the feeling , that your correspondent has deliberately resolved that he would save his penny at the cost of your twopence . There is a man , describing himself as a clergyman of the Church of England , ( I can not think he is one , ) who occasionally sends me an abusive anonymous letter , and who invariably sends his letters unpaid . I do not mind about the man s abuse ; but I confess I grudge my twopence . I have observed , too , that the people who send letters unpaid do so habitually . I have known the same individual send six successive letters unpaid . And it is probably within the experience of most of my readers , that , out of ( say ) a hundred correspondents , ninety-nine invariably pay their letters properly , while time after time the hundredth sends his with the abominable big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worries you by the old statement that the postman is waiting . Let me advise every reader to do what I intend doing // for the future : to wit , to refuse to receive any unpaid letter . You may be quite sure that by so doing you will not lose any letter that is worth having . A class of people , very closely analogous to that of the people who do not pay their letters , is that of such as are constantly borrowing small sums from their friends , which they never restore . If you should ever be thrown into the society of such , your right course will be to take care to have no money in your pocket . People are disagreeable who are given to talking of the badness of their servants , the undutifulness of their children , the smokiness of their chimneys , and the deficiency of their digestive organs . And though , with a true and close friend , it is a great relief ; and a special tie , to have spoken out your heart about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ordinary acquaintances , to keep these to yourself . It must be admitted , with great regret , that people who make a considerable profession of religion have succeeded in making themselves more thoroughly disagreeable than almost any other human beings have ever made themselves . You will find people , who claim not merely to be pious and Christian people , but to be very much more pious and Christian than others , who are extremely uncharitable , unamiable , repulsive , stupid , and narrowminded , and intensely opinionated and self-satisfied . We know , from a very high authority , that a Christian ought to be an epistle in commendation of the blessed faith he holds . But it is beyond question that many people who profess to be Christians are like grim Gorgons ' heads , warning people off from having anything to do with Christianity . Why should a middle - aced clergyman walk about the streets with a sullen and malignant scowl always on his face , which at the best would be a very ugly one ? Why should another walk with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till they seem likely to roll out ? And why should a third be always dabbled over with a clammy perspiration , and prolong all his vowels to twice the usual length ? It is , indeed , a most woful thing , that people who evince a spirit in every respect the direct contrary of that of our Blessed Redeemer should fancy that they are Christians of singular attainments ; and it is more woful still , that many young l ) eople should be scared away into irreligion or unbelief by the wretched delusion , that these creatures , wickedly caricaturing Christianity , are fairly representing it . I have beheld more deliberate malice , more lying and cheating , more backbitin* and slandering , denser stupidity , and greater self-sufficiency , among bad-hearted and wrong-headed religionists , than among any other order of human beings . I have known more malignity and slander conveyed in the form of a prayer than should have consigned any ordinary libeller to the pillory . I have known a person who made evening prayer a means of infuriating and stabbing the servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou knowest , Lord , how my servants have been occupied this day " : with these words did the blasphemous mockery of prayer begin one Sunday evening in a house I could easily indicate : and then the man , under the pretext of addressing the Almighty , raked up all the misdoings of the servants ( they being present , of course ) in a fashion , which , if he had ventured on it at any other time , would probably have led some of them to assault him . " I went to Edinburgh , " said a Highland elder , " and was there a Sabbath . It was an awfu ' sight ! There , on the Sabbath-day , you would see people walking along the street , smiling AS IF THEY WERE I'ERFECTLY IIA*-rir ! " There was the gravamen of the poor Highlander 's charge . To think of people being or looking happy on the Lord 's day ! And , indeed , to think of a Christian man ever venturing to be happy at all ! " Yes , this parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brown , " said a spiteful and venomous old woman , - with a glance of deadly malice at a young lad who was present . That young lad was the son of the clergyman // of the parish ,  --  one of the most diligent and exemplary clergymen in Britain . Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown were the clergymen who preceded him . And the spiteful old woman adopted this means of sticking a pin into the young lad ,  --  conveying the idea that there was a sad falling off now . I saw and heard her , my reader . Now , when an ordinary spiteful person says a malicious thing , being quite aware that she is saying a malicious thing , and that her motive is pure malice , you are disgusted . But when a spiteful person says a malicious thing , all the while fancying herself a very pious person , and fancying that in gratifying her spite she is acting from Christian principle ,  --  J say the sight is to me one of the most disgusting , perplexing , and miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the attacks of enemies on the blessed faith in which I live , and hope to die ; but it is dismal to see how our holy religion is misrepresented before the world by the vile impostors who pretend to be its friends . Among the disagreeable people who make a profession of religion , probably many are purely hypocrites . But we willingly believe that there are people , in whom Christianity appears in a wretchedly stunted and distorted form , who yet are right at the root . It does not follow that a man is a Christian , because he turns up his eyes and drawls out his words , and , when asked to say grace , offers a prayer of twenty minutes ' duration . But , again , it does not follow that he is not a Christian , though he may do all these things . The bitter sectary , who distinctly says that a humble , pious man , just dead , has " gone to hell , " because he died in the bosom of the National Church , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , in the main , within the Good Shepherd 's fold , wherein lie fancies there are very few but himself . The dissenting teacher , who declared from his pulpit that the parish clergyman ( newly come , and an entire stranger to him ) was " a servant of Satan , " may possibly have been a good man , after all . Grievous defects and errors may exist in a Christian character , which is a Christian character still . And the Christian , horribly disagreeable and repulsive now , will some day , we trust , have all that purged away . But I do not hesitate to say , that any Christian , by so far as he is disagreeable and repulsive , deviates from the right thing . Oh , my reader , when my heart is sometimes sore through what I see of disagreeable traits in Christian character , what a blessed relief there is in turning to the simple pages , and seem for the thousandth time The True Christian Character ,  --  so different ! Yes , thank God , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man should be humbly aiming to be : and when we see That Face , and hear That Voice , there is something that soothes and cheers among the wretched imperfections ( in one s self as in others ) of the present , - something that warms the heart , and that brings a man to his knees ! The present writer has a relative who is Professor of Theology in a certain famous University . With that theologian I recently had a conversation on the matter of which we have just been thinking . The Professor lamented bitterly the unchristian features of character which may be found in many l ) eople making a great parade of their Christianity . He mentioned various facts , which had recently come to his own knowledge , which would sustain stronger expressions of opinion than any which I have given . But he went on to say , that it would be a sad thing , if no fools could get to heaven ,  --  nor any unamiable , narrow-minded , sour , and stupid people . Now , said he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiosyncrasy . When a fool becomes a Christian , he will be a foolish Christian ; a narrow-minded man will be a narrow-minded Christian* a stupid man , a stupid Christian . And though a malignant man will have his malignity much diminished , it by no means follows that it will be completely rooted out . " When I would do good , evil is present with me . " " I find a law in // my members , warring against the law of my mind , and enslaving me to the law of sin . " But you are not to blame Christianity for the stupidity and unamiability of Christians . If they be disagreeable , it is not the measure of true religion they have got that makes them so . In so far as they are disagreeable , they depart from the standard . You know , you may make water sweet or sour , - you may make it red , blue , black and it will be water still , though its purity and pleasantness are much interfered with . In like manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with a great many features of character very inconsistent with itself . The cup of fair water may have a bottle of ink emptied into it , or a little verjuice , or even a little strychnine . And yet , though sadly deteriorated , though hopelessly disguised , the fair water is there , and not entirely neutralized . And it is worth remarking , that you will find many persons who are very charitable to blackguards , but who have no charity for the weaknesses of really good people . They will hunt out the act of thoughtless liberality done by the scapegrace who broke his mother 's heart and squandered his poor sisters ' little portions they will make much of that liberal act , - such an act as tossing to some poor Magdalen a purse filled with money which was probably not his own and they will insist that there is hope for the blackguard yet . But these persons will tightly shut their eyes against a great many substantially good deeds done by a man who thinks Prelacy the abomination of desolation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I grant you that there is a certain fairness in trying the blackguard and the religionist by different standards . Where the pretension is higher , the test may justly be more severe . But I say it is unfair to puzzle out with diligence the one or two good things in the character of a reckless scamp , and to refuse moderate attention to the many good points about a weak , narrow-minded , and uncharitable good person . I ask for charity in the estimating of all human characters ,  - -  even in estimating the character of the man who would show no charity to another . I confess freely that in the lastnamed case the exercise of charity is extremely difficult .
