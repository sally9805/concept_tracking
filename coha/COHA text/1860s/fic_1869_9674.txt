Main text FOR TWO MALES . JOHN .  --  There is much talk about Temperance Societies ; but I think few people quite understand them , except those who are members thereof . I am not quite sure that I am well informed on the subject , and as you are a member , perhaps you will be good enough to explain what a Temperance Society is . THOMAS .  --  With pleasure . It consists of a number of persons who have agreed not to use alcoholic drinks , who have signed a pledge to that effect , and have formed themselves into a Society to strengthen each other 's hands , and to induce others to follow their example . JOHN .  --  But why give up the drink altogether ? Can not men take it or leave it alone ? It is the abuse , not the use , that does the harm , is it not ? THOMAS .  --  The use , as it is called , leads to the abuse . Drunkenness is only the result of drinking . Our country abounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean to say that men can be strong , do their work , and bear fatigue and exposure as well without the drink as with it ? THOMAS .  --  There is no doubt about it now , at least among those who are properly informed on the subject . The brick-makers , anchor-smiths , harvest-men , etc. , in various parts , have tried it and succeeded admirably . JOHN .  --  But all who drink do not become drunkards . THOMAS .  --  Truly ; nor do all gamblers lose their money and character , but many of them do ; and as there is great danger of my doing so , therefore I abstain . Besides , what can be done better without , should be avoided , especially when the doing it might involve me and others in trouble . JOHN .  --  I think your temperance people make too much of drink ; you say there are not less than sixty thousand drunkards in the land , and that about sixty thousand die every year . THOMAS .  --  This may seem a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who love the drink , and have taken little pains to get at the facts . JOHN .  --  Then you say that at least one hundred millions of money are spent , directly and indirectly , in this drink . Now think of that enormous sum ! It can not be . THOMAS .  --  It 's all very well for you to say it can not be ; but that assertion has never yet been called in question by any competent authority . Allow me to say I do not think you are one . JOHN .  --  But if so many persons were made drunkards every year , should we not have many more of them about than there are ? THOMAS .  --  Thousands of them are imprisoned for crime , and thousands more shut up in lunatic asylums . They are a short-lived race and die off quickly . JOHN .  --  Then what becomes of their wives , widows , and families ? THOMAS .  --  Why , in many cases , they become a town charge , while in others they are taken care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pauperism of this country , from drink , is fearful . JOHN .  --  What is a pauper ? THOMAS .  --  A person who , being unable to procure food , clothes , and shelter , is provided with them by the taxpayers . JOHN .  --  But do you not think you are too hard upon the drink when you say it produces seven-tenths of the crime of this country ? THOMAS .  --  No . Facts prove it ; and facts are stubborn things . Besides , who ought to be better informed on these matters than the judges of the land ? They confirm this opinion . JOHN .  --  If Temperance Societies have done so much good as you and your friends say they have , how is it that all good people do not join you ? THOMAS .  --  Because prejudice , appetite , custom , and interest withold the light from them . They are human , and therefore err . But there is much improvement in this respect , and we must hope on . JOHN .  --  When and where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years ago in this country of reforms . They first merely rejected ardent spirits , but now we have grafted the teetotal principle on to their anti-spirit system . JOHN .  --  Before we part , there is one other point on which I wish to have a little information . I do not like your pledge . If people choose to abstain , why not do so without a pledge ? It seems so unmanly . THOMAS .  --  It is just the contrary , and gives proof that he who has hitherto been carried away by his appetite and by the customs of society , has at last awakened to the dignity of independence and manhood , and asserted his determination to be free . That is manly . JOHN .  --  But does not taking a pledge destroy moral freedom and responsibility ? THOMAS .  --  Certainly not ; no more than engagements and pledges of any other kind . It has proved a great boon to many a poor drunkard , who , struggling with innumerable temptations within and around him , has thus , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first , only because he had pledged himself ; but afterward continued , because he saw it was right to do so . But while I am on this point , excuse me one moment longer while I say , that of all the means of deliverance and of safety in this our probationary state , if any one in God 's revealed word stands out in bolder relief than another , it is the system of pledges , covenants , and promises . He has given it His sanction by His examples , entering into solemn covenant with many , and giving pledges for its fulfilment . So also the patriarchs , and prophets , and apostles , and kings , and people , throughout the Scriptures , are to be found uniting in pledges and covenants ; and invariably without exception , when these pledges and covenants for good objects have been kept , the blessing of God has attended them .
