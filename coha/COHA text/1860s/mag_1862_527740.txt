THE REHABILITATION OF SPAIN . THREE hundred and fifty years ago , a Spanish gentleman sailed on a cruise that may be considered remarkable even in the history of the wonderful adventures of the age of Columbus and Da Gama . Juan Ponce de Leon , having lost the government of Porto Rico , resolved to discover a world for himseW and so become as renowned as " The Admiral . " With the strong fanaticism of his time and his race , he believed that there was a third world to be found , and that it " had been saved up " for him , a gentleman of Leon , and a loyal subject of their Catholic Majesties , who had done good service for his sovereigns and the faith in Granada , and later in the Indies . While he was thinking of the course in which he should sail , he was told that to the North there lay a land which not only contained unlimited gold , and many other material good things , but also a fountain of such marvellous nature that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . This revival of an old classic story * fired the imagination of the adventurous cavalier , * The belief in the existence of the Fountain of Youth belongs to many countries and to all times . Not to mention other instances , Herodotus , in his third book , ( 23 , ) tells of a fountain of the kind which was possessed by " the long-lived Ethiopians , " and which caused the bather 's flesh to become sleek and glossy , and sent forth an odor like that of violets . Peter Martyr , to whom we owe so many lively pictures of the effect on the European mind of the discovery of America and its consequences , wrote to Leo X. of the marvellous fountain which was sought by Ponce de Leon , and in terms that leave no doubt that he was well inclined to place considerable faith in the truth of the common story . The clever Pope probably believed as much of it as he did of the New Testament . Peter Martyr does not , we think , mention the Ethiopian fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the age of the revival of classic Learning , he must have read . // and be sailed forthwith ( March 3,1512 ) in search of a land so rich in things that all men , from philosophers to politicians , desire to have ,  --  perfect health and boundless wealth . We need not say that Ponce de Leon failed as completely as if he had sailed in search of the Northwest Passage , for he died in less than ten years , a wornout old man , aged beyond his years , leaving little gold behind him , and presenting at his parting hour anything but the appearance of youth . He was a type of the Sphniards of those days , who believed everything , and whose valor was as great as their credulity ; and his cruise in search of the Fontaine de Jouvence was quite worthy of a native of a country which seems to be allowed the privilege of an occasional " dip " into that fountain , though at long intervals , but is denied the power of constantly bathing in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and apparently is never so near to degradation as when she is most strong , and never so near to power as when she is at the weakest point to which a nation can sink and still remain a nation . All states have had both good and evil fortune , but no other great European kingdom has known the extreme and extraordinary changes that have been experienced by Spain . France has met with heavy reverses , but she has been a great and powerful country ever since the days of Philip Augustus , whose body was turned up the other day , after a repose of more than six centuries . Even the victories of the English Plantagenets could but temporarily check her growth ; and notwithstanding the successes of Eugbne and Marlborough , Louis XIV . left France a greater country than he found it . England 's lowest point was reached during the reigns of her first four Stuart monarchs , but her weakness was exhibited only on the side of foreign politics : it being absurd to suppose that the country which could produce Hampden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who formed the Cavalier and Roundhead armies , was then in a state of decay . At the worst , she was but depressed , and the removal of such dead weights from her as Charles I. and James II . was all that was necessary to enable her to vindicate her claim to a first-rate place in the European family . In 1783 , at the close of the American War , men said that all was over with England ; but so mistaken were they , that at that very time were growing up the men who were to lead her fleets and armies with success in contests compared with which the combats of Gates and Burgoyne , of Cornwallis and Washington , were but as skirmishes . No other nation , perhaps , ever had so sudden and so great a fall as that which France met with in 1814-15 . It was the most perfect specimen of the " grand smash " order of things that history mentions , if we consider both what was lost , and how quickly it was lost . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of true strength . There was taken from France that which she had no right to hold , any more than England has at this moment to hold Gibraltar and Aden and India . France remained much as she had been under the old monarchy , and there were some millions more of Frenchmen than had ever lived under a Bourbon of former days , and they were of a better breed than the political slaves , and in some instances the personal serfs , who had existed under kings that misruled at Versailles and Marly . How rapidly France rose above the effects of her fall we have seen , as her recovery belongs to contemporary history . Her various mind was never more vigorous than it has been since 1815 . As to her political and military greatness , millions of men who were living on Waterloo 's day , and who read of that " dishonest victory " as " news , " lived to read the details of Solferino , and of the redemption of Italy . Not so has it been with Spain . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow herself to resemble them even in the matter of making sacrifices to Mutability . Had Juaa Ponce de Leon been so unlucky as to find the Fountain of Youth , and had he been so unwise as to reserve its waters for his own private // washing and drinking , and so have lived from the age of American discovery to the *ge of American secession , he would , as a Spaniard , have been forced to undergo many mortifications in the course of the dozen generations that he would then have survived beyond his originally appointed time . Spain has been a greater country than any other in Europe , but she has experienced greater changes than any other European country . She has never known such a catastrophe as tha% which befell France in the early part of our century , but her losses have been far beyond those which . France has ever met with . It was the lot of France to fall at once , to pass from the highest place in the world to the lowest at one step , to ab-dicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dreams , but which is of rare occurrence in real life . It has been the lot of Spain to perish by the dry rot , and to lose imperial positions through the operation of internal causes . So situated as to be almost beyond the reach of effective foreign attack , Spain has had to contend against the processes of domestic decay more than any other leading nation of modern times . To these she has often had to succumb , but she has never failed in due time to redeem herself , and , after having been a by-word for imbecility , to rise again to a commanding place . Three times in less than three centuries have the Spaniards fallen so low as to become of less account in the European system than the feeblest c* the Northern peoples and on each occasion has the native , inherent vigor of the race enabled it to astonish mankind by entering again upon the career of greatness , not always , it must be allowed , after the wisest fashion , but so as to testify to the continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman of the sixteenth century . Spain was of considerable importance in Europe from a very early period of modern history ; but the want of union among her communities , and the presence of Mussulman power in the PeninBula , prevented her from exercising more influence in the Old World than would fall to our share in the New , should the principles of the Secession party prevail . It was not until a union had been effected through the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella , that the power of Christian Spain was brought to bear upon the remnant of the Mussulmans of that country , and rounded and completed the work of redeeming it from the dominion of the followers of the Prophet , who had , on the whole , ruled their possessions better than the Christian states had been ruled . The fall of Granada , in 1492 , was hailed throughout Christendom as a great triumph for the Cross , as in one sense it was ; but there was not a . Christian country which would not have been the gainer , if the Mussulmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they played with the adversaries of their religion in a duel that had endured for more than seven hundred years . Many a Pagan country , too , which had never heard either of Jesus or of Mahomet , was interested in the eVent of the War of Granada . Montezuma and Atahuallpa , who never had so much as dreamed of Europe , had their fate determined by the decision of the long struggle between the rival religions and peoples of the Peninsula ; and Boabdil was not the only monarch , by many , who then and there had his lot decided . Much of America , and not a little of Europe , were conquered on the Plains of Granada ; and " the Last Sigh of the Moor " may have been given , not so much to his own sad fate , as over the evil that was to come , and which was to affect popes and princes and peoples alike . There was not a country in the world but might have served itself well , if it had sent aid to the struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Christians , the world might have sent forth a wail in consequence of it , as best expressing the sense that should have existed of the woes which that victory was to be the means of bringing upon mankind . The issue of that Peninsular contest was in every // way bad , and no good has ever come from it , but evil in abundance . The fountain that was then unsealed was one of hitter waters only . The sympathies of men should he with the Moors , who were the more enlightened , the more liberal , and the wiser of the two races that then grappled for a final encounter . Being the weaker party , they fell , hut they were destined to have grand funeral games . Freed from the presence of any Mussulman states , Spain was enabled to begin a grand European career in the latter years of the fifteenth century , the conquest of Granada and the discovery of America having given her a degree of power that gained for her the world 's profoundest respect . Partly by success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she became the first member of the European commonwealth in a quarter of a century after the overthrow of the Moors . The first of her Austro-Burgundian kings was made Emperor of Germany , and by birth he was lord of the Netherlands . In a few years , and after the conquest of Mexico , he had a French king among his captives , and the Pope was shut up by one of his armies in the Castle of St. Angelo . Yet a few years more , and Peru was added to the dominions of Spain . The position and principles of the Emperor-King made him the champion of the old order of things in Europe as against the Reformation , which added immensely to his power . Spain was then , as she is now , and as probably she ever will be , intensely Catholic , and as Papal as any country valuing its independence well could be . How she regarded Protestantism , and all other forms of " heresy , " we know from the fiery energy - it was literally of a fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of cvery degree , upon whom her iron hand could be laid . Had Charles Y. been inclined to favor the Reformation , from his position as Emperor of Germany , he would soon have been diverted from any cuch thought by considerations drawn from his position as King of the Spains . A Mussulman , or a Hebrew , or an avowed atheist would have had a l*etter chance of being a powerful and popular sovereign at Valladolid than a pious man who should have been inclined to look with favor upon Dr. Luther . It may be doubted if even a king could have been safe from the inquiries of the Inquisition . Thus Spain was not only at the head of Europe because of her military superiority and the extent of her home territory and foreign dominion , but , as the champion of the Church , she had a moral power such as ian other country has ever possessed , her championship of the Pope being something very different from Napoleon III . ' s championship of the Pope of to-day . The German aristocracy might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they professed readiness to aid in warfare against the Reformers ; but no one could doubt the zeal of the Spanish patricians , when they dedicated their swords and lances to the work of extirpating all enemies of the faith . An Englishman of 1857 could not have been more hostile to a Sepoy than a Spaniard of 1657 was to a Protestant . Religious power , political power , military power , and long-continued success in the cabinet and in the field , all combined to place Spain in a position such as no other nation had ever known , such as no other nation ever will know . Even the failures of Charles V. - his flight before Maurice of Saxony , and his defeat at Metz - did not sensibly abate the power of Spain , for they concerned Germany more than they did the Peninsular subjects of the disappointed monarch . When Philip II . succeeded to most of his father 's abdicated thrones , there was no diminution of Spanish pretensions , and he became the mightiest sovereign that Europe had known since Charlemagne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal disappointment to both father and son , but it was no loss of real power to the elder branch of the House of Austria . The death of Mary of England , though it prevented Philip S // from availing himself of the men and money of his wife 's kingdom , was rather beneficial to him , as chief of the Spanish dominion , than otherwise . What could he have done with the haughty , arrogant , self-sufficient islanders , who were as proud as the Castilians themselves , without any of the imperial pretensions of the Castilians to justify their pride , had Mary lived and reigned , while he alone should have ruled ? There would have been civil war in England but for Mary 's death , which occurred at a happy time both for her and for her subjects . Philip also lost a portion of his Northern hereditary dominions , because he would have a tyranny established in the Netherlands . But all that he lost in Germany , in the Netherlands , and in Britain was compensated by his easy conquest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Portugal of those times was a very different country from the Portugal of these times . It was not only Portugal and the Algarves that Philip added to the dominions of Spain , - and that alone would have been a great thing , for it would have perfected the Spanish rule of the Peninsula , always a most desirable event in the eyes of Castilians , - but the enormous and widespread possessions of Portugal in Africa , in America , and in Asia became subject to the conqueror . Portugal alone was of far more value to Spain than England could have been but Portugal and her colonies together made a greater prize than England , Holland , and Germany could have made , recollecting how full of " heretics " those countries were , and that the more heretical subjects Philip should have had , the less powerful he would have been . Portugal was as " Faithful " as Spain was " Catholic , " and both titles now belonged to Philip . At that time , Philip 's power , to outward seeming , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lose Holland , and it was certain that he had gained Portugal and all her dependencies . He was absolute master of the Spanish Peninsula , and his will was law over nearly all the Italian Peninsula except that portion of it which was ruled by Yenice . He alone of European sovereigns had vast possessions in both Indies , the East and the West . He was monarch of no insignificant part of Africa , and in America he was the Great King , his dominion there being almost as little disputed as was that of Selkirk in his island . He was still master of the best part of the Low Countries , and the Hollanders were regarded as nothing more than his rebellious subjects . He was the sole Western potentate who had lieutenants in the East , who ruled over Indian territories that never had been reached even by the Macedonian Alexander . From his cabinet in Madrid , he fixed the fate of many millions of the first peoples in the world , members of the races most advanced in all the arts of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every-day life of men in the principal cities of both hemispheres . He who was sovereign at Madrid and Lisbon , at Naples and Milan , at Brussels and Antwerp , was sovereign also at Mexico and Lima , at Goa and Ormuz . Philip 's power was by no means to be measured solely by the extent and various character of his dominions . His position , as a great monarch , and as the chief champion of the Catholic cause , made him , at times , master of many European countries over which he could exercise no direct rule . England trembled before him even after the " Armada 's pride " had been rebuked , and Elizabeth came much nearer being vanquished by him than is generally supposed . Nothing but the blockade of Parma 's forces by the Dutch , and the occurrence of storms , saved England from experiencing that sad fate which she has ever been so ready , with cause and without cause , to visit upon other countries . In Ireland the Spanish monarch was more respected than Elizabeth , its nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with reverence as the first of Catbolie princes , but also with that affection which men ever feel for the enemies of // their enemies . Whoso hates England is sure of Irish affection , and as it is today so was it three hundred years ago , and so will it ever be , unless the very human heart itself shall undergo a complete change . Scotland furnished a Spanish party that might have become formidable to England , had events taken a slightly different turn and the old Caledonian hatred of the Southrons had not been extinguished by the success of the Reform party in both countries . The Scotch Catholics called Philip " the pillar of the Christian commonwealth , " ( Totius reipublicce Christiance colu ? nen , ) and sought his assistance to restore the old religion to their country . France was for several years more at the command of Philip than at that of any of its own sovereigns , the weak dregs of the line of Valois . The League would willingly have transferred the French crown to any person whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensible decision of Henry IV. , that Paris was worth a mass , prevented that crown from passing to some member of the Spanish branch of the House of Austria . In Germany Philip had an influence corresponding to his power , which was all the greater because he was the head of a Germanic house that under him seemed destined to develop an old idea that it should become ruler of the world . If anything marred his strength in that quarter , it was the fact that the junior branch of the Austrian family was at that time inclined to liberalism in politics , - an offence against the purposes and traditions of the whole family of which few members of it have ever been guilty , before or since . But this mighty Spanish power came to an end with the monarch in whom it was represented . The sources of Spanish strength had been drying up for a century , but the personal character of the successive monarchs , and vast foreign acquisitions , had disguised the fact from the world . Philip died in 1598 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his son , a youth of feeble mind , but under whose rule a change of policy was effected , not , as has been sometimes supposed , from any deep views on the part of the Count-Duke Lerma , but because it was impossible for Spain to maintain the place she had held under Philip II . Even had Philip III . been as able a man as his father , or his grandfather , he could not have preserved the ascendency of Spain , - that country having changed much , and Europe more . Every European nation , with the exception of Turkey , - and the Turks were only encamped in Europe ,  - -  had advanced during the sixteenth century , except Spain , which had declined . Thus had she become weak , positively and relatively . Rest was necessary to her , and under the rule of Lerma she obtained it . He supported the peace policy of that old aristocratical party of which Ruy Gomez had been the chief , but which had been hardly heard of in the last twenty years of Philip II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death-bed , regretted that " to his grace in bestowing on him so great a realm , God had not been pleased to add the grace of granting him a successor capable of continuing to rule it " but had his son been all that the most unreasonable parent could have desired , he could not have pursued his father 's policy . Lerma did but act as he was forced to act . The circumstance that the Cathblic Reaction had triumphed was alone sufficient to make a change necessary . Spanish greatness was no longer the leading political interest of the Church , and Rome was at liberty to have some regard to the new powers that were growing up in Europe . Pacific ideas - prevailed . Spain ceased to make war in every direction , and husbanded her resources , and began to renew her native strength . The skeleton bequeathed by Philip II . became clothed with flesh , and sinewy . Could this policy have been continued for a generation , Spanish history might have been made to read differently from the melancholy text it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on . There had always been a strong party // opposed to Lerma , and that statesman 's friendliness to the English and the Dutch made him liable to the charge of favoring heresy , - a charge that was the heaviest that could be brought against any one in the estimation of Philip III. , who was as bigoted as his father . The Catholic and warlike policy of Idiaquez , GranvelIa , and Moura was revived . The two branches of the Austrian family were again brought into the closest alliance , and at a time when the German branch had become even more Catholic than the elder branch . Spain stepped once more into the European arena , and her generals and armies by their abilities and exploits revived recollections of what had been done by Parma and his hosts . Spinola , who was scarcely inferior to Farnese , conquered the Palatinate , and so began the Thirty Years ' War favorably to the Catholic cause . The great victory of Nordlingen , won by the Catholics in 1635 , was due to the valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be as powerful as at any former period , and the revival of her ascendency might have been expected by those who judged only from external indications of strength . Yet a few years , however , and it was clear to all politicians at least that Spain was far gone into a decline , and that the course of Olivar* had been fatal to her greatness ; and the mass of mankind , who judge only from glaring actions , could not fail to appreciate the nature of such events as the defeat of iRocroi and the loss of Portugal , the latter including the loss of all the dependencies of the Portuguese in Africa , America , and India . No historical transaction of the seventeenth century testifies so strongly to the weakness of a firstclass power as the Revolution of Portugal . Though Portugal lay at the very door of Spain , that country slipped from her fceble hands , and she never could recover it . Having resumed her encroaching , domineering course before she had fairly recovered her strength , she broke down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the full extent of her weakness was not generally understood . It is an amusement to read works that were written in the reigns of Philip IV . and Charles II. , in which Spain is spoken of as a great power , and to compare th' words of their writers with the actual facts of the case . If we were to fix upon any one date as indicating the final breaking down of Austrian Spain , it would be the year 1659 , when the treaty of the Pyrenees was made , and when the old rival of France became virtually her vassal . From that time we must date the beginning of that strange interference in Spanish affairs which has formed so much of the public business of France , whereby one of the proudest of peoples have become , as it were , provincials to one of the vainest of peoples . It is true that there were more wars between Austrian Spain and France , but they served only to show that the former had lost the power to contend with her rival , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Ii . should fall to pieces , and furnish spoil to those strong nations that watch over the beds of sick men in purple . The state of decay in which the first Bourbon king of Spain found his inheritance , in 1701 , is well known . The War of the Succession soon followed , and Spain was shorn of some of her most magnificent foreign possessions . All that she had held in Flanders was lost , - and so were Naples , and Sicily , and Sardinia , and the Milanese , and other lands that had been ruled , and welluigh ruined , by the Austro-Burgundian kings . The English had Gibraltar , and were holding Minorca also . Bourbon Spain was not to be Austrian Spain ,  --  that was clear . But this trimming and pruning of the Peninsular monarchy were very useful to it ; and Spain , having been ploughed up by the sword for twelve successive years , was in condition to yield something beyond what it had produced since the death of Philip II . Accordingly , under the ascendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could that remarkable statesman have confined his // labors to affairs purely Spanish in their character and purpose , that country might have taken , and have continued to hold , the first place in Europe . He , however , with all his talents , was intellectually deficient in some important respects , and so all his schemes came to nought , and he fell . He tried to effect too much , and though fully sensible of the necessity of peace to Spain , he plunged into war . He did , in fact , what the rulers of Spain are doing to-day : he sought to restore the old Castilian influence by engaging the country in wars that would have been foolish , even if they had not been unjust , when he should have continued to direct all his attention to its internal affairs . Had he been at the head of any other than a Spanish ministry , Alberoni would probably have borne himself rationally ; but there is something in the politics of Spain that affects even the wisest of heads , often turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strangest of caricatures . It is sometimes said that the most Irish of the people of Ireland are those who have come latest into the green island , there being something in its air and soil that soon converts the stranger into a true Hibernian in all moral respects ; but the remark is more applicable to Spain than to Ireland , as in the former country foreign statesmen have more than once made Spanish policy ridiculous by taking that one step which separates that quality from the sublime . What in the person of a Castilian is at the worst but Quixotic becomes in the foreigner , or man of foreign descent , the merest burlesque upon statesmanship . Alberoni 's fall did not imply the faU of Spain . The renewal of vigor that she had gained under his direction was sufficiently great to carry her well through more than seventy years , during which she stood on an equal footing with France , the Empire , and Great Britain , and for most of the time was the superior of Russia and Prussia , whose European greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century had become somewhat advanced . It is difficult for the men of to-day to understand that Spain was really a great power under the Bourbon kings , down to the first years of the French Revolution . We have seen her , until very recently , a country of little more European account than Portugal ; and that she should , but eighty years since , have treated with England as equal with equal , after having assisted at the work of England 's humiliation , it is hard to comprehend . But such was the fact . Several of the Spanish statesmen of the last century were very superior men , the kingdom itself was strong , and the Indies did not experience any disturbances calculated seriously to embarrass the mother-country . Then the close union that was brought about between France and Spain , in the early days of Charles III . and the last days of Louis XV. , had no unimportant effect on the fortunes of Spain . The Pacte de Famille was one of the greatest political transactions of those days . It was effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of the French Revolution it would have proved most fruitful of remarkable events . Had it never been made , it may well be doubted if the American Revolution could have been a successful movement . That Revolution France was bound to support , both by interest and by sentiment ; and the Family-Compact enabled her to take Spain on to the side of America , where it is evident that her interests scarcely could have taken her ; and Spain 's aid , which was liberally afforded , was necessary to the success of our ancestors . That it was possible thus to place Spain was owing to one of those displays of English insolence that have made the islanders abhorred by the rulers and the ruled of almost every land . " Charles III . of Spain , " says Macaulay , " had early conceived a deadly hatred of England . Twenty years before , when he was King of the Two Sicilics , he had been eager to join the coalition against Maria Theresa . But an English fleet had suddenly appeared in the Bay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // to the palace , had laid a watch on the table , and had told his Majesty that within an hour a treaty of neutrality must be signed , or a bombardment would commence . The treaty was signed ; the squadron sailed out of the hay twenty-four hours after it had sailed in ; and from that day the ruling passion of the humbled prince was aversion to the English name . He was at length in a situation in which he might hope to gratify that passion . He had recently become King of Spain and the Indies . He saw , with envy and apprehension , the triumphs of our navy , and the rapid extension of our colonial empire . He was a Bourbon , and sympathized with the distress of the house from which he sprang . He was a Spaniard ; and no Spaniard could bear to see Gibraltar and Minorca in the possession of a foreign power . Impelled by such feelings , Charles concluded a secret treaty with France . By this treaty , known as the Family-Compact , the two powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearest implication , to make war on England in common . " Such was the origin of an alliance that changed the fate of America , and which might have done as much for Europe but for the fall of the French Bourbons . The statesmen of England , with that short-sightedness which is the badge of all their tribe , were nursing the power of Russia , at an enormous expense , in order that , at a still greater expense , their grandsons might attempt the bridling of that power , in which they succeeded about as well as did Doria in bridling the horses of St. Mark . The partition of Poland showed what Europe had most to fear , and French statesmen were preparing for the Northern blast , while those of England , according to one of their own number , who was a Secretary of State , spoke of it as something indeed inconsistent with national equity and public honor , and therefore engaging their master 's disapprobation , but as not so immediately interesting as to deserve his interposition . Time , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own safety , and she would have united herself with France , Spain , and Naples to resist Russian encroachments ; and Austria , it may be assumed , would have gone with the West and the South against the North , for her statesmen had the sagacity to see that the partition of Poland was adverse to their country 's interests , and the part they had in that most iniquitous of modern transactions was taken rather from fear than from ambition . They could not prevent a robbery , and so they aided in it , and shared in the spoil . But the revolutionary storm came , and broke up the old European system . Passional politics took the place of diplomacy , and party-spirit usurped that of patriotism . It was the age of the Reformation repeated , and men could hail the defeats of their own country with joy , because their country and their party were on opposite sides in the grand struggle which opinions were making for supremacy . In that storm Spain broke down , hut not until she had exhibited considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ally of France . Her navy was honorably distinguished , though unfortunate , at St. Vincent and Trafalgar , and elsewhere , showing that Spanish valor was not extinct . Napoleon I. , unequal to bearing well the good-fortune that had been made complete at Tilsit , and maddened by the success of England in her piratical attack on Denmark , resolved to add Spain to his empire , virtually , if not in terms . He was not content with having her as one of his most useful and submissive dependencies , whose resources were at his command as thoroughly as were those of Belgium and Lombardy , but must needs insist upon having her throne at his disposal . Human folly never perpetrated a grosser blunder than this , and he established that " Spanish ulcer " which undermined the strength of the most magnificent empire that the world had seen for ten centuries ; for , if his empire was in some respects inferior to that of Philip II. , in others it was superior to the Castilian dominion . Out of his action in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Spain of our age what the Succession War had been to the Spain of a century earlier . That country was prepared by it for another revival , which came at last , but which also came slowly . Had Ferdinand VII . been a wise and truthful man , or had there been Spanish statesmen capable of governing both monarch and monarchy , the days of Alberoni would have been repeated before 1820 . But there was neither an honest monarch nor a great statesman in the kingdom , and Spain daily became weaker and more contemptible . Her colonial empire disappeared , with a few exceptions , such as Cuba and the Philippines . The sun ceased to shine constantly on that empire which had been warmed by his beams through three centuries , and transferred that honor to England . Spanish politics became the world 's scorn ; and a French army , acting as the police of the Holy Alliance , crossed the Pyrenees , and made Ferdinand VII . once more an absolute king . After his death , a civil war raged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties which took their names from the Queen-Mother and from Don Carlos , who claimed to be the legitimate King of the Spains . At length that war was brought to an end , and the throne of Isabella II . appears to be as well established as was that of Isabella I. During all those unhappy years , Spain had , to use the common phrase , been making progress . Foreign war and civil war , and political convulsions of every kind , had been eminently useful to her . The Arachne webs and dust of ages had been blown away by the cannon of France and England . Old ideas were exploded . Young Spain had displaced Old Spain . A generation had grown up who had no sympathy with the antique world . In spite of repeated invasions , and almost unbroken bad government , and colonial losses such as no other country ever had experienced , the material power of Spain had vastly advanced between 1808 and 1850 . Since 1850 the Spaniards have been a prosperous people , and every year has seen their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission into the list of the Great Powers of Europe . They have formed a numerous army , and a navy that is more than respectable . They are constructing railways , and encouraging business in all its forms . The public revenue is equal to about ninety millions of our money , which would liberally provide for every expenditure that the Government ought to make , but which can not meet the wants of that Government , because the Spanish statesmen of 1862 are as unwise as were any of their predecessors , most of whom treated the dollar as if it contained twelve dimes . " To spend half a crown out of sixpence a day " requires the possession of as much ingenuity as would , if rationally employed , serve to convert the sixpence into a crown ; but Spain rarely permits common sense to govern her action , and prefers debt to prosperity , when she can fairly make her choice between the two . As to her public morality , a very little observation proves that she is not an iota more merciful or consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the very time when she is engaged in making war on Mexico because of alleged wrongs received at the hands of that country , she refuses to pay her own debts , thus placing herself on the level of Mississippi , which can raise money to aid in warring against the Union , and yet will not liquidate its bonds , which are held by the English allies of American rebels . This does not promise much for the future of Spain , and she may find her armies brought to a stand in Mexico from the want of money ; and thus will be repeated the blunder of the sixteenth century , when the victories of the Spaniards in the Low Countries were made fruitless because their sovereign was unable to pay his soldiers , and so they became mutineers at the very time when it was most requisite that their loyalty should be perfect , in order that the Castilian ascendency might be entirely restored . Spain walks in a circle , and she repeats the follies of her past with a pertinacity that would seem // 361 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has learned nothing . This third revival of Spain has been attended with a liberal exhibition of the same follies which we know it was her custom to display after preceding revivals . Instead of attending to her internal affairs , which demanded all her attention and the use of all her means , she has plunged into the great sea of foreign politics , with the view , it should seem , of being admitted formally into the list of leading European Powers . That she should desire a first place is by no means discreditable to her ; but her manner of seeking it is to the last degree childish , and unworthy of a country that has had so much experience . That place which she seeks can never long be denied to any European nation which is really strong , and modern strength does not consist merely in great fleets and armies , to be employed in attacking the weak , and in promoting a system of intervention in the affairs of foreign countries . Snch , however , is not the opinion of Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . No sooner did Spain begin to feel her strength , than she determined to make other countries feel it , in a very disagreeable fashion . She directed her attention to Italy , and nothing but a salutary dread of Napoleon III . prevented her from becoming the champion of all the tyrants and abuses of that country . It was at one time supposed that she meant to revive her pretensions to territorial rule in the Italian Peninsula , and to contend for the restoration of the state of things which there ended with the ending of the Austro-Burgundian rule of the Spanish Empire in 1700 ; and though it would have been preposterous to have thought such pretensions possible in the case of any other country , as preposterous as it would be to suppose England capable of thinking of the restoration of her power over the United States , - yet it was perfectly reasonable to believe that Spain would revive claims that were barred by the lapse of one hundred and fifty years . No statute of limitations is known to her , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any day through all time . Weakness may prevent her from enforcing her title , but that title never becomes weak . What is ridiculous in the eyes of the statesmen of Paris and London is eminently commonplace in those of the statesmen of Madrid , who are the most industrious of builders , Chdteaux en Espagne employing their energies . Although it is more than two centuries since Portugal threw off the Spanish yoke , they have never yet given up the hope in Spain of adding that spirited little kingdom to the Peninsular monarchy . They would absorb it , as so many other kingdoms have been absorbed by the power that has issued its decrees from Madrid and Valladolid . The attack made by Spain on Morocco was a silly affair , and was resolved upon only to convince the world that Spain could make war abroad , a point in which the world felt but small interest , as at that time it was not thought that the Spaniards would seriously endeavor to regain their old American possessions . That what had been lost through one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of errors , it entered not the minds of men to conceive . They would as soon have thought of Spain making a demand on Holland , with the view of restoring in that country the rule that was lost there in the days of Alva and Parma , as of her entering upon a war for a second conquest of Mexico . Nor would they have been astonished by the breaking out of such a war , had it not been for the breaking down of the American Republic . America 's calamity was Spain 's opportunity . She had been successful in her crusade against the modern Moors , because bad government had unfitted those Mussulmans to make effectual resistance to her well-led and well-appointed armies , which were supported by well-equipped ships . Then , flushed with victory , and beholding America in convulsions , she resolved to direct her energies against Mexico , where , unfortunately , bad government had done its work even more perfectly than it had been done in Morocco . // The Spaniards are a brave and a spirited people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not he cited as evidence of their bravery and spirit . They never would have dared to move against the Mexicans , if our condition had remained what it was but eighteen months ago ; and yet they had just as good cause to assail them in the summer of 1860 as they now have in the winter of 1862 . All the grounds of complaint that they have against Mexico were in existence then , - hut we heard of no modern Spanish Armada at that time , and might then as rationally have expected to see a French fleet in the St. Lawrence as a Spanish fleet in the Mexican Gulf . The American sword was then sharp , and the American shield broad , and so Spain stayed her chivalrous hand . Her conduct is as bad as was our own , when we " picked a quarrel " with Mexico , and bestowed upon her weak back the blows we should have visited on the stout shoulders of England . Our Mexican contest was the effect of our fear of a stronger adversary . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was difficult to avoid war with Great Britain . The West had been cheated by the cry for " the whole of Oregon , " and the men who had got up that cry were afraid to face the people whom they had deceived by the light of common day ; and so we had the Mexican War improvised , to distract public attention from the lame and impotent manner in which we had settled the Oregon question . Having kissed the Briton 's boot , it became necessary to soothe our exasperated feelings by applying our own boot to the person of the Aztec . The man having been too much for us , we were bound to give the boy a sound beating , and that beating he received . True , we had cause of quarrel with Mexico , which we had long overlooked , and which had seldom moved us to anger , and never to the point of falling foul , until we had become excessively angry both with the English and ourselves ; and equally true is it that Spain has some reason to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has become strong again , - but , imitating our prudence , she has chosen her own time for calling Mexico to account . All chivalrous nations are partial to this form of shabbiness ; and though we are told that honor is the distinction of a monarchy , we see that under the Spanish monarchy its requirements can be dispensed with when a gain can be secured by walking in the path of dishonor . But though the policy of Spain is base toward Mexico , it has the merit of being perfectly intelligible , which is generally the case with things of the kind . Much fault has been found with Spain by our Unionists because she has exhibited some partiality for the Secessionists , and apparently is ready to go as far as England means to go in helping them to the full enjoyment of independence and national life . It has been pointed out , that it was the South , not the North , which favored the " acquisition " of Cuba by force , fraud , or falsehood , according to circumstances ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba must be ours , were Democrats , not Republicans ; and that the buccaneers who used to fit out expeditions for the redemption of the " faithful " island from Spanish rule were Southrons , while other Sonthrons refused to convict those buccaneers who were tried at New Orleans , and elsewhere in Secessia , of being guilty of crimes against the laws of America and of nations . And it is asked , with looks of wonder , " How can Spain be so blind to her interests , and so regardless of insults that ordinarily disturb even the mildest of nations , as to sympathize with and aid her enemies , men who , if successful in their present purpose , would be sure to attack Cuba , to help themselves to Mexi ' co , and to become masters of all the Spanish - American countries on this continent ? " Pertinent to the matter as this question is , Spain has an answer to give that would be very much to the point . " True , " she might say , " it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Federal Government that was domi // nated by Southrons that used to insult us semiannually by insisting that we should part with Cuba , though we should as soon have thought of selling Cadiz . But it was the American Government , which spoke in the name of the whole American nation , that made the demand for Cuba , and which protected the pirates . Had you made war on us to obtain possession of Cuba , as you would have done but for the occurrence of your civil troubles , that war would have been waged by the United States , and not by the South and by the Democratic party . It would have been the work of you all , of Republicans as well as Democrats , of Yankees as well as Southrons , of Abolitionists as well as Slaveholders . There would have come soldiers from your Southern States , to tear from the Spanish monarchy its most valuable foreign possession ; but whence would have come the men who would have manned your fleets , that would have acted with your armies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest possible ? They would have been Northern men , New-Englanders and New-Yorkers , perhaps descendants of some of the very men who helped to conquer a portion of the island a century ago . It was American strength that we feared , not the strength of the North or that of the South , for neither of which do we care . Who would have furnished the capital to pay the expenses of the war ? Who but the rich men of the North ? Money is the sinew of all war , foreign and civil , and not a little of that Northern capital which we have seen so lavishly poured out in aid of the Union would have been subscribed in aid of a project to bring the curse of disunion upon our country . You know this to be the fact , and we challenge you as truthful men to deny it , that for many years it has been a favorite idea with some of your statesmen , and not of leaders of the Democratic party only , to stave o* the troubles that were rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a distraction ' based on the acquisition of Cuba . You know , or ought to know , that the very man who is now at the head of the Southern Confederacy was advised , at the North , in 1853 , to pursue such a course with regard to Cuba , he being then the most influential member of the Pierce administration , as should distract ' American attention from slavery as a local matter ; and that he thought this Northern advice good , and would have given the administration 's support to the project it involved , and probably with success , and to our great loss and disgrace , when a new turn was given to your strange politics by the movement in behalf of the repeal of the Missouri compromise , a movement that has brought safety to us , and loss and disgrace upon yourselves . We admit that your cause is the cause of law , of order , and of constitutional freedom ; but why should we desire the triumph of the cause of law , of order , and of constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but preliminary to a triumph over our own country ? Had your internal peace been continued for ten years longer , your free population would . have reached to forty millions , and your wealth would have grown at a greater rate than your population . You would have been able to give law to America , and you would , under one plausible pretext or another , have taken possession of all the European colonies of the Occident . Nothing short of a European alliance could have prevented your becoming supreme from the region of eternal snows to the regions of eternal bloom ; and such an alliance it would have been difficult to form , as there are nations in Europe that would have been as ready to back you in your day of strength as they are now both ready and anxious to back your enemy in this your hour of weakness . In plain words , it is for our interest that you should fall ; and as your fall can be best promoted through the success of the Secessionists , therefore do we give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to establish their national freedom on the basis of everlasting slavery . Why should we not sym // pathize with them , and even aid , at an early day , in raising the blockade of their ports ? Are they not doing our work ? As to their seizure of Spanish-American countries , it would be long before they could attempt an extension of their dominion ; and by restablishing our rule over Mexico we shall be in condition to bridle them for fifty years to come , even if they should remain united . But it is not at all probable that they would continue united . What Mexico has been , that the Southern Confederacy would be . The revolutions , the pronunciamientos , the murders , and the robberies which it is our intention to banish from Mexico , would take up their abode in the Southern Confederacy , in which Secession would do its perfect work . Such things are the natural fruits of the Secession tree , which is as poisonous as the upas and as productive as the palm . You we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , Europe would never again permit you to endanger the integrity of the possessions of any of her countries in the West . " Such might be the language of Spain in reply to the remonstrances of our Unionists , and although it embodies nothing but the intensest selfishness , it would not be the worse diplomatic expression on that account . When was diplomacy otherwise than sordid in its nature ? When was it the custom with nations to " spare the humble and subdue the proud " ? Never . The Romans said that such was their practice , but every page of their bloody history gives the lie to the poetical boast . It is the humble who are subdued , and the proud who are spared . Good Sainaritans are rare characters among men , but who ever heard of a Good Samaritan among nations ? The custom of nations is far worse than was the conduct of those persons who would not relieve the man who had fallen among thieves . They simply abstained from doing good , while nations unite their powers to annoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable , an understanding existing between France , England , and Spain to aid the Southern Confederacy at an early day , and when we shall have become sufficiently reduced to admit of their giving such aid without hazard to themselves , they being little inclined to engage in hazardous wars . In one respect the reconquest of Mexico by Spain would prove beneficial to us . If the Southern Confederacy should be established through the action of foreign powers , it would be for our interest that Mexico should have a strong government ruling over a united people . If the anarchical condition of Mexico should be continued , that country would afford a fine field for the energy and enterprise of all the lawless spirits of the South , who could be precipitated upon it to the great gain of their countrymen ; and England , in pursuance of her great Christian principle of creating markets for cotton and cottons , would encourage the Confederates to enter Mexico . But if Mexico should be converted into an orderly country , and have an army capable of treating buccaneers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no place for the discharged soldiers of Davis and Stephens . They would have to stay at home , and they would make of that home a hell . The welfare of the North would be promoted by the misery of the Sonthrons , who ought to be made to pay the full penalty of their extraordinary crime . Without provocation , and making of that want of provocation an absolute boast , they have brought war upon their country , and are endeavoring to spread its flames over the world . The misery they have wrought is incalculable , and no narrative of it , let it be as minute and as detailed as it could be made , will ever furnish a full picture of it . It would be but the merest justice , that men who make war in the spirit of wantonness be compelled to drink off the red cup they have filled , to the very lees . Such would probably be their doom , should they prevail . The least successful thing to them would be success . It is not certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lasting in its nature ; and if Spain should fall as // suddenly as she has risen , the way to Mexico would be open to the Soutlirons , who might then and there add so tremendously to the dominions of King Cotton as to make him even more powerful than ever he has been in the imagination of his votaries , - and they have ranked him only one step below the DeviL Spanish revivals are so much like certain other revivals , that they are apt to be followed by reaction , leaving the unduly excited subject in a worse condition than ever . European affairs , too , may demand Spain 's attention , and require her to leave Mexsco to take care of herself . Europe is full of causes of war , occasion for waging which must soon arise . The American war has tended to the promotion of peace in Europe , but that can not be much longer maintained . Let war break out in Europe , and Spain would probably feel herself called upon to assume a principal part in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread slavery over the finest cotton country on earth , under the patronage of England , which hates slavery , but worships its results . The future of Mexico it lies in the power of the American Union to decide , and our armies are contending as much for Mexican freedom as they are for American nationality .
