ARTICLE IV. - REVIEW OF DR . BUSHNELL ON " THE VICARIOUS SACRIFICE . " The Vicarious Sacrifice , grounded in Principles of Universal Obligation . By HORACE BUSHNELL . New York : Charles Scribner &amp; Co. , 124 Grand street . 1866. 8vo. pp. 552 . WE may safely assume that this volume will be very generally read . Many will peruse it from curiosity to learn what is the last word from Dr. Bushnell in respect to one of the most important doctrines of the Christian systetn-remembering that his former utterances upon this subject have been seriously called in question . Many others who have been interested in his sermons , and in his " Nature and the Supernatural , " will expect to find genius , eloquence , and Christian feeling largely present in a treatise upon so inspiring a theme as Christ 's redeeming work . Very many more will be attracted to it , because they are dissatisfied with the theories of the atonement which are currently received , and are earnestly looking for some explanation which shall be more satisfactory to their reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures . Not a few of the younger theologians , preachers , and laymen may accept the volume as expre*sing in many of its positions the conclusions which they have already received , and therefore welcome the authority of Dr. Bushnell 's name and the force of his reasonings , as most important auxiliaries in the service of what they conceive to be a better theology . We say this most distinctly at the outset of our discussion , because it ought neither to be disguised nor concealed , that the chief opinions expressed in this volume are neither original with nor peculiar to Dr. Bushnell . His modes of presenting and defending them are sufficiently his own ; but in the doctrines which he teaches , he is a representative and follower of a very extensive school of thinkers , whose influence is great and steadily increasing in every part of // Protestant Christendom . Schleierrnacher urged these views in Germany with his remarkable gifts of subtle analysis and doquent exposition . Many theologians of the school of Schleiermacher , even of that branch of it which adheres most closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt very nearly the same expositions of the import of the life and death of Christ which Dr. Bushnell has propounded . In England , Coleridge , in his doctrine of the Redemptive work , did , as is well known , attack all the previously received theories of the atonement with arguments like those which Dr. Bushnell employs , while Maurice and the divines of his school not only follow Coleridge in their negative positions , but follow Schleiermacher , and agree with Dr. Bushnell in their positive expositions of the import of " the vicarious sacrifice . " Not only have these views been largely received by the Church of England , but they have been accepted with favor among the Congregationalists of that country . If we are not incorrectly informed , even the Presbyterian Churches of Scotland , in all of which it would be a capital offense to confess in form the doctrine of unlimited or universal atonement , are by no means unaffected by the theories of the school of Maurice . The oaken framework of the Scottish theology to the eye stands entire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber and brace is as stiff and unyielding as ever , but the dry rot of this new theory of the work of Christ has insinuated itself into many ot the timbers , and loosened not a few of the joints . Dr. Bushnell , perhaps , stands in this country foremost as the representative of this theory of Christ 's redemptive work , which has become somewhat formidable in its claims aud / influence . Though he is not prone to confess himself to be the representative of any opinions but those which he deems peculiarly his own , he does , in his preface , recognize a tendency in the church toward a " final doctrine of the subject , " of which " the grand ruling conception finally established will be that Christ , by his suffering , life , and ministry , becomes a reconciling power in character , the power of God unto salvation . " We do not inquire at present into the causes of this tendency of opinion . We shall not affirm whether it is to be ascribed to // a lower r*ligious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading ' to habits of reasoning and interpretations less rigorous and less exact than once prevailed ; or on the other hand , whether it is a sign of a deeper insight into the true import of the Scriptures , which is the result of better methods of interpretation . We shall not inquire how far these views result from yielding unwarrantably to the suggestions of the imagination , or how far they are to be explained by a violent reaction against the extravagant and untenable theories of the older orthodoxy . We notice this tendency as a fact , which fact is a reason for attaching greater importance to the views of Dr. Bushnell , than they would demand if they were regared as the idiosyncrasies of a single individual , however ably and eloquently they might be asserted . In examining the volume , we do not propose to give an analysis of its contents , or to follow out its course of argument and assertions by a critical commentary for approval or refutation . To do the first is needless , for we may assume that those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the volume . To do the second is impossible , for it would require a volume as large or larger than Dr. Bushnell 's to do justice to all the themes which would demand our attention . We propose to consider in order a few of the strong and a few of the weak points in this volume . Under the strong points , we include those features in which it has any advantage over other treatises upon its theme , whether this advantage comes from a better method of treatment or from sounder views of the truth . Under the weak points , we shall consider its positive oversights and errors . We hope to write in no spirit of captious criticism , or of special devotion to the interests of any of the received theological systems . It is almost needless to say that we shall not be tempted to avail ourselves of the cheap expedients of religions partisanship , to denounce and decry the friend whom we admire and esteem , and the writer who has done good service for Christ and the church by his eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to some extent the real excellencies of this volume , are the following : // 1 . The book is remarkably free from the technicalities of theology . The arguments and illustrations are brought within the reach of men untrained in the dialect and unused to the distinctions of theological schools . it is an element of power with Dr. Bushnell that he uses the language , arguments , and illustrations , which are addressed to thinking and cultivated men of all conditions in life , and which suppose no special initiation into scholastic terminology . His discussions are not the less subtle or profound for this reason . But they are incomparably more fresh and forcible , and are more easily followed by all classes of readers . They are much broader also , bringing into view the relations of the principles and truths involved , to the principles that are recognized in the actual world of living and breathing men , and which are responded to by the convictions , and the conscience of every human soul . Hence , his theological discussions when subtle and over-refined are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still so illustrated and enforced that the mind is stimulated to new trains of thought , and some valuable truth is suggested if none is directly taught . The boldness of his thinking imparts an energy and directness to his style . The independence , and even the audacity of his positions , require a corresponding daring in his arguments arid illustrations . Views so fresh and original as his , can only be fitly expressed in a fresh and glowing style . It is not merely that Dr. Bushnell is a writer of genius and power , and must therefore write with interest even when he treats of theological themes , but it is true that he has a genius for writing on such subjects , in such a way as to bring them within the range of the common thinking of cultivated men , and to awaken a profound moral and religious interest in the truths which he discusses . He never separates these principles from their direct and practical application to the feelings and the life . In his hands they are never dead dogmas or lifeless abstractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are always living truths , which require and evoke a warm response from every soul . These peculiarities certainly give to the volume a great advantage over theological treatises as they are commonly written . // They are fitted to secure for his doctrine a favorable hearing . They must be regarded also as real excellencies . In times like these , and in a country like ours , where the readers of theological treatises read so much besides , upon common and even profound themes , which is written in a familiar and untechnical style , when even the students of theology read so much of his . tory , philosophy , and literature , it seems to be a necessity that even theological discussions should , as far as possible , be free from everything like a stereotyped or traditional diction , and should be enlivened by manly thinking and the diction which is common to all literature . It would react advantageously upon theologians them selves* if they were compelled to couch old arguments in new *orins of speech , and to defend and illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modern thinking . Perhaps the charm of some old dogmas would vanish with the slight changes that would be thus effected in the phraseology in which they are expressed . Perhaps old errors would more naturally and easily be sloughed off from the 6ternal truths , by the very process of translating them into a new dialect , and the minds of those who are set for the defense of the truth would be enlarged to a wider toleration and softened to a diviner charity . Certainly the hearers of so-called " doctrinal " sermons would be surprised to find that the preaching of Christian doctrine had become the most interesting of all kinds of preaching , and the readers of theological treatises would learn that theology itself is the divinest and the most inspiring of all the sciences . We do not by any means commend all the peculiarities of Dr. Bushnell 's thinking or writing . He is least of all to be set up as a model to be blindly copied . But his freshness and freedom of thinking and writing , and the warm and practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are to be counted to his praise , even when they serve to give currency to serious defects or errors of opinion . 2 . Dr. Bushnell has gained another advantage for the impression of his book , in the circumstance that he aims to treat of the whole of Christ 's redemptive work , and actually gives prominence to many aspects of it which are often overlooked . // As sin involves many evils , the work of Redemption involves as many forms of deliverance , and Christ , by his life and death , accomplishes and completes them all . " Thou shall call his name Jesus , for He shall shall save His people from their sins . " Whatever is the form of evil which sin has induced , Christ has for it a remedy , or rather He is Himself the remedy . Sin involves subjection to the human body , with its disabilities of obstruction , of animal pre ponderances , of disease , weakness , and painful death . Sin involves in the toils , the strifes , the disappointments , the vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance of a disturbed and corrupted moral constitution ; too often developed by voluntary indulgence into habits of moral life , which eat like a cancer into the very substance of our being , and grow with frightful rapidity and disproportion till they become the veriesL tyrants of the inner man . It takes possession of the intellect , perverts its action , turns the light within us into darkness , and makes reason itself an advocate , philosopher , and orator  --  a poet , preacher , and law-giver-in the service of evil , putting light for darkness and darkness for light . Sin entangles us in all the fearful liabilities of our social existence , and manages to bring fashion , opinion , and legislation upon the side of our corrupt wishes , and to make them weave for us a net-work of chains " light as silk , but strong as the toughest iron . " It uses the venerable and awful authority of religion in its service . It even creates new gods for itself , or exalts itself into the very place of the living Jehovah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the temple of God , showing himself that he is God . " The terrific power for the service of sin which has come from false religion , whether in the forms of the idolatries and priesthoods of Paganism , of the church power , the one-sided and corrupted theologies of Christianity , and of the Atheisms and Pantheisms of the so-called Religion of nature , it would not be easy to overestimate . Last of all , sin has exposed man to the deserved displeasure of the living God-under the consciousness of which as a present fact his soul is forever cowed and depressed , and in the apprehension of what may come of it , he is , " through fear of death , " all his " life time subject to bondage. " // From all these evils Christ redeems man , and he does it by the life which he lived , and the death which he suffered as the Incarnate One . It is as a Redeemer from all these forms of evil that he is set forth in the Scriptures-now in one aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in few , with a noble carelessness of precise definition or of careful proportion , as to which aspect of his work were the more important , such as was to be expected of writers who saw in Christ all they wanted , and could not imagine it possible that he should not relieve them from every real evil . Theology has by no means followed this method in its conceptions of the work of Christ . Throngh its anxiety to give due prominence to those aspects of it which it has thought most important , it has persistently left out of view all the rest , and sometimes it has seemed almost to deny their reality . Especially has it been tempted to do this , when the more important element in it has been denied or practically set aside . IRomish Theology , by means of penances and indulgences , and the service of the Virgin and the confessional and priestly absolution , greatly diminished the significance of the atoning work . Protestant Theology , ever since the Reformation , has almost forgotten that Christ has done anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's free pardon . Because the Socinians denied the reality of his Incarnation , and any special significance in his death , their opponents have been ready to deny any moral power in his human life , in its relations to the generation and epoch in which he lived , and have practically sunk out of sight many winning and consoling influences which flow from that life for all time . It has happened in consequence that the stress of orthodox Protestant preaching concerning Christ has been laid upon his atoning work . Though the Protestant confessions and catechisms have recognized the other aspects of his life and death , yet these have scarcely entered into the practical faith of the Church . They have but feebly affected the feelings and inspired the life of either preachers or disciples . Argument and controversy , exhortation and consolation , have been concerned almost exclusively with his death . The result has been not only that much of the power and interest which lie within the person of Christ has been lost to // the Church , but the most efficient means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been thereby abandoned , and the effect of that death has been the more feebly apprehended and believed . By a natural reaction , those who have been impressed with the importance and interest of those aspects of Christ 's work which bad been neglected or overlooked , have found in them the entire explanation of this work . They have seemed to themselves to have discovered such new revelations of truth , such meanings unheard of before in his personal influence , that they have imagined that in this was to be found the sole interpretation of his mission and his power . Schleiermacher finds in the person of Christ a new life-giving power for the race , because in him was first exemplified a spirit of self-sacrifice even unto death , in order that He might redeem and save . From his name and person , thus consecrated by his death , there streams forth into the life of the race influences that have forever hallowed self-sacrifice , self-denial , and forbearance on the part of God , and repentance and faith in that name on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , emphasizing and expanding all these aspects and influences of the vicarious sacrifice that was perpetually offered in the life and death of the Redeemer . Dr. Bushnell , with his vivid power to conceive , his rare eloquence to set forth , and above all his rarer sensibility to appreciate the moral beauty and the redeeming power that there is in Christ as a person , through his life and death of sacrificing love , so preoccupies and interests his readers with these less familiar conceptions of Christ 's work , that many are ready to go with him to the conclusion that they completel y exhaust and explain its itnport. 3 . Dr. Bushnell has secured to his volume and his doctrine another advantage , in the circumstance that in exhibiting the work of Christ , he has followed the order of its actual history and development . As he very properly essays to exhibit the whole work of Christ , so he wisely begins his exposition of this work at the beginning , and traces its unfolding to the end . He makes Christ to live before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much in the chronological and external facts which make up its history , as in the progress of the moral // impressions which it works out in a natural and necessary order . He makes his readers conceive the world of thought and feeling concerning God and duty , concerning go9dness and sin , concerning holiness and salvation , into which Christ enters . He helps them to trace the changes which his presence is silently and surely effecting till He leaves the world . He shows how these impressions are all gathered into one , and reproduced by the event of his significant death , and how both life and death are transfigured into a diviner meaning and irresistible energy by the power of his resurrection . In all this , he does well , and for the success with which lie has done this work he deserves all honor . The service is not only important in itself , but it is essential that we may fully understand Christ . That the Church should require , and that theology should follow this method of studying the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a neceesity . In order to understand its meaning , we must not only view all its relations in their symmetry and mutual helpfulness , but we must see them drawn out in the order of their development , one impression preparing the way for another , till the manifestation of God through Christ is felt to be complete , and the student of it is prepared to see what it was and how " it is finished . " We regret that Dr. Bushnell has not carried the history of this manifestation through Christ to its end , but has abruptly cut it short , and thus failed to do justice to the import of its concluding and sublimest passages . He skillfully unfolds the gradually increasing hold which Christ is gaining during his lifetime , the intenseness of interest which is gathered about his impending death  --  the majesty with which the self-sacrificing love which was illustrated in his humble life is exalted to its throne of power over the soul , when he ascends to the right hand of the Majesty on High ; but here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not terminate here ! - that the same being who was present so long in the body promised to return , and did return in a more effective way to the same circle who in his lifetime received direct impressions from his bodily presence ; that the Paraldetoc who was to come in his name was to revive all these impressions , and give them new energy , because he would interpret and en'large their // meaning . He was to guide them into all truth . He would not speak from himself ; but from Christ , and would impart and interpret some of the many things which Christ could not say in his lifetime , because they could not bear intelligence and lovingly receive them . But as soon as the Son of Man should be glorified by the attesting resurrection ' , then He could comiiiunicate and they could receive . What he did impart the succeeding history informs us . We say the succeeding history , for the expositions which the Apostles gave of the work of Christ in the fragments of speeches which the Acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are as properly parts of that history as are the impressions which came directly from his lips and his life , as recorded by the Evangelists . These new impressions were sanctioned by Christ , who instructed and enlarged their minds in a supernatural way as really and more effectually than when He spake and lived before them . This work was gradual and orderly as was the work of his life , but it was the work of Christ none the less . At first , the comprehensive burden of the discourses of the Apostles , as it was the fact of their faith , was the Messiahship of Jesus , as attested by his works and resurrection . But at this point we find , even in the first exposition of Christ 's work made by Peter , that the direction is to baptism-i.e. , to open confession of faith in the name of Jesus Christ , for the remission of sins In the next recorded speech it is said , " Unto you first God having raised up his Son Jesus sent him to bless you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the next , " Neither is their salvation in any other , for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved . " In the following , " him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour , for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins . " Soon after , " Be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins , arid by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses . " Then follow the fuller and more elaborate expositions of the import and relations of Christ 's work that are given in the Epistles of Paul , and that // are attested in the epistles of Peter and John , all of which are parts of one continued history , with the difference that in the earlier part of it we have Christ living and speaking on earth ; and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven , explaining as it were his life and death-now that they are finished , and the glory of the person who gave them power and meaning is fully displayed . We are well aware that Dr. Bushnell will not agree with us in the interpretation of the passages to which we have refi*rred . Which is the right interpretation , we will discuss in its proper place . The point with which we are at present concerned , is simply that Dr. Bushnell has not followed the history of Christ to its proper termination . He makes the history of the direct impressions from Christ to end with his resurrection . Henceforward , all the operative force of his life and death lay in the natural interpretation which his followers placed upon his glorification as the Son of God . He leaves out of sight the fact of another teacher , who spake in his name , and widened and deepened his influence . Without giving large importance to the functions and the power of that agent , the growth and spread of Christianity as an historical fact is inexplicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to understand and natural to believe , with the evidence for the fact before us , that Christ taught and explained a larger import concerning his work , than that which Dr. Bushnell finds recorded and implied in the history , as recorded in the Gospels alone . While we concede to Dr. Bushnell all the advantages of both impression and argument which come from following the historical method , we note his defect in not tracing this history to its proper termination . 4 . Dr. Bushnell has another advantage , in this , that his proper argument concerning the atoning work is not purely nor drily metaphysical . We mean by this much more than we have before expressed , respecting his freedom from a technical handling of his theme . The atoning work of Christ , or the doctrine of the atonement , as it is usually called , is ordinarily discussed and defended in the forms and language of pure science . It also suffers more than any other doctrine , in respect to the very material of the argument , from being so defended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious . From the Cur DeuR flonw of Anseim down to the last treatise of a modern divine , these discussions and defenses are uniformly made to turn upon the ground of the necessity that an atonement should be made . This ground is as uniformly found in some reason of justice , more or less generally conceived . This at once leads to the discussion of what justice is , what are its demands , on what condition it can waive its claims , how does Christ and his death satisfy or meet these demands . Questions of this sort , though moral and religious in their occasion and their application , are yet as technically scientific and metaphysical in their character , as are discussions of pure geometry and philosophy . So far as they are discussed in their logical relations they only task the intellect to unusual refinements and unwelcome efforts . The mind instead of being confronted with warming and comforting truths , encounters the thinnest and the most ghost-like abstractions , which flit before the vision and undergo the most embarrassing metamorphoses . It is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who are undisciplined to the efforts required to grasp them , are wearied and disgusted with the discussions , and perhaps with the truths to which they relate . The result has been that the defense of the most interesting and important of all the themes of Christian theology , has become associated with the driest and most repulsive of abstractions . The argument for the necessity and fact of an atonement has suffered in its material also from this cause . The best defense of both is to be found in the adequate conception and the vivid presentation of the real import of what Christ has actually done and suffered , drawn directly from the descriptions of the Gospel when interpreted by the repenting and believing souL The power of this work to atone lies in the direct impression which is made upon the heart by what the incarnate Son of God is known actually to do and suffer . As we shall endeavor to show in its place , when this is understood with all its accessories it explains and vindicates the atoning work . It shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this is appreciated in its import , then the abstract definitions take a concrete meaning and application , the distinctions between gen // eral and distributive justice , between 801utw and acceptilcttio become intelligible because they respect a concrete fact . These distinctions can not be dispensed with . These theological formulai are necessary if theology is to be a science . But formulae without something furnished to formulate are empty of meaning and interest . It is only when that something is set forth that the symbols of definition and reasoning have either import or interest . Dr. Bushnell sees this distinction dimly and states it badly when he says : " The view of Christ 's mission I have been trying to establish excludes the possibility , it will be seen , of any dogmatic formula in which it may be adequately stated . " And again , " The Scriptures themselves do not know how to make up any formula of three or four lines , that will express , in the manner of our theologians , the import of Christ 's reconciling work . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition . He is given neither by nor to , logical definition . He is no quantitative matter , like a credit set in a book , or a punishment graduated by satisfaction . His reality is what he expresses , under laws of expression , &amp;c. , &amp;c . " " Hence the necessary poverty and almost mockery of all attempts to put the work of Christ in formula or to dogmatize it in a proposition or church article , " pp. 213 , 14 . After this arid much more of the sort , he proceeds to try to formulate his power under four specifications ! But though Dr. Bushnell is not very consistent with himself , and , while he denounces theology and metaphysics to his hearfs content , proceeds to furnish some questionable specimens of both , he yet seeks to furnish something besides , viz , a definite and living portraiture of the work which he thinks Christ performed . In this lies much of the power of his book , for in this particular of method it compares advantageously with most treatises upon the atonement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he represents and appeals to a very prevailing disposition to distrust and decry all positive and objective Theological science and Theological truth . The advantage is not legitimate , but it is none the less real . It is founded as we believe in intellectual and moral causes which are very largely significant of weakness and evil . But the tendency exists , and its causes are powerful in their working . We name in passing some of them . The wrangling // of partisan theologians and of partisan preachers has disgusted not a few thinking people and weakened their estimate of Theology itself . The higher value which is placed upon the essential truths of Christianity has tended to depress the interest in those which are conceived to be subordinate , and in any further inquiries or discussions in respect to their true interpretation . The larger charity between the diverse sects and families of the household of Christ , has led to a diminished interest in the peculiarities of either , especiaJly in mere verbal differences in stating and defending the same essential truths and in the plainly human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against theology like these are all of a good complexion , and however much they might work to the disesteem of theological inquiry and discussion as superfluous , they could be easily guided to a better and more enlightened judgment . There are others which are more obstinate and insidious . For they tend not only to weaken the confidence of the church in the creeds and systems of theologians , but in the positive and definite import of the teachings of the Scriptures . They even go further . They tend to destroy confidence in the capacity of the human mind to conceive of God and the relations of his government with any positive results of thought or language . The general scepticism of Kant in respect to the competence of the human intellect to attain to solid knowledge , involved of necessity the impossibility of any theology , whether Natural or Revealed . His principles were sanctioned in part by Hamilton . They were distinctly taught by Mansel with the ostensible design of humbling rationalism and limiting human reason , but with the real effect of exalting church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more flattering substitute of blind and groping feeling for an intellectually conceiving and intelligently loving faith which Jacobi , Schleiermacher , Maurice , Robertson , and others have introduced to eke out the incompetence of the intellect , has only deepened and broadened the distrust of creeds and theology . It has led on the one side to a contemptuous depreciation of any and all creeds as feeble attempts to express the many sided and exhaustless infinite , and on the other to a demoralizing and latitudinarian readiness to assent to any // and every creed , which has debauched the conscience to a disingenuous use of the doctrine of reserve and of the lib*rty of private interpretation , because of the confessed inadequacy of all creeds and all theologies to set forth the Divine . This distrust of scientific theology Dr. Bushnell largely represents , and to its special prejudices andits capricious moods , he addresses his arguments , or rather this distrust or denial of the possibility of any scientific statements of Christian truth , furnishes him with many of his arguments . We can not here discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position of this kind , if it is good for any , should suffice for every service . What is good for attack is equally good to repel an attack , and it is no better for one side than another , whether it is used in assault or defense . When it is convenient for Dr. B. to assail a theology on the ground of inexactness of statement , inconsistency of thought , or insufliciency of proof , he does it without a scruple . When his own theology is assailed on similar grounds , he quietly says he does not believe in theology at all . As if scientific theology were anything but a more exact and consistent and thoroughly grounded thinking than that which is common and necessary to all men As if its terms , definitions , reconciliations , and proofs , were not all represented in common language and reasoning . As if Dr. Bushnell could state and define his own opinions about " the vicarious sacrifice " without theologizing . As if he does not constantly furnish specimens in this very discussion of formulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older schools have incorporated into creeds and systems . While we insist that Dr. Bushnell can not legitimately take advantage of the prevailing sceptical distrust of scientific theology , we can not deny that he gains thereby an advantage which is real for the more favorable judgment of his own views . 6 . Dr. Bushnell has an advantage in the successful onsets which he makes upon false and defective theories of the necessity and nature of the atoning work . Though Dr. Bushnell abjures theological reasoning , yet he exhibits no mean power in criticising the unsound theologies of others . In Part LII. , // Chap . vi. , he reviews the thr*ee theories which would naturally require his notice . He considers first , the theory that the penalty of sin is inflicted upon the Son to satisfy and vindicate the justice of God , which is commonly called the Old School view . He then discusses the singular modification of this theory which is urg*ed by Prof. Shedd , according to which the atonement satisfies the ethical sentiment of justice in God himself ; by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; the punisher being also the sufferer . The third theory is that which is known as the New England or the Edwardean theory , according to which , if we may trust the statement of Dr. Bushnell , there is in the death of Christ an expression of God 's abhorrence of sin equivalent to that which would have been expressed by the infliction of punishment upon the sinner . The first and second of these theories he notices briefly . They require and are capable of a brief answer-because that answer is simple ; if justice can be satisfied only by the infliction of punishment , then an atonement or expiation is impossible . Punishment to be punishment must be endured by the guilty . Evil inflicted upon any other than the guilty can not be penal . Whether it be voluntarily accepted or not makes not the least difference in this regard . Nor is it material whether the suP ferer be the second person of the Godhead on whose human nature the " *uni8*ment " is said to be inflicted , or whether it be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justice . There is not , and can not be , under either of these theories , either justice , or punishment , or expiation . The third of these theories detains him longer , as it reasonably should . He first states the theory inadequately and then by " a fetch of words " he manages apparently to dispose of it , and to seem to set it aside . His argument against this theory is built solely upon the single phrase which he employs to characterize it . He argues that to express " abhorrence of sin " is not the end of punishment , and if it were , how , he asks , can God 's abhorrence of sin be shown in the suffering death of Christ ? We do not admit his argument as decisive , but he starts the one question and urges the one objection which press upon that theory . How it is to be relieved from the pressure Un VOL XXV. 17 // der which it seems to labor , we will not now discuss . We con- , cede that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conce*ve* and descri1*e8 it , a real advantage in the argument . The apparently easy and satisfactory demolition of opposing theories always gives an advantagQ to any argument , and Dr. Bushnell has managed to secure to himself the impression that he has gained such an advantage . Thus far have we considered the strong points of the volume . We have discussed these at some length because we wish our readers to understand wherein lies the real merit and truth of the book , and also wherein they may find the plausible grounds for even its oversights and errors . We turn now to the consideration of some of these oversights and errors . 1 . IDr . Bushnell is , as we think , unsuccessful in the distinction which he makes between " necessary law " and " instituted government , " and the distinction correspondent to it between " righteousness " and " justice . " This distinction is essential to his entire theory of the relations of the work of Christ to the holiness and law of God . He relies upon this and the inferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the aims proposed by the theories usually received , and to give relief from all their difficulties . He draws it out at great length . The defense and application of it cover a quarter of his volume . It comprehends the philosophy which underlies his entire superstructure of doctrine . It is continually shooting up into every part of this structure ; reappearing perpetually in some new form of justification or defense . ' The occasion of it is no novelty iu the history of theories 01 atonement . The distinction was suggested by the same difficulties of theory which have compelled other theologians to resort to such distinctions as those between general and distributive justice , and between the authority of God and the sanctions of His law . It is none the less metaphysical t*an any of these . The adoption and defense of it show abundantly that the author is a " man of like passions " and infirmities with other men in respect to metaphysics and formuh* and systems , and that metaphysical reasoning comes to him as to other men , " by nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metaphysical daring than those which we commonly meet with , for it aspires to take the subject out of the " analogies of law and justice , and penalty and pardon , prepared in the civil state , " and to get " a partially distinct footing for the subject which is not under such analogies . " The ingenuity of this metaphysical scheme is admirable . It proves not only that the author will occasionally indulge in the metaphysical vein , but that he is a dialectician of no mean art and skill , in that he lays his foundations deep down and far away from their immediate application , and forecasts the use which he will make of them with subtle sagacity . Or at least it shows how he was pressed by the desire to sustain his concrete theory , to find for it a consistent and coherent scheme of philosophy . The theory briefly stated is as follows . A distinction should be made " between law before government , and law by government ; uninstituted , necessary law , and law enacted and supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that necessary , everlasting , ideal law of RIGHT , which simply to think is to be rorever obliged by it . " The conformity of God 's purposes and actions to this law constitutes his rigltteou8ne88 . As soon as this " impersonal law " is insufficient for any reason , and God steps forth from this plane of action to enforce it by " personal authority or will-force embarked , " then commences " instituted government " upon the plane or in the sphere of which the relations of ju8tice , as distinguished from righteousness , become possible . Under the first the consequence of sin is only subjective " moral disorder . " Under the second only can come retribution and penalty . Instituted government with its liabilities to penalty only begins when sin against righteousness has actually commenced ; instited government is therefore only a means to and a part of redemption . Before redemption is begun the obligations are to righteousness only , and the results of sin involve moral disorder , but no penalty . There is no need of atonement to lay the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no instituted law , and where there is no law there is no transgression and no penalty . The question of the need of atonement as a ground for justification can not possibly // come up , for such questions can only present themselves with- ' in the sphere of " instituted government , " which exists only in the service and for the use of redemption , under which penalty is only " a milling and grinding " process for simple recovery . It can not be raised within the sphere of " law before government , " for in that sphere there is no penalty conceivable from which we are to be delivered , but only moral disorder from which we are to be recovered . Neither expiation nor satisfaction are conceivable , because there is no occasion for either . The righteousness of God as distinguished from his justice does not require either . The justice of God can not demand either of his . righteousness , for his righteousness has ordained justice and made penalty possible by introducing law in order to redemption . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " legitimates " the following conceptions : 1 . That there might be a scheme of cross , and sacrifice , and restoring power , every way like that which is executed in christ , which tias nothing to do with justice proper : being related only to that quasi justice which is the blind effect , in moral natures , of a violation of their necessary law . 2 . That instituted law is no necessary precondition of redemption . 8 . That the righteousness of God is not by any means identical with his justice , but includes all the perfections of God in his relation to the law before gov. eminent , and never requires him to execute justice under political analogies , save as it first requires him to institute an administrative government in the same . 4 . That law and justice might be instituted as co-factors of redemption , having it for their object to simply work with redemption , and serve the same ends of spiritual renovation-if there was a prior fall , under the law before government they naturally would be . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's justice , and probably has not , but only to a reconnection , by faith , with the righteousness of God , and a consciously new confidence , in the sense of that connection . pp. 247-8 . We have given this theory at greater length than we intended , that we might be entirely just to the author , and because it is fundamental to the construction and defense of every argument and interpretation which he urges . That which gives plausibility to it in the general is the impression which rests upon almost every mind , that analogies from political governments are inadequate to express and illustrate the whole truth in respect to the necessity of an atoning efficacy in the work of Christ . All men readily feel with Coleridge // that no analogies from the coarse and imperfect workhigs of human law-courts can adequately explain the whole of Christ 's redemptive work . They earnestly search after some deeper and more purely ethical truth beneath this artificial structure of which human government is but an inadequate analogon . This feeling has been intensified by the infelicitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drawing out and illustrating from the relations of human rule and authority in minute detail , thus belittling the whole subject by bringing in many particulars which it is felt have no possible relation to the trutl* to be illustrated . While the theory that Christ literally suffered a penalty or literally payed a debt simply offends the conscience , the " governmental theory , " as it is barbarously termed , fails to meet the taste and sense of fitness by the inadequacy of its analogies . Hence it is in many minds regarded with the prejudices of mere association contracted from the unhappy manner in which it has been illustrated . The attempt of Dr. Bushnell to rise above or see through these analogies and reach the principle on which they rest , would naturally be greeted with favor by many and would prepossess them kindly toward the principle for which he contends . Another circumstance works strongly in Dr. Bushnell 's fa- ' vor . The New Testament , when it treats of the law of Moses as an " instituted government , " expressly asserts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption . It was the " schoolmaster to bring us to Christ . " It says of it also that it was " added because of transgression . " It also asserts that simple command , i. e. , what the author calls " will force embarked " excites hostility in the heart determined to disobey , and is fitted to provoke both resistance and despair . With the law as operating to such effects , the grace of the Gospel and its recovering and forbearing love are contrasted as introducing motives nobler in their character and more genial in their operation . It has become the fashion of late for evangelical interpreters of the modern school to find in the New Testament no higher conception of law than that of a positive and " instituted government " like the Mosaic system . They have also fallen into the habit of speaking of the motives and influences which come from law of every kind as essentially inferior to // tho*e from love , and as made necessary by the circumstance that man by the apostasy had fallen below the plane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractions . We think these interpretations in its aspect than love , are superficial and erroneous . We believe that what Dr. Bushnell calls law eternal and necessary , as illustrated through the Mosaic law , is often the real theme of the apostolic reasoning , when the two are not formally distinguished . Moreover , we believe that when Paul speaks of law in the higher sense he never concedes that its authority is less reasonable and its motives less ethical , than are the influence and attractions of the Gospel . If Dr. Bushnell has turned the interpretations , which are sanctioned by so high authority , to the service of his own metaphysical theory , we can not be surprised . Perhaps the use to which he has applied them will induce a revision of these interpretations and conceptions . We return to the distinction itself-between " impersonal law " and law by command and will-force . The author observes that the distinction may be only ideal , so far as the order of time and of fact is concerned . The precedence of law over government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is really no real precedence in time , but only a precedence of rational order . Instituted government is to all created subjects of God as old as ideal principle , and they never had a moment under this , befoi'e coming under the other . " We accept this concession of the author , only observing in passing that it must inevitably follow that all created subjects of God must be sinners from the first , if as soon as they exist they find themselves under that " instituted government " which is of use only to redeem . But leaving this thought , we assert that this ideal distinction upon which everything depends is not correctly taken , and utterly fails to warrant the difference made between the righteousness and justice of God , and the relations of either to penalty and a required expiation . The ideal distinction we think is not correctly taken , for the following reasons . Right can not in the mind of either Creator or creature be a purely impersonal relation . In its // very nature it involves a conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imposing law . In the ideal state , before government is conceived to be instituted , even when there are no created subjects , there is still government and law , and possible penalty in every essential feature . We agree with the author that there is a " necessary , everlasting , ideal law of right which simply to think is to be forever obliged by it . " But the question at once arises , What is it to be obliged ? What are the elements and what the process ? We answer , to be obliged , there must be an obliging person . In case that person be sole and single , the person obliges himself , imposes upon himself as a law the eternal relation which his mind perceives in his very constitution , and to the excellence of which he assents . We will not dispute the assertion of the author that moral distinctions are like those of space and time , and number and quantity . We are forward to add , as he does , that " it is the distinction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch principle of the soul . It puts all moral natures under an immediate indefeasible bond of sovereignty . " But we add what seems to have escaped his notice , viz , that it can do this only as every moral person becomes a lawgiver to himself ; imposing the idea upon himself as a law and holding himself to reward and penalty as the sure retribution . There can not , even ideally conceived , be law before government . the moral law involves government , the self-government of the being who discerns it , whether he be God or man . Hooker well observes , first concerning the source of the moral relation , " The Being of God is a kind of law to his working for that perfection which God is , giveth perfection to that which He doth ; " and again , " That law eternal which God Himself hath made to Himself , and thereby worketh all things whereof He is the cause and author . " " Nor is the freedom of the will of God any whit abated , let , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this law upon Himself is His own free and voluntary act . This law therefore we may narpe eternal , being that order which God before all ages hath set down with Himself , for Himself to do all things by . " In respect to created beings in that ideal state in which no " instituted government " is recognized , the Apostle declares , " these having not // the law are a law unto themselves . " Nor is this a mere fiction of speech ; the government of a moral being over himself is the most effective of all governments , its law is the most potent of all laws , its sanctions are the most binding of all sanctions , its self-assigned rewards are the most winning , its selfinflicted punishments are the most terrible . By the same necessity and the same authority by which God reigns over Himself He will reign over others . He will not wait for sin to occur before He " institutes " government . As soon as moral beings begin to exist and are known to be existent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , " is there anything that God will certainly undertake ? His infinite righteousness contains the answer ; for by that lie is everlastingly fastened in profoundest homage to the law , and almost as certainly to fhe well being of all moral natures related with Himself to the law . He will therefore regard Himself elected by His own transcendent powers of will and working to assume the charge of a Ruler and will institute government " - no , not institute a government in Dr. B 's sense , but He begins to govern others by reenacting the law which they have imposed on themselves as the law which He imposes on them . This influence is not , be it observed , different in kind , only in degree , from that influence which He has used with Himself , and they with themselves . As He reigns over Himself by His sensibility to His own approbation or the reverse , so He reigns over others by their sensibility to the approbation of another being than themselves , ruling in all cases in the interest of moral rectitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The denial to God of this personal authority over others till sin requires its interposition , is a denial of God 's essential rights as a person . The supposition that if there were no sin there would be no personal authority or will-force embarked , is essentially mischievous in its principle . It tends to , nay it symbolizes most intimately with the atheistic or pantheistic direction of modern thought  --  the one comprehensive and damning evil of its denial to God , of the reality of personal existence , and of the lawful exercise and influence on the universe of his personal authority and his personal rights . We quote gladly from Dr. Bushnell himself , the following passage as looking in // the opposite direction : " We do not like in fact to call it a government , for that is not relational enough to meet our feeling , but we drop the institutional conception , taking up the personal and calling it King-God is King , that is government enough , and we prefer to let our mind be occupied wholly with his r*oyalties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for two objects-first , to attest that Dr. Bushnell would not consciously rob God of his kingly honor , and second , that in the name of those words of his we may ask his theory by what authority of reason or Scripture it refuses to accept God in this relation of governing King , in the ideal state of law before government and before sin . Is not God always a governing king ? - with personal authority , with venerable law , by the very fact that He is naturally great *and morally good , that is , by the glory by which He is the Living God ? We re*ject this fundarnenal theory of Dr. Bushnell , as factitious in its inception , as superficial in its philosophy , as demoralizing in its operation , and as pantheistic in its affinities . But if the theory is untenable with the fundamental distinctions which it involves between law and government , between righteousness and justice , then the " conceptions legitimated by them , " with respect to the cross and the work of Christ , must fail aIs*. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty is fatally defective . We ought rather to say he does not accept any conception of punishment at all as either supposable or necessary . There is no room for punishment within the first condition of existence supposed by him , which is the sphere of impersonal and necessary right . He is logical enough to require none but to make the evil consequences of sin to be only " moral disorder . " Under the second-that is , within the sphere of instituted government " - there is evil in abundance . But as this evil is appointed for the ends of redemption from sin already incurred it can not be penalty . These evils are called , indeed , by the author collectively " retributive causations , " but the proper sense of retribntion is not assigned them . They are all set forth as designed to chasten , to humble , to disappoint , to " mill and grind " the soul till it is brought into a condition // of attention and openness to the more ethical and gracious , the more spiritual and softening appliances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he describes , as first declared and clearly threatenea by Christ , doesn ot exclude the distinctive element of penalty , while the whole drift of the illustrations of its possible nature and of the answers to objections that might be urged against it , wholly excludes the conception of penalty proper . We may say with truth , that there is only a single sentence here and there of this entire volume in which the proper conception of penalty is recognized as possible , or accepted as real . All the reasonings of the author , both direct and indirect , would seem to authorize the conclusion that he holds no such doctrine , and scarcely knows what the conception is , as it is held and applied by others . Penalty or punishment in the ethical sense of the word , as we understand it , is not physical evil alone , whether endured in the mind or the body of the sufferer . It is that peculiar pain which the soul suffers from the displeasure of a person for disobedience to his will . Any form of evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the evil becomes penalty only so far it conveys personal *ispleasure . If the will is right , the person displeased is morally perfect ; if the sufferer condemns himself and assents to the excellence of the will of the person displeased , and his own desert of the displeasure expressed , then punishment is endowed with moral quality and is applied as a moral force . Any amount of evil not connected with moral ill desert , and not designed to manifest the displeasure of a moral person , is not moral penalty . Evil designed to reclaim , however much it may suggest his displeasure , if it suggests or conveys it as a monition to repentance , is not retributive but reformatory . Penalty , as a moral force , is also a force of the greatest moral dignity . It is used by all beings who have any sense of personal power or of personal rights . All men respond to it as an influence which may be rightfully exercised over themselves . That God should employ what is the essential element of punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an axiom in theology . How far He may use it and for what ends , whether for // simple retribution in any case , or only for reformation , is a question that is fairly open to debate , but that this peculiar influence is one that is natural and legitimate ought not be an open question . That Dr. Bushnell has never recognized this truth except in the most incidental way , and has left out of his theories the commanding and distinctive element of punishment , is to us a matter of surprise . If he had given even a slight attention to that in punishmcnt which gives it dignity and moral force , he surely could not have represented the motives derived from God 's personal authority , and his expressed will , as appealing to the lower grade of sentiments , or as operating within the sphere of prudence and self-interest , and as therefore only secondary in rank and temporary in application . Certainly he would have made it appear more prominently as an element of the " retributive causatiQus " to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not have failed to recognize it as bearing some share at least in that combination of evils assigned to the rejectors of the Gospel , which so unwittingly for his theory , but so truly for the fact , he describes by " a form of words having such vindictive energy that there is nothing , as far as I know , in all human language to match it- ' the wrath of the Lamb . " ' The non-recognition or the suppression of this essential element is but another example of the affinities of Dr. Bushnell 's entire scheme with the pantheistic tendencies of modern thinking . Not only has God His rights as a person so far forth as to be entitled to rule His own universe by the force of law , but He is morally bound to exercise those rights in the use of His displeasure as a penal power . To deny this , or to fail to recognize this as an actual force in the moral universe , is to move in the direction away from the just recognition of God 's personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a person that the modern irreligionist objects , but it is to the use of His influence for moral ends in the way of interference and restraint that he feels most strongly opposed . To the necessity that God should be brought out from his infinitudes , and brought within human relations so as to be grasped by human thought , Dr. Bushnell has always responded , whenever he has insisted upon the incarnation as essential to an efficient theism. // He has strongly emphasized the necessity and power of the manifestations of God 's personal love , in order that He may move and sway our human feelings . He has declared that this love must be self-sacrificing in order that it may reach the sensibilities hardened by selfishness and sin . So far he moves in the right direction . But when he denies or ignores those acts which give moral energy to the personality of God-acts of law and penalty-he moves in the direction opposite . He goes further when he ignores their dignity and their moral elevation . He goes still further when he dishonors these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrades even the retributions which he acknowledges to meaningless inflictions of physical evil . In all these positions he sets himself strongly and surely towards the denial of the very relations through which God 's personality becomes effective . He moves towards the abrogation of the most sacred rights , the most imperative duties , the most awful prerogatives that can be conceived as belonging to the personal Jehovah . The theory of punishment adopted by any theologian must by a logical necessity determine his theory of atonement . The atonement is by its very nature an act which is designed to take the place of punishment . He who with IDr . Bushnell does not believe in the need of penalty as an expression of God 's displeasure , must deny that atonement is either possible or necessary . He who holds that the infliction of so much positive evil , whether infinite in quantity or quality , is a vindication of justice , no matter whether it falls on the guilty or not , can easily construct a theory of the atonement by providing some substitute who is capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive act by which Christ is counted a sinner in order that he may be punished as a sinner , imparts neither ill desert to the sufferer , nor penal significance to his suffering . Where , on such a theory , can be the ethical value , where the moral significance of either penalty or atonement ? The theorist who holds that " the emotion of anger against sin is constitutional to the Deity , " which " God himself placates by a personal self-sacrifice that inures to the benefit of the creature , " may call the emotion " ethical " and the propitiation a satisfaction of justice , but he does not thereby make the anger of God an eth // ical sentiment , nor the penalty a moral power , nor the atonement a satisfaction of any moral claim . It is singular that those who hold these theories , and are the loudest to talk about the necessity of vindicating justice , and of maintaining eternal principles , do in fact propound theories which have nothing ethical in their principles and which override the requirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offset against the deserved penalty , no matter whether it falls on the innocent or guilty , no matter whether it does ) or does not , express a displeasure that is deserved and just . In this penalty , as they conceive it , God as a person is not expressed-his feelings are not involved , his displeasure against the sinner is not illustrated , but his demand for so much suffering is simply appeased . These are the theologians who are so fond of charging against the theory which finds in both penalty and atonement a moral expression of God 's personal character , " a theatrical inculcation of principles which were not truly involved in the case , " and who say that " it degrades the infinite work of Christ to the poor level of a governm*iental adjustment , whereas it was the most glorious exhibition of eternal principles ; " *Principles indeed ! What principles can be exhibited on their own theory except the principles of Shylock the Jew ? But this brings us to another point . *3 . Dr. Bushnell neither rightly understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of the atonement . This theory , when stated in its most general form , is , that Christ by his humiliation and his death did so manifest God as to make it morally possible to remit to the penitent and believing , the penalty which their sins deserve . It starts with a correct conception of the nature and ends of penalty , viz , that its value and force consists in this , that it expresses God as displeased with sin and the sinner . It proceeds to show that God by the humiliation and death of his Son , not only strikingly commends his redeeming pity for man , but does it in such a form and under such conditions that his love for holiness and displeasure at sin are made more conspicuous than if he had expressed them by punishment . This theory we hold to be the true theory , because of the positive statements of the Scrip- // Dr. Bu8h*ell . April , tures ; concerning the intent of the work of Christ , on the part of God ; concerning its actual expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is accepted ; concerning the consequences to those who accept it in their acceptance with God for the present and future life , and in their triumphant peace and hope . It is sometimes objected that it makes the atoning work a mere expression . But those who thus object forget that all the facts and the goings on of the universe in their construction and development are but expressions or manifestations of One majestic person . All that he does so far as it has a moral significance or influence is but a language through which the invisible is int*rpreted by man . What exists by his flat , and what occurs by his providence , are none the less realities because they are also expressions of God 's spiritual truth , and God 's moral feelings . Heaven is a fact in its fittings , its enjoyments , its rest , its society , its certainty of continuance , but it is because these all so constantly manifest and express the complacent love of the Redeeming God , that heaven has a moral force as the expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walls of gold , if the glory of God did not lighten it , and the Lamb were not the light thoreof . Hell may be dark and dismal in its befittings , and miserable in its companionships and hopeless in its prospects , but if God displeased were not ever flaming in lurid characters along its eternal vaults , its penalties would have no moral force . The atoning work of Christ is none the less a fact because its moral force is found in what it expresses of God . The humiliation to death of the incarnate Word is none the less a reality than the creation of the universe . The one expresses the moral earnestness of the eternal Word , and his redeeming pity to those who look upon the cross ; as " the heavens declare " the wisdom and glory of the same Word , by whom they were made , and are continually upholden . Dr. Bushnell does not , it is true , urge the objection to this theory , that it makes the atonement an act of expression . Indeed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind for a moment the thought that punishment may have what he conceives as a secondary import of expression . He observes in the sole passage // in which this thought occurs , " Punishment itself , apart from the matter of penal enforcement , * * * has besides a most sacred , noble efficacy in what it expresses of God-the determination of his will , his righteousness , in a word his rectoral fidelity to the law . " As if all the penal efficacy or the " matter of penal enforcement , " did not consist in what it expresses . If it be conceded that the force of the penalty lies in what it expresses of God , then it follows that the effect of th' atonement to release from penalty must also be found in what it expresses of God . Here two questions arise : Is there need of such an expression to release from penalty ? Is such an expression possible by the humiliation and death of Christ ? We need not raise the first of these questions , if we can satisfactorily answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so man-* ifest himself in the incarnate and dying Son as to accomplish the end which punishment is fitted to accomplish , then it is easy to believe that such an expression ought to be made . We need not discuss the abstract question of the necessity of an atonement , if we can show in what way an atonement can actually be made . The atonement may be assumed to be necessary if it can be shown to be possible . The question returns upon us , is an atonement in the sense defined , and by the means suggested , possible to be accomplished ? This is the question to be asked , because we must ionfess this theory , and indeed every other theory , labors more here than at any other point . Many earnest thinkers hesitate to accept in full the " govern mental theory , " because they can not clearly see what can be manifested of God by the incarnation and death of his Son which can make this death serve for the release from punishment . If now it can be shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , the same feelings , the same character which the penalty was designed to manifest , then the three problems of the nature , the necessity , and the possibility of the atonement are all solved . Can this be shown ? We think it can be shown to every mind that is willing to do justice to the entire import of the transaction . It is not easy to illustrate the act and its import by any analogies drawn from civil government , from political society , // from human law courts , or any human institution or relation whatsoever . The reason is that the analogies , though real so far as the similarity holds , are too imperfect to serve the purpose for which they are employed . They all fail adequately to illustrate the grand and unique transaction which they are designed to explain . Not only do they fail to satisfy the mind , but the incompetence of the analogy and the poverty of the analog*n , react to the disadvantage of the truth and principles involved . The weakness and ill-success of the attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy so insufficient , become associated in the mind with the theory itself , in whose service the attempt was made . The personages that are concerned , the interests that are involved , the transaction that is performed , the effects that follow , so transcend anything with which they may be compared , that to compare them at all seems to degrade the truths that are so explained . God , the Eternal King , reigns by a moral authority which transcends the rightful prerogative of any earthly sovereign . The Incarnate Word condescends by a humiliation which is beyond all imitation . The government is conducted for ends and in a spirit which no human administrator can even feebly imitate . The penalties are all personal in their meaning and binding force , and in this refuse to be symbolized by the operation of human punishments which are necessarily impersonal in much of their meaning and effect . The deliverance , in order to reach its aim , must respect not merely the outward actions , but the inner disposition of the man , an aim which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria by which to judge of success . If we attempt to illustrate the atoning suffering and death by any human act , we can not divest it of its human relations . Into the import of the death of Christ , then , must enter three altogether peculiar elements  --  the character of the being who suffers , the object for which he suffers , and the terms on which the suffering may be applied . That this import may be felt , the act must also be seen as the termination of the life of him who dies , and as the crowning event into which the significance of that life is gathered . It must also be rightly interpreted by and to the generation in which it took place , while the impres // sions of all that it signified , are freshly made upon their souls . To understand the possible significance of the dying Redeemer we must needs study the event itself , not in its physical circumstances of sorrow and pain , but in all the elements which make up its moral import . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explains , the object for which he suffers , the conditions through which his suffering becomes a deliverance , all these must be considered in order that this import may be understood . To do justice to all these elements of moral significance , we must go to the history itself , and learn to interpret it aright . The crucifixion is not a scene of physical suffering , a tragedy of agony and blood befalling a person of divine dignity , which may be set forth with circumstances of dramatic effect , and made to appeal to our physical sensibilities with moving pathos . The story of the cross , when thus recited in its physical detail by the graphic descriptions of the vivid preacher , or as represented so grossly by the Church of Rome , on Good Friday , by pictures and statues of the dead Jesus-ghastly , bleeding , betrayed , and suffering-is not the true story of the Cross , so far as it fails to give the moral import of the scene which gruws out of the person , the object , the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , so that we may rightly interpret the death of Christ , we turn from the weak analogies of human things to the event itself as it is sketched in the Gospels , and as it was interpreted to the living men who saw Christ die for their sins , and rise again for their justification . The Word is made flesh . God is manifest in the flesh , yet he is not all at once manifest as God . He begins indeed as a child of rare innocence , and with a certain winning loveliness , which nothing but pure moral unselfishness can ever express . lie passes through youth in ways of docility and obedience , with now and then a startling premonition of his divine relations and his coming mission and destiny . He is baptized and owned as the beloved Son of the Eternal by a miraculous attestation . He is introduced to his public ministry through a scene of temptation , and early learns to endure the contradiction of the sinners whom he would guide and save . He begins with teaching the elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Heaven . He exemplifies these ' truths in his own person , acting them out by look and deed , in the varied occasions of a public life which was tested by all manner of provocation , and of a private life that was open to the most prying scrutiny . His works of miracle attest his love and impress his teachings and support the claims which he prudently but firmly asserts . He gathers a circle of disciples upon whose rude yet receptive natures his character begins to make some moral impression that prepares them to respond to the radiance of his higher glory , as it shines forth more and more brightly through its earthly investiture . They believe that he is the promised Messiah  --  the Son of the living God-destined to be the Redeemer of Israel , the one who in their time should restore the Kingdom unto Israel . Bye-and-bye he intimates privately and quietly another destiny for himself-that he must suffer and be rejected , and be slain and be raised the third day . This they could not receive at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the words . As he draws near to the crisis of his life , his love to his followers becomes more intense and spiritual , and the revelations of his higher nature become more full and unequivocal . The import of his coming death , as the power that should give life , and the means that should provide pardon , is more than once distinctly intimated . He dies ; as he must die if he ventured into a world like this . He dies disgracefully , he dies by torture , as it was in keeping that he should . If he humbled himself so far as to become a man who should live for others he must be dragged down still further ; if he displays such patient love he must expect to be struck upon the face ; if he tries only to reclaim and recover he must expect to be spit upon and scourged . He could not show the excellence of such strange tenderness for others , without eliciting and illustrating by way of response the malignity of the sin from which he condescended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinful generation and people and race to whom he came , and among whom he lived , did the worst thing that sin is capable of doing-they nailed him to the cross with malignant cruelty and scorn . But he is not overcome by death . He rises , and in the conquest which he effects over death he is shown beyond question to be the Son of God . Hi5 // divinenature is now attested , and this being attested , a new import is at once attached to his life and death . The radiance in which the risen Redeemer is now transfigured shines backward over his whole career , and puts a meaning into every part of it which could not have been dreamed of before . It shines forward , also , and explains how this sacrifice could be applied , by faith in it as a ground of acceptance with God . To know that this sacrifice would easily and naturally take such an import , we have only to take a step forward in the history . The same Redeemer who had risen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne of eternal majesty , reappears in Jerusalem by a spiritual manifestation that startles the city and calls its astonished citizens together . Peter explains the miracle , and urges the argument that he whom they had crucified was indeed the promised Messiah , the now risen and reigning God . Those who are convinced of their malignant guilt are filled with terror at the thought of the deserved anger , the righteous punishment which they had incurred . They cry out , " What shall we do ? " They saw in the act which they had done against the innocent and the just a manifestation of what they were , and they knew at once what they deserved . Can we be forgiven ? Can we be saved ? These are the inquiries which spring from their hearts and leap to their tongues . The answer is ready . There is one way , and one only , in which you can be pardoned . If you will come to the cross where you hung him , and take your pardon as a gift from him , and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of him whom you have crucified , shall confess him by baptism as your master and Redeemer , God will pardon , you . Some gather around the place and , bitterly repenting of the sin by which they crucified him , do believe in him as the ground of pardon , and coxmfess their faith in him as their Lord . Can any man doubt that as their forgiveness was accorded by God , on the ground of what Christ had done , with the hearty consent of those receiving it , that there is also a similar showing forth or manifestation of God , and of the same character in God , to that which would have been effected by the visitation of punishment upon the deed of guilt ,  --  nay , which was manifested upon those who would not accept the pardon on those terms , and were doomed // to perish with their city and nation ? Can any one doubt that the cross thus applied and accepted manifests " the severity " as well as " the goodness " of God ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed in its elements and its application . It speaks the same truth to every generation which it spoke to the generation which killed the Prince of life . It is applied to all in the same import and upon the same conditions . It ever declares the moral majesty and the redeeming pity of our God . The advantage of allowing the death of Christ to explain itself and suggest the true theory of the atonement , instead of illustrating it by some impressive scene or act from human history , is that in this way we see it with its natural accessories , relieved against a real background , and growing out of its legitiinate antecedents . The death of Christ was a natural and necessary incident of his life . It was inevitable that such a being , living at such a time , should be crucified . That this death took place in such a way , and by such means , relieves our theory from the objection sometimes urged , that God is represented as contriving a spectacle of punishment for the sake of an impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . As we have viewed it , a part of the impression depends on the fact , and arises from the fact , that the death is a part of the life , of which it was the crowning event and fitting termination . If God was to be present in the flesh as a loving and condescending revealer of the Infinite Majesty , then , as revealed in the flesh , he must die a shameful death . Nothing but a miracle of ten legions of angels , or the presence of a chariot of fire to take him violently away , could avert such an issue . If we regard the death as the culmination of the life , then all abruptness in the scene , and all impressions of effect , are at once removed . The death and life constitute a.unity , and become the matter and medium of one manifestation of God . This enables us to do justice to the Scriptures , when they connect the life with the crucifixion and death as a continuous whole , forming a single impression , and tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Christ is invested with peculiar interest and made especially prominent as the ground of pardon . It is explained how , in the New Testament , the // death , the blood , the cross , are the ever prominent themes , because they gather into themselves and intensify the impression of the incarnation and life . It may be objected that if the death of Christ was incidental to his life , then it could not be so essential as the condition of pardon . An event that occurred from the reaction of Jewish malignity could not , it is urged , have been so essential in the movements of God 's administration as to be the turning point of the question whether or not man could be forgiven of God ; and so the turning point of another question , whether God should interpose for his pardon ; and so of another , whether or not the earth should be constructed and fitted up as a scene for man 's recovery . To this we reply , first , the death , as has been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be incarnate , he would be crucified . The humiliation to the form of a man involved humiliation to the cross . Moreover , the one signifies the same as the other . The cross fs only more intense and impressive in the degree . If an incarnation was contemplated as the ground or means of redemption , the cross must have been included . Second ; what is last in its occurrence , and incidental and natural in its place and order , is often foremost in significance and fundamental in the divine economy . The tiny bud , the frail flower , the perishing fruit , the insignificant seed , are produced last in the order of time , and by the quiet processes of the life of the tree , but they are the dominant idea which rule over its existence  --  the overmastering end for which it is provided , and according to which it is trained . All the arrangements with respect to the tree , both divine and human , contemplate the production of the final fruitage that emerges without notice amid other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cross which occurred so naturally in the life of one who was apparently an unpopular Rabbi , the report of which ocenpied but a line or two in the dispatches of Pontius Pilate , was great enough , notwithstanding , to explain the Jewish economy of sacrifice which foreshadowed it ; nay , to be set forth as the ground of God 's forgiving grace to those sins which had been pardoned during all the centuries before . It was great enough to warrant the declaration , " there is none // other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved " - other foundation " can no man lay than is laid . " To the interpreting and forecasting eye of the beloved disciple , when exalted by divine illumination  --  the divine sufferer is seen in the past as the Lamb of God , . slain from the foundation of the world ; " and in the future ages his name is heard as the inspiring theme of that song of the ransomed in which is the ever recurring refrain , " Worthy is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must of necessity be kept back and out of sight , till the work is done . It could not be understood so long as he who had been in the form of God was obscured in the form of a n*n ; but the instant he rose from the dead and was declared to be the Son of God with power  --  the instant that he stood forth in the glory of his higher nature , the Judge of men , the Lord of life , the Conqueror of death-then the import of the death as expressing God flashed into view , and the mystery that had been hid for ages was distinctly revealed . None of the princes of this world knew it , " for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glor*y ; " but when the act was completed , and the God who was in it stood forth , its import in all its aspects was revealed . The cross is explained as a way of pardon and justification , or rather the cross explains itself as soon as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is there . We observe , again , in this connection , that the death of Christ is more completely understood in its import as a manifestation of God , when it is consented to by the repenting faith of him to whose benefit it is applied . In other words , it can only become an atonement in the full import , when it is seen to have been designed to be accepted by every person who gains a release from penalty . It is not till it is received that God is fully vindicated , because the act is not fully understood till then . Were God to provide the death for the mere purpose of manifesting his severity , and without the understood condition that it shall be accepted by the grateful humiliation and consent of the pardoned , he would not be fully declared . But as soon as a single humbled and trusting offender accepts the gift , then all its import is revealed . We are well aware // that the objection might be urged that this would make the import of the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being actually received , and also that it would involve some ethical content in the act of faith which accepts it ; but we are content to take our view from the simple impressions left by the Scriptures , and to waive the opportunity to vindicate our assertion from every possible objection . We have room only to suggest that the consummated fact always reveals completely the designed effect . Objectively speaking , the act itself is complete on the part of God , and its import is really expressed , as soon as it is finished by the death , and explained by the resurrection of Christ . But when it takes effect by the faith of one believing soul , it is more clearly understood by the fruit which it bears and the end to which it is conducted . The theory which we have given , as a theory that is at once Scriptural and tenable , Dr. Bushnell neither understands nor refutes . We have stated this theory in the most general terms , that it might be free from scholastic phraseology and from all theological and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he attempts , upon the phraseology that is sometimes used , that God , by the death of Christ , expresses his " abhorrence of sin . " Out of this verbal rendering he seeks to derive an argument thus : " Abhorrence is a word of recoil simply , and not a word of majesty . There is no enforcement , no judicial - vigor in it . " To this it is sufficient to answer in the same verbal spirit , that if there is no enforcement in simple abhorrence , there may ' be enforcement in abhorrence when the abhorrence is " enforced " by an expressive act . We do not assert that there is judicial vigor in it , for that the theory denies ; but we do insist that the character is expressed which would become judicial vigor , if judgment and not pardon were required . The second objection is , like the first , directed against the theory as " an abhorrence theory , " and it lies " in the fact that no abhorrence at all to sin is expressed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply first , verbally , that it is not abhorrence which is required to be expressed , but that character which would be abhorrence if abhorrence were the emotion called for ; second , really , that the event , when connected // with the person enduring , the recovering love which animates the act , the object for which and the conditions under which it is applied , does speak forth both the holiness and mercy of God . The " severity is not laid upon him to be taken as the sign of his God 's abhorrence , " but it is laid upon Christ by man 's malignity , and is voluntarily suffered by Christ in order that the sinner who has shown the malignancy of his sin in the deed , may be freed from the punishment which he deserves , by consenting to take pardon as the gift and in the name of the once incarnate sufferer whom he had rejected and slain , but whom his faith exalts as his rightful Lord and eternal judge. * We have already conceded that the decisive question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's severity is in fact expressed by the suffering on the cross when endured for such an end . The answer to this question is not to be gained by argument ; it is furnished by the direct impression of the scene , when viewed in its moral completeness . That an obstacle to free and unconditional pardon actually existed is confessed by the conscience convinced of the fact and the evil of sin . That God removes it by the suffering of Christ is responded to by the same conscience , when the offer of pardon comes to it on the ground of that manifestation of God . Dr. Bushnell does not correctly understand this theory in other important particulars . He conceives of it as a theory which has been accepted only in New England , within a century even here , and which has been known in no other part of the Christian Church . The New England divines have certainly done much to give it a perfected form , and to free the * Dr. Bushnell contends that " the abhorrence theory " comes to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the expression of God 's feel . ings is made " on account of the law . " But the one theory makes Christ to endure evil as a punishment  --  the other makes him to endure it that punishment may be dispensed with . The one makes the evil endured " a substituted punish . ment , " the other makes it " a substitute for punishment . " Dr. Bushnell himself makes Christ sustain " the rectoral honor " of God by submitting to " the retrib. utive eausatio*s " in which man is implicated , and asserts that he came that he might , in reclaiming men , also accomplish this object . Did Christ , therefore , suffer punishment according to his theory ' ? Let him apply the same rule to the theory which he criticises , which he will accept as just for his own . // propositions in which it may be stated from every possible objection , but it is a very serious mistake to suppose that the principles which underlie it ? iave been accepted only in New England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to explain the Christian system . The germ of this theory can be found in the reasonings of Anselm , along with the undeveloped germs of those theories which were matured by the divines of the second and third generation after the Reformation . We have the testimony of Baur and Neander that Anselm had not conceived the notion of a punishment incurred , or of a satisfaction rendered by suffering . The restoration of God 's honor , and that not subjectively to himself , but also in the sight of the universe , was at least as prominent as the idea of expiation . This brings one part of his scheme into near connection with the so-called governmental theories . The treatise of Grotius , De &amp;ttisfactione , was an earnest protest against the doctrines of the Socinians , and a rational substitute for the more crude if not morally offensive explanations which so many of . the Reformers adopted from the Scholastics . Notwithstanding the weakness of some points in the scheme of Grotius , and his ill reputation as a Remonstrant , his ground-principles wrought like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traces of it among the writings of the more rational Calvinists of the Puritan Party , as well as in the Church of England . Certainly the so-called New England theory is substantially received at the present day in England among multitudes within the established church and out of it , without a thought that it is of New England origin . The New School portion of the Presbyterian Church in this country once received it eu masse , and were its most zealous advocates . The fact is recorded to their honor in the zealous fulminations against them which are to be found in the " Princeton Review , " in the uncharitable denunciations to which their prominent divines and theological lights were subjected in the same journal , and it is engraved as with a pen of iron in the popular and clerical accusations which led to the excision of the Synods of Western New York , and to the division of the Presbyterian body . Whatever may be the theories of the atonement which are at // present taught in that denomination , the time was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body the power of God unto salvation . 91t gave to it its aggressive energy , its manly spirit , its earnest piety , its rational yet Christian , its studious yet practical theology . It may have fallen into some discredit of late here and there in New England , but not , as we think , with the men who represent the best type of the New England spirit . With those who seriously question its truth , from grounds of hesitating conviction , we have expressed our sincere sympathy . But such are not all who dispute it . Some may have contracted a distate for it from associations that are purely factitious . Men who from philosophical pretension , or foreign culture , or superficial thinking , reject this view , will carry very little weight with their opinions . Mere litterateurs and dilettan*ti in theology may as well hold one opinion as another , so far as they themselves are concerned , and almost as far as those whom they influence . Traditional theologians who shape and modify their opinions by the authority of names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past for themselves , but they can not nourish the present by that which is gone , except so far as it teaches the ever living truth . Let the dead theologians whose faces look only to the past bury again the dead dogmas which they so carefully exhume , and would reinstate among the dwellings of the living . The political theologians , who shape their creed by consider*itions of ecclesiastical affinity , will not be likely to retain the New En*1and theology , if their hearts do not cleave to the New England institutions . The ort14odoxical not the truly orthodox theologians will , of course , prefer the old and well sounding phrases that mean nothing to the intellect but are imposing to the ear , especially if they can use them as a sounding brass , through which to proclaim their own superior zeal for the faith , or as forms of brawling accusation against those whom they would malign . But enough and more than enough of thoughts of this kind . The question is of little interest , who have taught this or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is called by one name or another . The only matter of importance is , what is true , and what can be defended by a sound philosophy and rational interpretation . // 4 . Dr. Bushnell is at fault in the most essential features of his theory of the sacrificial system and its symbolic import . We say the most essential features of this theory-for with very many of his positions we heartily concur . We agree with him that the sacrificial system is natural to all rude nations , and that whether it originally sprung from divine institution or not , it could not have been accepted unless it satisfied a want in man 's nature , and spoke directly to his heart . What this natural import is , should be gathered not from any possible accommodation of it to the work of Christ , or any typical foreshadowing which was found to be convenient or thought to be desirable , and therefore was assumed to be real . The sacrificial system could not serve as a system of types , unless it had a primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to prefigure a spiritual reality ; nor will the reasoning from any correspondence or fulfillment hold unless the system to be fulfilled had an import which corresponded in part to that which fulfilled it . . Moreover , we concede that sacrifices , even sacrifices involving death , were used on occasions of thanksgiving and consecration , as well as those of penitence and the deprecation of evil . We hold with him that these acts of sacrifice constituted a symbolic liturgy which was used on every occasion , and was fitted to serve as the medium of every form of feeling and every attitude of worship . It was required by and for a people who had " not yet come to the age of reflection . They know nothing about piety or religious experience , as reflectively defined , preached , tested by words . * * * Of course they are religious beings , guilty beings , but these deep ground-truths of their nature work out in them , from a point back of their distinctive consciousness ; felt only as disturbances , not discovered mentally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people and train them towards himself , God puts them in a drill of action , works upon them by a transactional liturgy , and expects , by that means , to generate in them an implicit faith , sentiment , piety , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . All this we hold to be true and important . We know no theologian whose opinion is worthy of respect who would not assent to all these propositions . From these general views , the author proceeds to lay down // April , what he considers the starting point or key-note to the entire system . " It begins at a point , " he says , " or base note of action , that , so far as I can recoll&amp;t , is wholly unknown to the cultus , or the sacrifices of any heathen religion . Moving on results of purity or purification from sin , it supposes impurity , and lays this down as a fundamental figure , in what may be called the footing of ceremonial uncleanliness . Then the problem is to cleanse or hallow the unclean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks to be indicated by the Mosaic ceremonial and the sacrificial system . In other words , lustration or ceremonial cleansing , as symbolizing inward purity , is " the fundamental figure " which exhausts the entire import of this system . When ceremonies are employed to make pure that which is by the law unclean , when garments are changed , when water is sprinkled , when the victim is slain , over whom the priest had confessed the sins of one or many , and the blood is applied to those in whose behalf the victim was sacrificedthe whole import of each and all of these . acts is expressed in the phrases to make inwardly pure and holy . Of these points of the theory , as thus far explained , we ob-. serve that simple lustration is not unknown to the heathen ritual , would scarcely be denied . If we mistake not , it figures very largely in their ceremonies . Water , and fire , and incense , and all manner of preliminary rites , figure very prominently in these systems . We agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant of inward purity . On the contrary , instration or ceremonial cleansing signifies in the heathen rites only consecration and accepta6leness to the Deity . Uncleanliness of person or apparel , of the place and implements of worship , is offensive , because it is displeasing in itself and because it betokens irreverence . This shows why it gave the fundamental figure to the ceremonial of the Jews . The Jews were taught to regard themselves as a chosen people , " a Kingdom of Priests , " a holy , i. e. , a consecrated nation . Hence , they were to be choice in their food , in their personal habits , in the thousand minute particulars of their ritual and manners , by which they were to be ever reminded of their special rela tion to God . When they had become unclean , when by accident or design they had broken these rules , they were to be // made clean again by appropriate ceremonies of lustration . Acceptableness to God , a state of rightness or favor with God , justification even , were much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Dr. Bushnell takes to be the grand conception of the sacrificial system , viz. , the conception of lustration or cleanness . It is true that inward purity was afterwards evolved , but not to the exclusion of the first and leading - conception . Even the order of suggestion from the physical to the moral was not that indicated by Dr. Bushnell . Gleannees meant first physical cleanness , next acceptableness to God , or rightness with the ritual , next freedom from whatever is offensive in transgression , whether the sin were external or internal . The loss of God 's favor enters always as an element into the idea of uncleanliness . This thought has greater importance than it seems to have at first , to any one who follows it out in the explanation of the kindred words which are used in the New Testament . To cleanse from sin , whether ritual or moral , suggests first the idea of the restoration of God 's favor , and second the idea of internal purification . Psychologically considered , also , the consciousness of guilt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inward pollution of sin . That which in the order of time first awakens the soul to refleetion upon and the discernment of moral distinctions , is the discovery that we have displeased others . We then ask ourselves is their displeasure reasonable or unreasonable . This puts us upon the efforts of inquiry whether we ourselves approve or disapprove our own acts . So in our relation to God , guilt , ill-desert , danger , are the conceptions which are first evoked and prominently expressed . The pollution of sin is a conception which comes later still , and so far as it is distinguishable from personal ill-desert , it signifies the degradation of the soul , from its high destiny , its base subjection to animal and irascible passions , and its entangling servitude to evil habits . Even when this conception is matured and developed , it by no means displaces or removes the sense of guilt or ill-desert from ourselves and from other good beings , and above all from God . But should we admit that lustration or ceremonial cleansixig had respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cult to see how the application of the blood of a slain victim could be limited to express inward cleansing , except by a sense which is obviously secondary and plainly derived . But before we pursue this point further , we ought to consider positively whether the offering of a slain victim did not necessarily symbolize the confession , on the part of the worshiper , that his sin deserved an evil like that which his victim incurred . It is no answer to say that the taking of life in ordinary cases signified nothing to the Jews , nor that the pain attending the slaughter would not awaken a responsive feeling in the minds of a pastoral people . The question is not whether these evils and pains would be noticed in ordinary , but whether they could be left unconsidered in extraordinary circumstances . We know when covenants were made among the earliest and rudest tribes , that animals were slain by or in the name of both the contracting parties , and that the act was understood to declare that each invoked upon himself the fi*te of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all such cases death painfnl death , is actually made to signify deserved evil . In this spirit and sense Moses ratified his law as a covenant with the people , by sprinkling the blood of calves and of goats , and saying " this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you . " t If slaughter could symbolize to a rude people evil possibly or really incurred in the case of a covenant , it could do the same in the act of sacrifice . lJpon Dr. Bushnell 's theory we can not see the import of the application of the blood of the victim by sprinkling the worshiper . In blood there is nothing physically cleansing ; it is only as the blood to a rnde people is the most obvious physical symbol of the mysteriously departing life , and as the sprinkling of this blood upon the participants is conceived of * The form which was used among the Romans in making the oath , when a Swine was sacrificed , was : Si prior defexit ( populus Romanus ) publico consilio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic ferito , ut ego hune poreum hic hodie feriam ; tautoque magis ferito , quanto magis potes pollesque . Livy , 1 , 24 , 8 ; compare also 9 , 5 , 3 . Compare Genesis xv . 8-24 , for the vision of Al*raham , in which the visible symbol of Jehovah , translated " a smoking furnace , " &amp;c. , passes between victims that were slain to bind the eovenant. t See Hebrews ix . 19 , 20 , and Exodus xxiv. 5 , 6 , 8. // as connecting them most intimately with whatever purpose the slaughter of the victim signifies , making the victim , so to speak , tobe their own , that we can explain its application at all . But if , in the case of the sin or trespass offering , there was signified the infliction of evil such as the offerer confessed he deserved , and the cleansing by blood meant the removal of deserved anger as well as the moral cleansing of the sod , then the application of it is natural and easy to be nuderstood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bushnell that it signifies the " sacred , mystic , new-creating touch of life . " For a rude people such a conception is plainly too refined ; to a cool critic it would seem to be only a dexterous conceit , used to dispose of the obvious import of the passage , " For the life of the flesh is in the blood , and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul . " Nor does it prove anything to the contrary of these views , to assert that slaughtered victims were offered on other occasions besides occasions of expiation . It is true they were . Animals were slaughtered , and placed upon the altar , and burned with incense to serve as thank-offerings , as well as to express the confession and to relieve the fears of the guilty . The use of animal sacrifices , for all the occasions and acts of worship , was most natural as it was universal , for reasons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means justifies the inference that they could not naturally and legitimately also become the symbols of expiatory needs and deprecatory feelings , nor that when they served this use , the death , and snfferings , and banishment of the victim did not come distinctly into view and signify substituted evil . This argument , which is so strongly urged by some modern German critics and theologians , and which is pressed so confidently by Dr. Bushnell , seems to us not only to fail , but to be entirely inconsistent with a proper historic estimate of the extensive import and varied uses of the sacrificial system among Those tribes and nations to whom such a system constituted the only liturgy for all occasions and needs . We should like to follow Dr. Bushnell in his remarks concerning " Atonement , Propitiation , and Expiation . " But // our limits will not allow . The principles upon the subject which we have urged , must serve in the place of a more particular discussion and criticism of his arguments and ppinions . It would seem , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elaborate argument which Dr. Bushnell has bestowed upon these three most important topics , especially in consideration of the very confident assertion which he makes in the following words : " I am able , after the most thorough and complete examination of the Scriptures , to affirm with confidence , that they exhibit no trace of expiation. * * * * That such an opinion has been so long and generally held of the Scripture sacrifices , I can only account for in the manner already suggested , viz , that there is a natural tendency in all worthy ideas of religion to lapse into such as are unworthy-repentance , for example , into doing penance-that the sacrifices could easily be corrupted in this manner , and , in fact , were by all the pagan religions ; and then , that there was imported back into the constructions of holy Scripture a notion of expiation , as pertaining to sacrifice , under the plausible but unsuspected sanction of classic uses and associations. ** The whole force of this assertion and of the nine reasons which Dr. Bushnell adduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rightly seized upon the fundamental conception which is expressed by the sin offering under the Jewish system . This was not , as we contend , " inward cleansing , " but rightness with God  --  or justification-oh the objective ground that evil was deserved by the worshiper and endured by another . The subjective or spiritual condition of acceptance which the act of offering symbolized , was indeed that repenting faith which involves inward purity . The heathen notion of expiation began with the same fundamental conception ; but the need of sacrifice was interpreted by superstition to proceed from malignant anger on the part of the cruel deities , in place of the just displeasure of the Holy Jehovah , and to require on the part of the worshiper the costly and painful sacrifice perhaps of the fruit of the body for the sin of the soul , instead of the broken and contrite heart . But does this perversion of heathen superstition exorcise truths that seem to be // recognized on every page of " holy Scripture ; " which have molded and inspired all its diction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise definitions and its most elaborate arguments , such as we find in the Epistles to the Romans , the Galatians , and the Hebrews ? Dr. Bushnell must excuse us ; we are not convinced , we are not even moved by either his assertion or his arguments , except to wonder ! We can not silently pass over the view which is earnestly pressed by the author in respect to the use which is to be made of the " molds of thought for the world 's great altar-service in Christ , " in our devotional conceptions and public preaching of the work of Qhi*ist . " In the facts outwardly regarded , there is no sacrifice , or oblation , or atonement , or propitiation , but simply a living and dying , thus and thus . The facts are unpressive , the person is clad in a wonderful dignity and beauty , the agony is eloquent of love , " Why not of something more ? " and the cross a very shocking murder triumphantly met , and when the question rises , how we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we hardly know in what way to begin . How shall we come unto God by help of this martyrdom ? How shall we turn to it , or turn ourselves under it , so as to be jmtstifled and set in peace with God ? Plainly there is a want here , and this want is met by giving a thought form to the facts which is not in the facts themselves . They are put directly into the molds of the altar , and we are called to accept the crucified God-man as our sacrifice , an offering or oblation for us , our propitiation ; so to be sprinkled from our evil conscience , washed , purged , purified , cleansed Why not justified here as well as above ? from our sin . " " And so much is there in this that without these forms of the altar , we should be utterly at a loss in making any use of the Christian facts , that would set us in a condition of practical reconciliation with God . Christ is good , beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his forgiving patience melts into my feeling , his passion rends open my heart , but what is lie for , and how shall he be made unto me for the salvation Ii want ? One word-he is my sacrifice-opens all to me , and beholding him , with all my sin upon him , I count him my offering , I come unto God by him , and enter into the holiest by his blood . " // We have copied so much of this passage in order to be per-i fectly fair to Dr. Bushnell in allowing him to speak for himself . The passage strikingly reminds us , in its intellectual coherence though not in its moral spirit , of the position taken by Strauss and ilennell when at the close of their destructive criticisms of the facts of the Christian history , they ask , what then ? Must we cease to be Christian believers ? Must we cease to receive these facts of history in some sense as true ? To these questions of their own asking they reply , not in the least ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , and act , and feel , as though they were ,  --  we must incorporate them into our festivals , prayers , and sacred songs ,  --  " we must give a thought form to the facts which is not in the facts themselves . " The reason given by Dr. Bushnell why we must give " a thought form to the facts which are not in the facts themselves , " is that we require some objective molds into which we can project the phenomena of our conscious experience , so as to avoid an " over-conscious , " a too introverted occupation with our subjective experiences . That is , if we concern ourselves too exclusively with the subjective goings on of our souls- " their moral disorders " and their inward relations of purity-we shall have no objects from which to derive the inward purity for which we seek . This is true , and the truth reaches out far more widely , and strikes far more deeply in its application to his entire scheme , than Dr. Bushnell seems to dream . But let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some objective form must be had into which the soul may project itself , and from which it may draw inward strength and purity , the question still returns , how can you find such a form in the sacrificial system , if that system means no more in its natural and original import than he allows ? How could the sacrificial system become the altar form of Christian thought and feeling amid expression in all ages , unless the system itself suggested an mmnport of facts and objective relations which is fitted to promote and excite gratitude , love , and " inward purity ? " Dr. Bushnell asserts that this system served as the " transactional liturgy " of a rude people , because they desired to offer their best to God and on occasions of ceremonial uncleanliness were told to slay a victim and sprinkle his blood . It might serve as such // a liturgy so long as the rude custom of sacrifice should remain , or the positive law of priest , ruler , or deity should require it . But when we are called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship , then we inquire what is it fitted in its nature to express , and what is the real import of Christ 's work , which we wish to express through it ? According to Dr. Bushnell , the work of Christ means only a sacrificing act of love in God which stoops to our miserable and suffering condition that we may be won to purity and love . And what did the victim slain upon the altar signify to the Jew ? Why he offered his best to God , as he had learned from his fathers , following also the blind impulses of a childish nature , or God had told him when he sinned to slay a victim and to be sprinkled with its blood ; the use of the victim signifying the inward purity , that the ceremonial cleansing might suggest to the reflecting mind . When now we have learned all about this inward purity , and also have learned the substance of the gospel to be that Christ loves us , and longs to make us pure , how can we use the shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of what use is the shell to us ? It expressed nothing to the Jew in the way of natural significance ; how can it express anything to us ? How can we make the lamb slain upon the altar an object into which we pro*ject our spiritual feelings or out ' dependence upon God ? But if it were true that the dying lamb did signify to the Jew that there was evil deserved for which the evil that fe9l upon the victim was substituted , and if the blood of the lamb when applied to the penitent signified that he might be accepted on certain conditions , we can see how it could furnish a language for all Christian worship . And if we may believe that Christ by the evil which he suffered made it consistent that God should forgive , we can see also how the lamb that was slain and the blood that was sprinkled should become the altar forms after which the believing and the praying Church on earth must express its prayers for forgiv&amp; ness , and the ransomed Church in Heaven shall phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has unconsciously taken the same view , we must believe , when he says , in the words already quoted , " but what is he for , and how shall he be made untG me the salvation I want ? One wordhe // is my sacrifice-opens all to me , and beholding him with all my *in upon him , I count him my offering , and come unto God by him , and enter into the holiest by his blood ? There are two remaining points of weakness in Dr. Bushnell 's scheme on which we had proposed to offer some remarks ; viz , his view of justification by faith and his special interpretations of the declarations of the Scriptures . Of the first we desired especially to say something , that we might explain what that faith is which is the condition of justification , and how this faith is required to complete and explain the atonement , and also that we might show that under Dr. Bushnell 's theory , justification can not be distinguished from the inward cleansing or sanctification , despite his earnest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to explain the several conceptions of the word " righteousness , " so often used in the New Testament and so strangely perverted in some systems of theology . But we pass over these topics for want of room . Of the declarations of the Scriptures we must say a word . These declarations concerning the import of the work of Christ are so various , and so decisive , that we find it difficult to see how they can receive but one interpretation . They speak directly of its design in terms too clear and decisive to be set aside . They speak indirectly of its operation in a great variety of assertions , all consistent with each other , and with only one conception of the leading design of this death . They do not , it is true , with scholastic nicety , confine themselves to this one relation or end . Often this leading relation is entirely omitted through the desire to emphasize some other , but that the Scriptures do teach a doctrine of the vicarious sacrifice in the sense commonly received , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Bushnell , is to our minds most clear . Had we no theory of the atonement by which to cxplain its reasonableness and its justice , and were we entirely unable to answer Dr. Bushnell 's arguments or to expose the weaknesses of his counter-theory , we should at least rest assured , in the words of Channing , " that the Scriptures ascribe the remission of sins to Christ 's deatim , with an emphasis so peculiar that we ought to consider this event as having a special influence in removing punishment , though the Scriptures may not reveal the way in which it contributes to this end . " // Dr. Bushnell 's interpretations are all to the opposite conclusion . We had proposed to examine some of them , but our limits will not allow us to do so at present . Perhaps on some future occasion we may show that his interpretations of special passages are as untenable as is the philosophical theory which made them necessary . There are two passages , however , which we can not pass over , they seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to the design and import of the death of Christ . These are Rom. iii . 19-26 , and 2 Cor. v. 18-21 . In the first of these passages the starting-point is the thought that all are condemned and pronounced guilty . No mention is made of the pollution of sin . It is not even hinted at , so absorbing and overwhelming is the consideration of the ill-worthiness of the human race . The next thought is that a way of deliverance from this condition and of transference into another , is clearly manifest , being effected by believing in Christ . Then Christ himself is spoken of as taking the place of the old propitiatory offerings . Christ , to become effective , must be received with faith , as these offerings were made effectual by the sprinkling of blood . The design and effect of this provision is to manifest in these last times that the past forbearance of God , in remittiug sins committed in the previous ages , had been on groi*nds of justice , the death of Christ being all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apostle dwells upon , and repeats it again , this is what I intend , that ' God has set forth Christ as a sacrifice , that at this time of the world 's history his justice might be vindicated , in all his acts of justification , whether past , present , or future . ' This interpretation is , we believe , in the main correct . Not only is it sustained by the careful study of the words and the grammatical structure of the sentences , but it is required by a consideration of the logical relations of the parts of the passage to each other , and to the whole argument of the Epistle . Any other interpretation fails to meet these conditions of truth . The second passage is interesting , as it purports to be an explicated , statement of the import of the gospel which the apostle was accustomed to preach . God is through or by means of Christ reconciling the world of sinful men to himself ; // but in what does the act consist ? in not imputing their trespasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean no more than that he imparts to them inward purity , or that he gives them that favor of God which they had forfeited ? Which of these two thoughts is expressed in the apostle 's words , or was in fact in the apostle 's mind ? Who can doubt that there was but one thought in his mind and which of the two was that one ? This is made more clear , if possible , by his summary of the message of entreaty " in Christ 's stead " " be ye reconciled to God . " Here the responsibility is thrown upon the men addressed , of bringing themselves into that relation to which they were invited . The argument gathers strength when the reason for their compliance is added . For he hath made him Christ to be treated as though he were a sinner , to the end that he might treat us as though we had never sinned . ' Into the effect described in the words " that ye might be made the righteousness of God in him , " the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteous or " inwardly pure , " but this is not the consideration prominent in the mind of Paul . It would seem that no more clear , precise , or decisive explanations could be asked for or given , respecting the " vicarious sacrifice , " than are furnished in these two passages . We can not bring to this abrupt conclusion our remarks upon what we regard the oversights and errors of Dr. Bushmiell , without a single additional observation . While he contends most earnestly against the doctrine of the atonement as it is usually received , he contends as earnestly , that Christ has most amply sustained the rectoral honor of God , and deepened the impressions of men concerning his essential holiness . He has done this by sanctifying the precept of the law by his personal obedience , by threatening eternal judgment and perdition in a manner and in terms most awful and impressive , and by suffering all the corporate evils as well as the retributive causations under whi'ch the race exist . His exhibition of these truths are very earnest and impressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contends as earnestly as any that an expression of God 's holiness must be made as well as of God 's mercy ; that God 's rectoral honor must be upholden as truly as his vicarious love ; and thal Christ most effectually // accomplished these objects . He only differs from us by deflying that this expression was directly made by the incarnation and death , or that these are set forth as the ground of possible pardon . These express only tender love and pity . The work of Christ a a whole provides for an honorable ground of pardon , but not the humiliation of Christ to the cross . Christ does sustain God 's rectoral honor , and thus provides for the propriety of pardon . But it is not by the great act of condescension unto death . This illustrates only the mercy of God . He rejects the doctrine of a required expiation because his philosophical scheme provides no occasion for it , because , as he asserts most distinctly , there is no possible antagonism between justice and mercy , which makes an atonement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions are we have endeavored to establish . Into what defective in* terpretations of the Scriptures this philosophy has led him , we might more fully have shown , had our limits allowed . The practical conceptions , however , which he everywhere exhibits of the place which Christ should hold in the soul of man , of the power which he is fitted to exert over his moral being , of the coixipleteness of man 's dependence upon him for all his salvation , and of the free grace from which this salvation proceeds , can not be mistaken nor overlooked , except by those whose creed is more Christian than their justice or their charity . No one of our living writers can be easily named who gives to Christ a higher place , or who ascribes to his supernatural Incarnation and Work a larger honor , than does Dr. Bushnell . No one can be named who has taken nobler and more comprehensive views of the completeness of Christ for every exigency which he recognizes . No one can conceive more vividly the tenderness , the sublimity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . No one certainly can draw out by a finer analysis the workings of that love upon the soul of man to purify and humble , to elevate and ennoble , to sanctify and save his ruined nature . It is singular , remarks an acute critic in a private letter , that men who , like Bushnell and Robertson , reject the full import of the death of Christ , should make Christ a far more living and effective power than the majority of those who receive it . it is singular , yet , it must be confessed , it is true . // While , then , we reject the theory of Dr. Bushnell as falling short of the fullness of Scriptural truth , we recognize , with the utmost satisfaction , that he reaches substantially the Scriptural view of Christ 's work in every possible practical application which may be made of it to the soul of man . In one view the prayer with which he concludes his book might be construed as a piece of unconscious irony perpetrated by himself upon his own theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded as the confession of the truth in which the heart is far more orthodox than the head . We think none the worse of our Congregational system that it enables us by its free and charitable spirit to recognize such a man as we know him , and as all the world knows him to be , as a Christian preacher with whom we may hold fellowship , while at the same time it allows us freely to discuss and refute the errors of that philosophy which has so seriously misled him in the interpretation of the teachings of Scripture in respect to one of its most important doctrines .
