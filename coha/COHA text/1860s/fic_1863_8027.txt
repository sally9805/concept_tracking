POEMS ON MAN , IN HIS VARIOUS ASPECTS UNDER THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : I THE CHILD . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Calm , in thy cradle lie , thou little Child , Thy white limbs smoothing in a patient sleep , Or , gambolling when thou wakest at the peep Of the young day  --  as clear and undefiled As thou ! Around thy fresh and lowly bed Look up and see , how reverent men are gathered , In wonder at a babe so greatly fathered Into life , and so by influence fed . They watch the quiet of thy deep blue eye  --  Where all the outward world is born anew , Where habit , figure , form , complexion , hue Rise up and live again in that pure sky ; At every lifting of thine arms , they feel The ribbed and vasty bulk of Empire shake , And from the fashion of thy features take The hope and image of the common-weal . See ! through the white skin beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come and go , Like the great circles of the ocean-flow , And dash a continent at either side . Thou wield'st a hopeful Empire , large and fair , With sceptred strength : about thy brow is set A fresh glad crown , with dewy morning wet , And noon-day lingers in thy flaxen hair ! Kingdom , authority and power to thee Belong ; the hand that frees , the chain that thralls  --  Each attribute on various man that falls , Strides he the globe , or canvass-tents the sea : The sword , the staff , the judge 's cap of death , The ruler 's robe , the treasurer 's key of gold , All growths the world-wide scope of life may hold , Are formed in thee and people in thy breath . Be stirred or still , as prompts thy beating heart ! Out of thy slumbering calmness there shall climb , Spirits serene and true against the Time That trumpets men to an heroic part ; And motion shall confirm thee , rough or mild For the full sway that unto thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massy throngs Of life  --  thou gentle and thou sovereign Child ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : II . THE FATHER . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Behold thyself renewed ! But think not there A slave or suppliant lies ; nor on him bow Thy curious looks , as if another heir Had sprung to bear about thy civil brow In public streets  --  thy sober suit to wear : In all things to obey , in all to trust  --  And , when thy time has past and his ensues , Ape-like to track thee downward in the dust . See , rather , from the little lids looks out A soul distinct and sphered , its own true star , Shining and axled for a separate way , Be its young orbit 's courses near or far . His little hands uplifted for his right To have an individual life allowed  --  Implore of men , of men , from thee the first , The freedom by his birth-right hour bestowed . Check not , nor hamper with an idle chain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With habitudes of craft , of health or pain The youngling life that asks to be its own : His early friend , his helper and his guide To stay his hold upon the rugged way  --  Turn not that life-branch from the sun or shade aside , But in heaven 's breezes , rather , let it go astray . Be thou a Heaven of truth and cheerful hope , Clear as the clear , round midnight at its full ; And he , the Earth beneath that elder cope  --  And each ' gainst each for highest mastery pull : The child and father , each shall fitly be  --  Hope in the evening vanward paling down , The one  --  the other younger Hope upspringing , With the glancing morning for its crown . There is no tyranny in truest love , Nor rightful mastery in triumphant force ; And gentleness at hearth and board will prove Felicity is born of their divorce : Father and Child , the after and before , Latest or first , whatever matters it ? Of mutual hopes , of mutual fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life are knit . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : III . THE TEACHER . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) With reverent steps approach the soul that lies Before thee , rude , unformed and full of life ; A chaos shrouding up a future world  --  To order born  --  yet with itself at strife . Peer for a while within the dark domain , And see how temples mighty spring to sight , Arks , palaces  --  all dead or living things Doomed to climb up into the Heaven 's light , To heap the Earth or sail the outward Sea ; The giant mass of things to come at large , Hovering about and shaping silently Within that baby soul 's unquiet marge . Footnote : 1Kb In beauty shall that fresh-girt spirit build ? Shall harmony through all its chambers sing  --  While rising day by day , and pile on pile , Its topless worlds of heaven-ward wonders spring ? Say thou  --  that broodest on its infant breast ! Whose eyes cry light through all its dawning void  --  Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on labor without hope employed . ' T is there the truest work Earth knows is done  --  Each hour , each instant buys the world an age With glory bright : knits up its golden peace , Or rends the web of time with endless rage . Bend to the Teacher , bend , oh world , thy knees ! And pray him , blessed God 's name , to be true ! Lest he for ever break that spirit 's precious peace , And following millions in its fall undo . A consecrated man  --  thou man of thought  --  Keep clear thy master-soul in every act , And be thy features pure as early light  --  Crossing in power that spirit 's undimmed tract . The world 's dust ever shake from off thy feet , When drawest thou to that white temple near , Nor vex its amber cope with words unmeet Of hate , or anger harsh , or unblest fear . Listen the way the spirit seeks to go  --  And watch its sacred steps , or firm or frail ; Haste not its pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in changeful mirth or wail , Remember , thou art standing by thy God ! Ere Earth has soiled his beauty , touched his strength : ' T is there th ' Almighty makes his sweet abode ; And there , if undisturbed , would Heaven at length Take up and fix its everlasting rest : Yea , Heaven with these , its children , fain would dwell , And , far-withdrawn within their stainless breast , Deliver thence , at times , a blessd oracle . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : IV . THE CITIZEN . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) With plainness in thy daily pathway walk  --  And disencumbered of excess : no other Jostling , servile to none , none overstalk , For , right and left , who passes is thy brother . Let him who in thy countenance looks , Find there in meek and softened majesty , Thy Country writ , thy Brother and thy God ; And be each motion , forthright , calm and free . Feel well with the poised ballot in thy hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T is thine to bless , or blast the waiting land , To shorten up its life or make it long . Who looks on thee , not hopeless , should behold , A self-delivered , self-supported Man ; True to his being 's mighty purpose  --  true To a wisdom-blessed  --  a god-given plan . No where within the great globe 's skyey round  --  Canst thou escape thy duty , grand and high , A man unbadged , unbonneted , unbound  --  Walk to the Tropic  --  to the Desert fly . A full-fraught Hope upon thy shoulder leans , And beats with thine , the heart of half the world ; Ever behind thee walks the shining Past , Before thee burns the star-stripe , high unfurled . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : V. THE FARMER . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Full master of the liberal soil he treads , With none to tithe , to crop , to third his beds Of ripely-glowing fruit or yellow grain  --  He knows what freedom is ; undulled of pain Looks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden in the other 's view ; Or , on the meadow listening to the sky That bids its grasses thrive with starry dew . To him there come in such still places , Undimmed , majestical and fresh as life , The elder forms , the antique mighty faces Which shone in council , stood aloft in strife  --  When went the battle , billowy , past ; When high the standard to the sky was raised ; When rushed the horsemen with the rushing blast , And the red sword through shrouded valleys blazed . When Cities rising shake th ' Atlantic shore  --  Thou mighty Inland , calm with plenteous peace , Oh temper and assuage the wild uproar , And bring the sick , vexed masses balmy ease . On their red vision like an angel gleam , And angel-like be heard amid their cries Till they are stilled as is the summer 's stream , Majestical and still as summer skies . When cloud-like whirling through the stormy State Fierce Revolutions rush in wild-orbed haste , On the still highway stay their darkling course , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger of their chariot-wheels In the cool flowings of the mountain brook , While from the cloud the heavenward prophet casts His mantle 's peace , and shines his better look . Better to watch the live-long day The clouds that come and go Wearying the heaven they idle through , And fretting out its everlasting blue  --  Than prowl through streets and sleep in hungry dens The beast should own , though known and named as men 's ; Though sadness on the woods may often lie , And , wither to a waste the meadowy land  --  Pure blows the air  --  and purer shines the sky , For nearer always to Heaven 's gate ye stand ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : VI . THE MECHANIC . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) O , when thou walkest by the river 's brink , Thy bulky figure outlined in the wave , Or , on thine adze-staff resting , ' neath the ship Thy strokes have shaped , or hear'st thou loud and brave The clangor of the boastful forge  --  Think not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Are given rights masterless and vantage-proof , The sad , pale scholar and his puny hand Idling his thoughts upon the idle sand , May not possess as full : oh , maddened , drink not With greedy ear what selfish Passion pours : His a sway peculiar is , no less than yours . The inner world is his ; the outer thine  --  ( And both are God 's )  --  a world , maiden and new , To shape and finish forth , of iron and wood , Of rock and brass , to fashion , mould and hew  --  In countless cunning forms to re-create  --  Till the great God of order shall proclaim it " Good ! " Proportioned fair , as in its first estate . Let consecrate , whate'er it strikes , each blow  --  From the small whisper of the tinkling smith , Up to the big-voiced sledge that heaving slow Roars ' gainst the massy bar , and tears Its entrail , glowing , as with angry teeth  --  Anchors that hold a world should thus-wise grow . In the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enginery , and temples meek , In grandeur towered , or lapsing , beauty-sleek , Let order and creative fitness shine : Though mountains are no more to rear , Though woods may rise again no more ; The noble task to re-produce is thine ! The spreading branch  --  the firm-set peak may live With thee , and in thy well-sped labors thrive . The untried forces of the air , the earth , the sea , Wait at thy bidding : oh , compel their powers To uses holy ! Let them ever be Servants to tend and bless these new-found bowers ; And make them household workers , free and swift , On daily use  --  on daily service bent : Her face again old Eden may uplift , And God look down the open firmament . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : VII . THE MERCHANT . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Who gathers income in the narrow street , Or , climbing , reaps it from the roughening sea  --  His anchor Truth should fix  --  should fill his flowing sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Wrought out with lies each rafter of thine house , Black with the falsehood every thread thou wearest  --  A subtle ruin , sudden overthrow , For all thy household 's fortune thou preparest . Undimmed the man should through the trader shine , And show the soul unbabied by his craft : Slight duties may not lessen but adorn , The cedar 's berries round the cedar 's shaft . The pettiest act will lift the doer up , The mightiest cast him swift and headlong down ; If one forget the spirit of his deed , The other wears it as a living crown . A grace , be sure , in all true duty dwells ; Humble or high , you always know it thus , For beautiful in act , the foregone thought Confirms its truth though seeming-ominous . Pure hands and just , may therefore , well be laid On duties daily as the air we breathe ; And Heaven amid the thorns of harshest Trade The laurel of its gentlest love may wreathe . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : VIII . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1863 ) With grounded arms , and silent as the mountains , Pause for thy quarrel at the marbled sea : And , when comes the ship o'er the curled wave bounding , Remember that a brother in a foe may be . Thy battles are not wars but self-defences , Girding this Universal Home about  --  Least lion-wrong and subtle-fanged pretences Pierce to its heart and let the life-hope out . Though sleeps the war-blade in the amorous sheath , And the dumb cannon stretches at his leisure  --  When strikes the shore a hostile foot  --  out-breathe Ye grim , loud guns  --  ye fierce swords work your pleasure ! And sternly , in your stubborn socket set , For life or death  --  your hilt upon the steadfast land , Your glance upon the foe , thou sure-set bayonet , Firm ' gainst a world 's shock in your fastness stand ! This , this , remember still , thou son of war  --  The child of peace within his doorway seated Thine equal is  --  though beats the luring drum afar , Or flies the meteor column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent man , And in the peaceful sky-arch o'er him bending , A pure repose  --  a more triumphal span Than sees the death-field ' mid its storms ascending . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : IX . THE STATESMAN . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Up to the Capitol who goes , a heart Should bear , state tyranny may not subdue : Wakening at dawn to fill its ample part , It , ever , day by day , grows fresh and new , Nor sleeps through the mid-watches of the night , Though there the thankless world has left its smart  --  Without some visions , beckoning and bright , That make him gladly to his bedside start . Accursed who on the Mount of Rulers sits Nor gains some glimpses of a fairer day ! Who knows not there , what there his soul befits , Thoughts that leap up and kindle far away The coming time ! Who rather dulls the ear With brawling discord and a cloud of words ; Owning no hopeful object , far or near , Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empire would control The various millions , parted or amassed , Should hold in bounteous fee , an ample soul  --  Equal the first to know , nor less the last . At once whose general eye surveys as well The rank or desert waste  --  the golden field ; Whose feet the mountain and the valley tread , Nor ever to the trials of the way will yield . Deeper to feel , than quickly to express  --  And then alone in the consummate act  --  Reaps not the ocean , nor the free air tills , But keeps within his own peculiar tract : Confirms the State in all its needful right , Nor strives to draw within its general bound  --  For gain or loss , for glory or distress , The rich man 's hoard , the poor man 's patchy ground . Strip from the trunk that props the empire up , All weeds , all flowers that hide the simple shaft : Plain as the heavens and pure as mid-day light Swell up its ample cope : nor there ingraft A single leaf nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coax the grasper 's hand ; Simple it rose  --  so simple let it rise  --  For ever , changeless simple let it stand ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : X. THE FRIEND . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) In fortune , quality and temper mated  --  Let spirit , spirit choose  --  each suited best To th ' other 's moving mind or mind at rest ; In kinship nearer than red blood related . No castled shadow falls upon the heart , Darkening two faces each turned unto the other , No lowly roof shuts in or out the heart 's true brother : Life deals to each , with equal chance , an equal part . With mutual talk  --  of kingdoms past and gone , Of Rome republic-strong , and emperored Rome , Of Venice in her heart-struck days of doom  --  Old Israel pure , and scarlet Babylon ; Of muniments to guard a free-born State , And ships built proof against the world 's worst shock , Of battles won , white-handed peace to rock The coming age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel of two noble souls ! Where sleeps no lie of thought with art concealed Beneath the blood , nor in the face revealed : Friendship goes oftenest down on secret shoals ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XI . THE PAINTER . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) A spirit moving through the Universe , On Heaven 's errand or his own Nature 's pure behest , Would feed the beauty of his living wings On the free air , and on the sunset bright And on the dawning morn ; should a later quest Detain him far through the heart of night , Some darker tints might creep across the light , Or a chill splendor , of the moonbeams born , Dying in gloom or wakening into morn . Lighting by chance amid the haunts of men  --  Though yearning to get purely forth again  --  Their dusty shouts would not sully , but renew Rather , the glory when it had wandered through . To pause beneath a mountain , should he choose , Its shadows would be portion of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , And , dwelling , once again , within his native coast , The mountain and the sea , the setting sun , The storm , the face of men , and the calm moon Would live again upon the pictured vans and in the glowing crest Of that High Spirit , moving or at rest . Be , thou , oh Painter , various , pure and free , As Heaven 's boundless and wide-wingd minister : Moving abroad , thy spirit let confer With whispering beauty , born of Earth , of Air or Sea . Look on the earth that breaks about thy feet , In valleys and in mountains starry : Look on the woods , amid whose colored bowers , The dark bright seasons , else departed , tarry . See Heaven shining through the pale blue sky On some fair day of dreamy summer , Smiling upon a gentle hour just dead , Or kindling welcome for a gentler comer . Are there no spirits , kin to light and beauty , Springing to cheer these sweet and suited haunts ? Faces of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul thereafter pants ? Fill thou , the mansion of thy Father-land With hues to gladden in its hours of need , With glancing shapes that every fairness breed , And pour a larger life from thy creative hand ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XII . THE SCULPTOR . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Leap up into the light , ye living Forms ! And plant ' mid men your birthright feet ; Angry and fierce as the maned thunder 's storms , And as the lightning beautiful and fleet . Of quick and thoughtful souls the truest thoughts , Born of the marble at Heaven 's happy hour  --  Ye blessed Realities ! who strike the doubts Begot of speech , dumb , with your better power . Human and life-like with no sense of pain , Come forth , crowned heroes of the early age , Chieftain and soldier , senator and sage  --  Benignant , wise and brave again ! Would the soul clothe itself in elder gloom  --  Let stand upon the cliff and in the shadowy grove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb and flushing face , Diffusing Autumn through the stilly place  --  For battle stern , or soothed for love . Or should a spirit of a larger scope Seek to express itself in sacred stone : Cast , life-long , on the mountain-slope Or seat upon the starry mountain-cone , Colossal and resigned , the gloomy gods Eying at large their lost abodes , Towering and swart and knit in every limb , With brows on which the tempest lives , With eyes wherein the past survives ; Gloomy and battailous and grim . Think not too much what other climes have done , What other ages : with painful following , weary , Each step thou takest darkens thy natural sun , And makes thy coming course , thy by-gone , dreary . Let the soul in thee lift its awful front , Facing the Universe that stands before it ; Beaten by day and night and tempests ' brunt , All shapes  --  all glorious passions shall cross o'er it . Forth from their midst some forms will leap That other souls have never disencumbered , And up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people of thy love unnumbered . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XIII . THE JOURNALIST . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) As shakes the canvass of a thousand ships , Struck by a heavy land-breeze , far at sea  --  Ruffle the thousand broad-sheets of the land , Filled with the people 's breath of potency ; A thousand images the hour will take , From him who strikes , who rules , who speaks , who sings ; Many within the hour their grave to make  --  Many to live , far in the heart of things . A dark-dyed spirit he who coins the time , To virtue 's wrong , in base disloyal lies  --  Who makes the morning 's breath , the evening 's tide , The utterer of his blighting forgeries . How beautiful who scatters , wide and free , The gold-bright seeds of loved and loving truth ! By whose perpetual hand , each day , supplied  --  Leaps to new life the empire 's heart of youth . To know the instant and to speak it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sad cloud , To fix upon the unnumbered gazers ' view , Is to thy ready hand 's broad strength allowed . There is an in-wrought life in every hour , Fit to be chronicled at large and told  --  ' T is thine to pluck to light its secret power , And on the air its many-colored heart unfold . The angel that in sand-dropped minutes lives , Demands a message cautious as the ages  --  Who stuns , with dusk-red words of hate , his ear , That mighty power to boundless wrath enrages . Hell not the quiet of a Chosen Land , Thou grimy man over thine engine bending ; The spirit pent that breathes the life into its limbs , Docile for love is tyrannous in rending . Obey , Rhinoceros ! an infant 's hand , Leviathan ! obey the fisher mild and young , Vexed Ocean ! smile , for on thy broad-beat sand The little curlew pipes his shrilly song . Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XIV . THE MASSES . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds that gather at the set of day ; When square and market roar in stormy play , And fields of men , like lions , shake their fells Of savage hair ; when , quick and deep , call out the bells Through all the lower Heaven ringing , As if an earthquake 's shock The city 's base should rock , And set its troubled turrets singing :  --  Remember , Men ! on massy strength relying , There is a heart of right Not always open to the light , Secret and still and force-defying . In vast assemblies calm , let order rule , And , every shout a cadence owning , Make musical the vexed wind 's moaning , And be as little children at a singing-school . But , when , thick as night , the sky is crusted o'er , Stifling life 's pulse and making Heaven an idle dream , Arise ! and cry , up through the dark , to God 's own throne : Your faces in a furnace glow , Your arms uplifted for the death-ward blow  --  Fiery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire the thunder-gun ! Be nothing said and all things done ! Till every cobwebbed corner of the commonweal Is shaken free , and , creeping to its scabbard back the steel , Let 's shine again God 's rightful sun ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XV . THE REFORMER . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Man of the Future ! on the eager headland standing , Gazing far off into the outer sea , Thine eye , the darkness and the billows rough commanding , Beholds a shore , bright as the Heaven itself may be ; Where temples , cities , homes and haunts of men , Orchards and fields spread out in orderly array , Invite the yearning soul to thither flee , And there to spend in boundless peace its happier day , By passion and the force of earnest throught , Borne up and platformed at a height , Where ' gainst thy feet the force of earth and heaven are brought ; Yet , so into the frame of empire wrought , Thou , stout man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fiends or men , are taught And feel the truths by thee delivered . Seize by its horns the shaggy Past , Full of uncleanness ; Heave with mountain cast , Its carcass down the black and wide abyss  --  That opens day and night its gulfy precipice , By faded empires , projects old and dead For ever in its noisy hunger fed : But rush not , therefore , with a brutish blindness Against the ' stablished bulwarks of the world ; Kind be thyself although unkindness Thy race to ruin dark and suffering long , has hurled . For many days of light , and smooth repose , Twixt storm and weathery sadness intervene  --  Thy course is Nature 's ; on thy triumph flows , Assured , like hers , though noiseless and serene . Wake not at midnight and proclaim the day , When lightning only flashes o'er the way : Pauses and starts and strivings towards an end , Are not a birth , although a god 's birth they portend . Be patient therefore like the old broad earth That bears the guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawning light  --  Thy silent hours shall have as great a birth ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XVI . THE POOR MAN . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Free paths and open tracts about us lie , ' Gainst Fortune 's spite , though deadliest to undo : On him who droops beneath the saddest sky , Hopes of a better time must flicker through . No yoke that evil hours would on him lay , Can bow to earth his unreturning look ; The ample fields through which he plods his way Are but his better Fortune 's open book . Though the dark smithy 's stains becloud his brow , His limbs the dank and sallow dungeon claim ; The forge 's light may take the halo 's glow , An angel knock the fetters from his frame . In deepest needs he never should forget The patient Triumph that beside him walks , Waiting the hour , to earnest labor set , When , face to face , his merrier Fortune talks . Plant in thy breast a measureless content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pain , Good Providence , on no harsh purpose bent , Has brought thee there , to lead thee back again . No other bondage is upon thee cast Save that wrought out by thine own erring hand ; By thine own act , alone , thine image placed  --  Poorest or President , choose thou to stand . A man  --  a man through all thy trials show ! Thy feet against a soil that never yielded Other than life , to him that struck a rightful blow In shop or street , warring or peaceful-fielded ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XVII . THE SCHOLAR . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) Bosomed in peace and far apart from crowds  --  Who sits till hands grow wan and eyes grow dim , Pausing his pulse and stirring not a limb , Though paling fast toward the dead man 's shrouds ? ' T is thou , ' t is thou  --  thou foolish scholar 's heart  --  Forgetting round thee what a world there flows , How , ever in and out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its edge , so still , apart . Who thinks that dull dead books have deepest life , Calls them by names of awed delight or gladness , With one or other argues with a joyful madness , And with the tidiest pillows for a wife ? Oh , thou poor , idle moon-struck heart of youth  --  Has the keen air no better wit brought to thee ; This folly in this land will sure undo thee  --  In spite of nobleness and worth , of gentlest truth ! Go cast these follies in the barren sea : Seal up , for ever seal , the hateful leaves , And turn thine eyes where light no more bereaves Their orbs , and lift thine arms up strong and free . Away , away all gentle thoughts shall glide , All happiest fancies night or morning born ;  --  It may be thou wil't feel awhile forlorn , And drop , one day , unmissed , beneath the hurrying tide ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XVIII . THE PREACHER . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length upon the mastered air ! Man-like in form and yet divinely fair , About his head a golden glory glows , And fair as morning every feature shows . His feet are toward the earth , and upward thrown His stretched and yearning arms appeal to God ; With God he talks at that far height  --  with God alone . Athwart all troubles of the day or night or clouds , Athwart eclipse of sun or moon , or the dun tempest 's shrouds  --  Behold that radiant figure streaming , ' Twixt Earth and Heaven , and Heaven and Earth , An angel mighty  --  meek as the swathed infant at its birth , All the mid-region from its gloom redeeming . ' T is Christ , ' t is sacred Christ who there is beaming . Oh , ye who sentried stand upon the temple-wall Holy , and nearer to the glory 's golden fall  --  Moon-like possess and shed at large its rays  --  The wide world knitting in a web of light , Whose every thread the gladd'ning truth makes bright ; Peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in God the good . Withered be he , the false one of the brood , Who , husbandman of evil , scatters strife , Brambling and harsh , upon the field of life : But deeper cursed whose secret hand Plucks on to doom the safeguards of the land , Freedom , and civil forms and sacred Rights That conscience owns : he , conscience-stung , who plights His voice ' gainst these , should sheer-down fall From off the glory of the temple-wall , Smitten by God as false to truth and love And all the sacred links that bind the heavens above And man beneath : a withered Paul , Apostleless , beyond recall ! Rather , with blessings and the bonds of life Let Heaven 's good workman bind together The house that roofs us on this dear , dear plot of earth , An arbor in the genial sun , A stronghold in the tyrannous weather : Kindly and loving brothren every one , All equal  --  all alike who thither tend , Where all may dwell together without end  --  And as our course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink not , therefore , from the coward age , That shows , in mockery shows , its hideous face at times , And crosses with its cursed din the very sabbath-chimes ; O , smite and buffet with a holy rage Its brassy cheeks and brow of icy coldness  --  Dash and confound it with the storm-cloud 's boldness That frowns and speaks till every house-roof trembles , And face to face no more dissembles The God-fear coiled within the crusted heart ! Brandish the truth and let its four-edged dart Cut to the quick , and , cut through every armor , Unbosom to the light the Satan-charmer ! Ye holy Voices sphered in middle air ! Lower than angels , nor as they so fair , Yet quiring God 's behest with truth and power  --  Pitch your blest speech , or high or low , That angels may its language own and know , Through the round Heaven to which it rises , And ever on the earth may fall in glad surprises , The spring-sweet music of a sudden shower . Heaven shall bless thee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark death-hour thou shall spring With fragrant parting , and heaven-cleaving wing  --  To ask , nor ask in vain , thy Christ 's caress ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : XIX . THE POET . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) The mighty heart that holds the world at full , Lodging in one embrace the father and the child , The toiler , reaper , sufferer , rough or mild , All kin of earth , can rightly ne'er grow dull ; For on it tasks , in this late age , are laid That stir its pulses at a thousand points ; Its ruddy haunts a thousand hopes invade , And Fear runs close to smutch what Hope anoints . On thee , the mount , the valley and the sea , The forge , the field , the household call on thee . Men  --  bountiful as trees in every field , Men  --  striving each , a separate billow , to be seen , Men  --  to whose eyes a later truth revealed Dazzling , cry out in anguish quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , To have an utterance adequate and bold  --  Ask that the age 's dull sepulchral stone Back from their Saviour 's burial-place be rolled : All pressing to be heard  --  all lay on thee Their cause , and make their love the joyful fee . There sits not in the wildernesses ' edge , In the dusk lodges of the wintry North , Nor crouches in the rice-field 's slimy sedge  --  Nor on the cold , wide waters ventures forth  --  Who waits not in the pauses of his toil , With hope that spirits in the air may sing ; Who upward turns not , at propitious times , Breathless , his silent features listening : In desert and in lodge , on marsh and main , To feed his hungry heart and conquer pain . To strike or bear , to conquer or to yield , Teach thou ! O , topmost crown of duty , teach What fancy whispers to the listening ear , At hours , when tongue nor taint of care impeach The fruitful calm of greatly silent hearts ; When all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the secret chambers of the soul , All blessed powers of joyful truth are met . Though calm and garlandless thou may'st appear , The world shall know thee for its crownd seer . Mirth in an open eye may sit as well , As sadness in a close and sober face : In thy broad welcome both may fitly dwell , Nor jostle either from its nestling-place . Tears , free as showers , to thee may come as blessed , As smiling , of the happy sunshine born , And cloaked-up trouble , in his turn , caressed Be taught to look a little less forlorn ; Thy heart-gates , mighty , open either way , Come they to feast or go they forth to pray . Gather all kindreds of this boundless realm To speak a common tongue in thee ! Be thou  --  Heart , pulse , and voice , whether pent hate o'erwhelm The stormy speech or young love whisper low . Cheer them , immitigable battle-drum ! Forth , truth-mailed , to the old unconquered field  --  And lure them gently to a laurelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fill all the stops of life with tuneful breath , Closing their lids , bestow a dirge-like death ! Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : WAKONDAH , THE MASTER OF LIFE . from The various writings of Cornelius Mathews ( 1863 ) " We have already noticed the superstitious feelings with which the Indians regarded the Black Hills ; but this immense range of mountains ( the Chippewyan or Rocky Mountains ) which divides all that they know of the world and gives birth to such mighty rivers , is still more an object of awe and veneration . They call it , " The Crest of the World , " and think that Wakondah or the Master of Life , as they designate the Supreme Being , has his residence among these arial heights . "  --  Astoria , Vol . I. , p. 265 . Footnote : 1Kb I. The Moon ascends the vaulted sky to-night ; With a slow motion full of pomp ascends , But mightier than the Moon that o'er it bends A Form is dwelling on the mountain height That boldly intercepts the struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A gloom and dreadful grandeur that aspire To match the cheerful Heaven 's far-shining might . II . Great God ! how fearful to the gazing eye ! Behold the bow that o'er his shoulder hangs , But ah ! winged with what agonies and pangs Must arrows from its sounding bow-string fly ;  --  An arc of death and warfare in the sky . He plants a spear upon the rock that clangs Like thunder ; and a blood-red token hangs , A death-dawn , on its point aspiring high . III . Upon his brow a garland of the woods he wears , A crown of oak leaves broader than their wont ; Above his dark eye waves and dims its brunt  --  Its feathers darker than a thousand Fears  --  A cruel eagle 's plume : High , high it rears , Nor ever did the bird 's rash youth surmount A pitch of power like that o'ershadowed front On which the plume its storm-like station bears . IV . Filled with the glory thus above him rolled  --  How would some Chinook wandering through the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank amazement dumb and cold : How , fear-struck , scan the Spirit 's awful mould ;  --  The gloomy front , the death-dispelling eye , And bulk that swallows up the sea-blue sky  --  Tall as the unconcluded tower of old . V. Transcendant Shape ! But hark , for lo a sound Like that of rivers and of mingled winds Through forests raging ' till the tumult finds Or makes an outlet free from hedge or bound ,  --  Breaks from the Holder of the mountain-ground . Oh , listen sadly to the urgent cry !  --  No mightier shadow of a strength gone by Through the whole perishable Earth is found . VI . The Spirit lowers and speaks : " Tremble ye wild Woods ! Ye Cataracts ! your organ-voices sound ! Deep Crags , in earth by massy tenures bound , Oh , Earthquake , level flat ! The peace that broods Above this world and steadfastly eludes Your power , howl Winds and break ;  --  the peace that mocks Dismay ' mid silent streams and voiceless rocks  --  Through wildernesses , cliffs and solitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands And clap them harshly with a sullen roar ! Ye thousand Pinnacles and Steeps deplore The glory that departs ! Above you stands Ye Lakes with azure waves and snowy strands , A Power that utters forth his loud behest Till mountain , lake and river shall attest The puissance of a Master 's large commands ! " VIII . So spake the Spirit , with a wide-cast look Of bounteous power and cheerful majesty ; As if he caught a sight of either sea And all the subject realm between :  --  Then shook His brandished arms , his stature scarce could brook , Its confine ; swelling wide , it seemed to grow As grows a cedar on a mountain 's brow By the mad air in ruffling breezes took . IX . The woods are deaf and will not be aroused  --  The mountains are asleep , they hear him not , Nor from deep-founded silence can be wrought , Tho ' herded bison on their steeps have browsed : Beneath their banks in darksome stillness housed The rivers loiter like a calm-bound sea ; In anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are spoused . X. Then shone afar Wakondah 's dreadful eyes , With fire and lurid splendor , like the stars That dazzle earth belolding them ;  --  the wars That noble spirits wage with enemies , Flash in his aspect through its cloudy guise ;  --  His tower-high stature quakes in all its parts , And from his brow a mighty sorrow starts  --  A sorrow mightier than the midnight skies . XI . " Oh , wherefore tremble ? Wherefore should I fear Because these creatures now , by chance , are dumb , Nor longer to my bidding with obeisance come ; As when , in times to startle and revere , Templed on high within this cloudy sphere , With wondering worship of the dusky wood  --  The quivered stream , the dark-eyed solitude  --  I stamped my image on the rolling year . XII . " At eve or morn whene'er I walked these hills From ridge to ridge they shook , from peak to peak ; A thousand warrior tribes that dare not speak Lay in my shadow with the awe that chills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a god and thunderer then , Nor bent his bow nor launched his shafts in vain  --  Lord of each power that terrifies or thrills . XIII . " Your dark foundations felt my framing hand ; Nor can your sun-smote summits e'er forget By whom their flood-resisting roots were set  --  By whose clear skill their skyey power was planned . Through all the borders of his throne and fixed his Godhead stand . XIV . " My spirit stretched itself from East to West , With a winged terror or a mighty joy ; And , when his matchless bow-shafts would annoy , I urged the dark red hunter in his quest Of pard or panther with a gloomy zest , And while through darkling woods they swiftly fare  --  Two seeming creatures of the oak-shadowed air , I sped the game and fired the follower 's breast . XV . " Outsounding with my thunder thy loud vaunt , Thou , too , hast known me , mighty Cataract !  --  When rocks in headlong motion thou hast tracked , Like some huge creature goaded from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who makes his foaming way while all around He awes the circuit with a shuddering sound :  --  So ragest Thou and lift'st Thy sounding front ! " XVI . Power crumbles from the arm , and from the brow Glory declines with surety swift as light : Like towers that loose in storms their wondrous might , Dark principalities of air must bow And have their strength and terror smitten low : The hour draws nigh , Wakondah , when on thine Yon full orbed fire unpaled , shall cease to shine Uplifted longer in Heaven 's western glow ! XVII . " Lo ! where our foe up through these vales ascends , Fresh from the embraces of the swelling sea , A glorious , white and shining Deity . Upon our strength his deep blue eye he bends , With threatenings full of thought and steadfast ends , While desolation from his nostril breathes , His glittering rage he scornfully unsheathes And to the startled air its splendor lends . XVIII . " The nation-queller in their length of days  --  The slaughterer of the tribes art thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And wood-born strength reared up amid the maze Of forest walks and unimprisoned ways ;  --  The dwellers in unsteepled wastes ; the host Of warriors stark and cityless , whose boast Was daring proof ' gainst torture that betrays . " XIX . Oh wrestle not , Wakondah , with the Time ; The Time resistless in its present hour Of rugged force , of multitudinous power To make itself triumphant o'er the clime , Where streams are endless , mountains as sublime And valleys shadowy and calm as ever Yet tasked a Godhead 's high and bright endeavor , Since first the world was in its mighty prime . XX . Far through the desert , see his fiery hoof Speeds like the pale white courser of St. John , With rage and dreadful uproar thundering on ! At every step old shadows fly aloof , While on and on he bounds with strength enough To master valley , hill and echoing plain  --  Cheered by the outcry of a savage train Of white-browed hunters armed in deadly proof . XXI . " Through the far shadows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Phantoms of dreadful aspect that arise Cold with the anguish of their wintry fears ; And struggling forth from out a gulf of tears And blood by banded nations vainly shed , Above them all a single Wo its head Lifts high and awes its customary peers . XXII . " I say not now what name that Wo shall bear , What mournful omen on its front is written , What pillared glories by its sad rage smitten  --  Shall fall to earth , and all th ' embracing air With its dread sound of wasting tumult tear ; These are the future 's  --  voiceless let them rest Deep in the shadow of her silent breast , ' Till vengeance bid the sons of men  --  Prepare ! " XXIII . So spake the Spirit ; but I deemed I saw That in the language of his gloomy eye , That made a falsehood of his augury . I know that Heaven is true to its great law ; I know how deep and damnable a flaw Has through its righteous code of truth been rent By erring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that fills my soul with awe . XXIV . And yet , oh God ! I dare to ask of thee Pardon and palmy days for this dear land ; The glory of thy sun , thy shadowing hand , In mercy spread abroad from sea to sea , That all its wide vast empire so may be , From loud Atlantic unto Oregon An orb of power , and never to be won Nor yielded up , a home and fortress to the free ! XXV . " The past is past ! " Wakondah spoke " the past Is past : to others lifeless , cold and dumb Beyond repeal , I bid it 's shadows come Swiftly before me , nor care I how vast That which I gendered shall appear at last As when at first it 's dim colossal form , Huge , rude , mis-shapen , noisy as a storm  --  Rose up , by me called upward and amassed . XXVI . " Falling or rising through the azure air  --  Green dells that into silence stretch away ; Ye woods that counterfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not repair From his wide fount of morning dyes and fair Evening or noon ; innumerous rampant life With which this waste or verdant world is rife  --  As yet were not ; the offspring of a god-like care . XXVII . " Oh , backward how that youthful glory gleams  --  Ye creatures of my undiminished arm , When shadowing hills were lifted like a charm , And at a word their duly measured beams Sprung to their chambers in the mountain seams . This was no task-work , nor a toil of joy Thus an immortal puissance to employ In building worlds and pouring ocean-streams . XXVIII . " Oh ! might and beauty of the forming earth  --  Shaped hy a hand upholding and divine , For such was then Wakondah even thine !  --  With hill and mountain masses bursting forth , And struggling all along the blue-aired North  --  With smiling valleys winding far between , And rivers singing all aloud , though yet unseen : While I , their sire , hung joyous o'er their birth . XXIX . " A fearful and a perilous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world I saw the striving giants swiftly hurled , With thunderous noises to and fro ; a constant line Of furnaced lightnings , ever forced to shine Quick , fierce and kindling through the shapeless gloom , Made the dull void some creature disentomb , And cheered its birth-pangs with a fire benign . XXX . " What voice of portent shook the gulf that held The uncreated majesty of woods , The calm deep beauty of the solitudes Of boundless fields ; and from the deep compelled That Behemoth , whose roar has lately quelled Nations in panoply of arms arrayed ? Amid the sounding mass and undismayed By striving rivers , shock of hills impelled XXXI . " ' Gainst hills and wild beasts raging into light , Wakondah stood , and o'er the tumult bent , It 's Ruler and it 's steadfast firmament . He breaks the bondage of the cruel Night That wraps them in its folds , and like a blight Of storms that rage and thunder but to save And purify , he burst your rock-ribbed grave  --  The matchless Master of redeeming might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the air , From where in speechless majesty he stood  --  On either hand through all the solitude Of glittering peaks and dusky vales , to where The wild beasts held afar their anxious lair  --  A sudden silence like a tempest fell ; A silence and a gloom that none can tell  --  A calm too dread for mortal things to bear . XXXIII . No cloud was on the moon , yet on His brow A deepening shadow fell , and on his knees That shook like tempest stricken mountain-trees , His heavy head descended sad and low : Like a high city smitten by the blow That secret earthquakes strike and toppling falls With all its arches , towers and cathedrals , In swift and unconjectured overthrow . XXXIV . Thenceforth I did not see the Spirit lift Again that night his great discrownd head , Nor heard a voice : He was not with the dead Nor with the living , for the mighty gift Of boundless power was passing like a rift Of stormy clouds that still will have a tongue Ere yet the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift .
