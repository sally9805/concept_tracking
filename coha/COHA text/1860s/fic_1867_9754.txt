" De omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis . " Main text Scene ; a college room . Time ; evening . The Editors of Harvardiana sitting round a table . First Editor ( snatching a paper from one of his brethren . ) Is this a sonnet that I see before me , Its title towards mine eyes ? or is it but An outward semblance of a sonnet , shaped , By the vain dreamings of my tortured brain , From " airy nothing " but to cheat my sense ? I see thee still , and , from thy smiling front , Large scrawls of ink look meekly in my face , In silent eloquence , as if to say " Regard me well ; I am a CONTRIBUTION ! " Second Editor Yes , ' t is a contribution , and myself I took it with these hands from out our box , As I returned , with circular , by names Unsullied , sadly to my room to weep ! Oh ! I have passed a miserable day ! So full of honied " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another such a day Though ' t were to smoke , ( Oh best of earthly joys ! ) , The nicest " real Spanish , " ever made By Yankee ingenuity and art . ' T was but an hour ago , that wreathed in smiles , I placed " the paper " ' neath a Freshman 's nose , And asked , in accents bland , " Will you subscribe ? We need a few great names to head the list ; To sign or not to sign ; that is the question . " Then with my ready pencil poised between My thumb and finger , waited a reply . He started back as if his nostrils snuffed Contamination , " grinned a ghastly grin , " And cried , " I 've seen the work ! " It was enough ; I opened not my mouth , for " I liked not The grinning " humor which that Freshman had ! Oh ' t is a grievous thing to be an Editor ! Men look askance and say , " He hath the ' LIST , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the worst ; " the little dogs and all , Tray , Blanch and Sweetheart , see , they bark at me ! " Third Editor Well , less than this we could not much expect ; " He who ascends the mountain tops , shall find The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow ; He who surpasses or subdues mankind , Must look down on the hate of those below ! " Footnote : 1Kb But gained you not one name ? Second Editor Alas ! not one . Third Editor Gods ! can a single student long debate Which of the two to choose , subscribe or not ? " Oh I could weep ; save that I may not stain With grief " this hour made sacred to the nine . Hast a cigar ? Fourth Editor ( abstractedly ) No , and alas ! no cash To buy them with . I had a fourpence once , A treasured one ; there was the look Of pureness on its venerable cheek , Such as the coiners love to give to their Debased metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never to return . A saddened smile lit its round face , a tear Seemed almost trickling down that long loved cheek ; I saw it slide , slide gently , through the fingers Of the glad Herald boy ; then sternly wiped The woman from my eye , and cried , " I 'm penniless ! " Fifth Editor " ' T was strange , ' t was passing strange , ' t was pitiful , ' T was wondrous pitiful ! " But listen , hark ! ( a voice is heard in the street . ) Devil ( sings ) Where the types are , there are I ; And on costly sheets I lie ; There I couch when cats do cry In the murk night lovingly ; On my bare feet do I fly After " Copy " merrily ! " Merrily , merrily shall I live now " And pick up a living the devil knows how ! Fifth Editor Didst mark that song ? " it had a dying fall , Oh ! it came o'er my ear " like a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Devil COPY ! Copy ! ho ! Fifth Editor ( gives him a bag ) " I tax not you , poor devil , with unkindness ! " Devil If you did , it would be " werry annoying , " as the gemman said ven he vos hung by mistake . Exit
