ARTICLE V.-PRESIDENT WOOLSEY 'S ADDRESS COMMEMORATIVE OF THE LIFE AND SERVICES OF BENJAMIN SILLIMAN , SENIOR , PROFESSOR IN YALE COLLEGE . IT will be but an act of justice to the memory of Professor SILLIMAN , if some one , who can measure accurately his services to science and to education , and his character as a man and a Christian , shall in due time pay him a carefully prepared tribute , which he so well deserves , and express the gratitude of his country to one who has so long commanded universal respect . Such a task I do not propose to myself , but in the expectation that such a task will be undertaken by a more skillful hand , working at leisure on materials which can not be collected at once , I design to limit myself to a brief sketch of the life of Professor SILLIMAN , followed by an equally brief estimate of his services to science , of his career as an ofll*er in Yale College , and of his general character . The fanmily to which Professor SILLIMAN belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ancestors appear among the early inhabitants of the town of Fairfield , soon after the first settlement . His father , Gold Selleck Silliman , a graduate of Yale College of 1752 , was a lawyer in Fairfield , and during the revolutionary war a brigadier-general of the state militia . lie stood high in the confidence of Gov . Trumbull , and was entrusted for a time with the protection of the Long Island coast , which his residence at Fairfield enabled him to have in charge . He commanded the troops that were gathered for the defense of Danbury in the summer of 1777 , when the British , in far superior force , burnt that depot , and when Gen. Wooster , who went over as a volunteer froimi New haven , met his death . In II 780 , a party of British troops landed on the coast and carried off Gen. Silliman as a prisoner . He remain. * ed in captivity six months , until exchanged with Judge Jones of Long Island , whom an expedition from Connecticut seized // and brought off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mother of Professor SILLIMAN , Mary Fish , daughter of Rev. Joseph Fish , who was for fifty years pastor of the second church in Stonington , was the wife first of Rev. John Xoyes , by whom she had two sons , well known as exemplary ministers in this State , and then of Gen. Silliman , by whom she had two sons also ,  --  GoId *Selleck and Benjamin , the former of whom still survives *t the age of eighty-seven . Benjamin , like his namesake of old , was born away from home . The British forces had invaded the coast at New Haven in July , 1779 , and excited that consternation in the towns toward the ' west , which was soon afterwards followed by the burning of Fairfield and Norwalk . The family fled to New Stratford , now Trumbull , and there it was that on the 8th of August , 1779 , our friend first saw the light . At the age of eleven he was left fatherless , and his education devolved upon his mother , who well fulfilled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graduated in the same class with his brother , at the early age of seventeen . Three years afterwards he was called to the tutorship , which office he continued to hold for five years . Dr. Dwight came to the College to preside over its interests in 17*5 , when Mr. SJLLIMAN was a Junior . It was one of the great blessings of his life , and was by him so regarded , that he fell under the influence of this eminent man , whose shining qualities attracted him , and who took an unusual interest in his welfare . For Dr. Dwight Mr. SILLIMAN retained , until the close of life , a most unbounded respect and attachment , and probably no other man did so much for the cultivation of his mind and heart . Having tested his capacity to teach and govern by several years of trial in the office of Tutor , Dr. Dwight proposed to him , in 1802 , to leave the law which lie had been studying , and for the practice of which lie was now ready , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History . But the project of establishing such a chair was not entirely new here , for in September , 1798 , the President and Fellows voted , " that a professorship of Chemistry // and Natural History be instituted in this College , as soon as the funds shall be sufficiently productive to support it . " This appearing to be the case in 1802 , the board proceeded to establish the professorship by the following resolution : " that it is expedient to elect for a Professor of Chemistry and Natural History , some person of competent talents , giving him such time to give his answer , whether he will accept such appointment or not , as he may desire , and as may be agreed upon between him and the Corporation . " The Corporation being led to the choice of a Professor of Chemistry and Natural History in this College , on the positions of the foregoing vote , BENJAMIN SILLIMAN , Esq. , was declared chosen . " Part of the next year was spent by Mr. SILLIMAN in Philadelphia , as a pupil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funds were appropriated by the Corporation for the purchase of apparatus . The next year , also , was in part spent at the same place in chemical studies , and in part , after his return , in the delivery of a course of lectures . A fuller course occupied the early months of 1805 . It was in the spring of this year that he left the country , by consent of the academic authorities , to study the physical sciences abroad . He was absent fourteen months . In these months he attended courses of lectures in London and Edinburgh , traveled in different parts of England , and made an excursion across the channel , which , however , was cut short by the restrictions imposed under Napoleon upon persons visiting the continent from England . Few persons from this land then traveled either in England or on the continent , and fewer still had so good an opportunity to see men and things of interest . Accordingly , when , a year or two after his return , Mr. SILLIMAN published his journal of travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was received with a warm welcome in all quarters . I well remember what an engaging book it was for inc in my boyhood , and how I became acquainted with and learned to reverence such men as Wilberforce , whom the author introduces to his readers . This work of travels passed through a second edition a number of years afterwards , and in // 1865.1 Prof. Benjcunin Sillimctn , Senior . 135 1820 an account of a journey from hartford to Quebec opened Canada to the reader , which was then almost an unknown land . Professor SILLIMAN returned from England in 1806 , and began those instructions in chemistry and mineralogy , which he continued to give ever afterwards , whilst he remained an officer of Yale College . Geology , I believe , was added as a third branch of instruction , somewhat later . The course in cheinistry extended through the fall term and into the winter ; in the latter part of the winter term the lectures on mineralogy began ; and in the first half of the summer term the geological lectures closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence until he visited Europe for the second time in 1851 , with the exception that the lectures in chemistry of 1823-24 were given by another person , on account of the temporary failure of Professor SILLIMAN 5 health . Let us now leave him in this life-work where Providence has placed him , rejoicing in his pursuits and spreading the same pleasure through his audiences , gathering yearly fresh and increasing tributes of homage and respect from the public , most happy in his domestic and academic life ,  --  let us leave him here in this onward flow of years , and look at him as a man of science , a college officer , a man and a Christian . In attempting to judge of the services which Prof. SILLIMAN has rendered to science , we must remember at how low a point the physical sciences stood in this country at the beginning of his career , and , especially , what slender help this college could give to one who wished to explore the secrets of nature . Chemistry was then in its infancy ; the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally immature ; and geology could scarcely be said to exist at all . No preparation for study in these departments was made except through the study of natural philosophy in imperfect text-books . The college had no collections , scarcely a retort , only minerals enough to fill a candle-box . In this state of things a young man was induced , by the advice of Dr. Dwight , to enter the unknown field , who had been prepared for another calling , and prepared to shine in it by // personal advantages such as few possess . After he had completed his tutorship he must qualify himself for a science of which he had not learned the rudiments , and in which there were here , if I am not deceived , ahnost no books and no smattering of knowledge . He also took upon him the duty of leading students over wide fields . Chemistry during his active life ran into almost infinite details , demanding exclusive study to inaster them ; mineralogy , with its beautiful doctrine of crystallization , was constantly building itself up ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands upon all its sisters , upon chemistry , zoology , botany , and began to write out a history of the earth , stretching back into inconceivably distant ages . In such wide fields , at a time when every year revealed new treasures of nature , and when man was continually forming combinations of elementary bodies , of which nature had prepared no pattern , a young professor could not be an explorer , he could scarcely grasp what was thrown into his hands by the developments of science . We do not claim for Mr. SILLIMAN the discovery of any great laws in the kingdom of nature ,  --  that , in his circumstances , was almost out of the question . Nor do we claim any more genius and skill in original investigation than many others have possessed . What then are his titles to respect as a man science ? They are these : 1 . He was almost the pioneer and the father in this country of the three branches in which he gave instruction . The same honor is due to him on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once his colleague in the college faculty - for the impulse which he gave by his enterprise and zeal to biblical studies . And thus to open the way in any science or discipline , useful to man , is a most valid title to the respect and the gratitude of posterity . It is easy to follow in a trodden path , but the originator of a science and the first inculcator of it-these have a difficult part to play ; amid uncertainties and discouragements , with few to cheer them by sympathy , sustained by their own inward convictions chiefly , and warmed by their own inward fires , they are not so much the leaders of the ranks in a conquest over nature , as they are single champions , fighting alone , and unaided by the countenance // and prowess of others , until they have first won for themselves their hardest victories . 2 . But this position of a pioneer and a pathbreaker would have told but little on the interests of science , if it had not been seconded by enthusiasm and by the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . Mr. SILLIMAN was thus an eminent means of diffusing the physical sciences , of giving them their due place in the American system of education , and of commending them to the regards of the people . As a lecturer he was almost unsurpassed . Without a severe logical method , he threw so much zeal into his discourse , expressed himself , with such an attractive rhetoric , and supported his doctrine by experiments of such almost unfailing beauty and success , that all audiences delighted to hear him ; so that for years no lecturer so attractive could address an assembly , whether gathered within the walls of a college or from the people of crowded cities . In his own lecture room the students felt the genial sway of his oratory . No other such instructions were given , uniting at once pleasure and improvement . Hence for many years the study of chemistry was , perhaps , the most popular one in the institution . In the latter years of his professional life the science of geology seemed to take the largest share of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject matter seemed especially fitted to kindle and exalt his fervor . The mighty agencies that have moulded the earth over and over , as clay is moulded in the hands of the potter , the unmense ages which almost appal the imagination , this vast framework of the earth the theatre of such sublime displays , and over all , before the eye of faith , the divine architect carrying the great building forward , until it had become a fit dwelling-place for his immortal creature , man , *-these grand objects inspired him , and he threw the inspiration into his audiences , wherever they were gathered . In the years between 1835 and 1840 he gave courses of lectures in quite a number of the large towns in the United States , from Boston as far west and south as St. Louis , New Orleans , and Mobile . Tie was also invited to deliver the Loweli // lectures about the same time . Treated everywhere with the highest consideration , welcomed by the numerous Sons of Yale dispersed through this broad land , he had almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a taste for physical science . 3 . But , again , outside of the lecture-room , by his investigations and through the press , his services to science were great . He made , indeed , no signal discoveries iu his departments , but his laboratory was by no means idle . Tn 1807 , when the meteorite fell at Weston , in this State , he , with Professor Kingsley , went to the spot and gave an account of it , and lie afterwards subjected one of the fragments to an analysis . A few years afterward he made experiments on the fusibility of bodies with the compound blow-pipe of Dr. Hare , his long tried friend . His success in fusing a number of bodies supposed to be infusible before was made known in a memoir read before the Connecticut Academy . In 1822 , he instituted a series of experiments with the galvanic battery , and established the fact of a transfer of particles of charcoal from the charcoal point at one pole to the other pole of the battery ; and in his various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the press also , Professor SILLIMAN was a most useful diffuser and fosterer of the sciences to which he was devoted . When he began his course there were few books accessible in chemistry or mineralogy in this country . In 1822 , he procured , if I am not deceived , the republication of Henry 's Chemistry , and in 1829 , that of Bakewell 's Geology , which he enriched by notes of his own . In 1830 , appeared his own text-book on Chemistry , in two octavo volumes . But the Journal of Science , which has now continued to be published for forty-six years , and which has not yet lost his name , although he has long had no active part in it , gives the best proof of his enterprise and his love for science . This journal , edited by himself for twenty years , and then in conjunction with his son for eight more , with whom Professor Dana was afterwards associated , soon become the leading organ of science in the United States ; but it was long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senior . whether it could maintain itself and would not involve its editor in pecuniary embarrassments . The zeal and courage of Mr. SILLIMAN , after years of loss , in keeping up this journal , when his own editorial labors were uncompensated and the debts for printing had to be provided for , are worthy of the highest praise . He did persevere until it was secure against failure , and was supported by scientific readers through the country . The reputation and eclat which Mr. SILLIMAN acquired in chemistry and geology were of the highest use to his own college . It is beyond doubt that many came here , because he was here ; and he succeeded in inspiring many with a zeal for the one or the other of these departments , who have since reflected honor upon the college and the country . Among the services which he rendered at once to science and to his alma mater was the acquisition by purchase of the Gibbs Cabinet , then altogether the best collection of minerals in our country . Col. Gibbs , a Rhode Islander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. SILLIMAN , to deposit his specimens here , and rooms had been provided for them in one of the college buildings . But the time came when it was necessary that they should be sold , and in order to secure them for Yale College , the friends of the institution had to be appealed to for the sum of $20,000 . Mr. SILLIMAN undertook this task with the greatest zeal and assiduity , made most of the solicitations , I believe , himself , and succeeded in his object . The cabinet over which he fondly watched , and which was enlarged by his correspondence with other collectors and by donations , will be a memorial for him through all time . But it was not on this occasion only that his voice was lifted up and his influence used for the benefit of Yale College . His personal presence , his great popularity , his fine powers of persuasion , caused him to be put forward whenever there were wants to be urged , before the legislature or before private friends , whenever strangers of distinction were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the authorities of the institution . There were , I beieve , in the universities of the middle ages orators annually appointed , // who represented their communities on public occasions . He , in his prime , was our stauding orator , the principal medium between those who dwelt in the academic shade and the great public . A very important duty of Professor SILLIMAN grew out of his function as a member of the college faculty . For more than fifty years he sat and voted in that Faculty , aided in discipline as well as instruction , and being the senior professor , had a prominent place in all Facnlty measures . Dr. Dwight , without doubt , would not have selected him for the new professorship , unless his clear eye had discovered in him the poWer of governing and controlling ; and his career as a tutor must have been satisfactory . When he took the professor 's chair , no especial part of the college discipline fell on him , he had no care of a division , and hence had less direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers exercised . It was natural therefore that he should think less of rules than those whose business it is to enforce them . But his influence was all exerted in favor of discipline and order : especially , where insubordination and combination to resist law was rife , as happened more than once between thiri*y and forty years ago , he was a tower of strength to the government . His influence , again , as a man upon those students whom he knew or who were committed to his special care , was often exceedingly happy . It is but a few months ago that a gentleman of high standing in one of our large cities told me how Professor SILLIMAN had saved him from waywardness and disgrace , and how an attachment was thus begun which had never been weakened . Many such ties were established with young persons who are now prominent men in various parts of this land , and who , when they get the news of his death , will feel that a guide and a true friend has passed away . Success so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admiration , imply a very happily constituted personal character . His mind was of the rhetorical , not of the analytical cast . He was a man of practical judgments , and not drawn by his native leanings into abstruse speculations ; and hence he was better qualified to act directly // upon mankind . His perceptions were qnick , his taste good , his tact exquisite . Few men are better fitted to shine in society than he . To a most commanding person , an engaging countenance , and an admirable carriage , he nuited that ease and affability which are the product of self-respect and kindness united . Fond of admiration , yet not led by it into the slightest disposition to depress others below their true level , he at once found his enjoyment in the good will of others , and showed entire good will towards them . He was , among all the men who have lived in this city during the present century ,  --  as I think will be conceded by everybody ,  --  the most finished gentleman . And this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it pertained not to his exterior , but to his character and his soul . It was founded on a high sense of honor , a delicate perception of what was due to others , and was due from them to him . His dignity of manner was not so much modeled after the old style , which the gentlemen of the days before the Revolution handed down , as it ran back into dignity of character ; it proceeded from a self-valuation , which , without being assuming , takes the right place , neither depriving others of what is their due , nor being afraid to occupy a position which is fairly one 's own . But the radical essential trait of his gentlemanly character was gentleness and kindness . This led him to study the pleasure , to respect the feelings of those in whose society he was placed ; and this , whether they were high or low in the world . For the poor , the dependent , the young , the undistinguished ,  --  for all , he had a good word ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of the truth that lay in the heart . Hence all loved him . It could not be that with manners and a bearing like this , manifesting unusual kindness of nature , Professor SILLIMAN should not enter with grace and beauty into all the circles of life . Among his fellow-citizens , while all gave him that respect which was due to his person and character , he aroused something more than distant respect , for his kindness brought all men near to him , and took away a sense of distance even from the humblest . Among his colleagues he moved in unbroken harmony of intercourse , not to mention that nearer intercoQrse // Jan. , Prof. Benjamin Silliman , Senior , of more than half a century subsisting between him and those earlier associates of his , one of whom left us more than ten years ago , and the other survives to follow the remains of his earliest friend to the grave this day. * As a friend he was considerate , kind , ready to make efforts and sacrifices to serve his friends and promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all that a wife and children could desire . His home was a happy home , and as his children , with their children , came back to the old house , he was ever the bright center of the circle . For his only brother he ever cherished the warmest attachment . Letters were interchanged almost weekly ; and in the last but one , under the date of November 8th , he writes , " I love frequent responses , especially as the time approaches when a surviving brother may call , but no brother 's voice will answer , until we shall be reunited in heaven . " This great kindliness of character rested on a base of sincere religion . It is not known when he was first called to consider his condition as a sinner before God , or when and in what way he was led to the faith and hope of a Christian . Without any distinctly marked experience , it is supposed , and without knowing when his religious life began , he came forward , when he was a tutor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communion of Christians . He is thus the oldest member but one of the College Church . I am permitted to make an extract from a private paper of his , which he drew up on the with of September , 1802 , the day on which he first partook of the Lord 's Supper . " This day , " he writes , " I intend with the permission and assistance of the good Spirit of God , to give myself up publicly , in a perpetual covenant , with God as my Father , with Jesns Christ as my Saviour , and with the Holy Spirit as my Sanctifier. 0 Thon Triune God , my Creator , my Redeemer , and my Sanctifier , accept me in the covenant of grace ; dispose of me according to thy own good pleasure ; employ me in thy service ; save me in thy own way ; and // enable me to perform with fidelity the solemn act of publicly committing my soul into thy hands . Not because T am assured of my soul 's health do I thns resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it is but faint and glimmering , that God has accepted of my soul , which was early given up to him in baptism by my pious parents , one of whom I trust his father , is now singing the song of Moses and the Lamb , and the other , I trust , is fast ripening for heaven ; nor can I entirely despair that the secret act of self-dedication which has been performed in my closet , has been regarded by Him who searcheth the heart and trieth the reins . 0 , my Redeemer , when I this day for the first time take the bread , the sacred symbol of thy flesh , which was torn for my sins , and drink the wine , that sacred symbol of thy blood , which was shed for my sins , may I be melted with grief for my sins , warmed with gratitude for thy disinterested love , and elevated in hope by the remembrance that my Redeemer liveth , and that I shall stand before him at the last day . " Then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document from which an extract or two will illustrate his religious feelings and principles . It bears the date of Sept. 11th , 1803 . " On that day I vowed not only to resign all sinful inclinations , but to resign friends and even life , should God call me so to do . I promised , as far as possible , to work out my own salvation , but with fear and trembling , humbly hoping for the blessing of God , without which ii can do nothing . " Then he speaks of the mercies of the year , and among the rest , that he has received an appointment which will afford him a comfortable and honorable support , with the prospect of extensive usefulness to the . young and to his country . *Then , after lamenting his ingratitude and coldness , he closes as follows : . * 0 Heavenly Father , I implore thine aid through the Spirit of truth ,  --  should my life be spared another year  --  to enable inc to live more agreeably to the character of a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own solemn professions ; and wilt thou assist me this day to renew my covenant with thee , and having renewed , to keep it inviolate . " The religions life , the public profession of which was marked // by such serious purposes , flowed on in a consistent and blameless course until the end . To the interests of religion in the college and elsewhere his heart was ever open . He often introduced religious reflections and religious counsel into his lectures . He carried his religious principles with him into every circle , and although a most polite man and most careful not to hurt the feelings of others , was not afraid or unwilling to avow himself everywhere a Christian . He was a warm and earnest advocate of those measures of reform by which young persons may be kept and others rescued from destroying indulgences . He rejoiced in any signs that religion was getting firmer hold of the students . He reverenced the Sabbath . He was a devout man , one who morning and evening prayed in his family , and who steadfastly communed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religiously , and , as the blessing of God on the family training , saw them all walking in the steps of Christ . He was a believing man ; one who was perhaps never disturbed by those doubts which now harass so many ; one who was neither fond of abstruse religious speculation , nor needed that his faith should have the support of reasoning , but rested his faith on the simple word of God , and was content to rest there . He was a believing man , and amid all the contradictions that physical science seems to utter against revelation , he held with a firm hold on the records of the Old Testament , and was not shaken by the revelations of his favorite study of Geology . He was a trustful man ; leaning like a little child on the word and promises of God , and the more childlike in his trust , as he advanced in years . He was also a hopeful man ; apparently not afraid to die , but accustomed to commit himself into the hands of Christ with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the evening of his life especially he seemed to have been much affected by the goodness of God . On his birthday , August 8 , 1863 , lie writes thus in a paper of private devotion : " *y life has been prolonged to four-score years and four ; I trust , Heavenly Father , that I am deeply grateful for this long life , full of mercies , although very imperfectly requited to thee , by the obedience due from a humble being to my great Benefactor . To recite my mercies would be to recount the // story of my life . " Then he makes mention of his sins , and after speaking of the Saviour 's life on earth , closes thns " This ) 0 heavenly Father , is the Saviour in whom we trust . His death on the cross assures our hopes of salvation . " And he closes his reflections on his last birthday in the same strain : " I can only repeat that my sole dependence for salvation rests upon the blessed iRedeemer , who appears to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall receive my discharge from this life , to enter on the endless future . " A life built up on such foundation , and animated by such feelings , was a life of probity and of usefulness . Nor can it be doubted that the spirit of the gospel influenced his manners and presided over his intercourse with others ; that formed as he was by nature to be courtly and gentlemanly , he was made by his religion a truer gentleman than he would have been without it , that he was more anxious to serve others , more regardful of their feelings , more kind to those who could render him no kindness in return . On the other hand , his religious principle made him more indignant at meanness and baseness , more intolerant of oppression and wrong . Thus his life of usefulness and happiness passed on , until in 1853 he resigned his professorship in Yale College . A little before this , in 1851 , he accompanied his son and some other friends on a visit to Europe , taking a look at England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and traveling for the first time through France , Switzerland , Italy , and Sicily . An account of this visit to Europe from his pen , appeared in 1853 . In 1852 his old friend , Professor Kingsley , was called away ; - one of those two associates with whom he had been in the most intimate connection for more than half a century . In 1853 his son was put into the chair of chemistry , as in 1850 his son-in-law , Professor Dana , had been selected for that of geology ; but as these two gentlemen could not immediately enter into the active duties of their professorships , he continued to give lectures in both departments until 1855 , when he retired altogether from instruction and discipline in the college . And thus the last link , which bound the times of Dr. // Dwight with these times , was severed . The three men who had been the permanent officers in company with that distinguished man , who had with him borne the burden of college affairs , and mainly sustained the institution after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except through the pupils they had raised up . It is pleasant , as we look back on the history of the college , to commemorate their unbroken friendship for each other . Most unlike in their qualities of mind , their traits of character , their tastes and their pursuits , they yet were united together in close bonds , respected and loved one another , rejoiced in each other 's successes , and acted in uniform harmony . Had there been dissensions in this small Faculty , had either of them broken the laws of friendship and forbearance , our college could not have reached its present prosperity . The eleven years of Professor SmLIM*N 's retirement from academic labors were passed in singular peace and domestic happiness . God did not him off in the time of old ao'e cast nor forsake him when his strength failed , but rather increased his greatness aud comforted him on every side . Years before he had experienced domestic affliction ; he had lost a son of fond hopes , and soon after , at brief intervals , three other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children , had been taken away from him . But in these years , since 1853 , his immediate family circle continued unbroken . His dwelling was between that of his son and his son-in-law , who were carrying on the torch of science which he had first lighted . He received frequent visits from his other children , and saw them filling honorable and useful stations in society . His grandchildren multiplied around him , gladdening him by their cheerful faces , and rendering to him that love which he was so well able to awaken in the young . As a veteran of science , a man who had acted an important part in* the world , a friend of religion and morality , a man of courtesy and gentleness , he was welcome in all circles ; his fellow-citizens honored him ; multitudes whom he had educated or had known in earlier life , called upon him as they passed through the city . his health and vigor continued to a good degree unimpaired ; he could // be present steadily in the house of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was rarely disabled from seeing and mingling with his friends . Of friends , his immediate vicinity was full , and among the rest two gentle men of great worth , whom he had known from their college life af the beginning of the century and onward , established themselves in his neighborhood , and were on terms of close friendship with him . There was nothing in his circumstances to annoy him or to excite apprehension for the future . His days passed happily away in private reading and composition , in intercourse with his family and with other friends , and in correspondence with friends abroad . He had none of the moroseness which is charged on old age ; but the spirit of kindness , only more tender than ever , the spirit of piety , only more hopeful and childlike , shed a lustre on the evening of his happy and honorable life . It is pleasant and profitable here to put on record the feelings which he had in regard to the events through which the country has passed for the last ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiesced in that policy which sought to conciliate the South , and to keep the peace by half-way measures . But when atrocious wrongs began to be committed in Kansas , his sense of justice was violated , his indignation was aroused , and with many others among us , he felt that a crisis was coming on in which a man must be either against the slave power or against the country . For his sympathy with sufibring Kansas , strongly and publicly expressed , he received numerous letters of remonstrance or of vituperation from former acquaintances in the southern country . But his convictions were strong ; nothing moved him , and events only confirmed his judgments . Since the breaking out of the rebellion he has been most earnest in his support of the government ; and most desirous to have the plague of slavery removed from all our borders . He has been most hopeful , also . It is remarkable , that while our younger men have been anxious and sometimes despondent , our old men of wisdom and religious principle have been full of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // divine counsels , and attained " to something of prophetic strain , " and their heart drank in courage from the manifest protection of the Almighty pervading our past history . Such was he , when , a few days ago , on the evening of the 13th of the present month , he attended a service on behalf of the Sanitary Commission . The house was crowded and the night air chill , and he thought he had taken a little cold ; in the evening of the next day he was seized with sharp pains in the chest , which were afterwards transferred to the space between his shoulders and to the back part of his head . This was followed by fever and other symptoms of some disturbance . He was ill all the week , but seemed to be regaining his usual health . On the 20th , which was Sunday , he was not well enough to be present at public worship . On this day he wrote in his journal as follows : " Nov. 20th . I am not able to attend public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ n*y time usefully at home . " I am warned by this occurrence , that my health , although usually so good , may be in an instant subverted , and that the call for departure may be sudden , as has happened to Mr. Elton of Waterbury , and others during the week . I leave time and manner with my Creator , relying entirely upon Christ Jesus , my ever blessed Saviour , to rescue me from the power and condemnation of sin . Again , on the 21st , Monday last , he writes : " I have been able to resume my pen and am gradually recovering my usual state of feeling , but the shock has been severe , and to an old man serious . As the cause is apparent , I must avoid , in future , exposure to a cold night air , which brought on the attack ;  --  the next may fasten on the lungs or the heart , and may prove fatal . " These were , I believe , the last entries in his journal . Through Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends , and he intended on Thursday to be at the thanksgiving gathering of his family circle , which was to be at Professor Dana 's . On the morning of this day-and here I use chiefly the words of another-he awoke at an early // hour , having had a good night 's rest . After remarking upon the return of Thanksgiving day , and the many reasons for gratitude to God , he gave utterance , as his custom was , to a prayer , in which he rendered thanks for his returning health and strength , and prayed for his children and grandchildren , and especially for his son absent in California . He then requested Mrs. Silliman to repeat the Lord 's Prayer . He also spoke of the causes for national gratitude , rejoicing that the nation had been permitted to unite in elevating again to the presidency a man who had proved himself so true , so honest , and so upright in conducting the affairs of the government as Mr. Lincoln . He then repeated five verses of the fifth Psalnzi , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning thou shalt hear My voice ascending high , " and also asked to have another hymn said . " Come , Holy Spirit , Heavenly Dove , " was then repeated . Calling attention now to the improved clearness and strength of his voice , he said that he should be able to have more extended family worship than he had been able to have for a few days past , and proposed that one of David 's psalms of thanksgiving should be read , when the family should be assembled . He then enquired if it would be prudent for him to attend church that day , expressing a desire to go , if it were advisable . in a protracted conversation he spoke most affectionately of his wife and children , and just after he had uttered words of endearn*ent to Mrs. Silliman , she noticed a sudden change of countenance : a slightly heavy breath followed , and he was gone . What a happy death , a thousand voices have said , since the news of his death went abroad , and I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die without pain , in a momnent , with no warning , when a long life had been making preparation for , death . What a happy death , to die with expressions of affection to the members of his family on his lips ,  --  happy for him that the last moments of life were filled // with love , happy for them that he left them such a precious testament . What a happy death , to die almost in the act of giving thanks , to have the praises of Thanksgiving day suddenly broken off only that they might be renewed with one more cause of thankfulness in the Father 's mansion on high . " We that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened ; not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life . " But such a death is almost a clothing of what is mortal with immortal life .
