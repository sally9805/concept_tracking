THE Missouri River divides the Continent midway between ocean and ocean . Yet , though Plymouth Rock took its place in history two and a half centuries ago , it is only within the past few years that the atlases have yentureci to indicate more of the vast unexplored region that stretched away from its western shores to the far Pacific , than did those old maps of Africa , where Geographers , on vacant downs , Put elephants in place of towns . A buffalo , an Indian , a range of mountains , the words " Great American Desert , " stood for all that range of country , which , till the wonderful exodus from Nauvoo , only a few scouts and trappers ever penetrated . An unknown land of mystery and romance . To-day , the geographer may supplant all former symbols by the four letters " U. P. R. R. ; " initials as potent on a line of a thousand miles west of the Missouri as were ever S. P. Q. R. in Rome 's palmiest days ; initials which have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest the possible danger that the Republic may repeat the history of some of the individual States , and submit to the irresponsible tyranny of monopolies . When reconstruction and the financial derangement caused hy the Rebellion , have been settled , one great practical political question will be , whether individual liberty and a republican form of government can coexist with these mammoth railroad corporations ? A question worthy the immediate consideration of those philosophers who , in their closets , map out the politics of the future . A government that rules a large extent of territory must have the means of ranid communication throughout its dominions . The Romans understood this , and so followed their conquering armies with broad , enduring highways , that , throughout the civilized world , it passed into a proverb that " all roads lead to Rome . " Twenty years ago , Thomas H. Lenton , the great Senator of the West , realizing the nece ssitv of more rapid transit , if the Pacific coast was to be held , proposed the building of a national railroad to the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Sierras impassable . On the very day of the passage of the ordinance of secession by South Carolina-the 20th of December , t36o  --  the House of Representatives passed the first bill authorizing the building of a railroad to the Pacific . Its passage , on this day , was largely owing to the strenuous exertions of the distinguished publicist , Samuel 13 . Rug oles of New York , who urged the members to signalize the day hy this evidence of their confidence in the perpetuity of the Republic ; and , also , at this first moment of danger , to begin at once ib work , which would create new bonds of union between the different parts of the country . A stately Corinthian column of the temple of constitutional liberty trembled to its fall ; but the watchful curators of the building , nowise dismaye // 667 BY RAIL TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS . threw out a mighty buttress , which should strengthen the walls and bind the masonry . In this fact was hid the whole story of the result . A people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan such a colossal enterprise , must needs he invincible to any attack of plotting traitors . Too many of the secessionists then lingered in the Senate to permit the passage of the bill , and the road  --  the conception of enlightened patriotism , delayed , but not defeated , by the enemies-owes its creation to the same patriotic zeal which shrank from no sacrifice to preserve that common country , of which this great work is at once evidence and security . The imperative need of a connecting road with the Pacific slope induced the offer of such terms as , in fact , makes the country the real builder of the road and entitled to the credit of its construction , without , however , detracting from the credit due to the actual managers and executors of the enterprise , or the courage , energy , and ability , they have so conspicuously shown ; but for these qualities , the aid of the Government , munificent as it was , would have been useless . I have no space to detail the story of their trials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A well-built railroad , well supplied with rolling stock , and having substantial depots and repair shops at needed points , runs now from Omaha to a point between seven and eight hundred miles west . It has already crossed the Rocky Mountains , and , on meeting the Central Road , running east from Stockton , California , xviii open for through traffic to the Pacific ; and much sooner than is generally anticipated . The Union Pacific Railroad , having , in accordance with the conditions , first reached the iooth parallel of latitude west , became entitled to the grants which had been offered to the competing roads . First , the right of way and all lands needed for buildings ; second , each alternate section of land , twenty miles on each side the track , as a free gift . This is equal , in territory , to a continuous belt twenty miles wide to the Pacific , and amounts to fourteen millions and eighty thousand acres of land . For three hundred miles west of the Missouri , the road runs through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the mountains , the mineral treasures are believed to be vast ; coal , of good quality , has been found in abundance . In addition , the bonds of the Government are loaned to the road-in all , amounting to $29,328,000 for i , ioo miles . These bonds are advanced on the completion and acceptance by Government commissioners of each twenty miles of the road . Government permits the company to issue first mortgage bonds to an equal amount , taking itself a second mortgage . It pays for all Government transportation one-half in cash , crediting the other half toward the loan of the bonds . The amount saved to Government during 1867 in the difference between the cheaper transportation by rail and the contract xvagon prices , amounted , according to the quartermaster 's report , to $1,925,839 . National soldiers guard the road against Indian attacks . To form a just idea of the real magnitude of this undertaking at the beginning , it must be remembered that the country itself supplied neither workmen nor material ; it was unexplored and full of hostile Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa . Everything had to be wagoned from there , one hundred and fifty miles to the Missouri , and then , as now , ferried across the river . All the xvorkmen , all the machinery , all the material , had to be brought from the far distant East ; while , pushing west , the surveying parties were harassed and sometimes killed by the Indians . // Nov. , Men have wondered how the Egyptians transported the material for their pyramids and obelisks , and it took France , with all her resources , many months to bring one of the smallest of these obelisks from the Nile to the Seine . Yet here , quietly , within the past three years , Americans have done a more wonderful and far grander work . So quietly none knew of it till the difficulties had been overcome , and the incredulity of the country was startled by the statement that , out in the Rocky Mountains , the Union Pacific Company was building a railroad at the wonderful speed of three miles a day Here will be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly successful efforts of the Mormons . Civilization was wont to make slow progress , creeping along in emigrant wagons on the trail of trappers and hunters , and leaving behind her more valuable possessions , as too cumbersome ; and so , by slow degress , has moved , cautiously and painfully , over half the Continent . Now a new era begins . The locomotive , pushing out into the new country , bears with it all the essentials of civilization ; and towns and cities rise up in a day ; States spring forth full panoplied ! Nebraska sets her star upon the flag , and Wyoming steps forth , the youngest of the territories . " U. P. R. R. " is seen on the signs in the street , on the mules and horses , on cars and depots ; and " U. P. R. R. " occupies the thoughts and employs the energies of almost every earnest man west of the Missouri . Soon it will write its magic sign along the shores ot the Pacific , and bring back the spoils of the Orient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations have contended for-the trade of the East . Reaching with its branches to Colorado , Montana , Idaho , Oregon , and Washington , it will carve out new States , and control their destinies . It will soon have it in its power to control the election of twenty Senators . Said I not truly that the geographer might well substitute upon his map , its initials , for the vague symbols with which he made ignorance picturesque ? Thirteen years ago , the Indian title to the land on the west bank of the Missouri was extinguished . At the spot opposite Council Bluffs , the Mormons crossed , and struck westward over the Plains . The emigrant trail took the same route  --  the path the Indians had always taken-along the valley of the Platte , and by degrees a settlement grew up on the river bank to supply the needs of the emigrants . The situation is so lovely , that it seems as if nature had foreseen the day when civilization should come and demand of her a place for settlement , and had prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , the bluffs are some five miles back from the river 's edge , and the stream makes a grand sweep around the meadows . On the west bank , there are two plateaux , one lifted by a steep rise of some fifty feet , both affording ample room for all business purposes . A mile back , the bluffs rise abruptly about a hundred feet above the river , and trending south-east , strike the river boldly some two or three miles below , thus encircling the town like an amphitheatre , and offering the finest sites for private residences , some of which are already nestled along their wooded slopes . The view from the top of the bluff near the old capitol building , is very extensive ; looking north the eye can trace the river , far-sweeping with majestic curves , and the distant bluffs , with bare ravines looking seamed and time-worn , and having the effect of high mountains seen at a great distance , there being nothing to contrast them with , but the prairie meadows from which they abruptly rise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually receding bluffs , the houses crowning them , and the town stretching down at our feet ; the near and the distant view , all combine and harmonize into a scene very rare in this flat western country , and one which recalled in many of its features one of the loveliest in the land , the view from Round Hill , Northampton , Mass . Only in the modern style of the better class of dwellings , and in the smallness of the cottonwood trees which fringe every door-yard , do you get any idea of the newness of the place . It looks very like an eastern town of the same size ; has handsome blocks of stores equal to those of any city , and some very substantial and elegant private residences . It counts sixteen thousand inhabitants , though three years ago there were but three thousand-its growth in ten years . We have come to see the Union Pacific Railroad , and her.e is its starting point ; and this City of Omaha is its creation . It is a promising , prosperous little city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamers from its levees two thousand miles north , and two thousand miles south to the Gulf it will have railroad communication with the Pacific and the Atlantic . It already numbers seven railroads-three finished , and four in process of completion , which , centering on the opposite bank , it proposes to absorb . Indeed , as the initial point of the Union Pacific Railroad , it seems to get more of growth out of these other roads than does its neighbor , Council Bluffs , where they centre . This town as yet numbers only six thousand inhabitants . Omaha is a live place ; has churches , stores , hotels , and everything on an Eastern scale ; horses as fine as can be found anywhere , and carriages to match . Its citizens are hospitable and intelligent , and we bore away many pleasant memories of their courtesy and kindness . The Company employs a thousand men in its works here , which works we duly inspected . They make all their rolling stock , with the exception of the locomotives , of which they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They propose hereafter to construct their own locomotives . The workshops and depot buildings are all large , well built , and well appointed . It is only the fact that they , as well as the city about them , have been created in so short a time , and under such disadvantageous conditions , that makes them of any special interest to the mere traveller . We felt far more of interest in the five hundred Mormon emigrants we found scattered about under the shade of the cars , and wherever they could find shelter from the scorching rays of the sun . They seemed to be divided into family groups . A bread cart had just come from the city , and the men were busy about it buying supplies , and showed plenty of greenbacks . They were all soon busy eating their frugal meal , and it looked like a gypsy party or a picnic on a large scale . Although worn and dirty from their emigrant journey ( they had been just a month from Liverpool to Omaha ) , they seemed generally bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose great age and feebleness would have deterred any but religious enthusiasts from subjecting them to such hardships . They were mostly from England-from London , Lincolnshire , and Yorkshire . The Yorkshire dialect and the cockney elision of the " H , " were very perceptible . All seemed to have a great idea of the energy of the Americans , and to look forward very hopefully to their new home . There were three or // four really pretty faces among them , but as a whole , they were far from possessing the royal doxver of beauty . Asking several of the women-unmarried ones and married-what inducement led them to leave their homes , the reply always was , that " they had come in obedience to the Lord 's will , and that they would he pcrfectly willing to pass through the same , and far heavier hardships , to render that obedience . " They seemed earnest and sincere , and of average intelligence . They complained much of the cars without springs-cattle cars-in which they were transported through Canada , six of their number having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been helping her husband move the luggage , was then prostrate from the heat , and they were striving in their simple way to help her , but in vain , as we afterward learned . I have rarely seen so touching a sight as the bewildered look of the husband as he stood there beholding his wife so mysteriously stricken down in the midst of perfect health , and trying in every way to aid her . There seemed to he no provision for any medical assistance for them ; in this case , it was plain nothing could avail . The poor ei*igrants , ignorant of the danger of exposure to the sun , and with no provision made for their protection , fall easy victims to this unknown foe . This is especially the case with the Norwegian emigrants , who pass through Chicago in large numbers . I was much surprised to find among them a group , whose bright eyes , dark hair , and olive cheeks , spoke unmistakably of sunny Italy ; the little threeyear old " Catterina " was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the innocents Raffaelle delighted to l ) icture . They were from lurin , a family of eight , fhther , mother , one son , and five daughters , " Protestants *- " Vaudois . " They told me they were " Mormons " now , and that there were some seventy Italians at Salt Lake . I had not before known that Brigham had found any disciples beyond the Alps . What strange power of attraction it is which has enabled these despised ones to go to this distant desert among the mountains , and call in workers from all the world ; to come across sea and land , and then face the thousand miles of of desert that lie between them and the last limit of civilization , and there to make the wilderness literally " to blossom like the rose . " The bald statement of the fact is like a story out of the Eastern wonder book . It seems to have been left for the West to realize , and to put into actual being , the most wonderful imaginings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ni&amp;'hts " exceeds in romance the story of Salt Lake , or the magical building of this railroad here , which is to take these emigrants so m any hundred miles on their way to that other wonder . Truly the " old men " of the East " have dreamed dreams , " but the " young men " of the West " see visions . " Three thousand emigrants are expected to ariive soon . The men will go to work at once on the railroad , for sixty miles of which Brigham Young has a contract . The emigrants make already a large portion of the business of the road , and also furnish labor for its construction . The Mormons are very anxious to have it finished to Salt Lake , so as to avoid the long journeys by teams . They expect large and rapid accessions when it is completed . An hour 's ride from Omaha brings us to the Valley of the Platte . It opens before us , first , like a little inlet pushing back among the hills , then , broadening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far as the eye can reach , north and // west , the treeless , green expanse  --  a boundless plain of verdure-stretches away . On the south is the Platte , with its fringe of trees and its picturesque islands , which form a singular and beautiful feature of the river , scattered along like beads upon a rosary . Beyond the river , the sea of grass again , and , at some distance , low rolling hills . We are now upon the old emigrant trail across the Continent . On the river bank are cultivated farms , and large , brown , comfortable-looking houses , seated among the luxuriant fields , like grey old rocks jutting up out of this dark green sea of growing corn , whose " laughing waves " are edged with the foam of whitening wheat fields . Surely one sight of these harvest-fields would settle all doubts as to the agricultural possibilities of Nebraska . The valley here is forty miles from north to south , and stretches away before us to the Rocky Mountains . For more than two hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These farmers- " ranch men , " as they are called , who had a sort of vested interest in the " emigrant trail " - gave no welcome to the railroad , even though it promised a market at Omaha . Heretofore their market has been a sure one at their own doors , and the emigrants were forced to pay whatever the farmers chose to ask , and to exchange their tired teams for fresh ones at rates highly profitable to the settlers . Ninety miles from Omaha is Columbus . Two or three board shanties near the station , set down in the flat prairie , are all the present indications of the cominu *reatness of George Francis Train 's proposed and prophesied new b capital city of the United States . Its eligibility is not apparent to common eyes . It is claimed , I think , as the geographical centre from ocean to ocean . But railroads and telegraphs have diminished the importance of merely " geographical centres , " and though there is , at the west , some real feeling in regard to moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position will , let us trust , permit the white dome to crown the bill where Washington placed it , for generations ! Sixty miles beyond , one hundred and fifty miles west of Omaha , at Grand Island Station , we made our first acquaintance with antelopes , prairie dogs and rattlesnakes , the peculiar denizens of the prairie , kept as pets by some of the company 's men , of whom two or three hundred are here employed . The antelopes look like large rabbits on stilts , and are far less graceful in form than their Indian namesake , but have the same lustrous eye and wonderful speed . They are easily domesticated . The prairie dogs are curious little animals , something between a grey squirrel and a woodchuck . The rattlesnakes , of which we saw two venomous specimens , are said to inhabit their holes and to make a happy family party . We met here a bright Yankee machinist , who took great pride in showing us the little house he had built himself in his spare hours , without fit tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cosy , pleasant-looking little house it was . A glimpse of the wife within it showed that he had something more to live for Qan the thousands of lonely men who , on the far frontiers , form the skirmish lines of the advancing hosts of civilization . Our friend , who is building another house " to let , " is a true type of the best class of western men-a genuine , intelligent , industrious Yankee , set in the prairie with ample room to grow ! With such stock in such soil , why should not " the West " do great things  --  and she is doing them . // In New York , our city life is so absorbing , so concentred , that we are in danger of unconsciously limiting our views by the boundaries of Manhattan Island , forgetting that New York is but the pier at which these people of the West load the ships they send over all the oceans laden with food for a world . Leaving Grand IsP nd , we plunge in again through the unending plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scene . The Platte is a broad , pretentious looking river , but held in no esteem , and spoken of with contempt as a treacherous deception , full of quicksands , useless for navigation , and a dangerous obstacle to travel . All western streams miss the one element of beauty which makes the smallest mountain brook in New England a delight and a joy  --  the element of purity . It is not easy to get poetical over the muddy , discolored waters of the West . At dusk we cross the Platte on a trestle bridge three thousand feet longrecalling that over the Gunpowder River near Baltimore  --  and stop for supper at a large hotel at North Platte Station , two hundred and ninety miles from Omaha . We get an excellent meal , and our first intimation that we are not in a settled community  --  the waiter at our table taking the opportunity while going for acup of coffee to have a " scrimmage " and fire a revolver at one of his fellows while in the kitchen ; at his place again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with his duties . A sign on a drinking shop indicated two " specialties "  --  the " Spotted Tail Keg House . " Spotted Tail is the great Indian chief of this vicinity , and a Keg House is a variety of bar-room popular in these Cities of the Plain . The liquor is kept in small varnished kegs . The customer pays his quarterthe universal price of a drink here-takes his tumbler and draws his own dram . This freedom from supervision is so agreeable that the keg houses are fast driving out the elaborate bars with their cut-glass decanters and showy mirrors . At Hillsdale , a little station some four hundred and ninety-six miles from Omaha , we stop for water , and , seeing two graves alone in the prairie , we go to them . The wooden head-boards show that one was that of a child , the other of a man who accidentally shot himself a few weeks since . Murder and accident are the diseases that kill most men here , and there are many deaths . This station was named in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best civil engineers , who was killed by the Indians when surveying in company with Mr. Archer . Hill was killed after a running fight of two miles ; Archer , though wounded , escaped . West of the Missouri , the Indian question is a live question . Men 's eyes flash , and their tongues grow emphatic , for they live in constant danger . No one of them but has some story of friend or relative barbarously murdered . Their only appellation for them is " red devils . " All admit that they have been systematically defrauded by the Indian agents , but the provocation they have , in violated treaties , is no apology for the indiscriminate murders by which they seek to avenge their wrongs and the barbarous mutilations they inflict . I heard one man  --  and but one man-raise his voice in eloquent and indignant denunciation of the wrongs and systematic spoliation inflicted on these poor creatures by those who are placed as their special guardians ; but even he admitted that matters had reached such a pass now that they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States before any peace would be practicable . Tlie opinion that they should be under the care of the War Department is general ; and Harney 's success with them is constantly referred to . // The guards of United States soldiers that present arms at every station , the little adobe fortlets beside their tents , show that there is some real danger to be guarded against . Fortunately , the Indians have a superstitious fear of the train , and have attacked but one , and that a freight train . They threw it off the track at night , but did not venture to approach till daylight . They killed most of the men , broke open the goods , and finding pieces of gay colored calico , twined them about their ponies and themselves , and tying long pieces to their ponies ' tails as streamers , went careering over the prairie like mad . If they ever get over this superstitious fear of the road , it will make travelling on it a little unpleasant for timid people . The feeling is very general that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our return to Omaha , we found at the hotel two men suffering from arrow wounds , who had been attacked by Indians and their companions killed . We have seen as yet no Indians , except a few Omaha Indians , naked , but for the red blankets around their waists . They are not of a character to increase our estimate of the noble red man . We are looking anxiously for buffalo ; they are announced as having come up to the south side of the Platte . The road crosses their path , for they have their immemorial highways over these trackless plains , and last year the train was forced to wait for hours while the multitudinous herds slowly passed . It is said the Indians direct their course by burning the grass in those places where they do not wish them to go , and so drive these untamed herds whither they will . Strange , wild herdsmen who hunt , not house their flocks . Now and then we have seen a train of emigrant wagons slowly making their way westward , and yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a pleasant farm house , with barn and ricks gathered about it as becomes a thrifty farmer . It stands on a knollpverlooking a little stream in the valley below ; it seems as if it might have been lifted up from a New England hillside , and set down here in the prairie . There was nothing tragic or startling about it , but it had been for years the last house of civilization . The emigrant trains , however , kept it eiz raptort with the world , and our conductor told me of his surprise on going to the house two years ago to find first-rate " lager-bier , " and a little brewery operating in the cellar . A short distance from Hillsdale , we come upon Dogto*vn , the home of the prairie dogs , and stop for a few minutes . Over the prairie , every few yards , are scattered their holes ; and we could see the little creatures running from one to another , or sitting gravely upon their haunches looking at the strangeis ; the pop of a rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twinkling feet was all the result , and pretty soon the saucy little creatures were taking observations again . We deployed quite a little army on the plain ; but , I am glad to say , caused no mourning in any of the homes of Dogtown ! The railroad crosses their tract for about seven miles , and it is said to stretch north and south three hundred miles ! Figures are all so large out here that one hesitates to repeat them . I tell the tale as t was told to me . We are hardly seated in the cars again when some one exclaims " The mountains ! " All is excitement , as when the cry of " Land " is heard at sea ; and there , on our right , against the far horizon , rise the first outlines of the // Black Hills  --  the beautiful blue mountains ! looking here about as high as Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke ; and not unlike them in general outline , only showing longer ranges-one , two , three groups of them , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of a mountain is to one horn among them ? It is home , friends , country , all in one ! After these days of endless plains-however beautiful with their ripening harvests , however grand and sublime in their native freedom-it was glorious to look again upon the mountains-God 's own altars , set up for man 's need of worship . Our course was a little west of south ; these hills were due west . Fifteen minutes later , in the south-east , we caught our first sight of the snowy range of Colorado : one hundred and ten miles away ; 14,000 feet high ! The snow lay on their sides like silver fretwork on dark purple enamel-they lay beautiful and cloudlikc , shimmering in the morning sunlight . The clear air on these high plains , higher than most mountains , quickens every sense , and the pleasure of this first sight of the hills was well worth all the fatigues of the long journey . They differ from the snowy Alps in that the latter are capped with snow , and their pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that encircle them ; but these hills are seamed with snow , and the purple and white show to the very summit . The effect is , therefore , less grand than that of those mountains whose heads are wrapped in eternal snows ; hut nothing could be more beautiful than the scene about us . We are still in the grassy sea ; every moment , as we sweep along , the mountains on our right rise up more distinctly ; the country becomes rolling ; we pass through some cuts fifteen or twenty feet deep , and , coming out , run on an embankment as high through an intervening valley ; and the mountains begin to spread their welcoming arms farther and farther around us . Emerging from one of these cuts , we come on the one *cene needed to complete the picture . First , we pass scattered groups of ponies ; then a large Indian encampment , two hundred lodges at least ; and beyond it hundreds of ponies feeding . The plains , the mountains , the smoky lodges-it was the ideal scene we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , as we approach the mountain , and of interviews with the noble red man among his own wigwams , flitted before our minds . While we looked and dreamed the encampment was left far behind ; and that was the last of our Indians-our one sole glimpse . The Indians had gone out of all this Western country : and these had , Arrapahoes . The citizens assure us " t is dis/a ; zce lends enchantment to the view . " In a few minutes we are in sight of Cheyenne ( " Shy Ann , " as the natives pronounce it ) , looking like an " encampment " - only of shanties and civilization , and , therefore , not half as picturesque as that of the Indians . The road circles about it , so that you get a very complete view of the town before you are finally run into it , and deposited at the depot . It is set down in the prairie , and comprises a few streets , running at right angles , filled with hoard houses and shanties , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bank , many stores , a population of some 2,500 , and stores and appliances for at least mo , ooo people . The tent dwellers  --  the floating population , who hover ever in advance of the road , and in turn have mn*de each of its termini hideous with their orgies-have flitted on , and , having given Laramie a had name , are now founding the town of Benton . Cheyenne , which commenced a year ago , and developed a population of 8 , ooo people so rapidly as to be called the Magic City , // has shrunk down to its number of respectable inhabitants ; and gives indication of having now a substantial population , and of developing a healthy growth . The railroad company intend placing large shops here , as this will be the beginning of the mountain division , where the heavy grades commence . Fort D. A. Russell  --  a fourteen company post , the distributing post of all this section-is only two miles distant . A school-house , costing $9,000 , has been put up , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in population is smaller here than East . We are ; i6 miles west of Omaha , and 5,000 feet higher , and yet we have come all the way over an apparent dead level . There are no trees here . The soil is said to be good , hut needs irrigation . It is proposed to bring water from Crow Creek , some seven miles distant , by digging a ditch ten feet xvide and two feet deep . It is said one foot of water can be brought ; and the example of Salt Lake City is held here to demonstrate the productiveness of this soil , and the inhabitants believe that , with this irrigation , trees and crops can be raised . At present , all their supplies come from abroad . We tasted here , at the hotel , a great delicacy-ahtelope steaks ; a delightful compromise between venison and mutton , juicy , tender , and delicious  --  to be cooked like venison and eaten with jelly . In estimating their future prospects , the Cheyennese dwell largely upon the fact that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chag River , some thirty miles distant . The plains here are covered with grass . Herds feed out all winter . They seem to think irrigation is all that is needed to make abundant crops . In irrigating , shallow ditches , one foot in width and about thirty feet apart , are used . The water is let into these ditches at morning and evening . Some seem to think that as the country settles there will be sufficient rain . More rain is said to have fallen the past year in Cheyenne than was ever before known ; and this s said to be an invariable rule-that settlement produces rain . I saw a plot of potatoes , a little out of the city , giving good promise . The branch railroad to Denver City is to start from here . So that Cheyenne seems to have several elements of permanency and growth . We are soon pushing on our way again . Clumps of white flowers begin to he scattered over the plain ; they prove to be a species of thistle , with a single white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend . The plain on either side is covered with beautiful larkspurs . The white thistle blooms in clusters , and has a bright-yellow blossom , somewhat resembling a marigold . Seven miles from Cheyenne the heavy grades commence . The change in the atmosphere is very rapid , and winter clothes come into instant requisition . The grade is about eighty feet to the mile . In going twenty-eight miles the road rises 2,200 feet , and then we are at the summit , 2,260 feet above the top of Mount Washington . At Granite Caflon , nineteen miles from Cheyenne , the mountain scenery begins . You look back down valleys and over hills to further valleys beyond , and realize at last that you have begun to ascend . We have been ascending in a ravine , and so shut out from getting any view . The fields are one vast parterre , beautiful with flowers . The masses of larkspur color the ground with its exquisite hue . About us , here and there , are the red " buttes " - fantastic piles of red rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the turf . In the distance , and all about us , are ranges of mountains-we are , rather , among // mountains , on a level with the bases of high hills rising in the distance , than upon heights ourselves . In the windings of the cafion up which the track has come , all view of the plains is shut off ; but human sight is too limited to give any adequate view . A mountain whose sides begin to slope up five hundred miles away , is incomprehensible . The Rocky Mountains , thus far , give us no view comparable for grandeur to those of the White Mountains-nothing to be mentioned with the view from Mount Washington . They have , however , a beauty and fascination all their own . There is something in this dry , clear , western atmosphere so transparent , that the eye , trained to measure distance in our grosser air , finds itself wholly at fault , and one hears incredulously the statement of the distance of objects . A mountain a quarter of a mile off is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant , are said to be thirty miles . Your informant is supposed to be truthful , but the statement is simply incredible . At Sherman , the summit of the pass , 548 miles west of Omaha , and 8,262 feet above the level of the sea , we stop . It is the summit of the Rocky Mountains-the highest point in the world yet reached by the locomotive . And here , for the first time , I felt an indication of our great altitude , in the consequent rarification of the air , and in a slight sensation of . suffocation , which made rapid motion out of the question . We descend rapidly through the great Laramie Plains , pass Laramie " City , " pass I3enton , pass the 700th mile post , and a few miles further on the cars stop at the end of a cutting . We clamber up the hill at the side , and look down on a busy , inspiriting scene . Before us is a plateau of about a mile , through the centre of which runs a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which we stopped . Over on the left is an encampment of tents , and a train of whitecovered wagons moving leisurely along . All about are sloping hills , like rolling waves suddenly arrested and fixed forever ; and as barren as they . Not a tree or shrub is in sight , not even a single bush . The ground is covered with little stones of all colors and sizes , as if some day there had been a hail storm here of crystals more lasting than ice . Around , at greater or less distance , mountains . The sun beats down pitilessly from a cloudless sky , yet there is no feeling of oppressive heat . The clear , stimulating air drives away all lassitude . So much for the surroundings  --  the setting of the picture ; that which gave all its life and interest to the scene , and which had brought us so far to view it . Clustered all over that embankment-tugging , working , moving with all their might , now running ahead , now falling back , some far in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs to the very end of the last rail , and almost as by magic , it seemed , found a new rail to run on ; a man on a fiery little horse , now galloping like mad from one end of the field to the other , now still as a statue , and anon directing , by gesture , a body of men . It was a scene of apparently inextricable confusion . But , watching it long , close at hand , and in detail , it became evident that whatever of confusion there might be about it , was in the spectator , not in the scene . No crack company of soldiers on dress parade ever moved with greater facility or precision . Far ahead , along the sides of the embankment , were scattered ties . Nearly a mile ahead of the main body were five men , who were placing ties about twenty feet apart , and carefully adjusting and levelling them . Immediately behind them were as many men as could work to advantage , busy putting the intermediate ties in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidity of // their work . No one stopped , no one hurried , but all worked with a vim I never saw any workmen East show , and which , in that climate , could not he kept up . In the rear , a platform car-having two horses , one on either side , galloping along the sides of the embankment-comes up at full speed loaded with rails , fish plates and bolts . Four men stand on each side and seize a rail , lifting it on two rollers which are in the top of the car , running it rapidly over them ; the end is dropped just in front of the forward wheel , the rail laid in its place , the car drives immediately over it . Two men on the car meanwhile throw off the fish plates and necessary bolts-this process is repeated in less time than I write this-until the car is empty . It is then thrown off the track , while another loaded car , driven up at full speed , takes its place . The empty car is lifted back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . It looks like killing work , but the horses we saw had drawn all the rails from Omaha , more than seven hundred miles away . Close to the car come two men with sledge hammers , who drive in a spike at each end of the rail to steady it ; they keep close to the car . Others follow them , who place the fish plates , shift the ties under the joints , put in the bolts , screw on the nuts , drive down additional spikes along the rails , each one doing just as much as he can do to the best advantage , and rushing on to repeat the same operation on the rail ahead . The division and sub-division of labor applied in the well-known instance of making a pin , in the old days when pins were made by hand , is applied here . This wise application of means and ends , this division of labor , applied equally in every department by this great corporation , is what has enabled them thus to distance all competitors and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . To enable these four hundred men to lay the rail as rapidly and as securely as we saw them doing it , twelve thousand other men in the company 's service are as busy as they . A hundred miles ahead laborers are cutting through the bills , running embankments across the valleys , putting in culverts , throwing bridges across the ravines , while in among the mountains the cliffs echo to the strange music of the woodman 's axe , and the tall cedars leave their solitude to aid in pushing on the great work . Far to the front , slowly move the long supply trains , for that unsettled , inhospi-a table country furnishes neither food nor shelter . Slowly along the embankment the long ox teams drag their load of ties , and tumble them off to be in readiness for the advancing track-layers . Twelve hundred miles away , to the rear , on the shores of Lake Michigan , is the point of departure from which all the material is sent forward . The hase from whence those supplies are drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood-cutters and the mills are busily building the bridges over which the locomotive is to cross the deep gorges and mountain torrents of the Rocky Mountains ; and a thousand miles south  --  to where the rolling mills of Pennsylvania are turning out the iron rails we see so deftly handled along these Pacific slopes . Hour after hour goes by as we watch the steady , unintermitting work of this machine , the click , click of each rail as it falls into place marking the pendulum beats of the clock , whose dial indicates a nation 's progress Three hours have passed , and another finished mile has been addded to the road . And now we reluctantly turn back , and set our faces once more toward the Atlantic .
