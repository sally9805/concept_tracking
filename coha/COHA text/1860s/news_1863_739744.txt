txt The achievements of our cavalry are the topic of much favorable comment among the men and officers of the army , particularly among the infantry , who are fast getting in love with the cavalry  --  there having been , heretofore. plenty of room for an increase of affection between them . The early and accurate accounts of the late cavalry battles , from the Tinsel cavalry correspondent , are the only ones that have appeared here , and are read with much avidity . Aside from the fact that STUART 'S impudent force has been thoroughly whipped , and now retires cowed and crestfallen , before our confident squadrons , another and still more important thing has been achieved . The whole rebel infantry movement has been completely unmasked , and it is demonstrated beyond doubt that but for the sagacious dispositions of this army , and the bold , vigorous and determined reconnoissances by the cavalry , Lu 's army would ere this have been in Maryland , by the very route he chose last year . This movement has been foiled . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that route is far more distant and dangerous for him than the one by way of Nolan 's Ford and Frederick , and places our army directly in his rear . At present he can not invade Maryland by any point east of Harper 's Ferry . In my dispatch of the 18th I said " The present position of the enemy , comparing all my information , I believe to be this : LONosTRRET and Ewsu. in the valley near Winchester ; HILL on the march between Culpepper and Chester Gap ; but he has hardly had time to get on the other side of the Blue Ridge . " Within the past forty-eight hours this information has been substantially confirmed . On Thursday last LonaBrItSim moved through Ashby 's Gap to the Loudon Valley , on this side ; for what purpose is not fully known ; but STUART 'S cavalry , which was masking his movement , being attacked in front and rear by PLsesseroa and Duns , LonasYsturr divided his command in two columns at Upperside , and moved both toward Snicker 's Gap , one column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 18th , and picked up a couple of hundred stragglers ; the other column direct to Snickersville , along the eastern base of the Blue Ridge . On Saturday he pushed through Snicker 's Gap and crossed the Shenandoah River , encamping on its banks , and leaving PICKET 'S division to hold the gap . On Sunday Gen. BuFORD pushed a bold reconnoissance to the top of the Blue Ridge , and discovered LorrosYbezi 's camp in plain sight . on the line of the river at the base of . the , mountains . F-41W ther information received at the outposts yesterday and Sunday , which is reliable in its character , places HILL 'S corps on the western side of the Blue Ridge , having marched by way of Cheater Gap . He has probably joined LONOSTREZT ere this . Las 's headquarters were at Winchester on Sunday . Ewata. ' s corps- was la the vicinity of Winchester , one division , Reonsfe , numbering about eight thousand men , being thrown up on the line of the Potomac , to support the guerrillas of JENKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ravaging the country for horses and supplies , and not for the purpose of fighting . This will be demonstrated in a very few days to a certainty . The matter of invasion is now reduced to one route only , and if the rebels are really in earnest about it they will soon demonstrate it , and they may be looked for on a line west of the Blue Ridge and South Mountain  --  crossing either at Williamsport , or at Blackford 's Fell , below Shepherdstown . The possibility of crossing the Potomac below Harper 's Ferry no longer exists . In executing this movement the rebels will , of course , conceal it from our knowledge as much as possible , by defending the passages of the Blue Ridge , and possibly by also seizing and holding the gaps of South Mountain , out of which they were so summarily routed last year . But with wide-awake cavalry scouts on the Pennsylvania border , together with the friendly people of that section , we shall not be blameless if we do not have early and full notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners captured on Sunday will reach one hundred and fifty  --  among them twelve officers  --  one Colonel , wounded . three LieutenantColonels , one Major , and the rest line officers . Nearly twenty-five of the enemy 's best cavalry officers have been taken within the past five days . The prospects for " retaliation " on their part are not much enhanced by these captures . MOKIIZT. yesterday . tried his band at another raid in this vicinity , but got most handsomely beaten and scattered . He crossed the Bull Run Mountains with several hundred cavalry , between Sidle and Thoroughfare Gaps . He sent a portion of his forces down to the Mountain Pike , with the evident intention of nicking up any wagons or stragglers they might find there . With about a hundred men , he pushed for the Aldie Pike , and debouched out on that road , just below Gum Spring . He soon encountered an ammunition train , on which he charged , and , of course , captured it . He then proceeded to unhitch and drive off all the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting fire to the wagons , when a battalion of the Twelfth Illinois cavalry , who had been resting in the woods just below , charged up the road , and after a short contest scattered MOSBY ' 13 crew to the winds , recapturing all the horses and mules , and taking ten of Ms gang prisoners . In the meantime , another force above Mositiv came down the road , and the rebels incontinently scattered into the woods and by-roads , having done no damage . We had not a man killed or wounded . The rest of his cavalry , which went down to the Warrenton road , ran into some of our infantry , and they also got scattered , some of them being captured . L. L. CROUNSE . Further Particulars of the Cavalry Fight . ALD1R , Ye. , Monday , June 22-6 A. M. The cavalry fight of yesterday was conducted by the columns of BUPORD on the right and Genic ; on the left . Gitsoo 's column was mainly engaged in an artillery fight of a running character , the rebels being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelve miles . Three guns and one caisson were taken during the day , and two caissons were blown up . At Upperville the enemy made a stout resistance and a charge , in which they were repulsed , losing their Colonel , who was wounded and captured . GREGO 'S oolumn took 80 prisoners , including five or six officers , one Colonel , one Major and several line officers . Our loss was light . Col. VINCIINT 'S infantry brigade , from the Fifth corps , were actively engaged early in the day , and captured one gun . They lost about twenty killed and wounded . Geo . Buroan , on the right , had the most cavalry fighting , but drove the enemy uniformly throughout the day . When near Ashby 's Gap , he cut off a large body of the enemy , and compelled them to : retreat by way of Snicker 's Gap . There are now no rebels in the Loudon Valley . it having been cleared by our cavalry . Las 's whole army is certainly west of the Blue Qidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yesterday was very handsome , successful , and our loss much less than usual .
