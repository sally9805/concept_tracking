GEORGE ROGERS CLARKE . CONCLUDED . RELIEVED by the result of Gibault 's diplomacy at Vincennes from apprehension of an attack from that quarter , Clarke turned his whole attention to the pacification of the neighboring Indian tribes . His plan was to treat them with the strictest justice , adopting a manner kind , haughty , or contemptuous , as occasion demanded ; but always reserved and dignified . Maintaining the superiority of the white men , he never allowed himself to be provoked into any unseemly display of passion or excitement . Seldom offering presents ; when he did do so , it was always with the distinct understanding that it was a mere act of grace , and not intended as a bribe . Though anxious to secure the neutrality of the tribes of Illinois , he never condescended to invite them to a council ; and all the overtures for peace came from those who had begun the war . Yet , when necessary , no one could be more persuasive , as was proven by his interview with the Big Gate-so called from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the gate of the fort at Detroit , during the attempt of Pontiac to surprise that place . This chief a deadly foe to the Big Knives , had accidentally met a party of Piankshaws coming to attend the great council , which was being held by the American commander at Kaskaskia ; and although an avowed enemy , he resolved to accompany them in order to behold this mighty chief of the pale-faces , whose fame had spread over the whole northwest . With the most audacious calmness he appeared each day in the council , sitting conspicuously in the front of the room in full war-dress , wearing the bloody belt he had received from the English , and elaborately bedecked in his war-paint . Thus he continued to attend for many days , saying not a word to the Americans nor they to him . But on the last day , when the deliberations were closed , Clarke addressed him , apologizing for not noticing him until the public business was over . He said , " Although they were enemies , still it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , to treat each other in proportion to their exploits in war . " On this account , and because " he was a great chief " the Colonel invited him to dinner  --  a compliment never extended to less distinguished men . The savage , taken completely by surprise , endeavored to decline ; but Clarke would take no denial . At last the chief , confused by 9uch unexpected kindness and attention , and yielding to the spell of a superior mind , could contain his excited feelings no longer . Springing into the middle of the room , he flung down the war-belt and a little British flag that he carried in his bosom , and ended by stripping himself of every article of clothing except his breech-cloth . Then striking himself energetically upon the breast , he told his hearers that " they all knew he had been a great warrior from his youth up and delighted in battle . That he had been out three times against the Big Knives in Kentucky , for the British had told him lies l That he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to rest himself a while , and come and hear what the Americans had to say on their side of the question . Now he knew the Big Knives were right , and as an honest warrior he would no longer fight against them : " upon which he shook hands with Clarke and his officers and saluted them as brothers . He ever afterward remained true to his new friends , and in a private interview detailed to the Colonel the situation of Detroit , and offered to go out and bring him a scalp or a prisoner . Clarke declined the offered scalp , but said that he would be glad to secure a prisoner , from whom he could obtain some information of the movements of the British . The chief , dressed in a fine laced suit , decorated with a silver medal , and bearing a captain 's commission , set out on this expedition . While Clarke was engaged in negotiations // with the Indians between the Mississippi and the Wabash he came near falling a victim to a plot for his assassination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of their superiors . They promised a band of Indians , composed of outcasts from all the tribes , a large reward if they would kill " the great chief of the Bostoni . " Under pretense of friendship they pitched their camp close by his , and made a treacherous attempt to shoot him at night . The plot failed , and the conspirators were made captive . The chiefs were heavily ironed , and shut up in the gnard-house , whence they were every day brought forth and placed in the midst of the council to be gazed at by the assembled tribes , and not allowed to speak or be spoken to . At last , when the council was about to be broken np , Clarke ordered their chains to be taken off , telling them contemptuously " that he had meant to put them to death ; but on considering the meanness of watching a bear and catching him asleep , he had found out that they were not warriors , but only old women , whom it would be a shame to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on breech-cloths like men . They shall be taken off of you , " hf concluded , " and plenty of food given you for your journey home , as squaws do not know how to hunt ; " and then turned away to speak with other persons , as though he scorned to talk any longer with such mean creatures . This treatment was too much for the Indians to bear ; they begged for forgiveness . Clarke would not allow their speech to be interpreted ; and when they offered him the pipe of peace , he broke it with his sword . The other Indians interceded in their favor , but he still refused to listen . Suddenly two young men of the offending tribe stepped into the centre of the room , sat down in silence upon the floor , and threw a blanket over their heads . While all were wondering at this movement , the chief again advanced with the pipe of peace and informed Clarke that these youths offered their own lives as an atonement for the crime of their people , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke he extended the pipe , the pledge and symbol of peace . Clarke was deeply affected by this display of patriotic self-sacrifice . He had intended from the first to grant the tribe peace after a sufficient show of reluctance , and this touching incident enabled him to do so gracefully . As soon as he dared trust his own voice - for , said he afterward , " I never felt so powerful a gush of emotion over my mind , or was ever so incapable of speaking from the impulse of that feeling " - he ordered the young men to rise , saying , " he was rejoiced to find that there were men in all nations , and that they at least were a proof for their own countrymen . Such characters were alone fit to be chiefs , and with such he liked to treat , and through them he granted peace to their tribe ; and he , therefore , took them by the hand as its chiefs . " They were introduced to the American , French , and Spanish officers , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saluted them in their new character . A solemn council was held , in which the terms of peace were settled . By the last of January , 1779 , Clarke had finished his task of pacification . In the mean time he had become anxious concerning the state of affairs at Vincennes , from which place he had heard nothing for many weeks . But on the 29th he was once more roused to the most strenuous activity by the arrival of Colonel Viejo , with the intelligence that Governor Hamilton had recaptured that post in December , and was occupying it with about eighty regulars , besides an Indian force of six or eight hundred warriors . Captain Helm , who had been left in the fort with one single private , had made a most vigorous defense - with menaces and profane language  --  and only surrendered on being allowed all the honors of war , the British commander choosing to humor him so far , rather than run the risk of losing half a dozen of his men by the charge of grapeshot that Helm swore he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not granted . Hamilton was provided with a small train of field-pieces , and had orders to penetrate up the Ohio to Fort Pitt , sweeping Kentucky in his course ; he was then to pass on to the invasion of Augusta County , by which name all the western part of Virginia was then known . But he had first to dispose of one of the most resolute and vigorous leaders of the age ; and in spite of all that had transpired , he had utterly failed to appreciate the character of the man with whom he had to deal . Instead of assailing him at once , he had sent his Indian allies on an expedition against the settlers along the Upper Ohio , intending to recall them early in the spring for an attack on Kaskaskia . Clarke had no idea of waiting the pleasure of his antagonist , and resolved to bring matters to an instant issue . " I knew , " he said , " if I did not take him he would take me ; " and he immediately set about preparing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of a row galley with an armament of two 4-pounders and two swivels , placing on board forty-six men under command of Lieutenant Rogers , with orders to move round by the Mississippi and Ohio to the mouth of the Wabash , up which stream he was to force his way to within a few miles of Vincennes , and suffer nothing to pass . To the remainder of his own force he added two companies of Kaskaskia volunteers , and with this small body of one hundred and seventy men lie set out on the 7th of February on a march of two hundred miles across the " drownedlands " oflllinois . The seasonwas rainy but not cold ; otherwise no human beings could have endured the hardships of that expedition . Yet it required all the influence of the commander to prevent despondency among those hardy men whose whole lives had been a constant wrestle with difficulties . At length , on the 18th , they reached the Little Wabash , not far from its junction with the larger stream of that name . Instead of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw that the worst was still to come . From the western bluff on which they had halted , the high lands that bounded the eastern side of the valley were full five miles distant , and the whole intervening space was one unbroken expanse of water , " three feet deep , never under two , and frequently four ; " while two broad bands of ripples on the otherwise motionless surface indicated the channels of the two rivers . Nothing is more characteristic of great leaders than the art with which , in critical emergencies , they have appealed to the master-feeling in the hearts of their followers . History has preserved many speeches by which men have been nerved to accomplish the seemingly impossible ; and we are sometimes inclined to wonder at their effect , forgetting that it was the occasion and the peculiar character of the hearers , with which we do not fully sympathize , that gave them their magic power . Few military orations will stand the test of a strict critical analysis , nor do we claim that our hero 's appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model of elegance . His speech on first coming in sight of Kaskaskia was one of the longest he ever uttered in the field , etcept on one sad future occasion ; and that was far more pithy than elaborate , containing only the single sentiment , " We must take the place at all events . " Now when he saw his soldiers gazing in gloomy despondency upon the lake through which lay their only road to Vincennes he did not expend even so many words ; but stepping to the.front so that all might see , he took a little wet powder in his hand , blackened his face , and raising the startling war-whoop , plunged into the water . The men who were educated in the symbolical customs of the Indians saw in this act of their leader an unalterable determination to succeed or perish in the attempt , and the well-known note of border war , which they had heard pealing over many a bloody skirmish or scene of midnight murder , fired them . The right chord had been struck , and echoing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a terrible undertaking , and it seemed as if their strength could not possibly bear them through . The march became slower and more toilsome ; the song gradually ceased , and nothing was to be heard but the splashing and loud panting of the men as they struggled painfully onward . The march was not over a smooth bottom of sand , but upon ground encumbered with submerged logs , brushwood , and all the thousand obstructions of uncleared land , and through water often up to the armpits . Here were to be seen men supporting themselves by embracing the tree trunks with their arms , in order to gain a fe*v moments ' rest for their aching legs , while others were seen trying to evade some of the difficulties by paddling themselves forward on pieces of floating timber , and one little drummer created some faint merriment by navigating the deeper places on the head of his drum . At last they reached a small island that offered them a resting-place , from which the object of all their labors could plainly be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain there long ; yet between them and the shore there still spread a wide expanse of water , entirely destitute of any friendly timber by which they could cling and rest . Clarke now spoke a few cheering words , and again led the way into the stream ; but before stepping off he had ordered Captain Bowman to fall back with twenty-five men and shoot any one who refused to march . But the precaution was needless , and the order was received with a huzza , and every man again took bravely to the water . At last the eastern shore was reached , but so complete was the exhaustion of the party that many of them fell with their bodies half in the water , not able , when the spur of absolute necessity was no longer felt , to take even the one single step that would place them on dry land . It was a wonderful achievement , and without a parallel in history since the time wher*the rancorous hatred of Dutch and Spaniards marched armies along the bottom of the sea , and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the army was resting in this manner an Indian canoe came in sight and was brought to . In it were found a quarter of buffalo beef . The timely supply was at once made into broth . Refreshed by this and somewhat rested the line of march for the town was again taken up , Clarke sending word to the inhabitants of his approach , and warning all who were friendly to the enemy to retire at once to the fort . This stroke of policy had the desired effect , for the astonished people thought that such frankness could only belong to one who felt himself too strong to fear resistance . Indeed , the idea was prevalent throughout the place that it was a new army from Kentucky , as it was deemed impossible that a march could have been made from Kaskaskia in such a state of the waters . This delusion was cunningly kept up by several officers sending a captured hunter with messages to their acquaintances in the town , under the names of persons known to be then in Kentucky . In making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminences in the plain , displaying each time they came into view different sets of colors in order to create an exaggerated idea of his numbers . He was received with open arms by the French inhabitants , while even the few who were hostile to the American cause were so completely overawed that they dared not even inform the commander of the fort of what was transpiring . He therefore remained quietly within his walls , never dreaming that his antagonist , instead of waiting in winterquarters according to established military usage , would in a few minutes be under the guns of his own stronghold , demanding an instant decision of the contest . In order to make his opponent unmask-if there were really any design concealed behind his apparent inaction-Clarke sent forward fourteen men to begin an attack on the fort . At // first the fire of these was attributed to some drunken Indians who had been lying about the place . But one of the men , having had Cap .. tam Helm 's quarters pointed out to him-who , it will be remembered , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot at the chimney and knock the mortar down into the captain 's toddy , which , he said , " was sure to be on the hearth at about this time . " The shot was so well aimed that the captain , who was sitting within , engaged as the man conjectured , on seeing this new ingredient added to his favorite beverage , sprang up and exclaimed , " That is Clarke , and he will make us all prisoners ; but damn him , he has no business to spoil my toddy ! " Immediately afterward a soldier was shot through one of the port-holes , and the truth could no longer be doubted . " Is Colonel Clarke a merciful man ? " asked the Governor , anxiously , of his prisoner . But soon recovering himself , the fire was returned and continued hotly throughout the night , aud until nine o'clock on the following morning . About that time the Americans , having received a good supply of ammunition-from several of the chief men of the place , who had concealed it during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lying within thirty yards of the walls , they kept up so murderous a fusillade that the garrison could no longer be kept to their guns , for the instant a port-hole was opened , even a few inches , half a dozen rifle balls would be sent whizzing through the aperture , cutting down ev , ery thing in the way ; nor could the smallest portion of a person be exposed without receiving the same unwelcome salute . " You had better take care ! " said Captain Helm to a man whom he saw trying to get a peep at the state of things without , through a crevice in one of the block-houses , " Clarke 's men will shoot your eye out . " There was no time to profit by the warning , for the words were scarcely uttered when both the prying organ and the brain behind it were knocked out by a nicely-aimed rifle bullet . It was said by the English that Clarke 's success in this attack was entirely owing to the awkward elevations of the platforms , which prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may be partially true , but it only shows the wisdom of Clarke in adopting a mode of attack never thought of by those who planned the defenses , and which was certainly the most effectual that could have been employed in the absence of a siege artillery ; for could the besieged even have brought their guns to bear they might have occasioned us greater loss , and postponed the final result , but could scarcely have changed it , since cannon balls and even grape would have availed but little n*ainst riflemen fighting under cover and in the loosest order . This is one of the first instances of attacking fortified places in this manner , and a few years before would have been laughed to scorn as the project of a fool by the scientific martinets of Europe . But one of the greatest improvements in the system of modern tactics grew out of the necessities *f Indian warfare in North America , or rather was learned directly from the Indians themselves ; we mean the employment of those light corps of rifle-armed sharp-shooters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every perfect military establishment . Toward three o'clock Hamilton , either on account of the uselessness of his cannon , or because he could no longer make his men face the deadly fusillade of the besieger , sent a flag with an offer to treat . The two leaders therefore met at the village church , the Englishman being accompanied by Captain Helm and a Major Hay . Clarke demanded an unconditional surrender , which Hamilton refused , and a violent scene ensued . Clarke arose to depart , informing the Governor that the firing would recommence in fifteen minutes . But tile latter , who knew the discouragement of his men , and dreaded being taken by assault , or that the fort , which stood within thirty feet of the steep river-bank , might be undermined , called to his opponent , as he was retiring , and mildly inquired his reasons for insisting on such harsh terms . " Because , " exclaimed Clarke , " I know the principal Indian partisans from Detroit are in the fort , and I want only an honorable opportunity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred do I consider this claim upon me that I would rather lose fifty of my men than not execute the vengeance demanded by so much innocent blood . If Governor Hamilton chooses to risk the destruction of his garrison for such miscreants he has it at his pleasure . " It may seem strange that Clarke should risk his own success on such a point . But in order to understand the importance he attached thercto it is only necessary to read the historical collections of that time , and learn something of the feelings with which those wretches called Indian agents or partisans were regarded . We do not mean the officers of the English army , who were sometimes compelled by the cruel policy of their masters to serve in conjunction with the Indians . These were generally as much disgusted at the barbarity of their red allies as civilized men would naturally be . And we remember Colonel Byrd 's strange withdrawal from Kentucky after the capture of two stations , and when he might have swept the whole State , because he would not pluck laurels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men to whom Clarke had reference were a set of abandoned villains , many of them renegades from the colonies , who had domesticated themselves among the Indians , whose natural ferocity they were continually stimulating ; planning for them expeditions into the settlements , which they not unfrequently led in person , and outdid the savages themselves in deeds of cruelty and blood . The bitter hatred borne by the early settlers of the West towar ( l these men may be conceived from the detestation that is even yet excited in their descendants by the very names of Girty and M'Kee . Hence // Clarke felt that he could not render a greater service to his countrymen than by cutting off a number of these their worst enemies . " And pray , Colonel Clarke , " called out Ma .. jor Hay , " whom do you mean by Indian partisans ? " " I consider Major Hay one of the principal ones , " was the prompt , threatening reply . The other turned pale and trembled when he thus unexpectedly heard himself especially designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely denounced . So excessive was his agitation that his own commander blushed for his open exhibition of cowardice and Clarke , who admired the dignified demeanor of the latter under misfortune as much as he despised that of his subordinate , relented in his heart toward the former , and told him that he " would reconsider the matter , and let him know the result by a flag of truce . " The American officers advised concession , and on the 24th of February , 1779 , Fort Sackville was once more surrendered into the hands of our countrymen , the garrison being received as prisoners of war . This victory permanently secured the conquests of the country , and fixed the authority of Virginia on a firm basis ; thenceforward it only remained for Clarke to defend that which he had so gallantly won . At the age of twenty-seven Clarke had reached the goal when he himself thought he had only overcome the first difficulties of the ground , and with powers braced by the previous exertion , saw , or thought he saw , a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , that his ph*n was only half executed , and his work yet unfinished while Detroit and the other posts along the lakes remained in the hands of the enemy . And it may be , there had floated dimly through his mind the splendid dream of accomplishing the design in which Montgomery had failed , and of striking once more for the possession of the St. Lawrence upon the Plains of Abraham and under the walls of Quebec . And certainly no one of his contemporaries was more worthy of trying his fortune on that " battle-field of empire , " where the great prize had twice already been lost and won , and where so many heroes had fallen amidst glorious victory or equally glorious defeat . Of all the English posts which gave them a direct communication with the savage nations of the Northwest , that of Detroit alone remained to them , and to its capture Clarke 's whole attention was now directed . " If I but had five hundred men when I first arrived in this country , " he wrote to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only have secured my prisoners and had three hundred men available , I would have attempted it . " But even with his small force of two hundred he was preparing to risk the attempt , when he received a letter from Governor Henry informing him that an additional battalion was to be raised to complete his regiment , and advising a postponement of farther offensive operations until it should join him . About the same time he received another note , part of which we insert : " Sir , " writes Lieutenant-Governor Page , on the 4th of September , 1779 , " I have the honor to inform you that by Captain Rogers I have sent the sword that was purchased by the Governor to be presented to you by order of the General Assembly , as a proof of their approbation of your great and good conduct and gallant behavior . I heartily wish a better could have been procured ; but it was thought the best that could be purchased , and was bought of a gentleman who had used it but little , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " etc. , etc . We suspect one of our gallant officers of the present day would not feel much flattered by being presented with a second-hand sword , however " elegant and costly " the gentleman " who had used it but little " might judge it to be . The sword duly arrived ; but not so the promised battalion . A change had come over the councils of Virginia ; and although at a later period an entire new regiment was formed and placed under Clarke 's orders , it was only for purposes of defense , and he was forbidden any offensive operations against the remaining British posts , but ordered to take up his quarters at the falls of the Ohio , and with seven hundred men protect a frontier eight hundred miles in length , exposed at every point to savage incursions . Here was the turning point in the history of Clarke . Restrained from the prosecution of those plans whereon his heart had from the first been fixed , and the immense utility of which he alone seems clearly to have understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties of savages , which , though a source of unceasing annoyance , could add nothing to his fame ; and reduced all at once to a position of comparative obscurity after having made himself an object of admiring observation to a whole nation by the most dashing and brilliant series of exploits performed during the war ; and cut off from those personal adventures in which he had formerly dejighted by the duties and proprieties of his position as Brigadier-General of the forces in the West : it is not to be wondered at if his spirits became depressed , or that he should be tempted to seek relief from the dreary monotony of a garrison life in the use of stimulants , as too many men of his ardent temperament have done before and since . It is always painful to speak of the weaknesses of a great man , or the sins of a good one ; but truth compels the admission that , from about this time , Clarke began to yield himself more and more to the dominion of this pernicious habit . But the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he still maintained his high reputation , and even down to the last moment of his command he continued zealously and actively to discharge its onerous duties ; and his zeal was always wise as his activity was always prompt and efficient . His plan of defense included an armed galley that plied along the river monthly , from the Falls to the mouth of the Licking , together with a // strong and well-trained body of rangers , who secured both shores from the mouth of the Tennessee to that of the Sciota : whose duty it was to report every movement of the savages that fell under their notice at head-quarters , then fixed at Fort Nelson , which occupied the site of the present city of Louisville . This corps of scouts and spies-for they acted in both capacities-contained many of the choicest spirits of the frontier , among whom were such men as Simon Kenton and Bland Ballard : in connection with the latter of whom there is related a little incident , which also illustrates well the difference between those times and the present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky shore of the river , a few miles below the Falls , he heard the voices of Indians evidently approaching from the other side . Concealing himself in the bushes he lay in wait for an adventure , and soon a canoe , containing three Indians , became visible through the fog , making directly for his point of ambush . When within range he fired and killed one in the bow , whereupon the others sprang overboard and tried to escape by swimming , but were both slain in the water before they could get out of reach from the hunter 's rifle . Thinking that he had now done enough for one morning 's work , he returned to the fort and reported his adventure to the General , who , as a reward for his gallant conduct , presented him with a linen skirt , which was the first garment of the kind the hardy borderer had worn for many years , except those made of buckskin . In the year 1780 Congress had been so far influenced by the intrigues of the Spanish and French ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , that they had actually instructed their envoys in Europe to be guided on this point by the advice of the French Government in any negotiations for peace , and not even to insist on the free navigation of that stream below latitude 3Q0 north . Compliance with this short-sighted policy of concession would have made Kentucky a Spanish province . But fortunately America had some statesmen who looked beyond the passing moment , and who determined to strengthen their claim by taking actual possession of the whole of the disputed territory . Clarke therefore received orders in the spring of this year to move down with a part of his State regiment and construct a strong fort on the Mississippi below the mouth of the Ohio . This order he promptly executed , and called the new post Fort Jefferson , in honor of the Governor of Virginia , under whose orders it was built . But the position of commander on the frontier was , in those times , one of ceaseless vigilance and constant activity , and Clarke had scarcely finished this labor when he heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Licking . It was his settled policy never to let any attack of the enemy pass without immediate retaliation . As soon , therefore , as he heard the news of the capture of the two northern stations he resolved to set out for that region and arouse VOL . XXLLI. - No. 133. -E the people to attempt an expedition into the Indian country beyond the Ohio . For greater safety he disguised himself and his two companions as red men , and struck boldly into the forest , traversed by scores of marauding bands ; for the savages , after more than a year of comparative quiet , had this spring again broken out into hostilities with redoubled fury . The wisdom of Clarke 's plan for the reduction of the English posts on the lakes was now made manifest , and bitter cause had the Kentuckians for the next four years to curse the short-sighted parsimony by which their execution had been thwarted . During those four years more than one thousand of their people were murdered or captured , besides their enormous losses in other respects . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not have their own way , sit down in sullen idleness to complain . Since he could not do what he thought best for the protection of the settlements , he resolved to do what * next best , to carry the war into the villages of the savages . With this purpose in view , he now set out on that perilous journey from Fort Jefferson to Harrodstown , then the largest town in the country . On reaching the Tennessee River with his companions they found it in a state of flood , foaming from bank to bank ; while , to add to the danger , they became aware that they were in the close neighborhood of a large band of Indians . Springing down the bank , they set vigorously to work upon a raft , whereon to transport their guns and baggage . Upon this they piled their arms , and , pushing it off , plunged into the roaring current . They had hardly made one-quarter of the passage when a party of painted warriors came leaping down to the shore they had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on that which they were approaching . Here the disguise of the adventurers stood theta in good stead , as it concealed their true character until the rapid current had whirled them beyond the effective range of their enemy 's rifles . As they shot swiftly past the mouth of a large creek , their minds , practiced in all the arts and devices of forest warfare , instantly perceived in it the means of escape . Running their raft quickly ashore , they plunged into the dense forest at full speed , and thus , while their enemies were making a long detour to reach a ford , gained a start that rendered pursuit hopeless . Shortly after this , while passing through " the barrens , " they met a band of forty emigrants , who , though scarcely ever out of sight of large herds of buffalo , were actually on the point of starvation from the inexpertness of their hunters . Clarke and his companions soon gave these unskillful hunters a practical lesson in this branch of business by killing for them fourteen out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrodstown he found it crowded with people from all parts of the country eager to enter land in the office just opened there by George May , surveyor of the newly .. erected cot*nty of Jefferson . No speculative mania ever // raged more virulently than did the " land fever " at this time in Kentucky ; and the Colonel knew how useless it would be to ask men to volunteer in defense of the very country of which all were so anxious to secure a portion as long as the office remained open . The mere speculator , who resided at a safe distance and relied on the bravery and industry of others to render his purchase valuable , would , of course , heed no appeal of the kind : on the other hand , he could not expect the real settlers , and those who intended becoming such , to leave the field clear for the former class to secure all the finest lands in the country while they themselves should be absent defending it . It was one of those cases when the good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws a solemn dutycases with which very great and very pure men only are competent to deal . The emergency was too pressing to allow of any communication with the superior authorities of the State at Williamsburg , four hundred miles distant ; and Clarke determined to take upon himself the responsibility of closing the office " until " - as the notice to that effect stated- " the return of an cxpedition , about to be organized under the orders of Brigadier-General Clarke , against the Indian towns on the Great Miami . " The success of the measure justified its adoption ; for the popularity and high military standing of the leader at once commanded any number of volunteers as soon as the counter-incitement of avarice was removed , and in a very few days two regimentswereraised , equipped , and on the march for the place of rendezvous , at the month of the Licking , opposite the present site of Cincinnati , while the State troops , with the artillery , moved up the Ohio to the same point : whence the whole army , one thousand strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of July . There is no need to describe this expedition minutely , as it differed but little from the half dozen similar ones subsequently set on foot , except in its more complete success-which was indeed too complete to allow of any of those interesting adventures so common in Indian campaigns . Dashing forward with his characteristic celerity the General came upon the town of Pickaway almost by surprise , and after a sharp fight , in which seventeen on each side were killed , the savages were forced to fly , leaving every thing in the power of the spoilers ; and were taught for the first time that the arm of the Big Knife could reach them even in their own wigwams , and that hereafter every incursion of their own was to be followed by a speedy and certain vengeance . Every town within reach was burned , the fruit trees girdled , and the standing crops destroyed . This may seem a barbarous method of warfare  --  and so it undoubtedly was , and so it was meant to be ; but it was waged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . To talk of conducting hostilities according to the practice of civilized nations against such a people is the height of sentimental folly . Such war to them would be no worse , nay , would occasion less of suffering , than they are accustomed to in their ordinary state of peace . War is justifiable only because the dread of its horrors enforces and secures peace ; and that to accomplish this the horror must be such as will be felt by those upon whom it is inflicted . This unexpected blow relieved Kentucky for the remainder of the year from any repetition of such inroads as had just spread terror throughout her borders . The Shawanees  --  the most implacable and powerful of the hostile tribes-were employed in rebuilding their ruined habitations , and procuring the means of subsistence during the ensuing winter . Clarke therefore discharged the volunteers , and returned with his own troops to Fort Nelson , there to recommence his distasteful routine of garrison duties , and , it is to be feared , to sink still deeper into those habits that were undermining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that any deficiency can at this distance of time be discovered either in judgment or vigor of his acts , for it takes dissipation a long time to produce a sensible effect on a mind so strong and well-balanced as his . On the contrary , he is seen for the next twelve or eighteen months watching every where his restless and stealthy foes , and ready to swoop at any moment , or upon any point , at which they ventured to make their appearance in force . During this year he removed with his command from the falls of the Ohio to Kaskaskia , in the now regularly organized county of Illinois , where the condition of things had become such as to require his presence . In the summer of 1781 he was once more summoned to the far south by the pressing danger of his new fort on the Mississippi . It had been built without permission on the lands of the Chickasaws , who , offended at the encroachment , had broken out into hostility against the whites for the first , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of a Scotch gentleman named Colbert , laid siege to the place , and seemed resolved to carry in spite of every effort of the little garrison of thirty fever-stricken men . The assault had been urged with unfaltering valor for five days , notwithstanding the terrible slaughter committed in their ranks by the light guns of the fort , and they were apparently on the eve of success when the arrival of Clarke , with a small reinforcement , compelled them to retire . But the fort being only erected in order to strengthen by actual possession the title of the United States to the country on the Mississippi north of latitude thirty , and that object having been shortly afterward accomplished , the place was dismantled , and peaceful relations thus restored with the Cbickasaws , the most civilized of all the North American tribes . Again for almost a year General Clarke lay at Fort Nelson in comparative idleness until , in the summer of 1782 , he was once more called forth to vigorous exertion by that terrible disaster-the defeat of the Lower Blue Licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // public mind of Kentucky , and none occupies a more conspicuous place in her early history . Every Kentucky boy is familiar with the events of that day , when men and officers seemed suddenly stricken with idiocy , and with open eyes rushed headlong into certain destruction . The narrative may not be so familiar to others , but there are few Kentuckians who have not heard how , at the call of the people of Bryant 's Station , one hundred and eighty of the most gallant spirits of the land , under Boone , Todd , Trigg , Harland , M'Bride , and M'Gary , hastened to their aid , and finding Girty and his host of savages gone , resolved to follow upon their trail without waiting the arrival of Logan , who was hastening on with the men of Lincoln ; and how , on coming in sight of a few stragglers who seemed to invite observation and pursuit , the veteran Boone at once saw that they were only left as a decoy , and told his friends that an ambush was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing the situation of the ground exactly , and telling them the precise spot where the five hundred Indians were lying in wait for their approach ; how , in the midst of the debate , the taunt of a hot-brained bravo seemed suddenly to sting the whole party into madness ; how they all-men and leaders-plunged pell-mell into the river , without caution and without order , each intent only on proving that he was not a coward , and rushed confusedly onward , no one commanding and no one obeying , till all at once they found themselves huddled in a confused mass upon a bare and rocky ridge , and inclosed in a triangle of fire , without cover , with a deep and narrow ford behind them ; how Todd and Trigg and Harland and M'Bride fell , and the survivors fought on until the enemy sprang forth from the ravines , rushed forward tomahawk in hand . The retreat , the route , the massacre in the river ; the magnanimity of young Reynolds in dismounting in the midst of the butchery , and giving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sat down in despair to await the approach of the enemy ; the cool conduct of the supposed cowardly Netherland , who wheeled his steed upon the bank , and gathering a few horsemen around him , drove back the savages , who were tomahawking the footmen in the water ; the escape of Boone , who , having seen his son shot down at his side , dashed through the savage lines ; and , last of all , the sickening appearance of the battle-field , two days afterward , when Logan found the mangled bodies of sixty Kentuckians blackening in the hot sun upon the rocks and in the river . All these are familiar to the ears of the present generation , and render the Lower Blue Licks a name to be shuddered at even to this day . Upon our ancestors the blow fell like a clap of thunder . Sixty men killed ! To us who count our populations by the million it seems an insignificant loss , but to them it had a terrible significance ; for it meant one-fourth of the fighting men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when the Shawanees , Wyan dots , Ottawas , and Delawares , supported by the English in Canada , had just formed an alliance for the extermination of these settlements , and this was but the first effort of their confederated power . Who could tell then what the end would be when the beginning was so disastrous ? The early settlers of Kentucky were probably as brave a race as ever lived ; but this defeat following close upon those of Holder , Estell , and Floyd , struck them with bewilderment and dismay , and for the first time they really quailed before the arms of the savages . Almost every family in the country had lost some member in one of those actions , and the gloom was therefore universal , and was increased by the fact that so many of the recognized leaders were among the fallen . Todd , Trigg , Estell , Holder , young Boone , Harland , M'Bride , and Floyd , to whom the people had been accustomed to look for encouragement and guidance , had been cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest of them all still remained , ready and able as ever to meet the crisis . Clarke was at the Falls when the tidings of the massacre of the Blue Licks reached him , and in pursuance of his plan of never permitting any invasion to pass unpunished , he at once called the superior officers of his brigade to consult on the best means of inflicting a prompt retaliation . The council recommended a draft of men to make up any deficiency of volunteers , and the impressment of horses and provisions , should it be found necessary . But the public spirit of the people prccluded the necessity of any harsh measures , and men and horses and beeves poured in so rapidly , that in a remarkably short space of time two entire regiments were formed and on the march for the Ohio . Before the enemy , who had won the late battle , were safe in their own homes again the avengers of blood were upon their footsteps . On the last day of September Clarke assumed the command on the same spot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer before . At the head of one thousand mounted riflemen  --  the most efficient of all troops for such service , and now first employedhe crossed the Ohio on the same day , and pushing forward with his wonted energy , arrived undiscovered at the nearest Indian town , and within half a mile of the camp of the triumphant victors of the Blue Lick . Here a straggler caught sight of the advancing whites , and at once gave the alarm . The savages instantly fled , bearing the alarm to the various towns in the valley , whose inhabitants , thus warned , succeeded in making their escape without serious loss of life , but leaving their homes to the vengeance of the white men . The effects of this expedition is not to be calculated by the amount of blood shed , but by its influence on the future conduct of the Indians . Tried by this test its success was nearly complete . " It put an end to the formidable invasions of Kentucky . " The Indians had at last learned that every aggression would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own villages , and they became shy of offering the // provocation . They were also now made to realize for the first time the immense disproportion between their own numbers and those of the Big Knives , who immediately after receiving a blow that would have prostrated the power of the strongest among their own tribes for many years , were able to send so overwhelming a force to revenge that disaster . No considerable body ever afterward ventured across the Ohio , and the war thenceforward resume&amp; the desultory form it had borne during the years 1775- ' 76 . Such were the beneficial consequences of this last act of George Rogers Clarke in defense of his adopted State ; for here his career may be said to have ended , and had his life terminated at the same time he would have departed with a fame as full-orbed and splendid as any of the worthies of our revolutionary age . And that one dark spot , ominous of the approaching eclipse , would ere now have been forgotten or have passed unnoticed amidst the general radiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Falls as the most central point on the long frontier committed to his charge , and he applied his great mind to the petty but vexatious occupation of listening to the reports of spies and scouts , and repressing or chastising the incursions of fugitive bands of Indians bent more on plunder than war-duties befitting a superintendent of police rather than a commander of an army , and which must have been almost intolerable to a man of his ardent and enterprising temper . But he was soon to be deprived of even this poor resource against ennui . As long as the war lasted he had never ceased to hope that his darling project for the reduction of Detroit might meet with the approbation of his government , and that the career that had been checked in 1779 might yet be successfully resumed , and the work he had appropriated as his especial life-task completed . But the peace , which was about this time concluded , put an end at once and forever to all those long cherished hopes , and to his own public employment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison , of Virginia , on the 2d of July , 1783 , " and the distressed condition of the finances of the State , call on us to adopt the most prudent economy . It is for this reason alone that I have come to the determination to give over for the present all thought of carrying on offensive war with the Indians , which , you will easily perceive , will render unnecessary the employment of a general officer in that quarter , and will therefore consider yourself as out of command . But before I take leave , I feel called upon in the most forcible manner to return you my thanks , and those of my Council , for the very great and singular services you have rendered to your country by wresting so great and extensive a country out of the hands of the British enemy , repelling the attacks of their savage allies , and carrying on a successful war in the very heart of their country . This tribute of thanks and praise , so justly your due , I am happy to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " etc . With this , and a grant of a splendid tract of land lying in the present state of Indiana , opposite Louisville , George Rogers Clarke was finally dismissed from the service of his country . But if Virginia no longer had need of such talents , the General Government was compelled for years to continue the war against the Northwestern tribes ; and why the one man who had shown himself most consummately qualified for the situation , both by natural aptitude and long experience , should have been persistently neglected is hard to explain . Certainly the captor of Vincennes would have been more efficient than the timid and luxurious Wilkinson ; and would not , like Harrison , have sacrificed in weak detachments the best portion of an army of twelve hundred men ; or , like St. Clair , have exposed one of three thousand to utter route and destruction by an injudicious encampment . Had either of these armies been placed under the command of Clarke , the United States would have been saved the disgraceful experiences of that long and ill-managed war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederacy contemptible in the eyes even of the savages , and delayed their submission until General Wayne took the field in the latter year . But Clarke 's day of glory was over , and his career finished at an age when that of many has but just begun , and at thirty-one he was laid aside like a superannuated veteran . The very prime of that powerful and active genius was lost to his country , as well as to his own fame , and left to rust away in obscurity ; or , sadder still , to destroy itself by seeking a forbidden relief from vain longing and repinings , while war was raging along the whole frontier from Lake Huron to the confines of Florida ; and when at times it appeared as if the misdirected power of the whole continent combined would fail to hold that country which he , with a mere handful of men , had wrested from the hands of the English . At last , so inefficient was the protection afforded by the regular army , and so audacious had the attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentuckians thought it necessary once more to take their defense into their own hands . After three years of retirement Clarke was again called to take the command in an expedition against the tribes in Indiana . But he was no longer the leader who had waded the flooded Wabash to recapture Vincennes , and whose swift blows had so promptly avenged the fall of Ruddell 's Station , or the defeat of the Blue Licks . The army , numbering about twelve hundred men , marched from the Falls in the summer of 1786 toward Vincennes , expecting to meet at that point their provisions , which had been placed on keel-boats to be transported up the Wabash . But it soon became evident that the General no longer possessed that absolute ascendency over his soldiers which had rendered his former operations so marvelously rapid and energetic . A spirit of defiance among the superior officers , and of disaffection and iflsuhordin*-tion among the men , quickly began to manifest // itself . This was increased to absolute mutiny , when it was discovered that the commander had sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding whether they would have peace or war . This act , which at once destroyed all chance of effecting a surprise , would appear , at first sight , to indicate a state of mind bordering on fatuity . But it is all explained when we learn that the whole enterprise was unlawful , as Kentucky had no right to send , without the authority of the Federal Government , such an expedition against tribes living beyond her own borders ; tribes , too , with whom Clarke himself had , as United States Commissioner , negotiated a treaty of peace only one year before ; and he was naturally unwilling to make an unannounced attack upon people who had never been proved to have violated that treaty . His error was in accepting the command at all under these circumstances . At Vincennes the army was compelled to wait many days for the boats , and when they at last cama it was discovered that nearly all the provisions were spoiled . The spirit of mutiny now overcame all restraint , and Clarke seems no longer to have possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days afterward , when within a few leagues of the Indian town , three hundred men deliberately turned their backs and took up the line of march for home . But the force was still sufficiently strong to accomplish the main object of the expedition , and the General advised a rapid dash forward . The disorganization was , however , now too complete , and the men clamorously and insolently demanded an abandonment of any further attempt . Here , for the first time , Clarke made a long speech , and strove by every means to soothe the discontented and encourage the desponding . But it was in vain : his passionate appeals were all received with coldness , until at last the stern warrior , overcome with mortification and grief , burst into a passion of tears . Even this produced no effect on the mutineers . At length the officers , many of whom had fomented the disaffection on account of personal enmity to their leader , advised a retreat , and he , feeling his utter helplessness and inability to avert the disgrace , reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been expected fell back to Vincennes without striking a blow or having seen an enemy . Here it became entirely disorganized , and the men , breaking up into small squads , made the best of their way home , each " on his own hook . " This failure gave a blow to the reputation of Clarke from which it never recovered . Yet no vital error can be discovered in his conduct , and had his advice been followed success would have been certain . In vigor or generalship we can see no diminution : it was his ability to command obedience that was gone . If any useful lesson could be drawn from examples of this kind , what a moral might be painted here ! For who even once would dare to call the fascinating demon to his assistance when all the strength and reso lution of such a man as Clarke could not enable him to tear away the iron grip with which it fastens on its victim ? and if self-conceit were not the most pervading weakness of men , who could hope to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaluable services , the lofty mind , and pure patriotism of such a man , could not shield him from the inevitable consequences of his fault ? But let it not be forgotten that the primary causes of the failure of this expedition were not attributable to the leader himself , and that he only contributed to the disastrous result by having weakened powers which might have enabled him to surmount the difficulties thrown in his way by the malice and folly of others . Kentucky was at that time a hot-bed of intrigues and intriguers . We do not believe a country can be named whose history reveals such an amount of secret and underhand dealing . Her whole early history , between the year 1783 and the breaking out of the late war with England , consists , when closely examined , of one perplexing maze of secret machinations and treasonable and dishonorable intrigues . One of the most deeply implicated in many of these was that political and military Proteus , General James Wilkinson , whose character and career is even yet a mystery . Engaged in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgoyne , lie aided his patron and his clique to sting Arnold into treason , and in the plot to supemsede Washington as Commander-in-Chief . Moving to Kentucky at the close of the ivar , we find him shipping tobacco to New Orleans , as the accomplice in a corrupt partnership of the Spanish Governor , and soon afterward swearing allegiance to his Catholic Majesty , and engaged with Sebastian and others in the plot to separate Kentucky from the Union and incorporate it with the Province of Louisiana . A fe*v years later , he appears in the capacity of General.inChief of the American army in the Southwest , yet corresponding with Aaron Burr in cipher , and receiving assurances that " Wilkinson shall be second only to Burr in the new empire " about to be formed , out of the dominions of the sovereign to whom he had a little while before sworn himself a subject ; and his opinion asked to whether the conspirators should begin their operations by seizing . on the principal post of the Province intrusted to his charge by the Government whose armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold him threatening to employ that army in a filibustering raid into the territory of his old master the King of Spain , for his own personal aggrandizement ; while , twelve months afterward , we are edified by the spectacle of his betraying the whole scheme to the President , when there was no longer a possibility of its success-scattering the poor remnant of the expedition as it fled down the Mississippi , hunting his so lately acknowledged leader through the cypress swamps , and throwing one of his most prominent confederates into prison . Wilkinson had made his home in Kentucky // after the close of the Revolutionary war , and at once undertook to raise himself to the lead in all her affairs . His qualifications as a demagogue were high : he was polished and insinuating in manner , and ( according to Mr. Marshall ) had made the discovery " that if the way to the hearts of women lay through their eyes , the most direct way to those of men was down their throats . " His revolutionary fame was considerable , and connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acted as Gates 's aid at Stillwater and Bemis 's Heights , had borne the tidings of vict&amp;ry to Congress , and been lauded in the dispatches of his commander . But in Kentucky he found in George Rogers Clarke one whose fame was far superior to his own , and whose popularity had hitherto been unbounded , and he hated and quarreled with him , as he did with Wayne and every one else who was his own superior . Besides , Wilkinson was then engaged in his plot to " precipitate " - that was the word-the Western people , not only into a violent separation from Virginia , but into secession from the Confederacy . With this view , he and his accomplices had done their best to magnify the delinquencies of the General Government , in not defending the frontier against the Indians ; and persuaded the settlers to take the matter into their own hands , by organizing this unlawful expedition against tribes with whom the United States were at peace . This was done in the hope of embroiling the two governments in a dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the proud-spirited Kentuckians were at the moment enraged and mortified by a defeat ; for the General had been engaged in too many intrigues , and was too well acquainted with the perversities and weaknesses of human nature , not to know that men are easily led into rash and violent measures while laboring under the angry excitement of recent failure . With this end in view , and also in order to rid himself of a personal rival , Wilkinson , who was then residing , or rather tarrying , at Louisville during the assemblingof the armythere , had done all in his power to foster and extend the spirit of disaffection that had even then begun to manifest itself among the men . Scarcely was the disastrous result known at that point , when he wrote , exultingly , to a friend in Lexington , " The sun of General Clarke 's military glory has set never more to rise ! " " There was , " says a contemporary historian , " a meaning in this sentence which those who had fathomed Wilkinson knew how to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the letter . Clarke 's military reputation suffered an eclipse from which it never emerged ; nor did he ever recover the personal popularity he had lost by this miserable affair , and henceforth lived neglected , not only hy the nation to which he had rendered such inestimable services , hut also by the State which may be said to have owed its very existence to him . For six years his acts had constituted almost the whole history of Kentucky and the West . At the age of thirty-four he disappears so completely from that history that , during the thirty-two succeeding years of his life , his name is to be found only upon one obscure page thereof . Of that one reappearance on the public stage it is both unnecessary and unpleasant to speak at length ; for it was in a character entirely unworthy of his former renown , and is connected with a passage of our national history on which no true patriot can reflect without humiliation . When in 1794- ' 95 , the insolent Frenchman , Genet-supported , it must he confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a proconsulship in the United States , and to reduce our country to the rank of a mere satellite of the French Republic , George Rogers Clarke accepted at his hand a commission of Major-General iu the armies of France , and Commander-in-Chief of an expedition to be organized in violation of the laws of his country , and in defiance of the proclamations of Washington , for the purpose of attacking the Spanish provinces in the South . A proclamation , which , it is to be hoped , was not Clarke 's composition , was issued in his name , offering the plunder of an inoffensive people as a bribe to the reckless adventurers of the West to enlist under the tricolored flag . A counter-revolution in France , however , saved Clarke from the disgrace of carrying out this programme , and merging the character of a patriot-soldier in that of a filibustering adventurer . The party that had been raiscd to power in Paris by the revolution of Thermidor disavowed all the acts of Genet and his agents , and annulled the commissions granted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he had thus been for a short time elevated . Though still a comparatively young man , disease and premature decrepitude had already seized upon him . Rheumatism , that fell foe of the early pioneers , followed by partial paralysis , reduced him to a state of almost childish helplessness . But still he lived on until he had seen the country , whose hounds he himself had carried to the Mississippi , extended to the Pacific ; and until he had seen another accomplish the designs which he himself had so ardently wished to attempt  --  the final annihilation of the British influence in the Northwest . The country whose struggle for existence he had witnessed and assisted in youth had become the undisputed mistress of the New World ; and was just taking its place as one of the great powers of the earth when his own existence terminated . He died of paralysis in February , 1818 , at his residence near Louisville  --  the city which he himself had founded forty-eight years before . His remains lie interred at Locust Grove , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fame ; for none such marks the resting-place of the illustrious founder of Kentucky .
