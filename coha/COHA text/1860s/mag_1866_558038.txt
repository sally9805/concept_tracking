shaken . Those who look for subtilties , finesse , and strategical combinations , such as are too often displayed on the chessboard of European politics , will be disappointed . The late administration , in its intercourse with other nations , chose to consider that governments are subject to the same rules of morality as individuals . The spirit manifested was frank , generous , and consistent . The policy was simple and thoroughly American , based upon the Jeffersonian maxim of good faith and honest friendship with all nations , entangling alliances with none . Of necessity it was a defensive policy ; and while some important treaties were negotiated , its chief merit is not in what it developed , but in what it prevented . It was , however , the policy for the times ; and if the national pride was sometimes wounded , the country 's honor was never surrendered . We purpose in this article to touch upon some of the leading points in the diplomatic history of the late IRebellion , as illustrated in the volumes of correspondence issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Americans , eager for results and impatient of delays ; and we are apt to consider the management of foreign relations as a system of political chicanery , a science of prudent delays adopted by nations seeking to outwit one another while each pursues its secret schemes of aggrandizement . That this is a partial and illiberal view of the subject need not here be argued ; but no candid person can read these volumes without feeling that the history of our foreign relations during the last four years is closely identified with the cause of civilization , - that it is America 's complete vindication pronounced before the assembled powers of the earth , that most solemn of human tribunals . We should feel proud vf the record . It exhibits an enlarged and comprehensive statesmanship . And surely , when we consider that from the outset the two leading powers of Europe , jealous of our growth and hostile to demo cratic principles , persisted in a course of action which aimed at our dissolution ; that they concerted schemes for the encouragement of the disloyal , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were for four years constrained to postpone the question of recognition , and to respect a blockade not at all times complete , from which they suffered greatly ; - // when we consider that a single indiscreet act , an official despatch arrogant or tamely submissive in its tone , might have involved us in a hopeless war ; that no opportunity was afforded them of intervention , either as open enemies or under the guise of a friendly mediation ; that as neutrals they were held to observance of the laws of neutrality , and at last compelled to withdraw their concession of belligerent rights and to acknowledge the supremacy of the Union of these States , - surely the foreign policy of President Lincoln may be pronounced no less successful than honorable . When President Lincoln 's term commenced , our foreign relations were in a pitiable state , and all things seemed hastening to destruction . The friends of the Union abroad were lukewarm and divided , while the new Confederacy was vigorously urging its claims . Influential partisans of the latter had already been secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from abroad ; and with the conviction that cotton was king , they appealed not altogether in vain to the jealousy and cupidity of our commercial rivals . Our new tariff , already unpopular in England and France , was made doubly odious through their efforts . The new President was assailed with coarse abuse and ridicule , as the vulgar leader of a root-and-branch party . The monarchical tendencies of the Southern planters found favor with the cabinets of Europe , and their doctrines of Secession and State Rights had been so generally accepted that the sources of public opinion were poisoned . Meantime the diplomatic and consular agents of the United States were remiss in their duties . Some secretly favored the Confederates , others manifested an indifference scarcely less injurious to the national cause . Mr. Faulkner , Minister to France , and Mr. Preston , to Spain , had the insolence , in their official despatche* , to warn the Executive , with threats , against what they termed " coercion " ; while the former , as there is reason to believe , was treacherous enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for insurrectionary purposes . An entire change was made in the foreign appointments under the new administration ; and although the leading missions were filled before the necessity of civil war had determined // the President 's policy , scarcely an impoi*tant change has since been made . The nation was fortunate in securing Mr. Seward as Secretary of State . Charles Francis Adams , at the Court of St. James , stands deservedly first among our ministers , and has attained the highest diplomatic honors . Mr. Dayton performed his duties with dignity and ability to the day of his death . Mr. Corwin , by reason of his course in Congress relative to the last war , had a strong personal hold upon the feelings of the Mexican people . Some of the less important missions were admirably conducted . Nor should the consuls at Liverpool and London be forgotten , who watched with sleepless vigilance the British privateers and collected important information as to their movements . The instructions issued by Mr. Seward to the new ministers set forth the general principles of the foreign policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards was the key-note of this policy . The idea of a dissolution , or even of a compromise , was not to be entertained for a moment . It was announced that the chief duty of our diplomatic agents would be to counteract the schemes of Rebels abroad . Foreign nations were to be assured of our determination and ability t&amp;maintain our own cause without their assistance . So long as they should abstain from encouraging the insurgents , we desired and courted their alliance , but they could not favor our enemies and remain our friends . The merits of the controversy between North and South , as though it was a question admitting of argument , were not to be discussed ; and that strength might not be wasted on side issues , the topic of slavery was to be avoided . Some of the commercial advantages resulting from a continuance of this Union were suggested , especially with reference to England and France ; but no promises of special favors were held out as arguments for our side . As to the dissatisfaction existing in England on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , if ruinous to her interests , it was likely to prove injurious to us as well , and that after all a tariff could easily he modified by Congress whenever change should be shown desirable . Above all , the duty of generous forbearance was urged ; and the representatives of the Union were directed not to indulge in expressions of harsh // ness , or even of impatience , concerning their misguided countrymen . " If the scourge of civil war for the first time in our history must fall upon our country during the term of this administration , " is the admirable language of Secretary Seward to Mr. Adams , " that calamity will then have come through the agency , not of the government , but of those who shall have chosen to be its armed , open , and irreconcilable enemies ; and the President will not suffer himself to doubt that , when the value of the imperilled Union shall be brought in that fearful manner home to the business and the bosoms of the American people , they will , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rise up and save it . " * Our relations with Great Britain and France were from the first of absorbing importance . The former saw in the approaching conflict the possible annihilation of her commercial rival , and , with " Divide and conquer " for her motto , shaped her course accordingly . The latter , projecting brilliant schemes of conquest , and aiming to secure a foothold on the Western continent , pursued , but with far more stealth and caution , a similar policy . Had either of these nations manifested a just and liberal spirit , civil war might have been speedily crushed , and certainly some of its greatest evils would have been avoided . But although we had maintained peaceful relations with them for half a century , it soon became apparent that their moral support would be wanting . The Confederates drew " the very breath of life " ( as Mr. Adams termed it ) from the belief of a speedy recognition and the ambiguous expressions of Earl IRussell and M. Thouvenel . The disposition of the former to hold unofficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between France and England to act together in American affairs , of which other European powers were notified , indicated a hostile spirit even before the fall of Fort Sumter . Scarcely had the first note of war sounded , however , before that policy of neutrality was proclaimed which has since proved fruitful of disaster . Great Britain led off , France followed ; Spain and most of the smaller European powers brought up the rear . They neither waited for official information of the // blockade , nor allowed our ministers time to present their credentials and explain the purposes of the new administration . They hastened to welcome an insurgent faction , struggling to perpetuate the worn-out system of negro slavery , before it had exhibited an armed vessel on the ocean , or achieved a single victory save that of starving into surrender a handful of brave men who would not betray their country 's flag . The practical effect of this policy was to encourage Rebel depredations on the ocean , to resolve the war for maintaining the integrity of this Union into a mere contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high seas under the name of privateering . President Lincoln pressed earnestly , whenever there was an opportunity , for the withdrawal of the belligerent rights so hastily and so unjustly conferred ; but Great Britain and France would not yield , until Grant had given the death-blow to the Rebellion ; and even then , on the part of Great Britain , there were such qualifications as allowed the Shenandoah to harass American shipping for months after the restoration of peace . In another paint of view this conduct was extraordinary . By their accession to the convention of Paris these two nations had committed themselves to the abolition of privateering , as a practice contrary to the spirit of civilized warfare . But with such professions of humanity they countenanced and encouraged an application of the old rule beyond example harsh and violent . It is true that our government , under Presidents Pierce and Buchanan , had not acceded to this convention ; but Secretary Seward , on receiving intelligence of the Queen 's proclamation , anticipated foreign complications which the Rebels would seek in every method to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume negotiations , with the view of making the United States a party to the new principles of international law ; but Great Britain and France refused to admit our accession to the treaty of Paris , - which would have bound them to aid in sweeping American privateers from the ocean , - except with the distinct stipulation that its provisions should have no bearing , direct or indirect , upon the war then existing . Here the subject dropped , and simultaneously with this failure on our part the work of the Southern cruisers began . // The relations of the United States with Great Britain during the Rebellion have been so fully discussed , that we seem , in considering them , to be entering territory already occupied . Earl Russell 's diplomacy exhibited little reserve , while the pulse of the English nation was steadily held by Mr. Adams , and each vibration promptly recorded . Bound to us by ties of a common lineage , language , and literature , Great Britain nevertheless chose to be the most conspicuous of our antagonists . Privateers were sheltered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The British press was subservient to the interests of Secessionists ; blockade-running was almost exclusively a British diversion , the risks being taken by British insurance companies ; British capitalists invested in the Southern loans ; British subjects in the United States were Rebel agents and emissaries ; British merchants furnished ammunition and supplies . More than this . Great Britain was for two years the naval base of Rebel operations . Piratical vessels built and equipped in British ports , and manned with British gunners , issued forth one by one and roamed at large upon the ocean to prey upon our commerce , seldom anchoring in a Southern harbor , and never bringing in their captures for judicial proceedings . While the national cause appeared to falter , the clamor was loud for intervention ; when each new campaign brought fresh hopes of success , the cry was fainter ; when the glorious victories of Gettysburg , Vickbsurg , and Port Hudson were announced , it finally died away . The late administration has sometimes been censured for holding out false hopes as to the speedy termination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pr'wiictions of Secretary Seward exposed him to reproach and ridicule . So far as the published volumes of correspondence show , such announcements were based upon the contingency that England and France should discountenance the schemes of the insurgents . Granting , however , that the military strength of the Rebellion was underrated , - which is simply to admit that man is fallible , - it may be doubted whether anything short of absolute faith in our ultimate success would have brought about our ultimate triumph . Possunt quict posse videntur . Our strength lay in our confidence of strength . Lord Bacon , if we // 453 Our Diplomacy during the Rebellion . mistake not , regards it as the maxim of a wise statesman in time of danger to lead the people from hope to hope . Would America have undertaken with zeal the salvation of this Union , believing that the contest would last four weary and painful years ? - Or would Europe have hovered in anxiety over the battle-field so long , and not pounced down upon her coveted prey ? Twice were matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Earl Russell after the capture of Mason and Slidell ; secondly , by Secretary Seward , when that decision was rendered in the Alexandra case which practically annulled the Enlistment Act , and protected the equipment of hostile vessels in neutral ports . The skill with which our government handled so delicate a topic of controversy as the Trent affair , and turned Great Britain 's weapon against herself , has called forth the general tribute of respect and admiration . If ever silence on the part of the Executive was golden , it was at that moment when Captain Wilkes arrived in port with the Rebel envoys . The spontaneous impulse of the people , already sensitive to English affronts , was to adopt , without regard to consequences , an act appealing strongly to the sentiment of national pride by its very audacity . Congress was in session , and the House of Representatives passed a vote of thanks to the commander of the San Jacinto . Statesmen were carried *away by their feelings in the midst of the general excitement . But , uninfluenced by prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . The ground was calmly surveyed , and the subject viewed in its future as well as its present bearings . There was no necessity of raising a point of honor ; nothing had been said or done to commit the government ; the recreant knights-errant of diplomacy were to be held in custody until the case was decided , and principles of international law should determine our course of action . Were Mason and Slidell included as Rebel envoys under the term " contraband of war , " and therefore subject to capture ? Granting that such was the case , was the method of their capture justifiable ? Was not the right of search strenuously resisted by America in 1812 ? Would our interests as a commercial power be promoted by the // April , Our Diplomacy during the Rebellion . adoption of a precedent which allows a belligerent commander to settle questions of confiscation on the deck of a neutral steamer ? If not , was it wise to plunge into a foreign war , while the national resources were strained in suppressing domestic insurrection ? Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I decide this case in favor of nay own government , " wrote Secretary Seward in that remarkable letter which proclaimed the liberation of the prisoners , " I must disavow its most cherished principles , and reverse and forever abandon its essential policy . The country can not afford the sacrifice . If I maintain those principles and adhere to that policy , I must surrender the case itself . " * Had . President Lincoln , catching the breeze of popular favor , accepted the challenge of Great Britain , and gone to war for the sake of gratifying a false sense of national honor , the consequences must have been disastrous . All Europe protested against the seizure of the Trent as illegal , - which fact , however , was not known at the time of his decision , and had no influence upon it . Southern disloyalists , according to their historian , Mr. Pollard , looked upon the Trent affair as a special dispensation , and their friends in Congress , under the lead of Vallandigham , attempted to force a war by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration brought to its support the sober second-thought of the people . Europe , so far from looking upon this decision as a weak surrender , accepted it as the strongest indication of our good judgment and honest intentions . In Great Britain there was a temporary reaction in our favor . The opponents of the Union were baffled ; the question of recognition was postponed ; and the North found time for developing its resources . The British government stood committed to a precedent which tended to restrain the proverbial tendencies of England on the ocean ; while America gave more convincing proof than ever before that the difficult lesson of self-government had been mastered . Our second crisis came nearly two years later . There was then a better feeling in the British community . The war to suppress insurrection had in the fulness of time become a // 1866 . Our Diplomacij during the Rebellion . moral revolut*ion ; the idea of a restoration of the Union with its Constitution unchanged and unimpaired had been slowly abandoned ; and freedom was at length inscribed on the banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without its effects on a nation which had professed a stolid indifference to the merits of the original controversy , and had stigmatized the war on our part as a contest for empire , taking the view that a certain number of States sought to be released from a burdensome compact , while the others would not suffer them to depart in peace . The decree of emancipation called out the friends of freedom and reform , - a party always strong and vigorous ; and numerous addresses of sympathy were issued by the anti-slavery societies and trades ' unions in England , and forwarded to President Lincoln through Mr. Adams . The poorer classes turned their thoughts to a home in the New World ; and emigration was stimulated and encouraged by this government as part of the regenerating work of its new career . Lord Palmerston 's Ministry , which , despite its aristocratic bearing , leaned to the popular and liberal side , now softened its tone , and a better spirit toward the United States was indicated in the spring of 1863 by Earl Russell 's speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alexandra . But the relations of the two countries were by no means satisfactory . It was now our turn to complain . We had tasted the sweets of British neutrality , and scarcely a week passed without bringing home to our merchants the news of some fresh spoliation on the high seas . American shipping was seeking protection under a foreign flag . Congress had authorized the President to issue letters of marque and reprisal . Mr. Adams had been promptly instructed to present the Alabama claims to the British government , and to press them discreetly ; but Earl Russell repudiated all responsibility for our wrongs . The wealthy and conservative classes were still bitterly hostile . The Confederate cotton loan had been entirely taken up by them . New privateers were on the stocks , and the Lairds had commenced two formidable iron rams for operations against Northern cities . In Parliament a violent party , under Mr. Roebuck , sought to compel the immediate recognition of the Southern Confederacy . The Alabama controversy had drawn // out the suggestion from the British Secretary , that mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of the two countries more effective ; but when Secretary Seward acceded to the proposal , it appeared that the Lord Chancellor considered the present act already sufficient , and that the Cabinet would consent to no change . Five months later , a fitting commentary upon this vacillating conduct was furnished by the decision of the Chief Baron of the Exchequer in the Alexandra case , to the effect that fitting out vessels and selling them for hostile purposes was no breach of the Enlist ment Act . This last piece of jugglery was not to be endured . The tide of military success had turned in our favor ; and Secretary Seward now plainly declared , that , if the Alexandra doctrine should be sus*tained in the higher court , one of two things remained , - either that Great Britain should remedy the defects of the existing laws by additional legislation , or that the United States would protect its commerce against Liverpool armed cruisers as against the naval forces of a public enemy , and would claim and insist upon indemnity for its injuries . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement of the July victories , and the perilous situation of European politics ; brought the Palmerston Ministry to a better comprehension of its duties . Henceforth there was a disposition to maintain neutral obligations , and avoid rupture with a government which had so formidable a navy to enforce its demand . The tone of Parliament changed . The iron rams were detained by order of the crown , and held for trial . But in the courts justice was not swift-footed . The Alexandra case , like a wounded snake , dragged its slow length ltp to the House of Lords , and was lost in its own convolutions ; and to relieve themselves of a dilemma , the officers of government were obliged to purchase the iron-clads . Only one case , that of the Pampero , was prosecuted to a successful issue in the Scotch courts , and the sentence of condemnation actually pronounced . The struggle rapidly degenerated into a mere effort on the Weaker side to do all the mischief possible ; and while the rescue of Seinmes at the sinking of the Alabama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albans raid , showed that British friendship was the result of expediency rather than conviction , the danger of foreign war was over . That sort of laissez-faire policy which the Palmerston Min* istry early adopted in American matters , and which indirectly abetted the enemies of this Union , contrasts strongly with the vigilance and activity of late displayed in suppressing Fenianism . No one can doubt that a vigorous enforcement of the Enlistment Act would llave prevented England from becoming the modern rival of the Barbary powers ; and in spite of a jealous aristocracy , avaricious traders , and obsequious judges , the Southern cause would have withered for want of root . It is the duty of neutral nations to protect their good faith against the efforts of all ill-disposed subjects ; and if a conviction can not always be procured , prompt legal prosecution will sometimes clear the atmosphere wonderfully . When the French Revolution was at its height , and Minister Genet , with the prestige of his government to aid him , undertook to launch privateers from American ship-yards against the proud mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult . " Is the Minister of the French Republic to set the acts of this government at defiance with impunity ? " was his indignant exclamation . Not long after , he signed a treaty which provided indemnity for the losses sustained by Great Britain through the remissness of subordinate officers , deeming it not derogatory to his country 's dignity to remove a blemish from its fair name . How has this conduct been rewarded ? British neutrality during the Rebellion was a gilded fraud . There was no strong arm to interpose the law between popular sympathy and public duty . Judicial decisions were invariably inspired by the desires of the hour . Our minister and consuls made the complaints , collect , . ed the evidence , and put the wheels of justice in motion ; the crown officers , the customs commissioners , - whose " wilful blindness and credulous partiality " were well understood by Mr. Adams , - the judiciary itself , interposed delays and impediments . The United States , in such cases as the Trent , Perthshire , and Labuan , manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it conflicted with our interests ; but Great Britain made her own opinion her law , and , blindly // pursuing a selfish policy , founded her justification on the maxim , " The king can do no wrong , " or , as modern authority has it , " Her Majesty 's government are the sole custodians of their own honor . " We have not touched upon the Alabama controversy , because it has been exhausted by others , and is well understood by our readers . Mr. Adams has ably argued the case for this government ; and the British nation can hardly suffer the subject to rest where Earl Russell , in his obstinacy and ill-temper , has seen fit to place it . We can not retrace our steps ; the time may come when the British government will wish to retrace theirs . Let reparation be made quickly , that it may be made honorably , before British merchants find their traffic given over to savage corsairs , - before it is too late to wipe out an infamous precedent , - before experience teaches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that privateering will take its place with piracy , and be at once and forever abolished from the code of civilized and Christian nations . Neutral precedents have sometimes been adduced in defence of this covert war upon American commerce . Questions of international policy must be determined by broader considerations ; and a case precisely analogous to our own can not be found in history . The rogue sometimes goes unwhipt of justice , because the law is of limited application and can not reach him ; but nations , in their mutual intercourse , are not hampered by narrow rules or technical constructions . If existing laws are insufficient , the remedy is at hand . If officials are remiss in their duties , they can be removed . There is a philosophy , as well as a law , in politics , which can not safely be disregarded . To sum up the case , no language can be more forcible than that of the statesman at the Court of St. James : " That Great Britain did , in the most terrible moment of our domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly professed to abhor , coldly and at once assume Our inability to master it , and then become the only foreign nation steadily contributing , in every indirect way possible , to verify its prejudgment. " * // The conduct of the Emperor Napoleon during the Rebellion was not such as to inspire confidence in either his wisdom or integrity . There was a certain show of fairness in his neutral policy , which contrasted favorably with the demeanor of his neighbors across the Channel ; but while professing the most earnest solicitude for our welfare , he was secretly developing schemes , which , as he well knew , depended for their success upon the downfall of our Republic . France , " our earliest friend and only ally , " whose sword was drawn in the cause of American independence , and whose name was once a talisman to the oppressed , little resembled that imperial nursling which to-day rears its head among the nations , begotten , bred , and brought up by the heir of a great name , who , " Having both the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state To what tune pleased his ear . " The Mexican policy of the Emperor , not yet fully understood , and still looming up dark and doubtful in the horizon , aroused the alarm and suspicion of our government at an early day , and now deserves especial consideration . At the outbreak of the Southern insurrection , Mexico was in an exhausted condition , after a long war of factions . Scarcely the shadow of a republic remained . The Juarez administration had neither sufficient force nor hold on the public confidence to maintain order . Guerilla bands infested the mountain passes ; the transportation of the mails was irregular and uncertain ; highway robberies were of frequent occurrence ; and a member of the American legation , journeying from the capital to Vera Cruz , had been waylaid and murdered . The archives at Washington were filled with complaints of rapacity , cruelties , and violation of contracts . European residents in Mexico suffered wrongs similar to our own ; and so serious had this chaotic condition of affairs become , that the establishment of a protectorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic when Buchanan 's term of office expired . But President Lincoln favored neither intervention nor the peaceable annexation of Mexico . His policy was humane , generous , and disinterested . Recognizing the duty which rested // upon the United States , in common with the Spanish-American republics , of protecting constitutional liberty on this continent , so far as comported with the sovereignty of independent governments , - willing , moreover , to refrain , for the time being , from pressing our indemnity claims , - he desired that Mexico should retain its integrity , unimpaired by external influences , . and by a prudent course of conduct should avoid the danger of Southern , no less than European aggression . Mr. Corwin , before setting out , was instructed to keep this object in view , to cultivate friendly relations with the Juarez government , to gain the confidence of the Mexican people , and to show that his mission was characterized by a spirit " earnestly American , in the continental sense of the word , and fraternal in no affected or mere diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm was ready to burst upon this unhappy people , and the impolicy of the ruling administration hastened their calamities . On the 17th of July , 1861 , a law was passed suspending for two years the payment of interest on the foreign debt , which was held chiefly by Spain and Great Britain . A quarrel immediately ensued . France and England suspended diplomatic intercourse with the Mexican republic , and eitered into negotiations for a joint expedition . Spain also became a party to their agreement , having wrongs of her own to settle . On the 31st of October a treaty was ratified at London , by which the contracting powers bound themselves to send a naval and military force to Mexico , for the alleged purpose of demanding more efficient protection for the persons and properties of their subjects and the fulfilment of obligations . A clause , which was inserted through the persistent efforts of Great Britain , contrary to the wishes of her colleagues , provided that the allied powers should not seek " any acquisition of territory nor special advantage , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prejudice the right of the Mexican nation to choose and constitute freely the form of its government . " t President Lincoln was notified of this alliance , and invited to become a party to it ; but it had been arranged that there should be no delay for his reply . He declined the proposition , * Mexican Affairs , 1862 , p. 5. t Ibid. , p. 136. // admitting the right of these powers to judge for themselves the propriety of war , but expressing the hope that , in accordance with their own solemn declarations , they would refrain from attempts to subvert existing institutions in Mexico . A plan was submitted at the same time , suggested by Mr. Corwin and approved by the Secretary of State , providing that the United States should advance the interest on the Mexican debt on proper security given by that government , and thus avert the necessity of foreign invasion . This proposal was unsatisfactory to the triple alliance ; and although a treaty was negotiated with Mexico on this basis , the Senate objected on general principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Spain took the initiative , eager for military glory . In the latter part of December her fleet appeared off the Mexican coast . Vera Cruz and the Castle of San Ji , ian d'Ulloa surrendered without firing a gun , and in the name of the allies were held as security for their demands . Napoleon , fearful of losing control of the movement , despatched , on learning this news , a larger force of French troops than had been originally contemplated , as an offset to the Spanish contingent . Great Britain , lukewarm and not over sanguine as to results , sent only seven hundred marines , who were soon recalled . President Juarez wished for a peaceful settlement with the allies . The obnoxious law of repudiation - justified only by reason of the general impoverishment of the country - had already been repealed . The Commissioners under the treaty were received with courtesy , and allowed to advance towards the interior . At Soledad , on the 19th of February , 1862 , preliminaries were signed which recognized the sovereignty of the existing government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on landing had proclaimed to the Mexican people the honesty of their inteutions4 , Orizaba was fixed upon as * Mexican Affairs , 1862 , p. 187 ; Thid. , 1863 , p . Set seq . Earl Russell states that he proposed making the United States a party to the triple alliance , and that France acceded , but not without hesitation . M. Thouvenel , on the other hand , contradicts the assertion , and says that France first suggested the invitation . The correspond . ence with Spain seems to confirm Earl Russell 's statement . t " They deceive you who would make you believe that behind our pretensions , as just as they are legitimate , come enveloped plans of conquest and restoration , and of interfering in your politics and government . " See Mexican Affairs , 1862 , p. 177. // the place of meeting for adjustment of mutual difficulties , and the day named was the 1st - afterwards the 15th - of April . But in the mean time a controversy sprung up . Almonte , a Mexican refugee , picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool for his ambitious designs , landed at Vera Cruz , and , claiming the protection of the French flag , entered into correspondence with the enemies of the administration . President Juarez demanded that he should leave the country . This seemed right to the English and Spanish Commissioners , but those of France refused to give him up . So gross and wanton a violation of the treaty of London and the Soledad preliminaries could not be countenanced . The triple alliance was dissolved . Great Britain and Spain withdrew their forces ; and France was left , as General Prim declared on parting from the country , to erect an imperial throne for the Archduke Maximilian. * The mask was now thrown off . The French Commissioners , pretending that fresh insults had been offered them , joined hands with the Almonte revolutionists , and proclaimed war against the constituted authorities of Mexico . They appealed to the people to shake off the yoke of an oppressive minority , - as they termed the Juarez administration , - and to elect a government for themselvqs . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the language of the invaders ; " and that banner will not retreat . Let all honest men receive it as a friendly banner : let only madmen dare to attack it . " Great Britain doubtless joined the expedition simply to secure her material interests . She took care to hamper her dangerous colleagues with restrictions , and extricated herself from the embroilment as soon as possible . A fair adjustment of the British claims might have prevented the joint invasion ; for liberal terms were proposed at an early day , which the Mexican Congress rcjected . Spain in all probability contemplated conquest ; but afterwards , perceiving her own plan impracticable , swung round to the side of Great Britain , through jealousy of the Maximilian movement . But France // from the outset had sinister designs , and resolved to force a quarrel . A random shot fired during a drunken brawl in the streets of Mexico was magnified into the attempted assassination of the French Minister , M. Saligny . While the treaty of London was under consideration , the Mexican Ambassador sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reconciliation in accordance with his instructions . He was interrupted hastily by M. Thouvenel : " We will not allow any explanation . We have given our orders in concert with England ; and you will know through our Minister and our Admiral what are the demands of France . " When the allies made up their accounts , the French claims were stated at the exorbitant estimate of twelve millions , including matters not specified by treaties , while their portion of the Mexican loan was only two hundred thousand dollars ; and when the allies remonstrated , the reply was , " Each nation is the sole umpire of its demands . " War was therefore the object and the necessary result of the French policy . The bold words of the invaders were not borne out by their first acts . General Lorencez advanced with his forces upon Puebla , but was repulsed and forced to retire . The summer was pas*ed in idleness at Orizaba . The initiative could not be resumed without fresh troops ; Mexican guerillas cut off communication with the sea-coast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe the news of this disaster strengthened the general impression that the foolhardy enterprise would be abandoned , and the Mexican people left to pull down and build up their own institutions . Not such was Napoleon 's purpose . He determined to send reinforcements , and asked of the legislative body an additional credit of fifteen million francs , which was unanimously voted . General Forey was appointed to the chief command , and invested with diplomatic powers superior to those of the French Commissioners . Almonte , who had assumed the title of supreme chief of the Mexican Republic , was ordered to dissolve his ministry , to abstain from issuing decrees , and to L*1ow strictly further orders , placing himself under the new commander . General Forey , upon his arrival at Vera Cruz , proclaimed that the object of the French government was to liberate the Mexican // people , and then allow them to select freely their form of government . The grievances of France were no longer the pretext for war . It was to be a mission of civilization , in the Napoleonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fire and sword . Before the month of November ended , about forty-two thousand French troops had landed on the Gulf coast , and General Forey took up his line of march for Puebla. * The mystic autograph letter of Napoleon to Forey , written before the latter departed from France , throws considerable light on the imperial designs in America . The plan of establishiiig a strong government of the Latin race in Mexico to counterpoise the great Republic - this government to be , if possible , a monarchy - is set forth in unmistakable terms . It is not for the interest of France , the Emperor argues , that the United States shall seize all the Mexican Gulf , and thence command the Antilles as well as South America , and dispense the products of the New World . " If , on the other hand , Mexico maintains her independence and the integrity of her territory , if a stable government be there constituted with the assistance of France , we shall have restored to the Latin race on th' other side of the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed security to our West India colonies and to those of Spain ; we shall have established our friendly influence in the centre of America ; and that influence , by creating immense markets for our commerce , will procure us the raw materials indispensable for our manufactures . " t Such was the brilliant picture conjured up by the imperial fancy . Europe was to regenerate the New World ; the course of empire was in a literal sense to take its way westward ; and Napoleon was to be the Columbus of the enterprise . The conquest of Mexico was thus the primary object of the Emperor 's policy . The dismemberment of the Federal Union was secondary , but none the less necessary . So far as we were * Mexican Affairs , 1863 , pp. 194 , 341 . Great credit is due M.

In spite of that fanaticism which is a distinguishing trait of his character , Napoleon was not the man to commit himself . He did not often reduce his plans to writing , nor , having done so , suffer them to be divulged . No one could be more prudent in his means or selfish in his ends . He was a master of words , an adept in ambiguities . Cold , crafty , and unscrupulous , gracious in his manners , but of impenetrable reserve , he excelled in that dissimulation which misleads without falsifying , and that duplicity which passes with the simple for diplomacy . He was the master spirit of European politics . Intrigue was his weapon ; his movements were covered by throwing forward his allies ; and if necessary to beat a retreat , he contrived to cast the odium upon others . The imperial policy must be studied , therefore , rather in the light of deeds than of words . Suspicion was soon directed to the French designs in Mexico , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not rush into foreign war while suppressing a domestic insurrection of vast proportions ; and the Jnarez government had not exhibited such proof of skill or stability as to encourage the hope that open interference in its behalf would result favorably . Mr. Dayton was instructed to ascertain the Emperor 's intentions as early as September , 1861 , and to acquaint him with our express desire that Mexico should remain independent . M. Thouvenel replied , with emphasis , that France and England meant merely to realize their money debt , * The same assurances were given repeatedly , as Mr .. * And yet at this time , as appears from a despatch of M. Thouvenel , dated October 11 , 1861 , he was urging upon Earl Russell that the proposed treaty should be so worded as not to prevent the exercise eventually of a " le , itimate participation " in the events which their operations might originate in Mexico . These are his words : " It is evidently the interest both of France and England to see there established such a state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devolopment of our exchanges with a country so richly endowed .

If the Mexicaas themselves , being tired of their trials and decided to react against the disasters of // Dayton 's despatches show , while the triple alliance lasted . The Emperor had no desire , it was said , to interfere in any way with the internal government of Mexico . Even when reinforcements under General Forey were sent forward , so earnest was the French government in disclaimi*g sinister designs , that no issue could fairly be made without raising a question of veracity . " If we must err at all , " writes Secretary Seward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere faith . " The conduct of the President was frank , honorable , and at the same time discreet . France was notified that our sympathies were with Mexico ; that we believed that no monarchical government founded by European intervention would have any prospect of security or permanency ; that we were opposed to all schemes which threatened to overthrow the Mexican Republic and the Juarez administration ; but that , at the same tune , relying on the assurances of the Emperor Napoleon , we should pursue a policy of strict neutrality until it seemed proper to make a change , in which case he would be duly informed . This attitude of our government was displeasing to a large body in Congress , who considered that the Monroe doctrine , so called , should be strongly enforced ; and an altercation arose in the spring of 1864 between the House of Representatives and the Secretary of State ; but the latter maintained that , while the sentiment of Congress was the unanimous sentiment of . the country , the question as to the policy to be pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before. * the past , should draw a new vitality from the dangers which threaten them ; if , coming hack and consulting the instincts of their race , for instance , they should find in the establishment of a monarchy the repose and prosperity which in vain they have looked for in republican institutions , I did not think we ought absolutely to refuse to aid them , if there was a chance ; bearing , nevertheless , in mind , that they were perfectly free to choose whatever means they might think best to attain their object I added , that , in case my prevision were to be realized , the governrnent of the Emperor , free from all preoccupation , rejected in advance the candidature for any prince of the imperial house ; and that , desirous to treat gently all susceptibilities , it would see with pleasure that the election of the Mexicans and the assent of the pow s should fall upon some prince of the house of Austria .

It need hardly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter . * Mexican Affairs , 1862 , p. 216 et seq. ; Ibid. , 1863 , p. 530 et seq. ; McPherson 's History of the Rebellion , p. 349 et seq . It is proper to add , that some of the facts connected with the Mexican policy above mentioned did not come to light // We may now understand why Napoleon was so anxious to become the great pacificator in the struggle between North and South . That ill-favored apparition of a friendly mediation , which stalked upon the stage at regular intervals , as if to intimidate us into compliance , was part of the Mexican drama . It need not excite surprise that the Emperor tendered his first services just after he had given belligerent rights to the Southern malecontents ; that , while pouring ruin and desolation into Mexico , he deplored most deeply our devastating strife ; that just after Forey 's troops had set sail he proposed another triple alliance , for bringing about an armistice of six months between " the Federal government and the Confederates of the South " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sentiments to the Cabinet at Washington , and entreated that commissioners should be appointed from the contending sections to ascertain whether separation was an extreme which could be no longer avoided ; * that after his persistent officiousness had been rebuked by Congress in resolutions declaring that foreign mediation was unreasonable and inadmissible , and that any further attempt in that direction would be regarded as an unfriendly act , he informed the leaders of the Secession cause in J*arliament of his readiness to recognize the South if Great Britain would take the first step . So far as related to European arbitrament in our disturbances , President Lincoln was steadfast and immovable ; he was not to be duped by honeyed words or soft explanations ; and although the timorous , as well as the treacherous , had sometimes the folly to suggest mediation as the panacea of the national ills , he was not so foolish as to take the medicine . After numerous delays General Forey effected the capture of Puebla in May , 1863 , and immediately ordered the wholesale confiscation of the estates of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impolitic measure was disapproved for a considerable time ; so that our government was oftea groping in the dark as to the mysterious designs of the Emperor . * " The sentiment to which we have yielded is too sincere for indifference to find a place in our thoughts , and that we should cease to be painfully affected whilst the war contiunes to rage . " See M. Drouyu de Lhuys 's letter to M. Mercier , Jan. 9 , 1863. // by the French government , but was only partially revoked . The Church party , which had favored the invading army , now gave in their allegiance . Juarez and his Cabinet fled from the capital , and on the 10th of June the tan-colored flag waved over its deserted halls . Another decree of confiscation followed . Six days afterwards General Forey organized the provisional government of Mexico . This consisted of a junta of thirtyfive , named by him , who , with two hundred and fifteen others chosen by themselves , constituted an Assembly of Notables , for the purpose of indicating the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *o a council ci ' three , with Almonte *t the head . As the work for the Assembly was already laid out , it took them but one day to adopt unanimously the resolve which abolished the commonwealth and substituted a monarchical form of government ; and , not to leave any doubt of their allegiance to the French rule , they offered the imperial crown to the Archduke Maximilian of Austria , and , in case of his refusal , to such other Catholic prince as his Majesty the Emperor Napoleon might indicate . So badly played was this farce , however , that , in order to save appearances , before his acceptance of the crown the Archduke requested that this election should be ratified by the suffrage of the Mexican people . The ratification was effected at the point of the bayonet ; and the formalities were at length complete . No one could manage such matters better than the Emperor of the French ; for in his own interest he had managed a similar experiment of popular suffrage. * After sundry impediments had been removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1864 , formally accepted the sway of the new empire . The Mexican deputation were received at his palace of Miramar , and laid their symbol of fidelity at his feet . Amidst the ' shouts of an Austrian populace and the roar of Austrian artillery Maximilian was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico , and a solemn Te Deurn was sung in the cathedral at Trieste . Nor was the Papal benediction wanting ; though this had not sufficed to keep the fabric of Jefferson Davis from tottering towards its destruction . A convention // between Napoleon and Maximilian , now entered into , provided that the French troops should remain in Mexico until native forces could be organized to supply their place ; that in the mean time the French commander should have equal authority with the Emperor in determining all movements and points of occupation ; that the expenses of the French invasion , fixed at the sum of two hundred and seventy million francs , and all future expenses of a standing army , should be assumed by the new empire ; and that the French indemnities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid . Under such auspices , oppressed with this millstone of obligations , Maximilian took his departure for his new domiuions , having renounced all right to the throne of Austria so long as the Mexican dynasty should endure ; and for him remained the discouraging task of planting a throne where he had found only a crown. * In the last chapter of the Mexican struggle , fact and rumor are strangely blended . Direct negotiations between the Emperor Napoleon and leading Southern Confederates for the disintegration of the Federal . Union , a proposed cession of Texas and Louis*iana to France , the formation of imperial states on the Western frontier to seduce California and New Mexico from loyalty , - these are among the floating reports of the last two years . A most palpable fact , however , is the late attempt of Maximilian to introduce a system of peonage within his borders , similar to the slavery which we have lately overthrown , and thus to open an asylum for our discontented fellow-citizens , where they may live in peace by the sweat of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Rebellion has also been more sharply defined . Napoleon is now informed that the new government is not likely to be recognized as the ruling power de facto of Mexico under any circumstances , and that it is time for him to withdraw his troops and abandon his foolish experiment to its fate . We do not desire war with France or any other nation . We seek not the annexation of Mexico , with its ignorant population and quarrelsome factions . We are not advocates of that mis- // 470 Our Diplomacy during the Rebellion . interpretation of the Monroe doctrine which compels the United States to fight the battles of other nations . At the same time we can not but feel how important it is to the interest and welfare of America to perpetuate democratic institutions on this continent , and to maintain a community of republics , united in principle and feeling . The advantages , not so apparent to this generation , are for the millions yet unborn . This at least is certain , - monarchy and democracy can not grow up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally yield . Napoleon* s mission may be that of a civilization which centralizes power by making one man the vicegerent of God on earth , while consigning the mass of humanity to a hopeless vassalage ; ours is the higher mission of peace and good-will to all mankind , - a civilization which seeks to raise the poor and downtrodden , and to secure to all the greatest share of liberty consistent with public safety . To us is committed the ark of a chartered freedom ; and unless we are cheated by delusive hopes or yield to cowardly fears , the Man of Destiny must withdraw to his legitimate field , and sooner or later " this imperial exotic , planted by foreign care and propped by foreign bayoiets , " must vanish like chaff before the whirlwind . Little remains to be said of our foreign relations during the war . Spain generally sided with England and France , sharing the responsibility of their schemes , although possibly not the confidence of the schemers . Switzerland and Italy sympathized with us , but their influence was not sensibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two leading sovereigns , but more Leebly as our cause gained strength . Russia alone of the great powers heartily supported us throughout the bitter strife , and our relations were of the most cordial nature . An inter-oceanic telegraph , which has already been commenced on the Pacific side , will doubtless knit us yet closer in bonds of sympathy . China and Japan have also favored the United States . The former forbade Rebel cruisers to enter her ports or receive supplies , and both of them have lately extended commercial facilities to our nierchants . Among the most important treaties negotiated by President Lincoln and ratified by the Senate are the treaties with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave-trade , and // 474 Our Diplomacy during the Rebellion . for the settlement of certain claims of the Hudson 's Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural Companies ; with Mexico , for extradition of criminals , and postal facilities ; with Bolivia concerning navigation ; with Liberia to secure commercial privileges ; with the Ottoman Empire , for facilities in trade ; with Ecuador , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement of claims ; with Belgium , for the extinguishment of the Scheldt dues , and commercial facilities ; besides numerous treaties with the Indian tribes . Congress by joint resolution has also given notice of the termination of the reciprocity treaty with Great Britain regulating the naval force on the Great Lakes , by reason of the hostile expeditions prepared on the Canada frontiers . Secretary Seward 's services as a diplomatist deserve more than a passing notice . To his admirable skill , foresight , and good judgment the country owes its deliverance from perils and embarrassments such as it never before encountered . His fairness and good temper have been more than a match for the plausible insincerity of Thouvenel and Drouyn de Lhuys , and the haughty arrogance of Earl Russell . If he is prone to indulge iu philosophical dissertation , yet the philosophy is sound ; if his style is sometimes that of the schoolmaster , it must be remembered that he had pupils who required constant drilling in the rudiments of American constitutional law and free institutions . Some of his despatches , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renown , and there are sentences scattered through his published volumes which deserve to live forever . Above all , his correspondence is pervaded with an enlarged and enlightened spirit of Christianity free from cant or bigotry , a genuine love of country , and a just comprehension of those principles of international law which shapo and direct American policy as distinguished from the European system . He brought to his work the leading qualities requisite for a successful diplomatist ; not the least of which is self-control . We should not forget the circumstances under which he accepted his present situation ; those long services as the pilot of reform which placed him at the head of his party , and made him its most prominent candidate for the Presidency ; the calmness with which he bore his disappointment ; the gen // erous support which he gave to his almost unknown rival ; his efforts to give confidence to public sentiment during that fearful winter when men were discussing coinpromi*es and sacrifices as the condition of the existence of the Union ; and his devotion to the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the just balance of our foreign relations during a stormy period ,  --  never swayed by passion or prejudice , never temporizing to gain personal popularity . Mr. Seward will rank rather as a progressive statesman than as a radical reformer ; but of the former class he is , to our mind , the greatest since the days of Jefferson . His recent efforts in the labor of reconstruction will not , we fear , add to his reputation for wisdom . But no statesman has more clearly forecast the years , or , with so little display of merely personal ambition , accomplished so much in revolutionizing public sentiment . He has been true to his convictions , and at the same time liberal in the application of a principle ; his position has generally been in advance of his party , and the people have steadily drawn to his support . Twice at least , while in his present position , has he checked the current of popular opinion , and woii applause at the end . He has lived to see the success of his l'abors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher law " ; the " irrepressible conflict " has become a matter of the past ; and the national cause was victorious , if not within " ninety days , " at least within the good time of Providence . His course is nearly run . His way has led him through a cloud " not of war only , but detractions rude " ; yet if he conducts the Mexican problem to a peaceful solution , his fame as a diplomatist will be almost unrivalled ; and he will bear to his retirement , not only the consciousness of duty well performed , but that reward which is the highest an American statesman can obtain , - the lasting gratitude of his countrymen .
