ERICSSON AND HIS INVENTIONS . No events of the present war will be longer remembered , or will hold a more prominent place in History , than those which took place on the eighth and ninth of March in Hampton Roads , when the Rebel steamer Merrimack attacked the Federal fleet . We all know what havoc she made in her first day 's work . When the story of her triumphs flashed over the wires , it fell like a thunderbolt upon all loyal hearts . The Cumberland , manned by as gallant a crew as ever fought under the Stars and Stripes , had gone down helplessly before her . The Congress , halfmanned , but bravely defended , had been captured and burnt . Sailing frigates , such as were deemed formidable in the days of Hull and Decatur , and which some of our old sea-dogs still believed to be the main stay of the navy , were found to be worse than useless against this strange antagonist . Our finest steamfrigates , though accidentally prevented from getting fairly into action , seemed likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient ; for all our batteries and broadsides had produced no effect on this iron-clad monster . She had gone back to her lair uninjured . What was to prevent her from coming out again to break the blockade , bornbard our seaports , sink and destroy everything that came in her way ? But we had only seen the first act of the drama . The curtain was to rise again , and a new character was to appear on the stage . The champion of the Union , in complete armor , was about to enter the lists . When the Merrimack steamed out defiantly on Sunday morning , the Monitor was there to meet her . Then , for the first time in naval warfare , two iron-clad vessels were pitted against each other . The Merrimack was driven back disabled . We breathed fi-eely again at this de'riouement , and congratulated ourselves that the nation had been saved from enormous damage and disgrace . We did not foresee that the great Rebel monster , despairing of a successful encounter with her antagonist , was to end her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury which she might have done , and might yet be capable of doing , to the Union cause , but from which we had so providentially escaped . It was indeed a narrow escape . Nothing but the opportune arrival of the Monitor saved us ; and for this impregnable vessel we are indebted to the genius of Ericsson . This distinguished engineer and inventor , although a foreigner by birth , has long been a citizen of the United States . His first work in this country - by which , as in the present instance , he added honor and efficiency to the American navy - was the steam-frigate Princeton , a vessel which in her day was almost as great a novelty as the Monitor is now . The improvements in steam machinery ayid propulsion and in the arts of naval warfare , which he introduced in her , formed the subject of a lecture delivered before the Boston Lyceum by John 0 . Sargent , in 1844 , fi-om which source we derive some interesting particulars concerning Ericsson 's early history . John Ericsson was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iron mountains of Sweden . His father was a mining proprietor , so that the youth had ample opportunities to watch the operation of the various engines and machinery connected with the mines . These had been erected by mechanicians of the highest scientific attainments , and presented a fine study to a mind of mechanical tendencies . Under such influences , his innate mechanical talent was early developed . At the age of ten years , he had constructed with his own hands , and after his own plans , a miniature sawmill , and had made numerous drawings of complicated mechanical contrivances , // with instruments of his own invention and manufacture . In 1814 he attracted the attention of the celebrated Count Platen , who had heard of his boyish efforts , and desired an interview with him . After carefully examining various plans and drawings which the youth exhibited , the Count handed them back to him , simply observing , in an impressive manner , " Continue as you have commenced , and you will one day produce something extraordinary . " Count Platen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden , and was regarded by him with a feeling little short of veneration . It was Count Platen who undertook and carried through , in opposition to the views of the Swedish nobility , and of nearly the whole nation , that gigantic work , the Grand Ship Canal of Sweden , which connects the North Sea with the Baltic . He died Viceroy of Norway , and left behind him the reputation of one of the greatest men of the century . The few words of kind encouragement which he spoke , on the occasion to which we have referred , sank deeply into the mind of the young mechanician , and confirmed him in the career on which he had entered . Immediately after this interview young Ericsson was made a cadet in the corps of engineers , and , after six months ' tuition , at the age of twelve years , was appointed niveleur on the Grand Ship Canal under Count Platen . In this capacity , in the year 1816 , he was required to set out the work for more than six hundred men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time not tall enough to look through the levelling-instrument and in using it , he was obliged to mount upon a stool , carried by his attendants for that purpose . As the discipline in the Swedish army required that the soldier should always uncover the head in speaking to his superior , gray-headed men came , cap in hand , to receive their instructions from this mere child . While thus employed in the summer months , he was constantly occupied during the winter with his pencil and pen ; and there are many important works on the canal constructed after drawings made by Ericsson at this early are . During his leisure hours , he measured up and made working-drawings of every implement and piece of machinery connected with this great enterprise ; so that at the age of fifteen he was in possession of accurate plans of the whole work , drawn by his own hand . His associations with military men on the canal had given him an inclination for military life ; and at the age of seventeen he entered the Swedish army as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron , Count Platen . This step excited the indignation of the Count , who tried to prevail upon him to change his resolution ; but findin* all his arguments useless , he terminated an angry interview by bidding the young ensign " go to the Devil . " The affectionate regard which he entertained for the Count , and gratitude for the interest taken by him in his education , caused the circumstances of this interview to make a deep impression upon Ericsson , but were not sufficient to shake his determination . Soon after the young ensign had entered upon his regimental duties , an affisir occured which threatened to obscure his hitherto bright prospects . His Colonel , Baron Koskull , had been disgraced by the King , about the time that he bad recoinmended Ericsson for promotion . This circumstance induced the King to reject the recommendation . The Colonel was exceedingly annoyed by this rejection ; and having in his possession a military map made by the expectant ensign , he took it to his Royal Highness the Crown Prince Oscar , and besought him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince received the map very kindly , expressing great admiration of its beautiful finish and execution , and presented himself in person with it to the King , who yielded to the joint persuasion of the Prince and the map , and promoted // the young ensign to the lieutenancy for which he had been recommended . About the time of this promotion , the Government had ordered the northern part of Sweden to be accurately surveyed . It being the desire of the King that officers of the army should be employed in this service , Ericsson , whose regiment was stationed in the northern highlands , proceeded to Stockholm , for the purpose of submitting himself to the severe examination then a prerequisite to the appointment of Government surveyor . The mathematical education which he had received under Count Platen now proved very serviceable . He passed the examination with great distinction , and in the course of it , to the surprise of the examiners , showed that he could repeat Euclid verbatim ,  --  not by the exercise of the memory , which in Ericsson is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . There is no doubt that it is this thorough knowledge of geometry to which he is indebted for his clear conceptions on all mechanical subjects . Having returned to the highlands , he entered on his new vocation with great assiduity ; and , supported by an unusually strong constitution , he mapped a larger extent of territory than any other of the numerous surveyors employed on the work . There are yet in the archives of Sweden detailed maps of upwards of fifty square miles made by his hand . Neither the great labors attending these surveys , nor his military duties , could give sufficient employment to the energies of the young officer . In connection with a German engineer , Major Pentz , he now began the arduous task of compiling a work on Canals , to be illustrated by sixty-four large plates , representing the various buildings , machines , and instruments connected with the construction of such works . The part assigned to him in this enterprise was nothing less than that of making all the drawings , as well as of engraving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be executed in the style of what is called machineengraving , he undertook to construct a machine for the purpose , which he successfully accomplished . This work he prosecuted with so much industry , in the midst of his other various labors , that , within the first year of its commencement , he had executed eighteen large plates , which were pronounced by judges of machine-engraving to be of superior merit . While thus variously occupied , being on a visit to the house of his Colonel , Ericsson on one occasion showed his host , by a very simple experiment , how readily mechaiiical power may be produced , independently of steam , by condensing flame . His friend was much struck by the beauty and simplicity of the experiment , and prevailed upon Ericsson to give more attention to a principle which he considered highly important . The young officer accordingly made some experiments on an enlarged scale , and succeeded in the production of a motive power equal to that of a steam-engine of ten-horse power . So satisfactory was the result , from the compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively small consumption of fuel , that he conceived the idea of at once bringing it out in England , the great field for all mechanical inventions . Ericsson accordingly obtained leave from the King to visit England , where he arrived on the eighteenth of May , 1826 . LIe there proceeded to construct a working engine on the principle above mentioned , but soon discovered that his flame-engine , when worked by the combustion of mineral coals , was a different thing from the experimental model he had tried in the highlands of Sweden , with fuel composed of the splinters of fine pine wood . Not only did he fail to produce an extended and vivid flame , but the intense heat so seriously affected all the working parts of the machine as soon to cause its destruction . These experiments , it may well be supposed , were attended with no trifling expenditure ; and , to meet these demands upon him , our young adventurer was // compelled to draw on his mechanical resources . Invention now followed invention in rapid succession , until the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remarkable steamboiler on the principle of art *ficial draught ; to which principle we are mainly indehted for the benefits conferred on civilization hy the present rapid communication hy railways . In bringing this important invention before the public , Ericsson thought it advisable to join some old and established mechanical house in London ; and accordingly he associated himself with John Braithwaite , a name favorably known in the mechanical annals of England . This invention was hardly developed , when an opportunity was presented for testing it in practice . The directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway , before erecting the stationary engines by which they had intended to draw their passenger and freight carriages , determined to appeal to the mechanical talent of the country , in the hope of securing some preferable form of motor . A prize was accordingly offered , in the autumn of 1829 , for the best locomotive engine , to be tested on the portion of the railway then completed . Ericsson was not aware that any such prize had been offered , until within seven weeks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shortness of the time , but , applying all his energies to the task , planned an engine , executed the working-drawings , and had the whole machine constructed within the seven for the start . Instead of the application of whip and spur , the *entle touch of the steam-valve gave life and motion to the novel machine . Up to that period , the greatest speed at which man had been carried alon0 the ground was that of the race-horse ; and . no one of the multitude present on this occasion expected to see t%at speed surpassed . It was the general belief that the maximum attainable by the locomotive engine would not much exceed ten miles . To the surprise and admiration of the crowd , however , the Novelty steamcarriage , the fastest engine started , guided by its inventor Ericsson , assisted by John Braithwaite , darted along the track at the rate of upwards of fifty miles an hour ! The breathless silence of the multitude was now broken by thunders of hurras , that drowned the hiss of the escaping steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise and delight excited on this occasion to the universal standard , and as an illustration of the extent to which the value of property is sometimes enhanced by the success of a mechanical invention , it may be stated , that , when the Novelty had run her two miles and returned , the shares of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had risen ten per cent . But how easily may the just expectations of an inventor he disappointed ! Although the principle of artificial draught - the principle which gave to the Novelty such decided superiority in speed - is yet retained in all locomotive engines , the mode of producing this draught in our present engines is far different from that introduced by Ericsson , and was discovered by the merest accident ; and so soon was this discovery made , after the successful display of the Novelty engine , that Ericsson had no time to derive the least advantage from its introduction . To him , however , belongs the credit of having disproved the correctness of the once established theory , that it was absolutely necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . Three engines entered the lists for the prize , - namely , the Rocket , by George Stephenson ; the Sanspareil , by Timothy Hackworth ; and the Novelty , by Ericsson . Both sides of the railway , for more than a mile in length , were lined with thousands of spectators . There was no room for jockeying in such a race , for inanimate matter was to be put in motion , and that moves only in accordance with immutable laws . The signal was given sive amount of surface should be exposed // to the fire , to generate a given quantity of steam . The remarkable lightness and compactness of the new boiler invented by Ericsson led to the employment of steam in many instances in which it had been previously inapplicable . Among these may be mentioned the steam fire-engine constructed b* him in conjunction with Mr. Braithwaite , about the same time with the Novelty , and which excited so much interest in London at the time the Argyle Rooms were on fire . A similar engine of greater power was subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was mainly instrumental in saving several valuable buildings at a great fire in Berlin . For this invention Ericsson received , in 1842 , the large gold medal offered by the Mechanics ' Institute of New York for the best plan of a steam fire-engine . In the year 1833 Ericsson brought before the scientific world in London his invention of the Caloric-Engine , which had been a favorite subject of speculation and reflection with him for many years . From the earliest period of his mechanical labors , he had been in the habit of regarding heat as an agent , which , whilst it exerts mechanicalforce , undergoes no change . The steam in the cylinder of a steam-engine , after having lifted the weight of the piston , contains just as much beat as it did before leaving the boiler , - minus only the loss by radiation . Yet in the low-pressure engine we turn the steam , after having performed its office , into a condensing-apparatus , where the heat is in a maimer annihilated ; and in the high-pressure engine we throw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caloric-Engine is atmospheric air ; and the leading peculiarity of the machine , as originally designed by Ericsson , is , that by means of an apparatus styled the Regenerator the heat contained in the air which escapes from the working cylinder is taken up by the air which enters it at each stroke of the piston and used over and over again . July , The machine constructed by Ericsson in London was a working engine of fivehorse power , the performance of which was witnessed by many gentlemen of scientific pretensions in that metropolis . Among others , the popular author , Sir Richard Phillips , examined it ; and in his " Dictionary of the Arts of Life and of Civilization , " he thus notices the result of this experiment - " The author has , with inexpressible delight , seen the first model machine of five - horse power at work . With a handful of fuel , applied to the very sensible medium of atmospheric air , and a most ingenious disposition of its differential powers , he beheld a resulting action in narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever can be wielded or used by man . " Dr. Andrew Ure went so far as to say that the invention would " throw the name of his great countryman , James Watt , into the shade . " Professor Faraday gave it an earnest approval . But , with these and some other eminent exceptions , the scientific men of the day condemned the principle on which the invention was based as unsound and untenable . The interest which the subject excited did not escape the British Government . Before many days had elapsed , the Secretary of the Home Department , accompanied by Mr. Brunel , the constructor of the Thames Tunnel , made his appearance in the engine-room where the new motive power was in operation . Mr. Brunel , who was at that time somewhat advanced in years , conceived at the outset an erroneous notion of the nature of the new power , which he would not suffer to be corrected by explanations . A &amp;scussion sprang up between him and the inventor , which was followed by a long correspondence . The result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the British Government . The invention fared little better at the hands of Professor Faraday , from whose efficient advocacy the most favorable results might have been anticipated ; This gentleman had announced that he would // deliver a lecture on the subject in London , in the spacious theatre of the Royal Institution . The novelty of the invention , combined with the reputation of the lecturer , had attracted a very large audience , including many individuals of erninent scientific attainments . Just half an hour , however , before he was expected to enlighten this distinguished assembly , the celebrated lecturer discovered that he had mistaken the expansive principle which is the very life of the machine . Although he had spent many hours in studying the Caloric-En in e in actual operation , and in testing its absolute force hy repeated experiments , Professor Faraday was compelled to inform his hearers , at the very outset , that he did not know why the engine worked at all . He was obliged to confine himself , therefore , to the explanation of the Regenerator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cylinder , and reemployed in the production of force . To this part of the invention he rendered ample justice , and explained it in that felicitous style to which he is indehted for the reputation he deservedly enjoys , as the most agreeable and successful lecturer in England . Other causes than the misconception of a Brunel and a Faraday operated to retard the practical success of this beautiful invention . The high temperature which it was necessary to keep up in the circulating medium of the engine , and the consequent oxidation , soon destroyed the pistons , valves , and other working parts . These difficulties the inventor endeavored to remedy , in an en*ine , which he subsequently constructed , of much larger powers , but without success . His failure in this respect , however , did not deter him from prosecuting his invention . He continued his experiments from time to time , as opportunity permitted , confident that he was gradually , hut surely , approaching the realization of his great scheme . Meanwhile he applied himself with his accustomed energy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ericsson propeller was first suggested to the inventor by a study of the means employed to propel the inhabitants of the air and deep . lie satisfied himself that all such propubion in Nature is produced by oblique action ; though , in common with all practical men , he at first supposed that it was inseparably attended hy a loss of power . But when he reflected that this was the principle invariably adopted by the Great Mechanician of the Universe , in enabling the birds , insects , and fishes to move through their respective elements , he knew that he must be in error . This he was soon able to demonstrate , and he became convinced , by a strict application of the laws which govern matter and motion , that no loss of power whatever attends the oblique action of the propelling surfaces applied to Nature 's locomotives . After having satisfied himself on the theory of the subject , the first step of the inventor was the construction of a small model , * which he tried in the circular basin of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly was his theory borne out in practice , that this model , though less than two feet long , performed its voyage about the basin at the rate of three English miles an hour . The next step in the invention was the construction of a boat forty feet long , eight feet beam , and three feet draught of water , with two propellers , each of five feet three inches in diameter . So successful was this experiment , that , when steam was turned on the first time , the boat at once moved at a speed of upwards of ten miles an hour , without a single alteration being requisite in her machinery . Not only did she attain this considerable speed , but her power to tow larger vessels was found to be so great that schooners of one hundred and forty tons ' burden were propelled by her at the rate of seven miles an hour ; and the American packet-ship Toronto was towed in the river Thames by this miniature steamer at the rate of more than five English miles an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Thames , who were astonished at the sight of this novel craft moving against wind and tide without any visible a , ency of propulsion , and , ascribing to it some supernatural origin , united in giving it the name of the Flying Devil . But the engineers of London regarded the experiment with silent neglect ; and the subject , when laid before the Lords of the British Admiralty , failed to attract any favorable notice from that august body . Perceiving its peculiar and admirable fitness for ships of war , Ericsson was confident that their Lordships would at once order the construction of a war-steamer on the new principle . He invited them , therefore , to take an excursion in tow of his experimental boat . Accordingly , the gorgeous and gilt Admiralty Barge was or ( lered up to Somerset House , and the little steamer was lashed along-side . The barge contained Sir Charles Adam , Senior Lord of the Admiralty , - Sir William Simonds , Chief Constructor of the British Navy , - Sir Edward Parry , the celebrated Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topographical Department of the British Admiralty , - and others of scientific and naval distinction . In the anticipation of a severe scrutiny from so distinguished a personage as the Chief Constructor of the British Navy , the inventor had carefully prepared plans of his new mode of propulsion , which were spread on the damask cloth of the magnificent barge . To his utter astonishment , as we may well imagine , this scientific gentleman did not appear to take the slightest interest in his explanations . On the contrary , with those expressive shrugs of the shoulder and shakes of the head which convey so much to the bystander without absolutely committing the actor , - with an occasional sly , mysterious , undertone remark to his colleagues , - he indicated very plainly , that , though his humanity would not permit him to give a worthy man cause for so much unhappincss , yet that " he could , an if he would , " demonstrate July , by a single word the utter futility of the whole invention . Meanwhile the little steamer , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles an hour , through the arches of the lofty Southwark and London bridges , towards Limehouse , and the steam-engine m anufactory of the Messrs . Seaward . Their Lordships having landed , and inspected the huge piles of ill-shaped cast - iron , misdenominated marine engines , intend e ( l for some of His Majesty 's steamers , with a look at their favorite propelling - apparatus , the Morgan paddle-wheel , they rei*mbarked , and were safely returned to Somerset House by the disregarded , noiseless , and unseen propeller of the new steamer . On parting , Sir Charles Adam , with a sympathizing air , shook the inventor cordially by the hand , and thanked him for the trouble he had been at in showing him and his friends this interesting experiment , adding that he feared he had put himself to too great an expense and trouble on the occasion . Notwithstanding this somewhat ominous finale of the day 's excursion , Ericsson felt confident that their Lordships could not fail to perceive the great importance of the invention . To his surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his hands a letter written by Captain Beaufort , at the suggestion , probably , of the Lords of the Admiralty , in which that gentleman , who had himself witnessed the experiment , expressed regret to state that their Lordships had certainly been very much disappointed at its result . The reason for the disappointment was altogether inexplicable to the inventor ; for the speed attained at this trial far exceeded anything that had ever been accomplished by any paddle-wheel steamer on so small a scale . An accident soon relieved his astonishment , and explained the mysterious givings-out of Sir William Simonds on the day of the excursion . The subject having been started at a dinner-table where a friend of Ericsson 's was present , Sir William ingeniously and ingenuously re // marked , that , " even if the propeller had the power of propelling a vessel , it would he found altogether useless in practice , because , the power being applied in the stern , it would he absolutely impossible to make the vessel steer . " It may not he obvious to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises ; but his hearers doubtless readily acquiesced in the oracular l ) proposition , and were much amused at the idea of undertaking to steer a vessel when the power was applied in her stern . But we may well excuse the Lords of the I3ritish Admiralty for exhibiting no interest in the invention , when we reflect that the engineering corps of the empire were arrayed in opposition to it ,  - -  alleging that it was constructed upon erroneous principles , and full of practical defects , and regarding its failure as too certain to authorize any speculations even as to its success . The plan was specially submitted to many distinguished engineers , and was publicly discussed in the scientific journals ; and there was no one but the inventor who refused to acquiesce in the truth of the numerous denionstrations proving the vast loss of mechanical power which must attend this proposed substitute for the old-fashioned paddle-wheel . While opposed by such a powerful array of English scientific wisdom , the inventor had the satisfaction of submitting his plan to a citizen of the New World , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States at Liverpool , - who was able to understand its philosophy and appreciate its importance . Though not an engineer by profession , Mr. Ogden was distinguished for his eminent attainments in mechanical science , and is entitled to the honor of having first applied the important principle of the expansive power of steam , and of having originated the idea of employing right-angular cranks in marine engines . His practical experience and long study of the subject - for he was the first to stem the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi , and the first to navigate the ocean by the power of steam alone - enabled him at once to perceive the truth of the inventor 's demonstrations . And not only did he admit their truth , but he also joined Ericsson in constructing the experimental boat to which we have alluded , and which the inventor launched into the Thames with the name of the " Francis B. Ogden , " as a token of respect to his Transatlantic friend . Other circumstances soon occurred which consoled the inventor for his disappointment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject had been brought to the notice of an officer of the United States navy , Captain Robert F. Stockton , who was at that time on a visit to London , and who was induced to accompany him in one of his experimental excursions on the Thames . Captain Stockton is entitled to the credit of being the first naval officer who heard , understood , and dared to act upon the suggestions of Ericsson , as to the application of the propeller to ships of war . At the first glance , he saw the important bearings of the invention ; and his acute judgment enabled him at once to predict that it was destined to work a revolution in naval warfare . After making a single trip in the experimental steamboat , from London Bridge to Greenwich , he ordered the inventor to build for him forthwith two iron boats for the United States , with steam-machinery and propeller on the plan of this rejected invention . " I do not want , " said Stockton , " the opinions of your scientific men ; what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once brought the subject before the Government of the United States , and caused numerous plans and models to be made , at his own expense , explaining the peculiar fitness of the invention for ships of war . So completely persuaded was he of its great importance in this aspect , and so determined that his views should be carried out , that he boldly assured the inventor that the Government of the United States would test the propeller on a large scale ; and so confi // dent was Ericsson that the perseverance and energy of Captain Stockton would sooner or later accomplish what he promised , that he at once abandoned his professional engagements in England , and came to the United States , where he fixed his residence in the city of New York . This was in the year 1839 . Circumstances delayed , for some two years , the execution of their plan . With the change of the Federal Administration , Stockton was first able to obtain a favorable hearing ; and having at length received the necessary authority , the Princetoa was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was completed and ready for sea early in 1844 , when she was pronounced by Stockton " the cheapest , fastest , and most certain ship of war in the world . " In this vessel , in addition to the propeller , Ericsson introduced his seinicylindrical steam-engine , a beautiful invention , so compact that it occupied only one-eighth of the bulk of the British marine engine of corresponding power , and was placed more than four feet below the water-line . The boilers were also below the water-line , having a peculiar heating-apparatus attached which effected a great saving of fuel , and with their furnaces and flues so constructed as to burn anthracite as well as bituminous coal . Instead of the ordinary tall smokepipe , - an insuperable objection to a steamer as a ship of war , - he constructed a smoke-pipe upon the principle of the telescope , which could be elevated or depressed at pleasure ; and in order to provide a draught independent of the height of the smoke-pipe , he placed ceritrifugal blowers in the bottom of the vessel , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally applied by him to marine engines in the steam-packet Corsair in 1831 . Thus the steam-machinery of the Princeton fulfilled the most important requisites for a war-steamer , combining lightness , compactness , simplicity , and efficiency , and being placed wholly out of reach of the enemy 's fire . The armament of the ship also exhibited many peculiarities . " By the application of the various arts to the purposes of war on board of the Princeton , " says Captain Stockton , in his report to the Navy Department , " it is believed that the art of gunnery for sea-service has , for the first time , been reduced to something like mathematical certainty . The distance to which the guns can throw their shot at every necessary angle of elevation has been ascertained by a series of careful experiments . The distance from the ship to any object is readily ascertained with an instrument on board , contrived for that purpose , by an observation which it requires but an instant to make , and by inspection without calculation . By self-acting locks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - no matter what the motion of the ship may be . " The instruments here referred to , namely , the Distance-Instrument and the Self-Acting Gun-Lock , and also the wrought-iron gun-carriage , by means of which Captain Stockton 's enormous guns were readily handled and directed , all were the productions of Ericsson 's fertile mechanical genius . A committee of the American Institute , by whom this remarkable vessel was examined , thus concluded their report : - " Your Committee take leave to present the Princeton as every way worthy the highest honors of the Institute . She is a sublime conception , most successfully realized , - an effbrt of genius skilfully executed , - a grand unique combination , honorable to the country , as creditable to all engaged upon her . Nothing in the history of mechanics surpasses the inventive genius of Captain Ericsson , unless it be the moral daring of Captain Stockton , in the adoption of so many novelties at one time . " We may add that in the Princeton was exhibited the first successful application of screw-propulsion to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamship ever built with the machinery below the water-line and out of the reach of shot . Ericsson spent the best part of two // years in his labors upon the Princeton . Besides furnishing the general plan of the ship and supplying her in every department with his patented improvements , he prepared , with his own hand , the working-drawings for every part of the steammachinery , propelling - apparatus , and steering-apparatus in detail , and superintended their whole construction and arrangement , giving careful and exact instructions as to the most minute particulars . In so doing , he was compelled to make frequent journeys from New York to Sandy Hook and Philadelphia , involving no small amount of trouble and expense . For the use of his patent rights in the engine and propeller , he had , at the suggestion of Captain Stockton , refrained from charging the usual fees , consenting to accept , as full satisfaction , whatever the Government , after testing the inventions , should see fit to pay . He never imagined , however , that his laborious services as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions and improvements , unconnected with the engine and propeller , were to be furnished gratuitously . Yet , when , after the Princeton , as we have seen , had been pronounced on all hands a splendid success , Ericsson presented his bill to the Navy Department , - not for the patentfees in question , but for the bare repayment of his expenditures , and compensation for his time and labor in the service of the United States , - he was informed . that his claim could not he allowed ; it could not be recognized as a " legal claim . " It was not denied that the services alleged had been rendered , - that the work for which compensation was asked had been done by Ericsson , and well done , - nor that the United States were in the enjoyment of the unpaid results of his labor and invention . A claim based upon such considerations might , it would seem , have been brought within the definition of a legal claim . But if not admissible under the strict rules of the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States ; and Ericsson could not believe that the representatives of the great American people would stand upon technicalities . He accordingly made a direct appeal to them in a Memorial to Congress . We may as well here give the further history of this claim . It met with the usual delays and obstructions that private claims , having nothing hut their intrinsic merits to support them , are compelled to encounter . It called forth the usual amount of legislative pettifogging . Session after session passed away , and still it hung between the two Houses of Congress , until the very time which had elapsed since it was first presented began to be brought up as an argument against it . At length , when Congress estahlished the Court of Claims , a prospect opened of bringing it to a fair hearing and a final decision . It was submitted to that tribunal six years ago . The Court decided in its favor , - the three judges ( Gilchrist , Scarborough , and Blackford ) being unanimous in their judgment . A bill directing its payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still . Although favorably reported upon by two committees at different sessions , and once passed by the Senate , without a vote recorded against it , it has never yet got through both Houses of Congress . For furnishing this Government with the magnificent war-steamer which was pronounced by Captain Stockton " the cheapest , fastest , and most certain ship of war in the world , " Ericsson has never been paid a dollar . It remains to be seen whether the present Congress will permit this stain upon the national good faith to continue . If it does , its " votes of thanks " are little better than a mockery . The efficiency and utility of the propeller having been established beyond a doubt , it went at once into extensive use . But the inventor was again disappointed in his just expectation of reaping an adequate pecuniary benefit from his exertions . Upon the strength of some attempts at screw-propulsion , - made and abandoned by various experimenters , - which had never resulted , and probably // never would have resulted , in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patent , soon made their appearance . A long litigation followed , during which all attempts to collect patent-fees were necessarily suspended ; and the result was , that the invention was virtually ahandoned to the public . But no one can take from Ericsson the honor of having first introduced the screwpropeller into actual use , and demonstrated and abroad . Although the first five years of his American experience had been less prof .. itable , in a pecuniary sense , than he had anticipated , he continued to reside in the city of New York , where he found an ample field for the exercise of his great powers in the line of his profession . He planned the war-steamer Pomone , the first screwvessel introduced into the French navy . He planned revenue-cutters for the United States Government , taking care always to have his contracts so distinctly made that no question could again arise as to his " legal * He invented a useful apparatus for supplying the boilers of sea-going steamers with fresh water . He invented various modifications of the steam-engine . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations in 1851 , he exhibited the Distance-Instrument , for measuring distances at sea , - the Hydrostatic Gauge , for measuring the volume of fluids under pressure ,  --  the Reciprocating Fluid-Metre , for measuring the quantity of water which passes through pipes during definite periods ,  --  the AlarmBarometer ,  --  the Pyrometer , intended as a standard measure of temperature , from the freezing-point of water up to the melting-point of iron ,  --  a Rotary FluidMetre , the principle of which is the measurement of fluids by the velocity with which they pass through apertures of different dimensions , - and a Sea-Lead , contrived for taking soundings at sea without rounding the vessel to the wind , and independently of the length of the lead-line . For these inventions he received the prize - medal of the Exhibition . But while thus continually occupied with new enterprises and objects , he did not lose sight of his great idea , the CaloricEngine . All his spare hours and spare funds were devoted to experiments with the view of overcoming the practical difficulties which stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1851 he seemed to be on the point of realizing his hopes , having constructed a large stationary engine , which was applied with great sue cess , at the Phmnix Foundry in New York , to the actual work of pumping water . Soon after , through the liberality of Mr. John B. Kitching , a wellknown merchant of New York , he was enabled to test the invention on a magnificent scale . A ship of two thousand tons , propelled by the power of caloricengines , was planned and constructed by him in the short space of seven months , and in honor of the inventor received the name of the " Ericsson . " Every one will remember the interest which this caloric-ship excited throughout the country . She made a trip from New York to Alexandria on the Potomac , in very rough weather , in the latter part of February , 1853 . On this trip the engines were in operation for seventythree hours without being stopped for a moment , and without requiring the slightest adjustment , the consumption of fuel being only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President and President elect , the heads of the departments , a large number of naval officers , and many members of both Houses of Congress , and subsequently by the foreign ministers in a body , and by the Legislature of Virginia , fhen in session . Ericsson was invited by a committee of the Legislature to visit Richmond as the guest of the State . The Secretary of the Navy recommended , in a special communication to Congress , the passage of a resolution authorizing him to contract for the construction of a fri*ate of two thousand tons to be equipped with caloricengines , // and to appropriate for this purpose five hundred thousand dollars . This recommendation failed in consequence of the pressure of business at the close of the session . But notwithstanding the surprise and admiration which this achievement excited in the scientific world , the speed attained was not sufficient to meet the practical exigencies of commerce ; and the repetition of the engines on this large scale could not be undertaken at the charge of individuals . Ericsson accordingly wisely devoted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1859 he produced it in a form which has since proved a complete success . It is no longer a subject of experiment , but exists as a perfect , practical machine . More than five hundred of these engines , with cylinders varying from a diameter of six inches to one of forty inches , are now in successful operation . It is applied to purposes of pumping , printing , hoisting , grindino* sawing , turning light machinery , working telegraphic instruments and sewing-machines , and propelling boats . No less than forty daily papers ( among which we may mention the " National Intelligencer " ) are printed by means of this engine . In Cuba it is used for grinding sugar-cane , on Southern plantations for ginning cotton and there is an endless variety of domestic , agricultural , and mechanical uses to which it may be advantageously applied . The extent of power attainable by this machine , consistently with its application to practical uses , is not yet precisely defined . Within the limit thus far given to it , its power is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended with the numerous perils that make the steamengine so uncomfortable a servant , but is absolutely free from dan , er . It requires no engineering supervision . It consumes a very small amount of fuel ( about onethird of the amount required by the steamengine ) and requires no water . These peculiarities not only make it a very desirable substitute for the steam-engine , but render it available for many pur poses to which the steam-engine would never be applied . In addition to his regular professional avocations , Ericsson was industriously occupied in devising new applications of the Caloric-Engine , when the attempted secession of the Southern States plunged the country into the existing war and struck a blow at all the arts of peace . His whole heart and mind were given at once to the support of the Union . Liberal in all his ideas , he is warmly attached to republican institutions , and has a hearty abhorrence of intolerance and oppression in all their forms . His early military education and his long study of the appliances of naval warfare increased the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandonment of the Norfolk navy-yard to the Rebels struck him as a disgrace that might have been avoided , lie foresaw the danger of a formidable antagonist from that quarter in the steamship which we had so obligingly furnished them . The building of gun-boats with steam-machinery above the water-line - where the first shot from an enemy might render it useless - seemed to him , in view of what he had done and was ready to do again , a very unnecessary error . Knowing thoroughly all the improvements made and making in the war-steamers of England and France , and feeling the liability of their interference in our affairs , he could not appreciate the wisdom of building new vessels according to old ideas . The blockade of the Potomac by Rebel batteries , in the very face of our navy , seemed to him an indignity which need not be en ( lured , if the inventive genius of the North could have fair play . An impregnable iron gun-boat was , in his judgment , the thing that was needed ; and he determined that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the war . The subject was not a new one to him . He had given it much consideration , and his plan , in all its essential features , had been matured long before . Proposals for ironclad vessels having been invited by the // Navy Department , Ericsson promptly submitted his plans and specifications . Knowing the opposition that novelties always encounter , he had no great expectation that his proposal would be accepted . " I have doue my part , " said he ; " I have offered my plan . It is for the Government to say whether I shall be allowed to carry it out . " He felt confident , however , that , if the plan should be brought to the notice of the President , his practical wisdom and sound common sense could not fail to decide in its favor . Fortunately for the country , Ericsson 's offer was accepted by the Navy Department . He immediately devoted all his energies to the execution of his task , and the result was the construction of the vessel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What she is and what she has accomplished , we need not here repeat . Whatever may be her future history , we may safely say , in the words of the New York Chamber of Commerce , that " the floating- battery Monitor deserves to be , and will be , forever remembered with gratitude and admiration . " We rejoice to believe that the merits and services of Ericsson are now fully appreciated by the people of the United States . The thanks of the nation have been tendered to him by a resolution of Congress . The Boston Board of Trade and the New York Chamber of Commerce have passed resolutions expressive of their gratitude . The latter body expressed also their desire that the Government of the United States should make to Captain Ericsson " such suitable return for his services as will evince the gratitude of a great nation . " Upon hearing this suggestion , Ericsson , with characteristic modesty , remarked , - " All the remuneration I desire for the Monitor I get out of the construction of it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of consideration . In the same spirit of manly independence , he discountenanced the moveinent set on foot among the merchants of New York for the subscription of a suni of money to be presented to him . He asks nothing but fair remuneration for services rendered ,  --  and that , it is to be hoped , the people will take care that he shall receive . Ericsson is now zealously at work in constructing six new iron gun-boats on the plan of the Monitor . If that remarkable structure can be surpassed , he is the man to accomplish it . His ambition is to render the United States impregnable against the navies of the world . " Give me only the requisite means , " he writes , " and in a very short time we can say to those powers now bent on destroying republican institutions , ' Leave the Gulf with your frail craft , or perish ! ' I have all my life asserted that mechanical science will put an end to the power of England over the seas . The ocean is Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surely Nature 's laws , when properly applied , will make it so . " His reputation as an engineer is worldwide . In 1852 he was made a Knight of the Order of Yasa by King Oscar of Sweden . The following extract from a poem " To John Ericsson " we translate from " Svenska Tidningen , " the Government journal of Stockholm . It is eloquently expressive of the pride and admiration with which he is regarded in his native country . " World-wide his fame , so gracefully adorn-ing His native Sweden with enduring radiance ! Not a king 's crown could give renown so noble : For his is Thought 's great triumph , and the sceptre He wields is over elements his subjects ! " Although now in his sixtieth year , Ericsson has the appearance of a man of forty . He in in the very maturity of a vicrorous manhood , and retains all the fire and enthusiasm of youth . He has a frame of iron , cast in a large and symmetrical mould . His head and face are indicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impresses one , at the first glance , as that of an extraordinary man . His bearing is dignified // and courteous , with a touch perhaps of military brusquerie in bis mode of address . He has a keen sense of humor , a kindly and generous disposition , and a genial and companionable nature . He is a " good hater " and a firm friend . Like all men of strong character and outspoken opinions , he has some enemies ; but his chosen friends he " grapples to his heart with hooks of steel . " He is not a mere mechanician , but has great knowledge of men and of affairs , and an ample fund of information on all subjects . His conversation is engaging and instructive ; and when he seeks to enlist cooperation in his mechanical enterprises , few men can withstand the force of his arguments and the power of his personal magnetism . Although his earnings have sometimes been large , his heavy expenditures in costly experiments have prevented him from acquiring wealth . Money is with him simply a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in this way he does not scruple to spend to the utmost limit of his resources . He lives freely and generously , but is strictly temperate and systematic in all his habits . The amount of labor which he is capable of undergoing is astonishing . While engaged in carrying out his inventions , it is a common thing for him to pass sixteen hours a day at his table , in the execution of detailed mechanical drawings , which he throws off with a facility and in a style that have probably never been surpassed . He does not seem to need such recreation as other men pine after . He never cares to run down to the seashore , or take a drive into the country , or spend a week at Saratoga or at Newport . Give him his drawing-table , his plans , his models , the noise of machinery , the clatter of the foundry , and he is always contented . Week in and week out , summer and winter , he works on and on , - and the harder he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is as untiring as one of his own engines , which never stop so long as the fire burns . Endowed with such a constitution , it is to be hoped that new triumphs and many years of honor and usefulness are yet before him .
