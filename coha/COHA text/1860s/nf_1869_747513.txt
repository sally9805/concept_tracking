But with a navy and army of 600,000 in the field , requiring , with the other expenses of the Government , an average daily expenditure of more than $1,600,000 , this new system of banking will not afford relief to the Treasury in time to enable the Secretary to meet the pressing demands that are made upon him . The duties received at the different custom-houses , and the taxes levied at the extra session , or that may now be levied , will be wholly inadequate to meet the requirements of the Treasury in the present emergency during the next six months . If you can not borrow the money on the credit of the United States , except at ruinous rates of discount , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not realize the amount required from your tariff and tax bills , in what mode can the means be obtained , and the Government be carried on ? It is believed that the only way in which it can be done is by issuing Treasury notes payable on demand , and making them a legal tender in payment of all debts , public and private , and by adequate taxation , to be imposed by new bills . This will bring into full exercise all the higher powers of Government under the Constitution . The Constitution confers on Congress the power ( art . 1 , sec. 8 : ) " To lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States . To borrow money on the credit of the United States . To regulate commerce with foreign nations , among the several States , and with the Indian tribes .

To raise and support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or officer thereof . " These are among the high powers of Government which must now be brought into full , ample play . The table which I have before me , procured from the Census bureau , shows that the true value of the property , real and personal , within the United States , is sixteen billions , one hundred and fifty-nine millions , six hundred and sixteen thousand and sixty-eight dollars , ( $16,159,616,068 , ) and the assessed value to be $12,006,756,585 . ( See Appendix . ) The power in the Constitution to ' ' lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , " is general and unlimited . Congress has the power to levy and collect any amount of taxes that may be necessary to preserve its existence and pay all its debts . Government has a claim , a mortgage in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Congress do its duty in passing bills to collect these taxes ? This is the vital question . Will Congress have the firmness arid the courage to impose the necessary taxation to sustain the credit of the Government ? Direct taxation , excises , and internal duties , are new features within the United States . They will be heavy burdens on the people , but essential to sustain the circulation of demand Treasury notes . The tax-gatherer will be an unwelcome visitor to most people , but his face must soon be familiar Some members of Congress may hesitate to vote for the tax bills , fearing that they may not be in favor with their constituency at home . Under these circumstances , will members of Congress meet the question boldly and firmly ? Here is the whole property of the country at the will of Congress . You have the power to tax it to an unlimited extent , if necessary to sustain the Government . This is the capital , $16,000,000,000,000 in amount , on which your Treasury notes and bonds rest . This claim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specific on the banks throughout the United States , including the gold and silver in their vaults ; on commerce ; on all kinds of production and business ; on railroads , steamboats , and their passengers : on gas companies ; on manufacturing companies of all kinds ; in short , all real and personal estate of every kind is held subject to the payment of the Treasury notes and bonds issued by the Government . Congress is clothed with this mighty power to sustain the nation at this time . Will you hesitate to do your duty ? This is what the people , the capitalist , the merchant , and all who confide in your demand notes , want to know . If they take these notes , they want to know positively whether you will enforce the claim of the Government upon the property of the country , to the full extent necessary to redeem the Treasury notes , and pay punctuallythe interest on the bonds which they take of you to sustain the government . Unless you are prepared to satisfy the country on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expect them to pass currently among the people . Unless this is done they will depreciate , and they ought to depreciate ; but with ample taxation , cheerfully voted by Congress , they will be the very best security in the country , because the whole property of the country is held for their redemption . Congress has a plain duty to perform . It has ample power . This power should now be enforced . Will Congress perform this duty ? /z/ I can not doiilit that it will . The emergency i grc:st . : IIK tin- -v this power is no v ; ni imperative necessity , in order to sustain the the I'mied States and justify the Government in issuing so amount of Treasury notes , to circulate as money and be made a legal der in the payment of debts .

The Avar power must be exercised to its fullest extent . The money power of the Government must be brought into requi. - ition . The power to tax must be availed of . All the energies of the nation must be aroused and brought into action . The power of the Govern n KM it and the means of the people must all be devoted to this great work .

" This necessity will not be questioned by any loyal member on this floor . The Constitution provides that " all the laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing pOAvers " may be passed by Congress . If the endloe legitimate , and within the scope of the Constitution , all the means that are appropriate , which are plainly adapted to that end , and which are not prohibited , may be constitutionally employed to carry it into effect .

The Constitution ( Art . 1 , Sec. 10 ) prohibits the States from making any thing but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts ; but this does not at all restrict the sovereign power of the United States . Congress has the power to coin money " regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin . " Gold and silver by long practice a practice that has continued for centuries among all nations has become the legal money of the world in all commercial transactions . Its real intrinsic value is not as great as that lixrd upon it by Governments . All Governments fix the value of gold and silver , and without the Government stamp , gold and silver would be a simple commodity , like other things having intrinsic value . Some Governments fix the value of coin higher , and some loAver , just as each , for itself chooses to determine . Any other metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value regulated by all the Governments of the world , would pass equally well in all commercial transactions as gold and silver , although not intrinsically as valuable . Exchequer bills or Treasury notes whose value is fixed by Government , and stamped as money , would pass as money in the payment of debts within the jurisdiction of the Government fixing such value . In regulating the value of " coin , " either foreign or domestic , Congress may provide that gold and silver shall be of no greater value in the payment of debts within the United States than the Treasury notes issued on the credit of this Government , which stamps such coin and fixes its value . These high powers of Government have been frequently exercised by Great Britain during her continental wars , in making the Bank of England notes receivable for public dues , and virtually a legal tender in payment of debts , by suspending the statutory clause requiring specie payments within the United Kingdom ; and other Governments of Europe have exercised the same high prerogatives whenever necessary to preserve their existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for constitutional power to issue these demand notes and make them a legal tender in payment of debts , as I will endeavor hereafter to show .

The word necessary , as used , is not limited by the additional word ll proper , " but enlarged thereby . " If the word necessary were used in the strict , rigorous sense , it would be an extraordinary departure from the usual course of the human mind , as exhibited in solemn instruments , to add another word , the only possible effect of which is to qualify that strict and rigorous meaning , and to present clearly the idea of a choice of means in the course of legislation . If no means are to be resorted to but such as are indispensably necessary , there can be neither sense nor utility in adding the word ' proper ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the propriety of the means . " 3 Story " 1 s Commentaries , sec. 122 . Alexander Hamilton , in discussing these high powers of the Constitution , says : " The authorities essential to the care of the common defence are these : to raise armies ; to build and equip fleets ; to prescribe rules for the government of both ; to direct their operations ; to provide for their support . These powers ought to exist , WITHOUT LIMITATION ; because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies , and the correspondent extent and variety of the means necessary to satisfy them . The circumstances which endanger the safety of nations are infinite ; and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed " " This pow r er ought to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside over the common defence . " * * * * " It must be admitted as a necessary consequence , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for the defence and protection of the community in any matter essential to its efficacy ; that is , in any matter essential to the formation , direction , or support of the NATIONAL FORCES . " This statement , adds Hamilton " Rests upon tvo anxioms , simple as they are universal : the means ought /z/ to be proportioned to the end : the persons from whose agency the attainment of the end is expected ought to possess the means by which it is to be attained . " Federalist , No. 23 , pp. 95 , 96 . Congress may judge of the necessity in the present exigency . It may decide whether it will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue demand Treasury notes , and make them a legal tender in payment of debts , or whether it will put its six or seven per cent , bonds on the market , at ruinous rates of discount , and raise the money , at any sacrifice the money-lender may require , to meet the pressing demands upon the Treasury . In the one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair rates of interest ; in the other , it must go into the streets shinning for the means , like an individual in failing circumstances , and sure of being used up in the end by the avarice of those who may exact unreasonable terms . The Government needs and should have , in her present peril , the aid and protection of all patriotic citizens . But , sir , knowing the power of money , and the disposition there is ; among men to use it for the acquisition of greater gain , I am unwilling , that this Government , with all its immense power and resources , should be left in the hands of any class of men , bankers or money-lenders , how- ever respectable and patriotic they may be . The Government is much stronger than any of them . Its capital is much greater . It has control of all the bankers ' money , and all the brokers ' money , and all the property of the thirty millions of people under its jurisdiction . Why , then , should it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other street , begging for money ? Their money is not as secure as Government money . All the gold they possess would not carry on the Government for ninety days . They issue only promises to pay , which , if Congress does its duty , are not half as secure as United States Treasury notes based on adequate taxation upon all the property of the country . Why , then , go into the streets at all to borrow money ? I am opposed , in our present extremity , to all shifts of this kind . I prefer to assert tin 1 power and dignity of the Government , by the issue of its own note- , pledging the faith , the honor , and property of the whole loyal people on the country to maintain their circulation and provide for their redemp-j tion . On the question of constitutional power we are not left without the recorded opinions of the ablest jurists in the country . 1 Kent 's Com. , 3512 - , McOuUoch v. The State of Maryland , 4 Wheat , R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Judge Kent lay down the doctrine as follows : " The Government of the United States is one of enumerated power- , and it can exercise only the powers granted to it ; but though limited in its powers , it is supreme within its sphere of action . It is the Government of the people of the United States , and emanated from them . Its powers were delegated by all , and it represents all , and acts for all . " There is nothing in the Constitution which excludes incidental or implied powers , The Articles of Confederation gave nothing to the United States but what was expressly granted ; but the new Constitution dropped the word expressly , and left the question whether a particular power ; igranted to depend on a fair construction of the whole instrument . No constitution can contain an accurate detail of all the sub-divisions of its powers , mid all the wants 1 which they might be carried into execution . /z/ It would render it too prolix . Its nature requires that only the great outlines should be marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients left to be deduced from the nature of those objects . The sword and the purse , all the external relations , and no inconsiderable portion of the industry of the nation , were entrusted to the General Government ; and a Government entrusted with such ample powers , on the due execution of which the happiness and prosperity of the people vitally depended , must also be entrusted with ample means for their execution . Unless the words imperiously require it , we ought not to adopt a construction which would impute to the framers of the Constitution , when granting great powers for the public good , the intention of impeding their exercise , by withholding a choice of means . The powers given to the Government imply the ordinary means of execution ; and the Government , in all sound reason and fair interpretations , must have the choice of the means which it deems the most convenient and appropriate to the execution of the power . The Constitution has not left the right to Congress to employ the necessary means for the execution of its powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution , expressly confers on Congress the power ' to make all laws that may be necessary and proper to cany into execution the foregoing powers . ' Congress may employ such means and pass such laws as it may deem necessary to carry into execution great powers granted by the Constitution ; and necessary means , in the sense of the Constitution , does not import an absolute physical necessity , so strong that one thing can not exist without the other . It stands for any means calculated to produce the end . The word necessary admits of all degrees of comparison . A thing may be necessary , or very necessary , or absolutely , or indispensably necessary . The word is used in various senses ; and in its construction , the subject , the context , the intention , are all to be taken into view . The powers of the Government were given for the welfare of the nation . They were intended to endure for ages to come , and to be adapted to the various crisis in human affairs . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future time execute its power , and to confine the choice of means to such narrow limits as should not leave it in the power of Congress to adopt any which might be appropriate and conducive to the end , would be most unwise and pernicious , because it would be an attempt to provide , by immutable rules , for exigencies which , if foreseen at all , must have been foreseen dimly , and would deprive the Legislature of the capacity to avail itself of experience , or to exercise its reason , and accommodate its legislation to circumstances . If the end be legitimate , and within the scope of the Constitution , all means which are appropriate , and plainly adapted to this end , and which are not prohibited by the Constitution , are lawful . " It is plainly within the scope of the Constitution that the Government should maintain itself ; that the army should be supported ; that the navy should be maintained . The ways and means of doing this are left to Congress to provide . Congress may do this entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collect taxes enough every year to pay the whole expenses of the war during each current year , and so " pay as we go . " It may issue six per cent , bonds and sell them on the market for what they will bring even if they will not sell for over fifty cents on the dollar to raise money to carry on the war . It may issue Treasury notes payable on demand , and make them a legal tender in payment of debts . Either one or all of these modes of paying the expenses of the Govern- /z/ ment is left to the discretion of Congress . Either mode is constitutional : and it is left to the sound discretion of Congress to decide which mode it will adopt , or whether it will adopt a part of each , as being the best in the present crisis . My own impression is , that it will be best for us to adopt , in part , all of these modes for providing the means . 1 . Raise by taxation the current year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sum of $150,000,000. 2 . Issue $100,000,000 of demand Treasury notes in addition to the $50,000,000 authorized in July , making them a legal tender in payment of debts , and exchangeable at any time for 6 per cent , twenty years ' bonds ; with a further issue of demand notes if Congress shall hereafter deem it necessary . 3 . Provide for the issue of all the twenty years ' 6 per cent , bonds Hint may be necessary to fund the demand Treasury notes , and other fundable Treasury notes that may be issued , ( say $500,000,000 six per cent , twenty years ' coupon bonds , ) and pledge $30,000,000 of the annual taxes to pay the interest half-yearly thereon , and pledge $25,600,000 more , as a sinking fund to redeem the principal in twenty years . 1 . This tax of $150,000,000 would afford an ample basis on which to rest the credit of the Government for this large issue of Treasury notes and bonds , and would insure the punctual payment of the interest to the capitalists who might hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the present exigencies of the Government , in the discharge of its existing liabilities to the army , navy , and contractors , and for supplies , materials , and munitions of war . These notes would find their way into all the channels of trade among the people ; and as they accumulate in the hands of capitalists , they would exchange them for the six per cent , twenty years ' bonds . These circulating notes in the hands of the people would enable them to pay the taxes imposed , and would facilitate all business operations between farmers , mechanics , commercial business men , and banks , and be equally as good as , and in most cases better , than the present irredeemable circulation issued by the banks . 3 . The $500,000,000 six per cent , twenty years ' bonds in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury , ready to be issued , would afford ample opportunity for funding the Treasury notes as fast as capitalists might desire to exchange Treasury notes not bearing interest for coupon bonds of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tax upon the people and all their property . In this way the Government will be able to get along with its immediate and pressing necessities without being obliged to force its bonds on the'market at ruinous rates of discount ; the people , under heavy taxation , will be shielded against high rates of interest ; and the capitalists will bd afforded a fair compensation for the use of their money during the pending struggle of the country for national existence . A suspension of specie payment is greatly to be deplored , but it is not a fatal step in an exigency like the present . The British Government and the Bank of England remained under suspension from 1797 to 1821 " 2 a period of twenty-five years . During this time England successfully resisted the imperial power of thb Emperor Napoleon , and preserved her own imperilled existence . During all this time the people of Great Britain advanced in wealth , population , and resources . Gdld is not as valu- /z/ able as the productions of the farmer and mechanic , for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army and navy must have what is far more valuable to them than gold and silver . They must have food , clothing , and the material of war . Treasury notes issued by the Government , on the faith of the whole people , will purchase these indispensable articles , and the war can be prosecuted until we can enforce obedience to the Constitution and laws , and an honorable peace be thereby secured . This being accomplished , I will be among the first to advocate a speedy return to specie payments , and all measures that are calculated to preserve the honor and dignity of the Government in time of peace , and which I regret are not practicable in the prosecution of this war . I do not despair ; on the contrary , I have an abiding faith in the patriotism , firmness , and resources of the people to maintain this Government . I feel that we are in great peril ; but when the people and our rulers become sufficiently aroused to fully appreciate the magnitude and probable duration of the rebellion a rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to put forth the energy and the means necessary to crush it . An early and successful advance of our armies is of the utmost importance . We need such an advance to sustain the financial credit of the Government . We need it to prevent foreign intervention ; we need it to rouse the flagging energies of the people ; and above all , we need it to vindicate the courage and invincibility of our brave soldiers , who are so anxious to be led on to victory . /z/ qwq /z/ At the conclusion of Mr. Spauldmg 's speech , Mr. VALLAXDIG.11 AM obtained the floor and offered a substitute for the bill , which was read . ( Congressional Globe , p.p. 526 . ) MR . STEVENS said : " I will follow an example set me , and give notice of an amendment which I shall offer to the bill . It is to make the semiannual interest payable in coin . I shall make it when we reach the proper time and place . " MR . VALLANDIGHAM.  --  That is included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my amendment is to the original bill . " Mr. Vallandigham " I do not desire to speak upon the bill at this stage of the debate , and therefore I will cheerfully yield to my colleague ( Mr. Pendleton ) , who proposes to discuss the constitutional question of legal tender . " Mr. Pendleton obtained the floor . /z/ MK . PENDLETON , on the 29th inst. made an elaborate speech in opposition to the constitutionality as well as the expediency of the legal tender clause . He commenced by saying , " MR . CHAIRMAN , I was glad to hear the announcement made by the gentleman from Vermont , ( Mr. Merrill ) , a member of the Committee of Ways and Means , by my colleague ( Mr. Vallandigham ) , by the gentleman from New York , ( Mr. Eoscoe Conkling ) , and by the gentleman from Pennsylvania , ( Mr. Stevens ) , that they each intended to propose to the House to make changes in this bill , either by way of amendment or - ui stitute . " MR . PENDLETON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal tender in discharge of all'pecuniary obligations , either by the Government or individuals , a character which has never been given to any note of the United States , or any note of the Bank of the United States by any law ever passed . Not only , sir , was such a law never passed , but such a law was never voted on , never proposed , never introduced , never recommended by any department of the Government ; the measure was never seriously entertained in debate in either branch of Congress . " MR . CONKLING interrupting , enquired " whether the present Secretary is in favor of making paper a legal tender ? " MR . SPAULDING " In reply to the question of my colleague , I will say that the Secretary of the Treasury has been called upon for his opinion in regard to this bill . We w r ere assured that his reply would be sent to us yesterday , but we did not receive it . We expect his answer every hour . " MR . CONKLING " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he expect a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury which will contain his views on the financial question , and also on the legal question ? " Mr. Spaulding " Upon the bill specifically . " Mr. Conkling " Containing the legal tender clause ? " Mr. Spaulding " Yes , sir . " MR . PENDLETON " 1 can not answer the question 1 so far as the opinions of the present Secretary of the Treasury are concerned . I affirm again the statement I have made , that a proposition of this kind lias never been recommended to either House of Congress by any Department of the Government from its organization The report of the Secretary of the Treasury , made at the opening of the Session , contains no such recommendation . " Mr. Pendleton contended that the bill , if passed , would impair the obligation of past as well as of future contracts , and that it would make it illegal to make a contract for dealing in gold or silver coin , for the reason that these legal tender notes might be tendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no express power granted in the Constitution to make United States notes lawful money and a legal tender in payment of debts , and that the power " to regulate commerce " gave no such power . He then said : " The gentleman from New York ( Mr. Spaulding ) , in his argument yesterday , deduced this power from the general powers of the Government . He told us that Congress had power to lay and collect taxes ; to raise and support armies , to provide and maintain a navy , and that all power necessary to effectuate these purposes was expressly given by the general grant of the Constitution . If I should admit his statement in the very language in which he has made it , am I not entitled to ask whether he has shown us any legitimate connection between making these notes a legal tender and the power to raise an army ? Might I not ask whether the repudiation of the obligations of the Government to pay its interest is a legitimate means for providing and sustaining a navy ? Whether impairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will in any degree assist the Government in its great duty in laying and collecting taxes ? We had no demonstration of the necessity or propriety of these means to accomplish those ends . The gentleman spoke quite at large in reference to the sovereign power of the Government . He told us that this power was not prohibited in the Constitution . He told us that in times of great emergency every thing may be done except that which is prohibited ; and he read an argument from the Attorney General which concludes as it began , with the proposition that such a power is not prohibited to Congress . Sir , I repudiate this whole idea . I think it has no solid foundation in the Constitution . When I come to examine the powers of Congress according to the principles of interpretation to which I adhere , I look to the grants of the Constitution . I find no grant of this power in direct terms , or , as I think , by fair implication . It is not an accidental omission : it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution , because it was designed that the power should not reside in the Federal Government . " MR . PENDLETON continued his argument at great length against the Constitutional power of the government to issue legal tender notes to circulate as money . He quoted from Story , Madison , Hamilton , Calhoun , and made long extracts from Mr. Webster 's speeches which were made while the government was on a peace footing , denying the power of the Government to issue currency and make it a legal tender . He insisted that no State , and that even Congress itself could not make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts . That the language of /z/ the Constitution , and the weight of authority , it seemed to him , settled the question that Congress had not the power to do that which it is proposed shall be done by the provisions of this bill . He concluded as follows : " Let gentlemen heed this lesson of wisdom . Let them , if need be , tax the energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Government . Let them borrow whatever money in addition may be necessary borrow to the full extent that may be necessary and let us adhere rigidly , firmly , consistently , persistently , and to the end , to the principle of refusing to surrender that currency which the Constitution has given us , and in the maintenance of which this Government , has never , as yet , for one moment wavered . " The letter of Secretary Chase of the 22d inst. was regarded by a majority of the Committee of Ways and Means and many Members of the House , as non-committal on the legal tender clause of the bill , and many believed that when pressed to a decision , he would declare against its constitutionality . In order to obtain the opinion of the Secretary more fully , MR . CORNING offered a resolution in the Committee of Ways and Means , which was adopted , referring the bill ( No. 240 ) to the Secreta , and requesting him to communicate to the Committee at as early a day as possible , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage by Congress . After considerable delay the Secretary sent to the Committee of Ways and Means the following reply : /z/ TREASURY DEPARTMENT , Jan. 29 , 1862 . SIR : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means , referring to me House bill No. 240 , and requesting my opinion as to the propriety and necessity df its immediate passage by Congress . The condition of the Treasury certainly needs immediate action on the subject of affording provision for the expenditures of the Government , both expedient and necessary . The general provisions of the bill submitted to me , seems to me well adapted to the end proposed . There are , however , some points which may , perhaps , be usefully amended . The provision making United States notes a legal tender has doubt l been well considered by the committee , and their conclusion needs no support from any observation of mine . I think it my duty , however , to sa . that in respect to this provision my reflections have conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not unknown to them that I have felt , nor do I wish to conceal that I now feel , a great aversion to making anything but coin a legal tender in payment of debts . It has been my anxious wish to avoid the necessity of such legislation . It is , however , at present impossible , in consequence of the large expenditures entailed /z/ by the war , and the suspension of the banks , to procure sufficient coin for disbursements ; and it has , therefore , become indispensably necessary that we should resort to the issue of United States notes . The making them a legal tender might , however , still be avoided , if the willingness manifested by the people generally , by railroad companies , and by many of the banking institutions , to receive and pay them as money in all transactions , were absolutely or practically universal ; but , unfortunately , there are some persons and some institutions which refuse to receive and pay them , and whose action tends not merely to the unnecessary depreciation of the notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this matter , give a cordial support to the Government , and in favor of those who do not . Snch discriminations should , if possible , be prevented ; and the provision making the notes a legal tender , in a great measure at least , prevents it , by putting all citizens , in this respect , on the same level , both of rights and duties . The committee , doubtless , feel the necessity of accompanying this measure by legislation necessary to secure the highest credit as well as the largest currency of these notes . This security can be found , in my judgment , by proper provisions for funding them in interest-bearing bonds ; by well-guarded legislation authorizing banking associations with circulation based on the bonds in which the notes are funded ; and by a judicious system of adequate taxation , which will not only create a demand for the notes , but by securing the prompt payment of interest raise and sustain the credit of the bonds . Such legislation , it may be hoped , will divest the legal tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest possible return to a sound currency of coin and promptly convertible notes . I beg leave to add , that vigorous military operations and the unsparing retrenchment of all necessary expenses , will also contribute essentially to this desirable end . /z/ I have the honor to be , with very great respect , yours truly , /z/ Hon. THADDEUS STEVENS , Chairman . /z/ TREASURY DEPARTMENT , Jan. 30 , 1862 . MY DEAR SIR It was impossible to get my answer ready before yesterday afternoon , when it was sent to the Chairman of the Committee ; the messenger boy instructed to deliver it to Mr. Stevens or yourself . The House having adjourned , he left it , he says , for you at the National Hotel instead of at Mr. Steven 's lodgings . Had I been aware that the part read to you would have been acceptable as an extract , ( to insert in your speech , ) I would have sent it earlier in advance of completing the answer . I read your speech carefully last night . It seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see , so much importance as I do to the Banking Act as a measure of relief ; nor so much as I am confident you will upon reflection . I confess too , that I was a little disappointed in being merely let off without censure when I thought myself entitled to some credit . My two first loans were negotiated considerably above the market rate , and the last at a rate almost equal at the time , and below , while the market almost immediately afterwards fell . Your friend , S. P. CHA8E , Hon. E. G. SPAULDING , House of Representatives . /z/ YORK , Jan. 29 , 1862 . MY DEAR SIR I beg to offer you my thanks for your able exposition of the financial affairs of the Government . It is clear that there are but the alternatives you state to obtain any substantial relief the one , to flood the market with the long stocks , submit to the very great depression in the price , and abide the consequences ; a great augmentation of the public debt , and ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , for the present to issue demand notes , making them a , legal tender in order to enable you to use them . No other plans have been , or in my opinion can be devised , I have long entertained and freely expressed these views , here and in Washington . Even if an attempt , more or less successful , had been made at the first to sell the long stock , yet , with the profligate expenditure since made to such fearful amounts , " to this complexion had we come at last. - ' It is idle to look back , but had there been economy in the great departments of expenditure from the beginning , inspiring full public confidence in their able and honest management , it may be questioned if the necessary funds could not have been provided without making irredeemable paper money . The war would have been shorter , the patriotism of the whole people fully sustained , and foreign nations shown that this Government could not be divided . I am , dear sir , respectfully and truly yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAYOR 'S OFFICE , NEW YORK , Feb. 3 , 1862 . MY DEAR SIR Accept my kind thanks for your note of yesterday , and also my apology for not having sooner expressed the gratification I felt on reading your very able and statesmanlike speech on the national finances . That speech has received , as it deserved , the hearty approval of every one who fully appreciates the imminent danger we are in of a collapse of the public credit . If the present financial embarrassments of the Government should be aggravated by military disasters , or threatened foreign intervention , it might precipitate a panic that would so depress the public securities , that it would be difficult to obtain supplies for the army , and thus arrest the further prosecution of the war . The only safe way of avoiding this danger is to promptly pass the bill you have introduced and advocated so ably . I shall not fail to give you whatever aid I can . I have tried in several instances to bring Mr. Bryant and Mr. Greeley over to our faith , bufthus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very truly yours , /z/ PHILADELPHIA , Feb. 14 , 1862 . MY DEAR SIR I have read your speech on the finances of the nation with the liveliest interest . It is at once clear , forcible , argumentative and conclusive , worthy alike of a financier , a statesman , and a patriot . Very truly yours , R. MORRIS . Hon. E. G. SPAULDING. /z/ PHILADELPHIA , Jan. 30 , 1862 . Hon. E. G. SPAULDING , House of Representatives , Washington . DEAR SIR I have just read your very able and statesmanlike exposition of our public finances and our financial policy during the war , with a satisfaction I can not refrain from expressing to you by letter . You have grasped the subject strongly and comprehensively , as well as practically . I can not doubt that your views will prevail . I trust you will now extend the same kind of effort to accomplish some harmonious action between the Associated Banks and the Government . I believe that these , and other leading banks can , by the aid of the Treasury and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency at par ; that is at par less only the special premium on gold , which will not be greater than now if the Treasury currency is well managed . The regular circulation of paper currency will absorb in no very long period the whole $200,000,000 , and keep that amount moving . But as currency in the channels of business necessarily at times gorges in particular places , and depreciates at once if the holders are not relieved , such occasions should not only be watched by the fiscal agents of the Government , but the proper remedy should be applied . It would cost the Treasury no sum worth mentioning , if the banks would enter into the plan heartily , to keep their currency in such credit that it would perform with complete success every function of a sound currency . According to my view , the banks are deeply interested in keeping up the credit of those notes . The continued demand for them created by the loans , by the payment of debts at banks , and the payment of taxes , will create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government to re-issue the whole amount several times a year . But there can be no doubt that an average of one hundred millions will remain so prominently in the channels of business as seldom to revisit the Treasury . If the banks will lend their aid effectively to support their circulation it is not likely that any further issue will be needed , if they do n't , they must depreciate , and further issue will be inevitable , if the war continues . Even the banks should be willing to acknowledge , that whatever their opinion about the propriety of issuing this currency , the w T hole financial policy of the war and commercial interests of the country , will depend very much on its management . They should accept the necessity and make the best of it ; and they can make a very good thing for themselves by making the best of it . There can be no doubt that the city banks can enlarge their discounts by the use of the United States notes beyond what they could safely do upon their own circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue which you have so well justified , as so important , that I think it would be well worth while for the Treasury to pay them for the sort of services they can render . I contributed an editorial on this subject to the North American , which I send you . If your speech is to appear in pamphlet form please send me one . I send you also an article in the Banking Magazine for January , 1862 , on the subject of banks and the Treasury . Be good enough to present my respects to Mr. Horton , of your committee , who is an old acquaintance of mine . With great respect , very truly yours , /z/ BUFFALO , Jan. 21 , 1862 . DEAR SIR I suppose of course a large issue of demand notes for circulation will be authorized , receivable for all clues and made a legal tender ; and sufficient taxation to sustain the credit of all such issues and of the Government bonds . I see no other method so economical and effective . Very respectfully yours , /z/ ALBANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thanks for a copy of your speech on the national finances . The demand notes , in addition to the legal tender , need only to be fortified by a sinking fund yearly of $10,000,000 , derived from taxation , to every $100,000,000 of notes issued , to make them pass equal to coin . Yours truly , /z/ SALISBURY MILLS , Orange Co. , N. Y. , Jan. 30 , 1862. /z/ DEAR SIR I have read your financial speech ( as reported in the Tribune ) twice over with great interest . The necessity for such measures is greatly to be regretted , but I do not see with the light I have , how they are to be avoided . In our national exigency , determined boldness , both in civil and military affairs , will be worth a mint of money to us . Please send me your speech for preservation , when printed in pamphlet form . With great respect , your obedient servant , /z/ NEW YORK , Jan. 29 , 1862 . MY DEAR SIR I have just read your speech as published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fair and clear exposition of the present financial condition of the Government , its necessities , its resources , and the emergency which now demands the immediate passage of the bill reported by the Committee of Ways and Means . The exigency of the Government to which I referred recently before that Committee , to justify the legal tender of the notes , I think is now reached , and we have no choice of any other measure as good as you propose . But protect the issue of this currency by limitation of its amount , by large taxation , and be sure to require by amendment that the payment of interest by the Government shall be certainly paid in coin on all its public debts . In haste , yours truly , /z/ P. S. In some quarters are suggestions not to receive these notes from customers . This is wrong . Such a proceeding , or to make any exception against them as lawful money of the United States , would affix a taint and affect the public confidence in them . " /z/ PIERMONT , Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on your lucid , forcible , and comprehensive opening of the debate on the legal tender Treasury note bill . It is unanswerable , and I trust will issue in an early triumph . I only wish the sum proposed was larger , so as to extinguish all hopes of national bonds being forced on the market and sacrificed . I think there will be a struggle in certain quarters to withdraw them from circulation and turn them into bonds on interest . The people would do that gradually without reducing the circulation too much , were there plenty more expected ; and with a discretion for a larger sum the inimical parties could do no harm . Should your speech be printed in pamphlet form , which I hope it will , please favor me with one or more . Respectfully , &c.,; ELEAZER LORD . /z/ BUFFALO , Feb. 7 , 1862 . HON. E. G. SPAULDING , Washington , D. C. DEAR SIR I thank you for a printed copy of your speech on the finances of the country , received this morning ; I had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval , but desire this copy for preservation . Whilst all loyal citizens must regret the necessity which compels the Government to suspend specie payments and make its own demand notes a lawful tender instead , I am quite unable , after very considerable thought , to suggest any other measure of relief , which I think would answer the purpose so promptly , or so well ; hence , I hope the bill as reported by the committee will speedily become a law , and this is I think quite the general wish here . As the Spring approaches , anxiety increases for a vigorous prosecution of the war to a conclusion ; for sometime or other , not very remote , necessity will compel at least a large decrease in our land and naval forces ; $500,000,000 annually , can and will be paid cheerfully awhile , but I need not say to you that it can not be very long ; so it behooves the Government to act with all practicable energy to end the rebellion by any means in its power , in the very shortest time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the conflict speedily and triumphantly ; and that all the States may be again united under the present Constitution ; still most of the slave states , except upon the border , seem almost hopelessly estranged , and will not , I fear , ever again , with their present people , yield obedience to the fundamental law of the land and the acts of Congress , unless they know the penalty for treason henceforth is to be rigidly enforced , and that the power of the Government is quite equal to capture the leaders of the rebellion by hundreds and thousands , and are determined to do it , and to execute them as fast as captured , unless they throw down their arms and disband , and return to loyalty . Can it be possible the Rebel leaders would long hold out against such a proclamation , after they saw that it was the intention of the Government to fulfil it to the letter , and they were virtually surrounded by a superior force .

NEW YORK , Jan. 30 , MY DF.AII Sin I send you the ith of a series of articles written that the bills of the Government should be a legal tender . I belong to the creditor class , but my interest in the Government absorbs all others . In my view the war can not be conducted except on this plan . I would pay the interest in gold and silver and lay heavy taxes . There should be $100,000,000 of demand notes of $1000 , bearing 5 per cent , interest . Yours , very truly , GEO . B. BUTLER . /z/ ALBANY , Jan. 31 , 18G2. /z/ DEAR SIR I have read your well constructed argument on national finances , and the issue of Treasury notes made a legal tender . I do not suppose that a loan can be made , and I regard this issue of Treasury notes the only adequate measure for sustaining the credit of the Treasury and the well being if not the very existence of the Government . Money must be had or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure means , no other will except at ruinous sacrifices . It is not , a debatable question . Ilie struggle is for life . The knife is at our throat . We must strike with the most available weapon , and leave theory for a more convenient season . Of course you will pass a tax law . The people will hail it , and it will inspire confidence in our public securities . I had hoped that you would authorize funding at 4 or 5 years in an S per cent , stock , and 20 years in a 6 or G per cent , stock . The short 8 per cent , stock would tempt to a large amount of funding , and when that short period expires , it is to be hoped that the Government can borrow at 5 per cent , We want to encourage funding so as to prevent a redundant , citnrtici/ , and to prepare the way for possible if not probable further issues . I have the honor to be , Your Obedient Servant , /z/ NEW YORK , Jan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D. C. DEAR SIR I have read your able exposition of the condition of the national finances , and the bill which you reported to authorize the issue of $150,000,000 of demand notes , and I beg leave to express the opinion , that there is no other means by which the Government can escape the utter ruin of their credit , than the immediate passage of the bill , and a bill to raise an amount of revenue which shall render the prompt payment of interest on all their loans beyond contingency . Should the passage of this bill be delayed until the banks have paid their last installment to tinGovernment , and the banks should refuse to receive the demand notes , and pay them out , they would of course depreciate to an extent sufficient to damage the credit of the Government essentially . If the experience of a life , not now short , is of any value , I say unhesitatingly , that this is the most critical period in our history within my knowledge . Those in power must take the responsibility and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think will be terrific . As to paying in gold during the war , it is utterly and totally impracticable , and the idea of doing so should at once be discarded . After the present emergency is provided for , I trust /z/ the bill for banking on the Government stock will be passed . The plan will be approved by nearly all the intelligent community when once adopted , and is now by a large majority of the men of wealth and influence , so far as I am informed . With apologies for trespassing upon your valuable time , I am , your obedient servant , /z/ On Thursday , the 30th inst . , MR . STEVENS moved to postpone the special order the Treasury note bill until to-morrow , for the purpose of going into the Committee of the Whole on the Army bill . The motion was agreed to . And on Friday , the 31st inst. , he again moved to postpone the Treasury note bill until Monday , the 3rd of February , which was agreed to by the House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered a modification of his substitute for the bill , for the purpose of having it printed for examination . This substitute will be found printed at length in the Congressional Globe , page 614 . MR . ROSCOE CONKLING With the permission of the gentleman from Ohio , I desire to submit for the same purpose , the following , which I propose to offer , at the proper time , as a substitute for the whole bill . Congressional Globe , page 615. /z/ MR . VALLANDIGHAM being entitled to the floor , addressed the Committee of the whole House for one hour , in favor of his substitute , and in opposition to the legal tender clause in the original bill . His speech will be found reported at length in the appendix to the Congressional Globe , pages 42 , 43 , 44 and 45 . He commenced by saying : " It has been my habit , Mr. Chairman , to premeditate , whenever premeditation was possible , whatever I have had to say in this House ; for no man has a right , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a deliberative assembly . * " I propose to-day to discuss the subjects involved in this bill to the best of my ability , and with becoming candor and freedom , and I may add earnestness too ; for I have the profoundest conviction of their incalculable importance to the interests , present and future , of the United States , and of the people of this whole continent . Nor am I to be deterred from a faithful discharge of my duty by the consciousness that my voice may not be hearkened to here , or in the country , because of the continued , persistent , but most causeless and malignant assaults and misrepresentations , . to which for months past , I have been subjected . Sir , I am not here to reply to them to-day . Neither am I to be driven from the line of duty by them . " Strike but hear . " Whatever a silenced or mendacious press , /z/ outside of this House may choose to withhold , or to say , no man who is fit to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his votes , or his public conduct here , to be controlled by his personal hates or prejudices . Sir , I recant nothing , and would expunge nothing from the record of the past , so far as I am concerned , But my path of duty now , as a Representative , is as clear as the sun at broad-noon . THE SHIP OF STATE is UPON THE ROCKS . I was not the helmsman who drove her there ; not had I part or lot in directing her course . But now , when the sole question is , how shall she be rescued ? I will not any longer , or at least just now enquire who has done the mischief . * * * * I do not agree , Mr. Chairman , with the gentleman who has opened this debate , ( Mr. Spaulding , ) that this bill is a war measure . Certainly , sir , it has been forced upon us by the war , but if peace were restored to-morrow , these $100,000,000 would be just as essential to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued his argument at great length . He insisted that the legal tender clause was unconstitutional , that it was'o forced loan , and that it would be disastrous and unjust . He said no scheme of loan or taxation , or national bank , or currency , or other similar contrivance , could be devised , and put into operation in time to avert ruin and disaster . The Government has no money , no gold and silver coin , which is the only money in the world . He advocated Treasury notes , without any promise to pay money , and without the legal tender clause , which should pass as currency from hand to hand , between the Government and its creditors and debtors , and be supported by a nearly equal amount of taxes such taxes to be received by the Government in these notes . He urged that the experiment of forcing a paper currency upon the country , was a dangerous experiment , that it would lead to other enormous issues , gold and silver would be banished from circulation , an immense inflation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , worked by steam , signed by machinery , there would be no end to the legion of paper devils which shall pour forth from the loins of the Secretary . " That inevitably there would follow bloated currency , high prices , extravagant speculation , enormous sudden fortunes , immense factitious wealth , and general insanity . He objected to their being called " United States notes " instead of " Treasury notes , " as they had always heretofore been called , and deprecated the idea that they were likely to be a permanent currency , or at least until the Secretary 's grand fiscal machine , 4 ' his magnificent National Paper Mill , founded upon the very stock provided for in this bill can be put into operation . " He /z/ insisted that these notes were not money , that they would not circulate as currency , would not be taken as legal tenders , and in discharge of judgments , and contracts , and state debts , or private debts , " though you should send them forth bearing ten times the image and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now president and CAESAR of the American Republic . " He urged the substitute presented by him as follows : " The fundamental idea of this substitute is to support and float these $150,000,000 , by nearly an equal amount of taxation and revenue , payable of course in these notes . The Government owe the people and the people owe the Government , each $150,000,000 , and these notes are primarily to be used as a common medium of payment between them . * * * * I do not propose or pretend that these notes are to be convertible into gold and silver . They are not payable on demand ; they are not payable to bearer , nor payable at all . They are not to be paid , but to circulate as currency receivable in Government dues , and finally to be funded in twenty year 's stocks . They are not promises to pay , and are not therefore paper money . They do not represent gold and silver , of which the Government has none . * * The United States are to cease in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying hard money Government , I deplore it profoundly . But imperious necessity demands it . There is no alternative , 110 matter what evils may follow . But I utterly deny , sir , the right of the Federal Government to provide a paper currency , intended primarily to circulate as money , and meet the demands of business and commercial transactions , and to the exclusion of all other paper . It is not the intent or object of the substitute to furnish such a currency for the country . ***** Such , Mr. Chairman , is the substitute which I have submitted . It differs essentially from the bill . The one relies on force , the other upon credit ; the one looks to the direct and despotic coercion of law and arms , and the other to the indirect and ordinary coercion of taxes . * * * To my political friends let me now appeal for support , not only for this substitute , but of the taxation which must follow it , as essential to the maintainahce of the good faith and credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , Mr. Hooper , of Mass. , obtained the floor . /z/ MR . HOOPER " The unusual exigencies of this country require that we should look for other and deeper sources of revenue than any to which we have heretofore been accustomed . We are contending for the maintainance of the Government , for the preservation of the Union , and for the enforcement of the laws , on which depend the existence , as well as the security of property . To insure our success in this contest , great and unusual exertions have already been made . An enormous army , a powerful navy , with vast stores of artillery and ammunition , have been created . In providing for the sustenance , comfort , and equipment of the Army and avy , the Government have been obliged to incur expenses far exceeding in magnitude /z/ any which have been hitherto known in our history . To continue them in their present state of efficiency , large additional sums must be expended ; and it now becomes the duty of Congress to devise methods by which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and the least risk to the credit of the Government . In considering the means by which this is to be effected , it must be remembered that it is hardly possible for the Government to raise money for any purpose without occasioning some inconvenience to individuals . To oppose necessary measures , therefore , simply upon the ground that it will injuriously affect tin 's class or that class of the people , is unreasonable . Parties interested may endeavor to show that the same objects can be effected with less hardship than by the methods proposed , or may endeavor to obviate any objectionable features , so far as may be consistent with the attainment of the desired end ; but they should always remember that the end aimed at must be attained ; that its attainment vill require individual sacrifices in some form , and that it is the part of wisdom , of patriotism , and of discretion , to submit to such necessary sacrifices cheerfully when called upon , : inl not by their opposition attempt to excite popular clamour , and weaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted for the safety of their persons , and the security of their possessions . Every step which tends to weaken the public credit has the effect of rendering private property more insecure , because it obstructs the Government in procuring its necessary funds in the ordinary way , and may oblige it to resort to the arbitrary modes of forced loans and heavier rates of taxation . At this moment , therefore , when for the time every hope of aid from foreign capital is idle , when the country is compelled to look to her own resources for the means with which to maintain her integrity and subdue the rebellion , not only does every dictate of patriotism , and every enobling sentiment of humanity , call upon the capitalists of the country to rally in defence of the Government , but the meaner instincts of self-preservation admonishes them to submit to slight sacrifices now , that they may secure and preserve their property . Three measures have been considered in the Committee , which are , to some extent , connected together , and form a comprehensive system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enabled to procure the sums necessary to the successful prosecution of the war ; while , at the same time , the burden upon the capital of the country will be light , and the public w r ill be benefited in some important particulars . The first of these measures is the one now before the House , by which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue United States notes , not to exceed $150.000,000 in amount ( including those authorized by previous laws ) , of denominations not less than five dollars . They are not to bear interest , but are to be issued and received as money , convertible , at the option of the holder , into six per cent , stock of the United States , the principal and interest being payable either here or abroad , and these notes are to be a legal tender . The second measure consists of a tax bill , which shall , with the tariff on imports , insure an annual revenue of at least $150,000,000 . The third is : i national banking law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as security for the bank notes now circulated as currency . In order more fully to understand and more easily to meet any objections which may be urged against the first of these measures , being the /z/ one now occupying the attention of the House , it will be desirable to notice the other two , which are designed to be more permanent in their character. , and upon the expected results of which the present measure is in some degree based . " MR . HOOPER here explained the various modes of the proposed taxation , by which the credit of the government was to be supported , and also went into a full explanation of the National Currency Bank bill which had been prepared , and the manner in which the government bonds would be absorbed by the banks , as soon as the bill should go into operation . He then proceeded as follows : " The levying of the contemplated tax , the'proper inauguration of the new banking scheme , and the successful negotiation of a new loan , are matters that will require time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the demands upon the government are numerous and pressing . To enable the government to support itself during this interval of time , and to facilitate the negotiation of their loans , the committee have decided to recommend the issue of government notes . There is a necessity for money , and the object of the authority to issue $150,000,000 U. S. notes , not bearing interest and made legal tender , is to pay the creditors of the United States , and enable them to discharge their debts . * The propositions of com- mittees from Boards of Trade and banks , which recently visited Washington , submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury and declined by him , differed from the theory of this bill so far , as to require that instead of the issue of the United States notes the banks should be relied upon to furnish the amount needed . The effect of this would be that the government bonds must first be disposed of , and the money received for them paid to the contractors ; in other words , that the government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without restriction as to the rate or terms , at a time when the government is discredited by the delay and the difficulties that have occurred in paying contractors and others ; taking the notes of suspended banks in payment of these bonds , and with these bank notes , thus obtained , pay off the contractors . The obvious effect of such an arrangement would be to put the reins of our national finances in the hands of the banks , leaving to them the direction of cmpath , with little opportunity for the government to exercise any influence on the subject . Exactly upon what terms the government bonds could be negotiated now , under such circumstances , no one can say ; but last Summer , when the banks made their negotiation with the Secretary of the Treasury for $100,000,000 , they at first refused to do anything , because the Secretary was restricted by law to taking par for seven per cent , bonds payable in twenty years , and for seven and three-tenths Treasury notes payable in three years . They finally decided , though with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as wisely consulting their own to take $100,000,000 of the latter ; though at that time , as now , money was not worth for commercial purposes more than five per cent . It is proposed in this bill to limit the Secretary to par for six per cent , bonds , the principal and interest to be payable in specie or its equivalent . It is believed that there can be nothing more secure /z/ than these bonds , which thus become , as it were , a standard of value in reference to the currency . In the war of 1812 the Government paid for its supplies with funds obtained from the banks in the same manner as proposed in the plan recently submitted to the Secretary by those committees . The bonds of the United States were then negotiated in some instances at twenty per cent , less than their par value , and paid for in bank currency of different degrees of depreciation , according to locality , but averaging from twenty to twenty-five per cent , discount , as compared with coin . To render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the United States notes a legal tender . It is possible that they would become a practical tender , like bank notes , without providing for them to be a legal tender . If this were a foreign war there would be no doubt of it ; but in this present emergency , when those who are openly or secretly disloyal to the government are found everywhere to suggest obstacles that may embarrass the government , nothing should be omitted that will add to their efficiency . I am , therefore , in favor of making the notes a legal tender , believing the Secretary of the Treasury , who alone has the power to issue them , can and will use the power with his well known discretion , and that it will assist him in his endeavor to keep the notes at par with coin . We shall probably be told that England , in her great struggle , while specie payments were suspended , never made paper money a legal tender . But in this respect her example should serve us as a warning rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worse , by suspending the laws to enforce the payment of debts in cases where the paper money had been refused as a tender . It is important in this great struggle to show the superiority of the principles of freedom , of education , of the elevation of mankind , upon which society at the North is based , over those of slavery , which doom men to hopeless ignorance in order to insure abject obedience . To do this our resources of every kind are abundant , both in men and in means ; and it is only necessary to draw them out in order to be successful . To fail , would not be because the nation was so poorly endowed as to be without the means of success , but because it refused to make use of them . Such a result , if it were possible , would not weaken the truth of the great principles for which we are contending ; but would simply demonstrate that we , of this generation , were faithless in guarding those principles ; faithless to ourselves ; faithless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; and , since such infidelity is a violation of unquestionable duty , faithless to God .

ROSCOE CONKLING- " Are those the only amendments ? " MR . SPAULDING " There are two or three smaller amendments not affecting the principle of the bill , however , in any way .

" Mr. SPAULDING " Yes , sir . I will read a paragraph of the letter written by the Secretary to myself this afternoon : " I came with reluctance to the conclusion that the legal tender clause is a necessity ; but I came to it decidedly , and support it earnestly . I do not hesitate since I have made up my mind . * * * The conclusion I have arrived at has convinced me that it is important to the success of the measure . " And then , on motion of Mr. Wright , the House ( at half-past four o'clock P. M. ) adjourned . The following is a copy of the letter of Secretary Chase referred to in the foregoing proceedings of the House , and from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1862 . MY DEAR SIR : Mr. Seward said to me on yesterday that yon observed to him , that my hesitation in coming up to the legal tender proposition embarrassed you , and I am very sorry to observe it , for my anxious wish is to support you in all respects . It is true that I came with reluctance to the conclusion that the legal tender clause is a necessity , but I came to it decidedly , and I support it earnestly . I do not hesitate when I have made up my mind , however much regret I may feel over the necessity of the conclusion to which I come . I have just sent a note to Mr. Stevens , with two sections ( penal ) instead of one . You will , I think , see the necessity of them . The one I have /z/ already sent I fear is not quite strong enough . What has the Committee done about the amendments suggested ? I thought them important . Immediate action is of great importance . The Treasury is nearly empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the November loan ; so soon as it is paid , I fear the banks generally will refuse to receive the United States notes . You will see the necessity of urging the bill through without more delay . Very sincerely yours , /z/ On the 4th of February , the House gave consent to Mr. Morrill to have printed a substitute having the sanction of one-lwlf the Committee of Ways and Means , which he proposed to offer at the proper time in place of the original bill . Mr. Stratton , one of the Committee , changed his mind , and now favors the substitute instead of the bill first reported , leaving the Committee of Ways and Means equally divided . /z/ MR . MORRILL , of Vermont " MR . CHAIRMAN : Engaged as I have been upon other matters of at least equal importance , I have not had the time to prepare an elaborate speech ; but the subject of issuing $150,000 , - 000 of paper currency and making it a legal tender by the Government at a single bound the precursor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one of which is to be redeemed in the constitutional standard of the country could not but arrest my attention , and having strong convictions of the impolicy of the measure , I should feel that I utterly failed to discharge my duty if I did not attempt to find a stronger prop for our country to bear upon than this bill a measure not blessed by one sound precedent and damned by all . I know the gentlemen who have had the latter in charge have bestowed upon it much time and perplexing thought , and from their thorough knowledge of the subject and large acquaintance with the monetary circles of the country , their opinions w r ill have great weight in this Committee deservedly so and I shall only claim a candid hearing in behalf of the substitute of the minority of the Committee of Ways and Means , well knowing that we are all inflamed by the same zeal for the triumphant success of our arms , the same solicitude for the honor and welfare of the people , who mean to live and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but one wish , which is , that the best plan shall be adopted . We are urged by the gentleman from Xew York ( Mr. Spanieling ) to pass this bill as " a war measure " ' ; a measure of necessity , " and to enforce this idea he gives you the figures of our probable requirements , if the war should be prolonged until July 1 , 1863 . Sir , I have no expectation of being required to support a war for that length of time . The ice that chokes the Mississippi is not more sure to melt and disappear with the approaching vernal season , than are the rebellious armies upon its banks when our western army shall break from its moorings and rush with the current to the Gulf , and baptise as it goes , in blood , the people to a fresher allegiance . At the same time , the men of the East will only ask /z/ for an opportunity to cross bayonets with the chivalry to leave epithetand try what virtue there is in steel ! That hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the result . ' Fly swiftly round , ye wheels of time ! ' We can close this war by the 30th day of July next as well as in thirty years . Let us second general McClellan for a * short and sharp ' e.mtliet . By so doing ; ve shall economise both blood and Treasury notes . It ' this paper money is ' a war measure , ' it is not waged against the enemy , but one that may well make him grin with delight . J would us soon provide Chinese wooden guns for the army as paper money alone for the army . * If , by the provisions of this bill , we cut ourselves oft ' from all other resources , it is to be considered how much could be realized from this , in my judgment , the weakest resource within our grasp , which is the power of a bank issue , without any capital , and not even specie enough to tender the odd change . It is an experiment to inject , by a governmental force pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the arteries are already filled . The whole bank circulation of the United States in 18GO was $207,102,477 ; that of fhe rebel States was $50,647,028 , leaving for the loyal States $156,566,449 . But at this time , in consequence of the diminution of all business , except that nourished by the war , the bankcirculation is over $20,000,000 less , or about $136,000,000 . I admit that we can drive a considerable share of this home upon the banks , and substitute that of the notes of the United States in its place . * * * * It is thus apparent that $20,000,000 is about all that would be absorbed by this country , or kept afloat in the present condition of monetary affairs without the intervention of Congressional omnipotence in making them a legal tender . If so made , they would , to the extent they are tendered for public dues , be a forced loan ; and to the extent of the difference between their current value and that of standard coin , it would be a breach of public faith . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankrupts ; and if the bill passes , my friend from New Tork ( Mr. Conkling ) no longer need press his bankrupt law , for they would have no occasion to go into Chancery in order to scale and settle oif with their creditors , as " legal tenders " would soon be offered at rates entirely wit h in their means . * * * The Govern- ment can flood the country with 150,000,000 paper dollars , but from that moment you would vastly increase the cost of carrying on the war ; prices would go up , and the addition we should . pile upon our national debt would prove that it might have been even wiser to have burnt our paper dollars before they were issued . The inflation of the currency would be inevitable . In ordinary times few comprehend the Archimedean leverage of a few millions added to or subtracted from the currency of a nation actively engaged in the affairs of the world . * No one here contemplates but that at some future time the banks and the Government shall resume specie payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not and if so , I invite them to calculate the cost of the descent from that basis , the cost of the return , the expiratory pains to be suffered , and then determine whether we shall carry on this war on a specie basis , or on a ceaseless flood of paper , bartered at discordant priees in every - ity. town and hamlet of the country , hearing in mind , however cheaply oMained , even- dollar is to be /z/ and will be ultimately repaid in gold and silver coin raised by taxation . That I am not wrong in supposing if we launch this measure that we have nothing else to put afloat , is quite apparent in the able speech of my friend from Xew York ( Mr. Spaulding ) , who plainly occupied his ground reluctantly ; for besides the 150,000,000 of notes he now proposes to authorize , he more than hints at the possibility of ' a further issue of demand notes , if Congress shall hereafter deem it necessanv ' I maintain that the bill , as reported by the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will infinitely damage the national credit ; because it will cut off all other chance of supplies ; because it will reduce our standard of legal tender , already sufficiently debased ; because it will inflate the currency and increase manyfold the cost of the war ; because it would slide into the place proper for taxation ; because , as a resource , it must ultimately fail , and tend to a premature peace ; because it is a question of doubtful constitutionality ; because it is an export facto law . immoral , and a breach of the public faith ; because it will at once banish all specie from circulation ; because it will dampen the ardor of our men at home , as well as soldiers in the field ; because it will degrade us in the estimation of other nations ; because it will cripple American labor , and throw at least larger wealth into the hands of the rich ; and because there is no necessity calling for such a desperate remedy . I agree with the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Spaulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of the tonic of decided military success . Without that our stocks will continue to be quoted/ . And yet I am no chronic grumbler . Standing at zero , our army rose as if by a magical wand and illumined the whole heavens by its magnificent sweep . Do not let it be said we rose like the rocket and fell like the stick . Mr. Chairman It will be seen from the substitute , as proposed on the part of one-half of the Committee of Ways and Means , that I do not object to the issue of United States notes to a limited extent , to circulate as currency . It is both convenient and proper . But I wish to have this issue marked by metes and bounds , saying at the outset , ' thus far shalt thou go and no further . " Then , let them be based on as solid a foundation as the everlasting hills that they shall be the full equivalent of standard coin . This can be done by fixing the amount ample , but reasonable , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put in circulation , and by providing taxation sufficient at all times to retire them or to maintain their full value . But , with all the earnestness I possess , I do protest against making anything a legal tender but gold and silver , as calculated to undermine all confidence in the Republic , whose reputation should be dearer to statesmen , as well as to soldiers , than life itself . We propose no new issue of treasury notes , but leave the fifty millions already authorized to . be issued and re-issued as may be found necessary or convenient . This will secure us against an inflated currency . Then it is proposed to issue $100,000,000 in United States notes , bearing interest at the rate of three and sixty-five hundredths per cent. , payable at the pleasure of the United States , and allowing them with accumulated interest to be received for all debts and demands ( taxes included ) due to the United States , except duties on imports , and exchangeable at the will of the holder , whenever presented in sums not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , coupon or registered stock . They are also to be received at par , with accumulated interest , for any bonds the Government may hereafter issue . These are to be paid out for /z/ all salaries , debts and demands due to individuals and corporations , at their option within , the l r nJfel S ( tt-x . In substance this is very like English Exchequer notes issued in anticipation of revenue . It is most probable these notes would maintain their credit at or near par ; and if there should be any ditVerenee bet veen these and gold , it would be an honest difference . visible to all men . As they accumulate they will be funded and retired , or re-issued , as the exigencies of the ( Jovernment may require . They equip the Treasury as well as any legal tender paper could do , while bearing interest they would not pass into the general volume of the currency . and they afford the only possible channel of obtaining any considerable sums to be consolidated into stocks . They can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will create a sun 1 and constant demand for these notes , and sustain their credit in every State and Territory in the country . We do not propose to receive these notes for duties on imports , for the reason that it is desirable to leave the tariff stable amid nil fluctuation. * . and also that we may secure the coin we promise to pay out as interest u the bonds . It is then proposed , in order to perfect this plan in all its parts , to issue $200,000,000 in coupon or registered bonds , payable in ten years , rnth interest semi-annually in coin , at the rate of seven and three-tenths per cent , per annum . This is comparatively a high rate of interest , and it may be necessary that it should be so , in order to get the stock taken up by capitalists ; but the time the bonds are to run is limited to ten years . because it would be much against the interest of the United States to engage to pay a high rate of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no doubt that these bonds will all be taken , commencing as soon as the tax bill shall be passed . Unless the credit of the United States shall be utterly shattered , which is not for a moment to he apprehended , these bonds must be considered a most desirable investment , both in large and small sums . It is proposed to issue $300,000.000 in coupon or registered bonds , payable in twenty-five years , with interest at six per cent. , payable semi-annually in coin . Usually , government bonds running for the longest time command the highest price , and for permanent investment are most eagerly sought after , at home and abroad . As we emerge from our present embarrassments , the other forms of debts due by the Tinted State- will naturally be funded in such stock . We promise coin for all interest on bonds , as it is indispensable that all engagements assuming this solemn form should in no instance repudiate the standard of the Constitution . We strikeout all words in relation to any foreign loan , as during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own means , without any foreign aid or assistance ; and if we cnn be permitted to do that we shall ask no favors . The substitute avoids all the material , and , we might say . fatal objections to the original bill ; is entirely practical and feasible in its character . and will not only relieve the Treasury from its present necessities but do something toward making provision for the future wants . It is n question that will mark for weal or for woe an important page of our history : and I invoke the courage and judgment of the Committee to meet the question with that cool deliheiation its high moment demand-. " /z/ 4i MR . CHAIRMAN The member of the Committee of Ways and Means ( Mr. Spaulding ) , by whom this bill was reported , was well Avarranted in all he said of its great magnitude , and of the thoughtful , serious , courageous attention due to its consideration . It concerns the life of the nation the means whereby it lives . The credit of the government , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrity to pay all debts and perform all promises with scrupulous exactness and punctuality . This ability and integrity , this untarnished public faith and unquestioned pecuniary solvency is that without which no Government can long survive . Public credit alone can not confer national immortality or national longevity , but the loss of public credit will be inevitably and swiftly followed by national decrepitude and national death . This is true in peace , when wars and rumors of wars are hushed throughout the earth ; it is true in uneventful times , in periods barren of action and prolific of repose ; but what shall be said of its urgent , warning truth , as applicable to us in this dark hour of trial and of danger ? Immediate and adequate financial facilities constitute , beyond all question , the overtoppi/t ; / . overmastering subjects with which we have the power to deal . Gentlemen have longed for victories to re-invigorate the languishing energies of finance . Victory , no doubt , would exert a potent influence ; but , sir , the Treasury will control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , the question of money and credit is all there is before us ; it is practically the only unsettled question of the war . Armies and navies may perish , and a public credit , well preserved , can replace them ; but if the public credit perishes , the army and navy can only increase the disaster and deepen the dishonor . I deny that any necessity is upon us to take the case out of settled rules . We need money large sums of money and the whole resources and property of the nation are liable to pay tribute to raise it . We owe debts large debts and the whole property of the country is hoi den to pay them . Does anybody suppose that the security is not ample , or the resources not abundant ? My colleague from the Erie District ( Mr. Spaulding ) told us that the taxable property of the nation amounts to sixteen thousand millions of dollars ; and he produced a statement from the Census Bureau to prove it . In reality it is vastly more than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by proprietors themselves , having an interest in reducing and covering up the amount . According to my colleague , at the end of this fiscal year our debt will be only $650,000,000 . One would think here was margin enough for Wall street , State street , or Chestnut street . Sir , it is margin enough , properly husbanded from first to last , to enable us to raise all the money we want at five per cent. , and history proves it . Xov , sir , what does this plea of necessity mean this plea upon which we are invited to leave the trodden paths of safet ' , and seek new methods of ' winning false moneys from the crucible called debt ? ' What is the necessity which prevents adherence to the old and approved methods of raising money ? The arguments must be two-fold : First , that the people will be better ready at some other time than the present to pay what , in the end , they must pay , with interest ; and second , that necessary and legitimate taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote it . Sir , I take issue upon both propositions . I say the country /z/ is rich and ready . Money is abundant very abundant . Then- i in tin* loyal States $250,000,000 of gold the gentleman from Massachusetts M Alley ) said the other day $300,000,000 more than ever before , and it w-deserve it , we can have it . The whole country is full of wealth . Th enormous expenditures of this home war have been made among ourselves , and the money has remained here and not gone into the cha DIM 1 which foreign war prescribes for currency . The harvest has been abundant ; materials and productions , raw and wrought , have been in great demand ; and nearly every loyal State teems with the elements of material prosperity . From a very extravagant , we have lately become a very economical people , and thus the percentage , as well as the aggregate of savings of earnings , is unusually great . We are able to pay now , and we never can pay better than now . ****** There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about the bill before us , intended probably to attract votes , which seems of very questionable policy and very doubtful ethics . I mean hostility to the existing banks of the country . And inasmuch as I own not a farthing in the stock of any bank , and have not the slightest connection with one , perhaps a word in behalf of banks in loyal States will be borne with from me . The present troubles , or rather their own patriotic action , have broken the banks ; for every commercial man in this House knows that the banks were never stronger than when the Secretary of the Treasury appealed to them for loans . r lhcy allowed the Government to carry off their specie , their capital from their vault* , and if that did not break them , they at all events might have adopted a policy which would have saved them . But they had to suspend , and the design of this bill would seem to be to prevent their resumption of specie payment . At all events , it is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present banks , ami array prejudices and votes on that issue . ****** I propose to assign my reasons briefly for voting against the attempt by legislation to make paper a legal tender . The proposition is a new one . No precedent can be urged in its favor ; no suggestion of the existence of such a power can be found in the legislative history of the country ; and I submit to my colleague , as a lawyer , the proposition that this amounts to affirmative authority of the highest kind against it . Had such a power lurked in the Constitution , as construed by those who ordained and administered it , we should find it so recorded . The occasion for resorting to it , or at least referring to it , has , we know , repeatedly arisen ; and had such a power existed , it would have been recognized and acted on . It is hardly too much to say , therefore , that the uniform and universal judgment of statesmen , jurists and lawyers has denied the constitutional right of Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . But more is claimed here than the right to create a legal tender heretofore unknown . The provision is not confined to transactions in future , but is retroactive in its scope . It reaches back and strikes at every existing pecuniary obligation . This was well put by the gentleman from Ohio ( Mr. Pendleton ) , and I concur with him that substituting anything for gold and silver in payment of debts , and still more of precedent debts , is of very doubtful constitutionality. * But , sir , passing , as I see I must , from the constitutional objections to the bill , it seems to me that its moral imperfections are equally seri- /z/ ous . It will , of course , proclaim throughout the country a saturnalia of fraud a carnival for rogues . Every agent , attorney , treasurer , trustee , guardian , executor , administrator , consignee , commission merchant , and every debtor of a fiduciary character who has received for others money , hard money , worth a hundred cents in the dollar , will forever release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at its depreciated value , the spurious currency which we shall have put afloat . Everybody will do it except those who are more honest than the American Congress advises them to be . Think of savings banks entrusted with enormous aggregates of the pittances of the poor , the hungry , and the homeless , the stranger , the needlewoman , the widow and the orphan , and we are arranging for a robbery of ten , if not of fifty , per cent , of the entire amount , and that by a contrivance so new as never to have been discovered under the administration of Monroe Edwards or James Buchanan . To reverse the picture : after the act shall have gone into effect , honest men undertake transactions based upon the spurious tender at its then value . By and by comes a repeal , and they are driven to ruin in multitudes by the inevitable loss incident to a return to metallic currency . The whole scheme pre-supposes that the notes to be emitted will be lepers in the commercial world from the hour they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and condemned by the laws of trade and value . If this is not to be their fate , what is the sense , as was said in the Federal Constitutional Convention , in attempting to legislate their value up . Xow , sir , I do not believe that you can legislate up the value of a thing any more than you can make generals heroes by legislation . Mr. Chairman I believe all the money needed can be provided in season by means of unquestionable legality and safety . The substitute I have offered will , I believe , without essential alteration , effect that result . " MR . CoxKLiNr estimated the national debt up to July 1 , 1862 , at 06,000,000 , and concluded as follows : * ' There has been no such occasion presented to a nation , no such demand made upon a nation during the lifetime of the human race . The history of America , the history of free government , the history of constitutional liberty begins or ends now . We have our career and our traditions as a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made . Our destiny is without an ally in the world , with nations banded against us , to hold fast a continent in the midst of the greatest , guiltiest revolution the world has ever seen . ' ' MR . BINGIIAM , of Ohio , obtained the fioor . MR . STEVENS offered a substitute for the original bill , which lie asked to have printed . After Mr. Bingham had concluded his speech , the substitute thus offered by Mr. Stevens was ordered to be printed . or /z/ MR . BlXiJlIAM ' It was I:ir from my plirpo. -e , when I came early to the House to-day to attend a meeting of the Committee on the . huli. - iary , to enter upon any discussion of the important iiestion which m commands the attention of the Representatives of the people ; and but fulsome remarks which liavo been made to-day by the honorable gentleman from New York ( Mr. Koscoe Conkling ) . I would not feel disposed now to address the Committee , Hut , sir . as a Representative of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made upon this side of the House and upon that to lay the power of the American people to control their currency a power essential to their interests at the feet of brokers and of city bankers , who have not a title of authority , save by the assent or forbearance of the people , to deal in their paper issued as money . 1 am here to-day to assert the rightful authority of the American people , as a nationality , sovereignty , under and by virtue of their ( ' oust it ntion . In saying that the people of this Republic are one people , a sovereignty , I do not feel that I shall be confronted by any of the great names of the illustrious dead who have suddenly found favor with gentlemen upon the other side of the House . Living , there was no epithet in our language too severe in its condemnation , or too much uncharitable in its import , for the tit denunciation by certain parties of the alleged political heresies of the illustrious man , Alexander Hamilton , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellect stood alone among the living ; and now dead , in his honored grave , sleeps alone by the sounding sea . I am not myself of that class of admirers who persecute men while living and heap tuns of granite and pour empty adulation upon their ashes when dead . I prefer to respect them and their authority while they stand among the living men of to-day . These great names have been invoked in this debate . For what . purpose ? For the purpose of denationalizing the people ; for the purpose of stripping the American people of the attributes of sovereignty ; for the purpose of laying , as I said before , at the feet and at the mercy of brokers and hawkers on ' Change the power of the people over their monetary interests in this hour of national exigency . Sir , there is nothing in the records of these illustrious men that justifies any such base use of their utterances , which were made not only for the instruction of the men of their own day , but for the guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to affirm without having recently had the opportunity to read much of what he said upon that subject that Alexander Hamilton , peerless almost among the founders of the Constitution , never intimated in any paper of his that the Government of the United States could not . at its pleasure , issue Treasury notes , either payable upon demand or payable upon time . There was much said by my respected colleague ( Mr. Pendleton ) with which I entirely and altogether agree ; but , sir , when my colleague seemed to intimate in his argument that he found any warrant in the elaborate papers of Alexander Hamilton against this authority or power of the Congress of the United States to authorize the issue of Treasury notes , either payable upon time or upon demand , he greatly mistook the spirit of all he has written , and which has been transmitted to us . My colleague was adroit in the handling of the papers of Hamilton , which will live as long as our language lives . He was one of those men upon whom it pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homage and admiration of men , whether they agreed with him or not . The passage which my colleague quoted from his work was an argument in which he showed the propriety of establishing a national bank , authorized to issue currency , and he gave certain reasons therefor . My colleague is a most excellent lawyer . He knows well , and so did Hamilton know well when he made that argument , that what the Government does by another it does by itself . " MR . BINGHAM argued at great length that Congress had the power under the Constitution to authorize the issue of Treasury notes , payable on demand or payable on time , redeemable in gold and silver , or other legalized coin , and make them a legal tender ; and that the present bill did not contemplate any other issue . He insisted that Congress , by the Constitution , was invested with certain powers , and as to the objects , and within the scope of those powers , it was sovereign . That the Constitution contained no words giving to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign or domestic , a legal tender . It has the power to coin money , and regulate the value thereof and of foreign coins , but the Constitution does not contain any words declaring that these coins shall be a legal tender . The point I make is this : Congress has power by the Constitution to fix the standard value of foreign coin and of domestic coin , and the power to declare a legal tender , and that these powers are distinct . It may declare what shall be a legal tender , either foreign coin or domestic coin , or paper representing coin . It is done by act of Conr/ress . Nothing ever was a legal tender under the Constitution in discharge of debt but by express provision of an act of Congress . That the power " to regulate commerce " confers on Congress the power to declare what should be received in payment of debt . It is not restricted to gold and silver , but the Government may issue Treasury notes , redeemable in gold and silver , and declare them a legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill would " impair the obligation of contracts . " There is no such limitation as that imposed by the Constitution upon the power of Congress . It is a limitation upon the States , arid not upon the United States . It was not by inadvertence that the framers of the Constitution omitted to impose upon Congress this express restriction upon the States against impairing the obligation of contracts . They proclaimed in the absence of such limitations that Avhoever , within the jurisdiction of the United States , enters into any mere money contract , either public or private , enters into it subject to the sovereign pover of the people , to determine at any time , by legislative enactment , what shall discharge it . It is of the essence of the contract . He did not share in any of the fears entertained or intimated that the people will revolt at this measure . He had an abiding faith in their loyalty , in their love of law , in their settled purpose to suft'er and strive , to labor and sacrifice , that they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " MR . SHEFFIELD , of Rhode Island , followed Mr. Biiigham in a lengthy speech in opposition to the legal tender clause in the bill . He insisted that it was unconstitutional , and an " odious feature . The fact that you propose to force these notes upon the public against the will of the people implies that force is necessary , in your judgment , to induce people to take them . He said that if the legal tender clause was stricken out he would vote for the bill , notwithstanding it was objectionable in other respects . ( Mr. Sheffield 's speech will be found reported in the CoiKjrt ' . w'nmil ( Unite , page G40-1 . ) On Wednesday , I'Yhmary " t h , several speeches were made for and against the bill , all of which are fully reported in the Congressional Globe , but the limits of this narrative will not admit of their being published here . Only a brief sketch can be iriven at this time . MR .

The supply of the precious metals is inadequate to our wants . If all the gold and silver in the country was placed at the control of the Government , it would be received and paid out twice in one year . It is , therefore , impossible for the Government to pay in coin . The business of the country and the business of the Government require some substitute for coin . must therefore create a new or vastly enlarge the existing currency .

" He argued at great length that the legal tender clause was unconstitutional , and that it would not be just to the creditor clas of the community . He moved to strike out this clause in the bill , and also the clause which compelled persons in the employ of the government to receive the notes for " salaries , debts and demands owing by the United States , " so as to make them only r " receivable for all debts and demands 1m the United States . ' He urged heavy taxation , and was generally favorable to the bill . if the amendments were made which he proposed , but could not vote for the bill with the legal tender clause retained . ( Appendix to Congressional ( ' ' // page 47-48 . ) MR . PIKE , of Maine , spoke for one hour in favor of the bill .

It iinport. - niee to tinmeasure can not be overestimated . JIc rcjnrth-tl it ft* M /q// of the plan . /z/ Strike it out and we are but duplicating notes already at a discount . It is really the specie clause , and no hard money man and he claimed to be one should vote for the issue of these notes without it . It is well known that Mr. Clay rested his support of the second bank upon the clause granting Congress " the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into effect the powers , " expressly granted by the eighteenth section of the first article . The great patriot of the West , in time of profound peace , was disposed to consider the financial question of such magnitude as to plan a law calling into being a fiscal agent among those which were " necessary and proper . " With how much more force can we , situated as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fathers , acting as many wise men believe , as the last Congress which , under the Constitution , shall represent the whole country , claim that all power which , under any circumstances , could be exercised by the Representatives of the people , should be used now . " MR . ALLEY , of Massachusetts , made a well-considered speech of one hour in favor of the bill . " The measure before the House received the approbation of his judgment . He could see clearly that under its provisions the rights of all will be protected , the prosperity of the whole people promoted , the credit of the Government revived and its power and dignity maintained . Beneficent as this measure Is , as one of relief , nothing could induce him to give it his sanction but uncontrolable necessity . While he had always believed it to be the duty of Congress to regulate and control the currency by such legislation as would make it of uniform value throughout the country , he had never regarded it as politic or wise for the Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary emergencies . Disguise it as you may , everybody knows that knows anything of the laws of trade , that to carry this people through this crisis , collect $150,000,000 tax , maintain these vast expenditures , and conduct the legitimate and necessary business of the country , you must increase the volume of the currency to such an amount as to make it impossible , under the present banking system , to give it confidence upon the ground of its immediate convertibility into specie . The question then for Congress to decide , is whether the Government shall share with the banks and keep them in check this circulation , or purchase their irredeemable bills at ruinous rates . If you do not adopt this measure yon will see the country flooded with irredeemable bank currency , a great deal of which will be found , as after the war of 1812 , utterly worthless . At that time Government securities w ere exchanged at eighty cents on the dollar for worthless bank promises , not worth the paper upon which they were written . " MR . ALLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , are government securities worth in the market to-day but ninety cents on the dollar in exchange for irredeemable bank paper ? Is it because they have confidence in bank paper , or because it will command specie ? Not at all ; but because the bank paper will liquidate the obligations of debtors . It is for you to determine whether government obligations shall be as good as irredeemable bank notes ; and whether you will allow these irredeemable issues to be preferred and take precedence of ri a national currency issued by a Government that never repudiated a dollar of its indebtedness ; and a nation whose fabulous growth , immense interests and exhaustless resources , have excited the wonder and admiration of an astonished world . I confess that when I reflect upon our condition , and the misery and puttering which such a policy inflicts upon the business interests of the country , I can have no toleration for such suicidal action . Congress has the power to inaugurate to-day a system of financial policy , both for Government and people , which will establish our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability to all our institutions ; and I conjure you , by all the memories of the past and every hope in the future , not to disappoint in this moment of peril the just expectations of the American people " While Mr. ALLEY was making his speech , Mr. Spanieling . received from Secretary Chase a private note , urging the importance of having the vote taken on the bill that da- . It was known that Mr. Horton , a prominent member of the Committee of AVavs and Means , desired to speak in opposition to the bill , and that several other members desired to express their views of the measure before the vote was taken . The Treasury was nearly empty . Money , or other available means must be had right off . The pressing demands made upon the Treasury could not be put off much longer without ruin to the credit of the Government . The Secretary had authority under the Loan Act , passed at the extra session in July , still remaining , to issue $46,000.000 of Treasmy notes bearing 3-65 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue 7-30 notes ; but was unable to put out either class of this paper without a discount . The 7-30 notes could not be paid out from the Treasury except at a dis count of two per cent. , and he could not pay out the 3-65 notes at all , because the ' would not pass as currency , except at a still greater discount the rate of interest was so low that they were not desirable as an investment , and not being a legnl tender they could not be made available at par as a currency . The following is a copy of the note received from Secretary Chase at this time : " Such men as Nathaniel Thayer. of Boston ; Alexander Duncan , of Duncan , Sherman &; Co . ; Shepard Knapp and John D. Wolf , and numerous able and leading financial men , have told me within two days that you were perfectly right , and they are deeply anxious that the legal tender clause should stand in the bill . They say the country is lost without it . " TREASURY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the above extract from a letter received from the Collector of New York this morning .

After receiving this note from the Secretary , Mr. Spaulding thought it desirable that a time should be fixed for closing the debate on the bill . He thought it desirable that Mr. Horton and Mr. Stevens , members of the Committee of Ways and Means , should speak , and such others as were prepared , and that the vote should be taken the next da ' . The following proceedings took place in the House . MR . WRIGHT obtained the floor . MR . SPAULDING " I move that the Committee rise with a view of closing this debate . " ' MR .

I expected to go immediately back into committee to allow the gentleman from Pennsylvania to make his speech , and then to allow Mr. Horton to speak , and then Mr. Stevens to close the debate . After that the vote would be taken . " MR . THOMAS , of Massachusetts ' " Then you arrange the manner in which speeches shall be made on this floor . " MR .

After the debate is closed , ve proceed to voting upon amendments which are pending , and which may be offered , and then live-minute speeches will be in order , as upon other bills . Those speeches can be continued until amendments are exhausted . " MR . WRIGHT , of Pennsylvania , spoke for half an hour in opposition to the legal tender clause of the bill .

The people have means enough in their possession , and he was willing to go for taxation to the uttermost limit , but the time had not yet arrived when we should resort to such an extreme measure as to make these notes a legal tender . " ********* MR . HORTON , of Ohio , a prominent member of the Committee of Ways and Means , made a lengthy speech in opposition to the legal tender clause in the bill . " He thought w r e were taking a dangerous departure from the financial system of the country . If this bill passes , as he hoped it would not , this will be a point from which we shall date anew financial system lor the United States . " Old things will have been done away ; all things will have become new . " He thought the Loan bill and the Tax bill should have been passed through this House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were convinced of the importance of this , and were desirous that it should be done . ( Mr. Horton was one of the sub-committee on the Tax bill . ) It is from no neglect of the Committee of Va vs and Means , or of the sub-committee which has had the preparation of the Tax bill in charge , that the Tax bill and Loan bill have not been brought forward side by side . The sub-committee on the Tax bill have worked night and day ; and although they do not get much credit for being industrious , still substantial progress had been made . There were two measures before the House , and he proposed to discuss them . One was the proposition of the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Spanieling ) and the other that of the gentleman from Vermont ( Mr. Moirill ) . He insisted that the three-sixty-five hundredths per cent , notes , proposed in Mr. Mori-ill 's plan , possessed " all the characteristics for circulation which the Treasury notes of Mr. Spaulding 's bill will have ( ae the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning interest , and being fundable in a more desirable stock for the holder , liecause bearing a higher rate of interest , and more advantageous to the Government , because having only half the time to run , the Government can redeem them at an earlier day . " The Committee of Ways and Means are equally divided in regard to the two bills . He was for the substitute of Mr. Morrill , and decidedly opposed to the legal tender scheme . He thought we had not yet reached the point when the Government , exercis- /z/ ing its high prerogatives , as Mr. Spanieling called them , can take for its use the property of the citizen without pay . Necessity for this measure has been asserted , but not proved . The Secretary of the Treasury thinks it is necessary , but he thought he was mistaken . " Mr. Horton argued at great length against the injustice and inexpediency of making the notes a legal tender , and concluded as follows : " Mr. Chairman 1 thank the Committee for listening to me so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , and my remarks of course have been very desultory . But I Avish to impress upon the Committee that these opinions of mine are not merely opinions superinduced by a hopeful temperament . I have , according to the best of my knowledge , examined this Avhole question in all its bearings , and I am willing to take the responsibility of voting against this legal tender clause of the bill for the reasons that I have given , and for divers and sundry reasons which I have not given . I ask the Committee to pause before they take a step Avhich , once taken , vill be irrevocable . When you have once broken a pitcher it never becomes Avhole again ; and this fair fabric of our untarnished faith and unbounded wealth and credit ought not to be destroyed , simply because our leaders men that AVC have faith in have become alarmed , and have told us that there is a necessity for it . When there is danger , Mr. Chairman , then is the time to be cool and look about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOAV is that time , and if you take this step , it is a step doAvnAvards , and you Avill find that to regain the high eminence from which Ave shall have descended is a labor very difficult to accomplish . " MR . KELLOGG , of Illinois , obtained the floor . MR . SPAULDING " I ask the gentleman to give way to me for a few moments , and then I Avill move that the Committee rise , " MR . KELLOGG , of Illinois " I yield for that purpose . " MR . SPAULDING " I Avish to make one statement in reference to the conelition of the Treasury . Avhich I presume all will be anxious to know before Ave adjourn . The Secretary of the Treasury has yet unexpended of the loan of last July $46,000,000 . He has a light to issue this sum in three anel sixty-five hundredths per cent , notes , or in seven and threetenths per cent notes ; but he is unable to put out either of these classes of paper without a discount . He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes without a discount of tAvo per cent. , and he can not pay out the three anel sixty-fiA r e one hundredths per cent notes because they Avill not be taken as currency . This bill of Mr. Morrill proposes simply to repeat the authority to issue the same kind of notes , which can not be issued advantageously by the Secretary of the Treasury at this time . I move that the Committee do HOAV rise . " The motion was agreed to . * MR . SPAULDING " I move that all debate on House bill No. 240 be closed in one hour after its consideration shall have been resumed in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union . " /z/ MR . THOMAS , of Massachusetts " I suggest to the gentleman to modify his motion , so as to make it read two hours/ ' MR . SPAULDING " The exigencies of the country are such that I can not consent to do so unless the House so order it . " MR . VALLANDIGIIAM U I move to amend the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours . ' " The amendment was adopted , and the motion as amended was agreed to . /z/ Thursday , February 6 , 1862 , was an exciting and important day in the House . The final vote on the legal tender note bill was to be taken , and in anticipation of the vote there was a very full house . In pursuance of the order passed last night , general debate was to be closed in two hours after the bill should be taken up in Committee of the Whole . The House on meeting and disposing of a little preliminary business , immediately resolved itself into Committee of the Whole , and resumed the consideration of the bill . The Chairman announced that general debate on the bill would close at ten minutes past two o'clock P. M. While debate was continued , Mr. Frank and Mr. Colfax , who were friendly to the bill , passed around the House with a list , making a canvass of how the different members would vote on the legal tender clause . Upon footing up the list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of making the notes a legal tender . MR . KELLOGG , of Illinois , being entitled to the floor , spoke for over half an hour in favor of the bill , not as a peace measure , but as a ivar measure . He said : ** I intend to detain the Committee but a little while . I should not have sought the floor for the purpose of offering any remarks , but for the consideration that , in my judgment , this bill was being considered and discussed as it might with propriety have been discussed and considered in time of peace , and when there was no pressing necessity for the action of Congress in placing the Government in possession of all the means and powers that can be safely gathered and exercised under the Constitution . If this question came up in ordinary times , I am frank to confess , that I might , perhaps , have had some doubt of iis constitutionality sufficient to induce me to oppose it . I mean by that only to say that in time of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would be more careful and cautious ; and if I doubted the constitutionality of the measure 1 would not vote for it . But sir , in this our extremity , while we are struggling to perpetuate our Government , I am willing to go to the very verge of the Constitution . I will go as far as I feel that the Constitution will permit me , to gather up the power and means to carry on the Government to that great consum- /z/ mation which the fathers contemplated when they established it . But while I might have some doubt in time of peace , when the monetary affairs of the country might safely be left to work out their own level and settlement , of the policy of this measure , I have none now . What may be policy in the one case may be vastly different in the other . I treat this , Mr. Chairman , as emphatically and clearly a war measur . It may appear strange that a money bill should be considered a war measure , and yet it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry on the Government in a war direction a direction in which all our measures are or should be tending . Sir , we should not disguise the fact of our complications . We should not deceive ourselves . The worst deception that men ever practice is that practiced on themselves . We should not allow ourselves to be deluded , now that we have a mighty rebellion nay , revolution before us , and that the Powers of the Old World , who have looked with a jealous eye on the mighty progress of the Western Continent , are seeking occasion to cripple our onward and upward career . Talk not of their sympathy for us . Oar Government antagonizes theirs . The principles are different . We must gird up our loins ; we must take all the power we have ; we must throw every energy , all the means of our Government , in the direction of the war power , for the purpose of self-preservation and perpetuation . Mr. Chairman , Ave must look this matter in the face , not only of this continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come to the conclusion that although the world shall rise against us , this Republic must and shall be preserved . All the energy of the country , all the blood and treasure of the country , if need be , must be summoned in from every part of the land to accomplish that object . Sir , we must give to this Government arms of iron and muscles of steel . We must think as with fire and strike as with spears . It is necessary , sir , it must be ; and if we now meet this emergency as true men should meet it , we shall succeed . 2 he money of the country must come to its aid , the powers of the Government must come to the aid of the Administration , as well as the strong hands and warm hearts of our people . Mr. Chairman , I am pained when I sit in my place in the House and hear members talk about the sacredness of capital ; that the interests of money must not be touched . Yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American youth for the Army , to be sacrificed , without a blush ; but the great interests of capital , of currency , must not be touched . We have summoned the youth ; they have come . I would summon the capital ; and if it does not come voluntarily , before this Republic shall go down , or one star be lost , I would take every cent from the treasury of the States , from the treasury of capitalists , from the treasury of individuals , and press it into the use of the Government . What is capital worth without a Government f Gentlemen must understand me , when I indulge in this strain and speak in this strain and speak of this talk and quibble about capital , that I do not charge it upon the real capitalists of the country , for they do not hold back . The true capitalists of the country are patriotic ; they have furnished their means liberally ; but there is a class of huckstering capitalists , there is a class of bankers proper , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopes and fears of the Republic . * It is said there is no power to make these notes a legal tender , and that /z/ that is not a legitimate way of expressing their value . If gentlemen are sure upon that subject , they would do well to run back a little further and ascertain whether there is any power under the Constitution vested in Congress to issue the notes at all . And I confess the argument of the gentleman from Ohio ( Mr. Pendleton ) ran back legitimately to that proposition . At least it carried my mind back to that proposition so fairly and certainly , that if I found no power to issue these notes , I would have voted against this bill . To that my mind has turned with every argument that has been made . I may have been obtuse , but I confess that I have come to the conclusion that we have the constitutional power to issue these notes ; and having that constitutional power we have , as an incident to that power , the power also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gentleman has voted more than once for the issue of Treasury notes to pay debts owing by the Government , w T hich were payable in coin . If we have power to issue Treasury notes , we have the power to fix the value of the issue . It is an incident to the power of issuance . Let them be issued as money , to take the place of money . Let there be no deception ; let the creditors of the Government know whether we are to palm off a spurious depreciated currency under the guise of money . If we have the right to issue it , and impress with the denomination of five dollars , why not stamp upon its face that it is five dollars everywhere ? " MR . THOMAS , of Massachusetts , made a speech against the legal tender clause in the bill . " He regarded this clause as unconstitutional , unjust , and inexpedient . The question had never been settled by judicial authority , but the weight of reasoning by Webster , Madison , and others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . He argued that nothing but coined money could be made a legal tender in payments of debts ; that a matured debt could not be paid by another promise . He regarded this clause in the bill in the nature of a forced loan , in itself a confession of weakness . The friends of this feature of the bill admit the reluctance with which they assent to it . The only ground of defence is its necessity , that no alternative is left to us . He deepty respected their motives , but could not himself see the necessity. * ' MR . EDWARDS , of New Hampshire , made a speech in favor of the bill . 44 We find ourselves confronted by an exhausted Treasury , and without the means of meeting its existing , or its constantly accruing liabilities . The amount of floating liability now due is $100,000,000 . The figures presented in the opening speech of this debate are immense almost appalling . Funded and floating it is now $400,000,000 ; on the first of July next it will be $650,000,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He was in favor of taxation to pay ordinary expenses and interest , and ultimately a sinking fund , but he was in favor of the issue of Treasury notes for the purpose of meeting immediate expenditures , and all parties seemed to concede that Treasury notes in some form must be issued . The bill reported by the Committee of Ways and Mran. * . and the substitute offered by Mr. Morrill , may be regarded as the only propositions now before the House . It is understood that the other propositions will be withdrawn , and that the dissenters from tin- hill will ronn-ntrate on /z/ this substitute . They agree in the main features of the plan , and differ only in details . He thought the notes proposed by Mr. Merrill 's plan would not pass current among the people or the banks , but would necessarily depreciate . The army and navy might be compelled to receive them at par , because the Government had nothing else to give them , but they could not afterwards pass them without a large discount , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought that would be a lack of faith of the most flagrant description more objectionable by far than the legal tender clause . He also objected to the high rates of interest proposed for the bonds to be issued in funding the notes . The substitute provides for a depreciated currency and a high rate of interest He thought the currency proposed by the substitute would demoralize the country as much , or more , than the legal tender notes , and would not possess as many advantages to the Government . The legal tender notes would give instant means to the Treasury , so much needed at this time , without looking to intermediate negotiation to furnish them . The original bill was the one in all material respects to be preferred to the substitute , one of which it is distinctly understood will be adopted . " MR . RIDDLE , of Ohio , made a speech against the propriety and expediency of issuing the legal tender notes . " He doubted the constitutionality of the measure . He thought there was no real money , except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can money be made of paper ? Clearly not , by calling it money or by stamping it as money by the Government . It would not stand the commercial test . Paper has no appreciable intrinsic value , and its exchangeable value is of the lowest possible grade . The only high degree of value it can ever attain is that which may be imparted to it by that which is written or printed upon it . It is apparent that the whole quantity of the circulating medium must be materially increased , for obviously that which was only equal to the demands of commerce and the ordinary wants of the Government , is wholly inadequate now to the same demands and the extraordinary wants of the Government . He was opposed to the legal tender clause , and would vote to strike it out ; if that fails , I will choose between the bill and its defeat . " ( He voted for the bill on its final passage . ) MR . BLAKE , of Ohio , spoke in favor of the bill . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril to our free institutions greater than now . The bill is brought forward as a war measure , to meet the pressing demands now on the Treasury . He argued that it w r as constitutional to issue Treasury notes and make them a legal tender . He insisted that it was a necessary and proper means of carrying into effect the war powers to raise and support armies and to provide and maintain a navy . We are now in the midst of a great National exigency , and one , too , that we must provide for ; and one that in the application of the means there must of necessity be great latitude of discretion , and denied that legal tender paper money was prohibited . " ( He read from the debates on the formation of the Constitution , Vol. 5 , page 435 . ) MR . MASON " He was unwilling to tie the hands of the Legislature . He observed that the late war could not have been carried on had such a prohibition existed . " /z/ MR . BUTLER " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " MR . MASON " Was still averse to tying the hands , of the Legislature altogether . If there was no example in Europe , as just remarked , it might be observed , on the other side , that there was none in which the Government was restrained on this head . " MR . BLAKE continued his argument , insisting " that the Convention which framed the Constitution did not attempt any prohibition , but left it to Congress to make Treasury notes a legal tender whenever the exigency should arise to make it necessary . It was denied in express terms to the States , and permitted in implied terms to Congress . It being constitutional , is it necessary to make Treasury notes a legal tender ? By these notes we are enabled to pay our soldiers , and it is the only means we have to pay them . Does not every gentleman know that if these notes were paid to our soldiers without making them a legal tender , they will immediately be sold at a loss to the soldiers of from four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : this very thing was done here only labt month ; soldiers were shaved by the money-shavers of this District from four to twenty per cext. on the demand Treasury notes they had received from the Government . We are not legislating for the money-shavers , who oppose this bill , but for the people , the soldiers , and laboring MR . CAMPBELL , of Pennsylvania , spoke in favor of the bill . " He said , it is proper that each member of this House should , however briefly , express his views on the pending bill one of the most , if not the most , important bills of this season . To support our armies in the field and navies on the seas is a plain , patriotic and necessary duty ; to do this with prudence , economy and foresight , is the highest evidence of statesmanship . That we have vast National resources , all admit ; that the public debt has for its security the whole property of the nation , is equally plain . The powers of the Government are ample they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his duty in this tremendous issue , in which free government is on its final trial , who would not , if necessary , vote the last man and the last dollar to defend and perpetuate the priceless inheritance of our fathers . I humbly conceive my duty to be a plain one . The path I have marked out for myself I will follow , let it lead where it may . Whatever measure is now or hereafter may become necessary to adopt in order to maintain the Union and perpetuate free Government , that will I support . Speak not to me of " objections " and " scruples " and " dangers , " of " Constitutional objections " and " conservative influences . " Sophistry is ever plausible , and opposition to a just and necessary measure generally wears the mask of a " Constitutional objection . " The highest duty of every member is to maintain the Unionto sustain the Constitution against this causeless and wicked rebellion ; and in doing this , let us bear in mind that the Constitution was made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free government . Therefore , with me the primary inquiry is , is this measure necessary to suppress the rebellion ? If it is , here am I ready to sustain it . It will be found the Constitution gives ample power to sustain this view . The bill now before the Committee is necessary to sustain the credit of the country , and to carry on the war . It is with reluctance that I have come to this conclusion . I do not like the necessity which exists for tinlegal tender clause ; still less do I like to place the issues of the Govern- /z/ ment in the hands of the brokers and money-lenders of the country . Depreciated now , let the legal tender clause fail , and mark the result to-morrow . The Treasury notes will fall from four per cent , to fifteen and twenty-five below par , and the Government will have to pay that per percentage additional for every article they purchase . Your soldiers will be shaved that amount on their blood-bought wages , and the country , flooded with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontented under so fatal a mistake . If we make the Government issues a legal tender , the demand for specie will be so limited that they will maintain their value . " /z/ B ' order of the House general debate was now closed . The standing rules of the House , however , provide that the member introducing the measure shall have the right , after general debate is closed , to speak one hour in reply to adverse speeches , in finally closing the debate . Mr. Spaulding , having introduced the bill , was entitled to the floor to close the debate . Mr. Stevens , who had not yet spoken , was desirous of expressing his views on the measure , and Mr. Spaulding was willing to give him most of the hour to which he was entitled , and intended to 3 T ield the floor to him for that purpose . MR . SPAULDING , in closing , summed up , on his part , as follows : " I have listened with a great deal of attention to the arguments and propositions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the House , but I shall not now make the concluding speech . I shall leave it to the able Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means to close the debate . If I may be indulged , however , for a few moments , I desire to say , summing up , first : that all agree that taxation , in various forms , must be imposed to the amount of at least $150,000,000 on which to rest the credit of these notes and bonds , a sum sufficient to pay the ordinary expenses of Government on a peace footing , the interest on all the war debt , and a sinking fund to liquidate annually a portion of the principal . Second : we all agree that hereafter the war must be carried on principally upon the credit of the Government , and that paper in the form of notes and bonds must be issued to an equally large amount , whichever plan is adopted . After deducting the sum raised by internal revenue , by direct taxation , and duties on imports , the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual expenses of the Government . The respective plans of Messrs . Vallandigham , Conkling , and Merrill , require the same amount of paper to be issued as the legal tender bill proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means , and supported by the Secretary of the Treasury . Third : the main difference between the several plans is , that the legal tender bill stamps demand notes as money , with the highest sanction of the Government to circulate as a National currency , the same as bank notes , in all the channels of trade and business among all the people of the United States ; whilst all the other plans proposed contemplate the issue of an inferior currency that will not , in my opinion , circulate as money either among the banks or the people , but will , on the contrary , be depreciated and /z/ sold at a large discount by all officers , soldiers , and others that are compelled to receive it from the Government in payment for services . -. in supplies furnished . For myself , I prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the highest legal sanction that can be given to them by the Government , placing the soldiers and capitalists all on the same footing in regard to these notes . " Mr. SPAULDING then yielded the floor to Mr. Stevens . Mr. LOVEJOY objected to the gentleman yielding the floor . THE CHAIRMAN " If objection is , made , the gentleman from Pennsylvania can not occupy the floor . The gentleman from New York can not yield the floor to him , except by unanimous consent . " Mr. MORRILL " I trust no objection will be made ; only the same time will be consumed . " Mr. LOVEJOY " Well , I will withdraw the objection . " " MR . CHAIRMAN This bill is a measure of necessity , not of choice . " No one would willingly issue paper currency not redeemable on demand , and make it a legal tender . It is never desirable to depart from the circulating medium which , by the common consent of civilized nations , forms the standard value . But it is not a fearful measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce no alarm . The late administration left us a debt of about $100,000,000 , and bequeathed to us also an expensive and formidable rebellion . This compelled Congress , at the extra session , to authorize a loan of $250,000,000 ; $100,000,000 of these were taken at 7 3-10 per cent. , and $50,000,000 six per cent , bonds at a discount of over $5,000,000 ; $50,000,000 were used in demand notes , payable in coin , leaving $50,000,000 undisposed of . Before the Banks had paid much of the last loan they broke down under it and suspended specie payment . They have continued to pay that loan , not in coin , but in demand notes of the Government ; that has kept them at par , but this last of the loan was paid yesterday , and on the same day the banks refused to receive them . Ihey must now sink to a depreciated currency . The remaining $50 , - 000,000 the Secretary of the Treasury has been unable to negotiate . A small portion of it , say $10,000,000 , has been issued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He estimated the present floating debt at $180,000,000 ; daily expenses , $2,000,000 ; to carry us to next meeting of Congress , $600,000,000 more . That if sufficient six per cent , bonds were forced on the market to pay our expenses up to December , or $700,000,000 , as the money should be wanted , he thought they would sell as low as sixty per cent. , as in the last English war ; and even then it would be impossible to find payment in coin . A large part of it must be accepted in depreciated notes of suspended banks , for no one expects the resumption of specie payments until the close of the war . Without the legal tender clause the notes could not be kept at par . Brokers , bankers , and others would depreciate them . The National Bank scheme recommended by the Secretary might , in ordinary times , be very useful , but while the banks are under suspension it was not easy to see how it would relieve the Government . They would have the circulation without interest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , /z/ and afford no immediate relief . He thought the Government should have the benefit of the circulation of legal tender notes , and did not see how we could get along in any other way . He argued in favor of the constitutionality of the legal tender clause , and that it was a necessary and proper measure at this time . In short , whenever any law is necessary and proper to carry into execution any delegated power , such law is valid . That necessity need not be absolute , inevitable , and overwhelming if it be useful , expedient , profitable , the necessity is within the constitutional meaning . Whether such necessity exists is solely for the decision of Congress . Their judgment is absolute and conclusive . If Congress should decide this measure to be necessary to a granted power , no department of the Government can rejudge it . The Supreme Court might think the judgment of Congress erroneous , but they could not review it . Now , it is . for Congress to determine whether this bill is necessary " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and provide for the general welfare . " They are all granted powers . It is for those who think that it is not " necessary , useful and proper , " to propose some better means , and vote against this ; if a majority think otherwise , its constitutionality is established . If constitutional , is it expedient ? It is objected by the gentleman from Ohio , that the legal tender clause would depreciate the notes . All admit the necessity of the issue ; but some object to their being made money . It is not easy to perceive how notes issued without being made immediately payable in specie , can be made any worse by making them a legal tender . And yet that is the whole argument , so far as expediency is concerned . Other gentlemen argued that this would impair contracts , by making a debt payable in other money than that which existed at the time of the contract , and would so be unconstitutional . Where do gentlemen find any prohibition on Congress against passing laws impairing contracts ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But this impairs no contract . All contracts are made not only with a view to present laws , but subject to the future legislation of the country . We have more than once changed the value of coin . Neither our gold nor our silver coin is as valuable as it was fifty years ago . Congress in 1853 , I believe , regulated the weight and value of silver . They debased it over seven per cent. , and made it a legal tender . Who ever pretended that that was unconstitutional ? The gentlemen from Vermont ( Mr. Morrill ) , - and Ohio ( Mr. Pendleton ) , think it an ex port facto law . It is not wonderful that my distinguished colleague , not being a professional lawyer , should not be aware that the ex pott facto laws prohibited by the Constitution refer only to crimes and misdemeanors , and not to civil contracts . The gentleman from Ohio no doubt knew , but forgot it . Gentlemen are clamorous in favor of those who have debts due them , lest the debtor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much sympathize with such importunate money-lenders . But widoivs and orphans are interested and in tears , lest their estates should be badly invested . I pity no one who has his money invested in United /States bonds , payable in gold in twenty years , with interest semi-annually . But while these men have agonized bowels over the rich man 's case , they have no pity for the poor widow , the suffering soldier , the wounded martyr to his country 's good , who must receive these notes without legal tender or nothing , and who must give half of it to the Shylocks to get the necessaries of life . Sir , I wish /z/ no injury to any , nor with our bill could any happen ; but if any must lose , let it not be the soldier , the mechanic , the laborer or tho farmer . Let me relate the various projects . Ours proposes United Stales notes , secured at the end of twenty years to be paid in coin , and the interest raised by taxation send-annually ; such notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . No better investment , in my judgment , can be had ; no better currency can be invented . The amendment of the gentleman from Ohio ( Mr. Vallandigham ) proposes the same issue of notes , but objects to a legal tender ; but does not provide for their redemption on demand in coin . He fears our notes would depreciate . Let him who is sharp enough to see it instruct me how notes that every man must take are worth less than the same notes that no man need take , and few would , being irredeemable on demand . But he doubts its constitutionality . He who admits our power to emit bills of credit , nowhere expressly authorized by the Constitution , is a sharp and unreasonable doubter when he denies the power to make them a legal tender . The proposition from the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Roscoe Conkling ) authorizes the issuing of seven per cent , bonds , payable in thirty-one years , to be sold ( $250,000,000 of it ) or exchanged for the currency of the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this proposition seems to me to lack every element of wise legislation . Make a loan payable in irredeemable currency , and pay that in its depreciated condition to our contractors , soldiers and creditors generally I The banks would issue unlimited amounts of what would become trash , and buy good hard-money bonds of the nation . Was there ever such a temptation to swindle ? He further proposes to issue $200,000,000 United States notes , redeemable in coin in one year . Does not the gentleman know that such notes must be dishonored , and the plighted faith of the Government broken ? No one believes that we could then pay them , and it would run down at once . If we are to use suspended notes to pay our expenses , why not use our own ? Are they not as safe as bank notes ? During the suspension , the Government would have the benefit of the whole circulation , without interest , until they were funded that is , the interest of all we could keep out would accrue to the Government . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government , without interest , to that amount , $9.000,000 a year . But if we used the suspended paper of the banks our bonds would bear interest from the instant we got their notes a good thing for suspended banks . Besides , the Government would have the benefit of all the lost and destroyed notes a considerable item . Last comes the substitute of the minority of the Committee ( introduced by Mr. Morrill ) . I look upon it as a curiosity . It proposes to issue United States notes , not a legal tender , bearing an interest of three and sixty-five hundredths per cent. , and fundable into seven and three-tenths per cent , bonds , but not payable on demand , but at the pleasure of the United States . This gives one and three-tenths per cent , higher interest than our loan , and not being redeemable on demand , would share the fate of all non-specie-paying notes not a legal tender . But the ingenious minority have invented a kind of currency never before known a circulation bearing interest . Bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one expects they will be used as currency ; whether in the shape of bonds or notes , they will be used only as investments , or as /z/ pledges on which to procure loans . Suppose a tailor , shoemaker , or other mechanic , or laborer , were to take one of these bills , and in a week he should wish to use it in market or store , or elsewhere , he must sit down and calculate the interest on the days he has had it to find its value . This would be rather inconvenient on a frosty day . This currency would make it necessary for every man to carry an arithmetic or interest table with which to guage the value of the circulating medium . Gentlemen must see how r ridiculous , if not impracticable , this scheme is . Here , then , in a few words , lies your choice . Throw bonds at six or seven per cent , on the market between this and December , enough to raise at least $600,000,000 about this sum is already appropriated , $557 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeemable in coin , but fundable in specie-paying bonds at twenty years ; such notes either to be made a legal tender , or to take their chance of circulation by the voluntary act of the people . I maintain that the highest sum you could sell your bonds at would be seventy-five per cent. , payable in currency itself at a discount . That would produce a loss which no nation or individual doing a large business could stand a year . I contend that I have shown that such issue , without being made money , must immediately depreciate , and would go on from bad to worse . I natter myself that I have demonstrated , both from reason and undoubted authority , that such notes , made a legal tender and not issued in excess of the demand , will remain at par and pass in all transactions , great and small , at the full value of their face ; that we shall have one currency for all sections of the country and for every class of people , the poor as well as the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an unwonted apparition , for the first time prowling forth to swallow the rich creditor and smouse the poor debtor . S r o nation , it is said , has ever tried anything like it . Let us look at the greatest and wisest commercial nation in the world . In 1797 England was struggling for existence against armed Europe . She needed money , as we do now . She found it impossible to borrow . Gold was likely to leave the country . She passed a law prohibiting the Bank of England from paying coin for her notes until six months after the final ratification of peace . That law remained in force till 1823 . It is said she did not make those notes a legal tender . She provided that whoever refused to take them for a debt should have no remedy for its collection : and that a plea of such tender should be a bar to the action . This , I think , is the most stringent legal tender ; yet those notes never depreciated to any great extent . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. STEVENS " Xo , sir ; at no time after they were made a legal tender did they depreciate twenty per cent/ ' Mr. VALLANDIGHAM " I have the authority of Mr. Canning , which I think is quite as good as that of Mr. McCulloch . They were receivable all the time for Government dues . " Mr. STEVENS " Yes , sir ; but they still run down until they were made a legal tender , and after that they never depreciated a single dollar . Had they been made an absolute tender , they would not have depreciated a farthing . But now , in times of peace , the notes of the Bank of England are /z/ a legal tender in all the vast business of that nation , and in even/ place , except a I the counter of the bank . What else are Bank of England notes than bills of credit of the Government ? Her whole capital consists of Government securities , and her issues are based on that alone . Prussia holds the currency in paper issueable by Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fine-spun theories of the opponents of this bill ? I think they have distressed themselves very unnecessarily ; and yet , gentlemen have shown all the contortions , if not the inspirations , of the Sibyl , lest Government should make these notes a uniform currency , rather than leave them to be regulated by sharks and brokers . I look upon the immediate passage of the bill as essential to the very existence of the Government . Reject it , and the financial credit , not only of the Government , but of all the great interests of the country , will be prostrated . " MR . CHAIRMAN " Let me say in conclusion , that unless this bill is to pass with the legal tender clause in it , it is not desirable to its friends , or to the Administration , that it should pass at all , and those who think as I do will have to vote against it , if it should be thus mutilated and emasculated . If it is to be defeated , I should be glad if we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign our places on the Committee of Ways and Means , and leave it to those who oppose this bill to mature some other measure . So far as I am concerned , I shall be modest enough not to attempt any other scheme . The Committee of Ways and Means have labored in the preparation of this measure anxiously , and to the best of their poor abilities . We are not infallible . We do not come near it . I am but poorly qualified for anything of this kind . But w r e have given it our most anxious consideration , and have consulted those whom we believed to be the best qualified to advise us . We have sought to harmonize conflicting views in the substitute which the majority of the Committee have prepared , and we hope it will pass . We believe that the credit of the country will be sustained by it , that under it all classes will be paid in money which all classes can use , and that it will confer no advantage on the capitalist over the poor laboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail it as the most auspicious measure of this Congress ; if it should fail , the result will be more deplorable than any disaster which could befall us . " At the conclusion of Mr. Stevens ' speech the Chair announced that general debate was closed . Amendments were now in order , and under the rules of the House , five-minute speeches could Inmade in favor of , or in opposition to , each amendment proposed . Under this rule , several short speeches were made by members who had not an opportunity to speak during the general debate . Mr. F. A. CONKLING , who opposed the legal tender clause in the bill , read an extract from an eminent citizen of New York , as follows : " The advocates of a paper substitute may find an argument in the necessities of the crisis , but are certainly not guided by the light of experience , if they recur to the fact that in 1814 a Boston bank note was capable of buying twice its nominal value in Treasury notes ( not a legal tender ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. gold/ in Denmark , in 1813 , when their currency , which was printed on blue paper , /z/ depreciated to such an extent that the King* , to remedy the evil , issued a new currency , printed on white paper , accompanied by an edict that one rix dollar of the new emission should be regarded in all transactions as worth six of the old , and taken as a legal tender , which required an amount of faith equal to that which was exacted by Lord Peter of Martin and Jack : that they should believe ' a loaf of brown bread to be a shoulder of mutton , ' or suffer for their incredulity . This arbitrary edict led to the ruin of many creditors , especially mortgagees , who were thus compelled to receive ' rags and lampblack ' in satisfaction of debts contracted in gold and silver . At that time I had bargained with the King 's painter , in Copenhagen , to take my portrait ( a half length , still in my possession ) , for three hundred and six dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the paper currency of the Government , that when it was completed I purchased with nine Spanish milled dollars the three hundred and six dollars to pay for the portrait and frame ; and such was the faith and loyalty of the painter , that he believed , or was bound by law to believe , that the oie currency was just as good as the other ! Being in London during the same year , I was guilty of the felonious act of selling my gold guineas for twenty-seven shillings in paper , while honest , patriotic and credulous John Bull insisted that in theory their value was the same ; and Right Honorable the Chancellor of the Exchequer could cause the transportation to Botany Bay of any man who practically proved the contrary . ' " Mr. HUTCHINGS " I would like to inquire as to the occupation of the gentleman who wrote that letter ? " 1 Here the hammer fell . Mr. CRISFIELD " In order to accommodate what seems to be the wish of the Committee , or some members of it , I propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the words , " and shall also be lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts , public and private , within the United States . " Mr. SHELLABARGER u Mr. Chairman , 1 rise to oppose the pending amendment . I did desire to submit to the Committee some views touching this measure when we were in general debate , but omitted to do so in deference to the more matured views which other members of the Committee desired to submit . I propose to occupy the few minutes I have , in making some statements in relation to the charges of bad faith and injustice which have been so persistently , earnestly , and , doubtlessly , sincerely made by the opponents of the bill . Now , sir , I think it must be plain , beyond all cavil , that if these notes , proposed to be issued under this bill , are made of the value imposed upon them by law , so that they will be to the citizen the true and real representatives of that amount of the intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them as their nominal value , then there can be no practical injury , injustice , or bad faith in the law which makes them pay a debt precisely equal to that real value or wealth of the country , which that note , so made a tender , represents . It is , of course , not my purpose now either to discuss or state those views by which others see in this measure as distinguished from those they advocate only disaster , in the shape of l destruction of all standards of value ; ' in the ' inflation of the business and the prices of the country ; ' in disordering the ' operations of trade and commerce ; ' and in the ultimate ' bankruptcy ' of the Government and of the people I /z/ have no doubt this cry is made sincerely by minis , and perhaps it is believed by all who make it . I do not discuss the sources and reasonableness of this cry of alarm , but only Avish to present a parallel to it . and say that this cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to hirh I allude . I find that parallel in the history of the growth of the debt of England ; and in the light of that history , I declare that this cry of ' bankruptcy ' and national disaster and ruin is utterly unreasonable , and just now most pernicious . Sir , the history of the growth of that debt , which one of the ureat Commoners of England calls ' the greatest prodigy that ever perplexed the sagacity and confounded the pride of statesmen and philosophers , ' furnishes as conclusive refutations of the theories and predictions of our alarmists of this House , as it did in the past of other Parliaments . Sir , at the end of the war of England with Louis XIV , in 1713 , the debt of England was , in round numbers , $250,000,000 . But , sir , at that period , not pot-house politicians merely , but profound thinkers , declared the Government permanently crippled . But while these were engaged in proving the nation ruined , the nation was growing richer and richer . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aix laChapelle ; and the national debt had come to be $400,000,000 in 1748 . Xow , again . historians , statesmen and economists concurred in declaring that the case of England was certainly now desperate ; but now again the nation persisted , although demonstrated by the books to be a bankrupt , in becoming far richer than in any period of her history . Soon the nation became again involved in the continental wars of the reign of George II , and at the end of Chatham 's administration , at the period of 1700 , the national debt came to be $700,000,000 . Then , again , it is declared that both men of theory and of business united in declaring that now , at all events , the fatal day had certainly arrived . Adam Smith , the father of politico-economical science , thought the limit had been reached , and an increase of the debt would be fatal . David Hume , the profoundest man of his age , declared it would have been better that England had been conquered and crushed by Prussia and Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kingdom north of Trent and w r est of Reading were mortgaged . He said the madness of England exceeded that of the crusaders . Richard Cceur de Lion and St. Louis had not gone in the face of arithmetic . England had . You could not prove that the road to Paradise was not through the Holy Land ; but you could prove that the road to national ruin w r as through a national debt . But still , in defiance of Hume and Smith , and even Burke , the nation would live and grow richer , and pay the interest on its public debt . Then came George Grenville 's policy to tax the colonies of America to help pay the interest on this debt , and brought on our war of the Revolution . In that England lost the colonies , and found an addition to her public debt of $500,000,000 making the aggregate , at the time ot the treaty of peace , $1,200,000,000 . Again England was pronounced hopeless : but again she continued to be more prosperous than ever before . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the debt of England ran up to $4,000,000,000 . Again the cry of despair and of bankruptcy was louder than ever ; but also again the cry was faUe aever ; and the interest on the debt of England not only continued to be paid to the day at the bank , but such was her prosperity that at the close /z/ of these French wars , her people expended for railroads in the island , in a few years , more than $1,200,000,000 ! Such is a sketch of the history of the debt of England , and such the refutation furnished by the logic of history to the logic of abstract reasoning , however profound . A great historian and a great commoner of England declares that all these cries of bankruptcy and ruin were based on a double fallacy . They who raised these cries imagined that there was an exact analogy between the case of an individual who is in debt to another , and the case of a society which is in debt to itself ; and they also forget that other things grew as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this allusion to the debt of England to show that ' a national debt is a national blessing , ' nor to indicate that this nation ought permanently to depart from its old and traditional policies of avoiding public debt and direct taxation . I do not think we either ought to or will . But , sir , this parallel between the alarms of this day and this country , and those of the past in another country , is only introduced to indicate the strange infirmities of vision in all these prophets of evil , and to indicate how unjust and cruel it is to weaken , by these refuted cries of ruin and bankruptcy , the faith of the people in the Government , which now , in its daj r of peril , so preeminently rests upon the faith of her children . Sir , all these obligations of this Government go out to the people borne up by all the faith and all the property of the people ; and they have all the value which that faith untarnished , and that property unestimable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic value that they need the quality of ' lawful tender , ' but it is to secure to the Government in their issue their true value , and to retain for them that true value as you pass them as all agree you must to your noble soldiery in the field , and to all classes of the people not engaged , as the most persistent outside opposition to this bill is , in endeavoring to destroy the value of these , so that out of the blood of their sinking country they may be enabled to coin the gains of their infamy. ' 1 ' ' /z/ Mr. HICKMAN , of Pennsylvania , spoke in favor of the bill : " The only question , Mr. Chairman , which I have ever had with reference to this bill , has not been a question as to the powers of Congress , but as to the policy of the enactment . I would , myself , have preferred that this bill had followed the tax bill . I would have preferred that , before the credit of the Government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit should have been exhibited to the country . Before I take my neighbor 's note , I should require him to show me on what his credit rests ; of what his capital consists . I have , therefore , had great doubt as to the propriety of voting for this bill as it stands at this time . But being assured by the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means that the Treasury , and , perhaps , the Administration , regard this as a governmental necessity , I am disposed to waive the question of propriety or expediency , and to vote for it as a necessity , having no doubt about the right . That clause of the Constitution which gives to the Government the right to coin money , and to regulate the value thereof , is , to my mind , conclusive of the great question that lias been raised in this House , ' To coin money . ' It does not indicate of what the material shall consist . which is to be regarded as money . It might be gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or iron , at the pleasure of the Government . In other word- , it is not demanded that the thing itself , which shall be coined as money , shall have any intrinsic value . The coining of money is merely impressing upon that which is designated to be the circulating medium the mark of the sovereign , indicating the will of the sovereign that it shall be received in the exigencies of trade and commerce at the stated value . And that mark of the sovereign , indicating the will of the sovereign , may just as well be impressed upon paper as upon gold or silver . t Nothing else can be made out of the Constitution in this regard . According to the arguments which have been addressed against thU bill , the Constitution should have been made to read : ' Congress , or the Government , shall have power to coin gold and silver money according to their intrinsic value . ' Why , sir , the Government is not restricted as to the material out of which it may make money ; is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ; it has perfect power to adopt iron as well as any other nietalic basis ; and if any other metal , why not paper ? Why not impress upon paper the mark of the sovereign , indicating the will of the sovereign as to the value at which it shall be received , and make it a circulating medium , there being nothing in the Constitution to restrict us in this necessary exercise of sovereign power , without which no Government can carry on its'operations ; without which no Government could exist ? I have no doubt , whatever , in regard to the right of Congress to pass this bill , and I am therefore willing to vote for it upon the ground that it is a necessity at this time . /z/ Mr. LOVE JOY , of Illinois , opposed the bill : ; MR . CHAIRMAN I have endeavored for a day or two to obtain the floor , for the purpose of expressing my views a little more at length than I can in the live minutes to which I am now limited ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ways and Means , my purpose has been averted . I will now simply say in regard to the question of constitutionality , that there has not been a respectable argument advanced in defense of the constitutionality of this bill ; and , inasmuch as great talent and eminent ability have been brought to bear upon it , I take it that no respectable argument can be made in vindication of the constitutionality of this bill . I would admit the plea of necessity , if I believed it ; and I think it is more manly to confess , as Jefferson did , than it is to attempt to torture the constitution into the support of a measure which everybody must see to be unconstitutional . Now , Mr. Chairman , in regard to the general idea of the bill , it is a mere fallacy . The whole argument used in favor of the issue of these legal tender notes is based upon precisely the same foundation as the old theological dogma , crede ui edes. et edes believe that you eat the real flesh of Christ in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this piece of paper is a live dollar gold piece , and it is a five dollar gold piece ; believe it is worth live dollars , and it is worth five dollars . Now , sir , I am prepared to state that it is not in the power of this Congress , nor in the power of any legislative body , to accomplish an impossibility in making something out of nothing . Tin. * piece of paper you stamp as live dollars is not five dollars , and it /z/ never will be unless it is convertible into a five dollar gold piece ; and to profess that it is , is simply a delusion and a fallacy . You may say even by legislative enactment that sixty or eighty or even ninety-nine cents are a hundred , but the rigid , inexorable digits will stand " fixed and immovable by your legislative legerdemain . Mr. Chairman , we are urged by the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means to pass this bill , because ruin is before the Government if we do not pass it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alarm . I can not undertake to give it in rhyme , but I will give the substance of it . You will remember that , hearing the deep braying of the hounds , and the sound of the hunter 's horn , the sheep coursed round and round the field , until the frightened flock came to the brink of a precipice , and to get away from the hounds and huntsman the pater gregis advised them thus : " I hold it , therefore , wisest and most fit That life to save , we leap into the pit . " The matron of the flock , more discreet than the spouse , replies : " How ? leap into the pit our life to save ? To save our life , leap all into the grave ? " Sir , there is no precipice , there is no chasm , there is no possible yawning , bottomless gulf before this nation so terrible , so appalling , so ruinous , as this same bill that is before us , and that it is proposed to pass under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You issue $100,000,000 of those notes . The gentleman tells us they are already due . We have got to pay the paper out almost before we can make it . It has taken us six months to manufacture $50,000,000 , and we can not manufacture it as fast as we shall spend it at that rate ; so that when we have issued $100,000,000 we must issue another $100,000,000 , and then another $100,000,000 . And thus we plunge from lower depth to still lower , till we are buried in an ocean of inconvertible paper . At every step your paper will depreciate more and more , until the expenses of the war will swell to such an appalling sum that redemption will be impossible , and repudiation inevitable . Facilis deocensus averni , etc .. which means it is easy to slide clown hill , but very hard work to draw the sled back over smooth ice . But the question is pressed : what will you do ?

Every piece of paper that claimed to be money , but was not , I would chase back to the man or corporation that forged it . and visit upon them the penalties of the law . 1 would not allow a bank note to circulate that was not constantly , conveniently and certainly convertible into specie . Third I would issue interest-paying bonds of the United States , and go into the market and borrow money and pay the obligations of the Government . This would be honest , business-like , and in the end economical . This could be done . Other channels of investment are blocked up , and capital would seek the bonds of investment . This is , in substance , what I propose . This would bring us through the war poor indeed , for half the nation has to support the other half , but with the health and vigor of the athlete , and not with the bloated flesh of the beer guzzler . Did I not know that the passage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-commit , with instructions to that effect . " /z/ Mr. WALTON , of . Maine , advocated the bill . " Necessity compels us to pay our creditors in treasury notes . Our credit is exhausted ; or perhaps it will be more accurate to say that tho means of those who arc willing to lend to the Government have become exhausted . To lay and collect taxes will require considerable time ; besides , it can not reasonably be expected that revenue enough can ever be derived from taxation to meet all the expenses of the Government while the war lasts . Practically , therefore , our Government is reduced to the necessity of paying not only its other creditors , but our brave soldiers , in its own notes . Thus compelling our creditors ( our brave soldiers included ) to take their pay in treasury notes ; is it not just , is it anything more than common honesty , to allow them to pay their debts in the same way . If these treasury notes are made a legal tender , they will circulate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only cease thus to circulate , if ever , when they have reached the hands of those who have no debts to pay . And if , as the enemies of the legal tender clause predict , they ever fall in value below par , will not the loss fall upon those who have money , and no debts to pay ? And can it fall on a class who will feel it less ? And as it is this class of persons that constitute our money-lenders , it will be rather a favor than an injury to them ; for these notes are convertible into United States bonds , with semi-annual interest coupons attached , and therefore accomplishes for them just what they desire a safe loan of their money . I say a safe loan , for the issue of these notes is to be followed by vigorous taxation ; and in equity the lender will have a lien on the whole property of the United States as security for every dollar of his debt , and a pledge of the public faith that this security shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , while it secures to our soldiers and the poorer class of our citizens , who have debts to pay , great advantages , does no real injury to capitalists , and ought to be retained . The constitutional objections have not been overlooked . I think the Federal Government has the same power to make these notes a legal tender that it has to make anything else a legal tender . It can make nothing a legal tender by virtue of any express power . It has but an implied power in any case . And if it is admitted , as it always has been , that the Government possesses the power to declare what shall be a legal tender in any case , it has it without limitation . It can make one thing a legal tender as well as another ; and whether these notes shall have that character or not , is a question of expediency only , and not one of power . It is objected by some that to make these notes a legal tender will impair the obligation of contracts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In every contract payable in money , and no particular kind of money is named , it is implied , and is a part of the contract , that it may be discharged in what shall be the legal currency at the time of payment . A change or enlargement of the legal currency of the country , and a payment in such new currency , is no violation of the new contract , but is in pursuance of one of its implied conditions . Having the power , and believing , on the whole , that the legal tender clause is a beneficial one , I am in favor of retaining it in the bill . " The question recurred on Mr. Crisfield 's amendment , to strike /z/ out the legal tender clause in the original bill . The vote was taken in Committee of the Whole by tellers- On taking the vote the tellers reported ayes 53 , noes 93 , so the amendment wasv rejected . Several other amendments were made in Committee of the Whole , but inasmuch as they were all cut off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reported to the House , it is not necessary to report them here . The bill , as adopted , is copied at the end of this day 's proceedings . Having gone through the bill in Committee of the Whole , there was a good deal of preliminary skirmishing on the part of different members , who had proposed substitutes and amendments as to the order of taking the vote . Some members feared that they would not be able to get a square vote in the House on their respective propositions . Several members were on the floor at the same time . Motions , objections and counter-motions were made in quick succession , and in various forms , which continued for some time , causing confusion and preventing any action of a practical character , and preventing any vote being taken on either proposition . It finally resulted in an arrangement being made that the bill should be reported to the House , and a square vote be had on the two main propositions pending before the Committee . Mr. Vallandigham and Mr. Conkling withdrew their substitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender clause could concentrate on the substitute agreed to by Mr. Merrill , Mr. Horton , Mr. Corning and Mr. Stratton , one-half of the Committee of Ways and Means ; and that the vote should be first taken on that substitute , which was modified to meet the conflicting views of the various gentlemen on that side , in order to make it as acceptable as possible to all the opponents of the original bill . This substitute finally offered ly Mr. Horton , will be found ( Cong . Gflobe , p. , ) and is as follows : The substitute which was read was , to strike out of the bill all after the word " that , " in the first section , and insert the following : " For temporary purposes , the Secretary of the Treasury be , and he is hereby , authorized to issue on the credit of the United States $100,000.000 of Treasury notes , bearing interest at the rate of three and sixty-five hundredths per cent , per annum , payable in two years after date , to bearer , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Assistant Treasurer , in the city of Xev York , or at the office of the designated depository in the city of Cincinnati , and of such denominations as he may deem /z/ expedient , not less than five dollars each ; and such notes shall be receivable for all public dues , except duties on imports , and for all salaries , debts and demands owing by the United States to individuals , corporations and associations , within the United States , at the option of such individuals , corporations and associations ; and any holder of said United States notes , depositing any sum not less than fifty dollars , or some multiple of fifty , with the Treasurer of the United States , or either of the Assistant Treasurers , or either of the designated depositories at Cincinnati or Baltimore , shall receive in exchange therefor duplicate certificates of deposit for the amount , with any accumulated interest thereon , one of which may be transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury , who shall thereupon issue to the holder an equal amount in bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be desired , bearing interest at the rate of seven and three-tenths per cent , per annum , payable semi-annually in coin , and redeemable at the pleasure of the Government after ten years from date ; and such Treasury notes shall be received the same as coin , at their par value , with accumulated interest , in payment for any bonds that may be hereafter negotiated by the Secretary of the Treasury ; and the Secretary of the Treasury may , from time to time , as the exigencies of the public service may require , issue any amount of such Treasury notes equal to the amount redeemed .

Thus the legal tender act , after a protracted debate , and a most determined opposition , by prominent and influential Republicans , as well as Democrats , was passed through the House by a large majority .

" This has been an exciting day in the House . A fierce battle has been waged against the ' legal tender ' Treasury notes . But , as I think , the right has prevailed , and by a vote of 95 to 59 a much stronger force than was counted upon , the real argument was reduced to a very small compass . All admitted the necessity of a resort to paper currency ; and the question was whether that paper should be made as nearly par value as possible , or subjected to the fluctuations and depreciations of an ordinary irredeemable currency . If made a legal tender , these notes could never sink below the best bank paper . If not so made , they would very soon cease to be available as a circulating medium . Besides , if Treasury notes were to be used to pay the Government creditors , why should not their creditors be required to take them ? Why should the soldier be required to take what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal tender bill left it optional with the soldier , whether he should take the notes or not ; but if he availed himself of the ' option , ' what had the Government to give him ? Practically , it would be Treasury notes or nothing , as , during a general Bank suspension , it is irredeemable bank bills ' or no pay . ' It was not strange that members of the same political family , differed on a question of really doubtful expediency . And but for the necessities of Government , I doubt whether the ' legal tender ' principle would have received a dozen votes in the House . It is a new financial principle , and its workings may result in some , if not all the evils predicted from it . Nevertheless , as Treasury Notes had to be resorted to . the common sense of the House , as well as the common sense of the people , determined that they should be made as near the practical value of gold as possible . Mr. Spaulding , of Erie , has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie had hill ; i bare majority of his Committee with him at the outset ; ; iml , when the Secretary of tin- Treasury hesitated , as he did for several days , the Committee became equally divided . And yet , the measure carried a large majority oftlie House with it a fact as gratifying to Mr. S. as it is complimentary to his financial acumen . The country hreathes ( Veer ! The legal tender hill has passed the IIouH ' , and national bankruptcy is averted . The grateful thanks of all , il men are due to Mr. Spanieling and the representatives vh- supported the measure , for this timely effort in behalf of the public credit . The relief comes not a moment too soon . Now let the Senate do its duty promptly , and e shall be clear " of the breaker-/ " i'Kori.i ; i:N ; IN Tin ; SKXATI : ox TIM- ; BILL . il tender bill was sent to the Senate on the 7th inst. , and was , on motion of Mr. Fessenden , rend twice by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Treasury was nearly empty , and the Secretary was unable to negotiate any more of the loan authorized by the act passed at the extra session in July , at the rates fixed by the law . The ad limited him to par in disposing of any of the bonds or notes authorized by that act , The six per cent , twenty year bonds v.erc then selling at about 88 , and the 7 3-10 notes were below par . In this emergency , Secretary Chase sent to Mr. Fesseuden n letter , urging the immediate passage of a bill giving temporary relief , while the legal tender bill was being perfected in the Senate . Mr. Fessenden obtained unanimous consent to consider the subject forthwith . The following proceedings were had : Mr. FESSEXDEX " I have just received a letter from the Treasury Department , which I will read : " TREASURY DEPARTMENT , Feb. 7 , 18 ; - J. k Sir : The condition of the Treasury requires immediate legislative provision . What you said this morning leads me to think that the bill which passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate this week . Until that bill shall receive the final action of Congress , it seems advisable to extend the provisions of the former acts , so as to allow the issue of at least $10,000,000 in United States notes , in addition to the $50,000,000 heretofore authorized . I transmit a bill framed with that object , which will , I trust , meet your approval and that of Congress . Immediate action on it is exceedingly desirable . Yours , truly , S. P. CHASE/ ' u llou .

At all events , I ask the unanimous consent of the Senate to enable me to introduce the bill without notice , and to have it considered now . " By unanimous consent , leave was granted to introduce the bill , ( S. No. 190 , ) to authorize an additional issue of United States notes ; and it was read three times and passed . This bill was sent to the House on the 10th inst , and on being read was immediately passed , without opposition . On the 10th inst . Mr. Fessenden reported the bill ( House Bill No. 240 ) from the Finance Committee , with amendments . The important amendments thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be receivable for all claims r and demands against the United States of every kind whatsoever , " except for interest on lands and notes , which shall be paid in coin .

On the 12th inst Mr. Fessenden , Chairman of the Finance Committee , opened the debate on the bill in a lengthy speech . ( Cong . Globe , p. 762. ) /z/ ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken on any one of the amendments , to make some remarks upon this bill . They may be very dull and dry , for it is rather a dry subject , but still it becomes my duty , as the organ of the Committee on Finance , to explain the provisions of this bill . The honorable Secretary of the Treasury , at the beginning of the session , recommended two measures taxation and a bank . Both of these subjects require , at this stage of the country , and under existing circumstances , peculiar and long consideration . The opinion of the country has tended towards what is called indirect taxation , taxation upon different American and other products , and different kinds of property . Sir , that requires great time . I have examined it sufficiently to be aware that it is not the labors of a day , or a week , or a month . It is substantially new in this country , and it requires much time , much study , and much inform- /z/ ation to acquire all the knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and upon which a tax might , with propriety , be laid . So , too , with reference to the scheme suggested by the honorable Secretary of the Treasury with regard to a bank . And yet , notwithstanding all that , a bill of that description has been reported . With regard to the particular bill now before the Senate , we all know that it was resorted to as a temporary measure , not in the beginning , but in consequence of the necessities of the Treasury , arising from a greater expenditure than the Secretary could have imagined , and arising from the nesessary delay with reference to other measures . Can it be said that a measure like the one now pending before the Senate and the country is a measure of a day or an hour ? Why , sir , what does it propose ? It proposes something utterly unknown in this Government from its foundation ; a resort to a measure of doubtful constitutionality , to say the least of it , which has always been denounced as ruinous to the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , too , about which opinions in the community are divided as perhaps they never have been divided upon any other subject ; a measure which , when it has been tried by other countries , as it often has been , has always proved a disastrous failure . Sir , it would hardly be expected that a measure of this description , brought into the House of Representatives and the Senate for the first time in the history of the country , involving questions of such infinite importance , not only with reference to to-day , but w r ith reference to the future , to all time , because it is setting a precedent which may be followed , should be taken up and . passed at once , as we pass appropriation bills . It needed long , careful and vigorous discussion . It has had it in the other branch of Congress . I have read that discussion from beginning to end . It has been able and clear upon both sides of the question . The subject deserved that discussion ; and the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of this kind to be passed without its having undergone a discussion which should not only enlighten the House , but enlighten the country upon all the aspects of it . Shall Congress be considered in fault because they have not before acted , or did not act heartily , upon a measure of that description ? I think not , sir . The time has been well spent , and although I regret as much as any man can regret that w r e have not been able to act more promptly , I see no fault to be imputed anywhere ; not in the other House of Congress , and certainly not in this ; for it has reached this body as soon as it could possibly reach it , w r hen you consider the nature of the questions that Avere to be discussed by the Committee to whom it was referred . I have already said that we have never attempted to resort to such a measure before . We have had a war with England since our Government was formed ; and if I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government went down to sixty per cent , and pay was taken for them in such currency as could be received , itself depreciated ; and yet it did not occur as a serious question to the men of that day to put forth , under the Constitution , irredeemable paper made a legal tender for the payment of debts . To be sure , the country then was poor ; it is now rich , comparatively . The country had not then the resources that we have ; and perhaps it would have had the more excuse for adopting such a course . I do not urge this as an argument against it at the present time , but only as showing the nature of the measure itself , to which it is now proposed to have recourse , in order to place the Government in a better position ; /z/ especially , sir , when you observe that everybody who has spoken on this question , I believe without an exception there may have been one or two but all the opinions that I have heard expressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with fear and trembling as to the consequences , can we have recourse to a measure like this , of making our paper a legal tender in the payment of debts . The Committee on Finance have reported several very important amendments . The first amendment , which the Senate will notice is made in the first section , is that the interest on the public debt shall be paid in coin . The Senate w r ill observe that without this , under the provisions of the House bill , a creditor of the Government , holding Government paper , notes , or bonds , would be compelled to take his interest in notes or bonds , as the case might be , when the time for the payment of the interest came round . He would have no choice . The tender of a note for the interest that might be due on his bonds , however large or small , would be equivalent in its effect to the tender of coin . According to our amendment , the Government will be obliged to provide itself with coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this provision is not only to do justice in this regard , but also to make it raise and support the credit of the Government obligations ; and it will be perceived how very important it is to that end . The Secretary , by the provision which I have referred to , is obliged to provide himself w r ith coin for that purpose , and he is obliged to do it at whatever sacrifice may be necessary , in order to accomplish that purpose . This certainly will have one effect ; it proves the good faith of the Government ; that it means to do all it can ; that it means to spare no effort at whatever cost , to give to those who take the Government paper , what they wish to receive , something besides Government paper , and thus running round in a circle of paper , for the interest upon their debts . But , sir , it was not enough , perhaps , to show the good faith of the Government in this particular . The Committee have recommended that we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to accomplish that purpose , and set it aside for that object . It was proposed in the Committee and it struck me favorably at first to set aside , specifically , the public duties , by providing that the duties on imports should be paid in coin ; but on consideration , it was deemed by the Committee that that would be hardly fair . The result would be to make a distinction between different classes of the community , and to impose a very heavy burden upon those who are engaged in trade , and who would be called upon to pay duties . If we provide a paper currency , the natural and inevitable effect of it is , that coin increases in price . The consequence would be , unquestionably , that those obliged to pay duties on imports might be compelled to make a severe sacrifice , in order to raise the coin to pay the duties ; and , in the next place , the general effect would be to , in eiFect , increase the duties provided by our tarili ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the ordinary currency , and duties are to be paid in coin , the effect of such a provision would be to increase the duties , which are already very high , and in some cases almost prohibitory . The Committee , therefore , thought that , under the circumstances , that would not be wise ; although it will be perceived that , not having done so , the converse of the proposition may be true : that the effect , if we inflate the currency by paper , and allow the duties to be paid in paper , is necessarily to diminish the duties on imports , and thus , perhaps , to lead to a greater importation . /z/ Having rejected this , it becomes necessary to make some other provision ; and accordingly provision was made , and will be found in t Infill h section , by setting aside the amount of duties received , the amount received from the sales of the public lands , and the amount that may be received from the confiscation of the property of the rebels , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these provisions are necessa ry and wise , to create a fund which shall be devoted , in the first place , to pay the interest upon the coin and on the notes ; and , in the second place . to create a sinking fund , which , in the end , might be able to pay the whole debt , and would in a certain course of time . This , undoubtedly , will be a very sufficient security ; but , sir , the Committee have gone further . In order that the Secretary may be sure , and that the public creditors may feel safe with reference to it , they give to the Secretary the power to sell the bonds of the Government at any time 11 ml it may le necessary , at the market price , in order to raise coin . That can always be done . The sacrifice may be great , or it may not ; it depends upon circumstances ; but at any rate that will bring coin . These two provisions , taken together , have the effect necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasers of the public obligations , that the interest will be surely paid at the time it is due , and paid in coin ; and having done that , the result is obvious to the Committee that our securities must necessarily be placed upon a more stable foundation , and be of very much greater value in the market , because what the holder of public securities wants , is to be sure that his interest will be paid , especially if it is on long time . But , sir , the power to sell the obligations of the Government at the market price is not confined to the interest . The Senate will observe that it is made general ; that instead of being confined and obliged to sell the obligations of the Government at par , the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to sell them at any time at the market price ; and instead of being confined to sell them for coin , merely for the purpose of raising money to pay the interest on the public debt , he is permitted to sell any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what he can gel . This is a bold , strong measure , and it may strike the Senate with some surprise , or . at . any rate , it may lead them to deliberate upon the subject . /z/ Tut the Committee thought , in giving this enlarged power to the Secretary at this time , that it was bound if this legal tender was to be resorted to , especially if the bill of the House as it stood should be adopted by the Senate , ami should become a law that an assurance should be given to the country that it was not to be resorted to as a policy ; that it was what it professed to be , but a temporary measure . The opinions of the Secretary of the Treasury are perfectly well known . lie has declared that , in his judgment , it is , and ought to be , but a temporary measure , not to be resorted to as a policj ' , but simply on this single occasion , because the country is driven to the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contrary opinion , or , at least , any man who has spoken on the , subject in Congress . The Chairman of the Committee of Ways . ami Means , in advocating the measure , declared that it was not contemplated , and he did not believe it would be necessary to issue more than iiie sl 50 , 000 , 000 of Treasury notes made a legal tender , provided by this bill . All the gentlemen who have written on the subject , except some wild speculators in currency , have declared that as a policy it would be ruinous to any people ; and it has been defended , as 2 have stated , simply /z/ and solely upon the ground that it is to be a single measure , standing by itself , and not to be repeated . Section four of the bill , as reported by the Committee , contains a provision to which I will call the attention of the Senate . It provides for certain deposit certificates . This provision was very much desired by the banks in all the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would give greater currency to the notes , that it would enable them to deal with them better ; and therefore we have offered a provision , that for a period of not less than thirty days , any person or institution may deposit their Treasury notes , in sums of not less than $500 , at the Sub-Treasury , and receive an interest of five per cent . Mr. President , I wish now to say something upon the main question of the bill , which I have avoided touching , except incidentally ; and that is the clause making these notes a legal tender ; for , after all , that is the great question now submitted to the Senate . The Senate will observe that the Committee make no recommendation on that subject , except such as may be inferred from the fact that they report it back , retaining the clause , and so far an inference might be drawn that the Committee were in favor of it . Under the circumstances of the case in the Committee , ( of which , perhaps , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had no opinion upon the subject , their opinions being so divided . ) I deem myself at liberty , as I should , perhaps , be under any circumstances , if need be , and if my opinions lead me that way , to say what I have to say in opposition to that clause . I do not propose to do this except incidentally . I propose rather to state the argument as I understand it , on both sides , in relation to the matter as briefly as I can , without attempting to go into the argument of the subject myself . The ground upon which this clause making these notes a legal tender is put , I have already stated . It is put upon the ground of absolute , overwhelming necessity ; that the Government has now arrived at that point when it must have funds , and those funds are not to be obtained from ordinary sources , or from any of the expedients to Avhich we have heretofore had resource , and therefore , this new , anomalous , and remarkable provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay off the debt that it now owes , and afford circulation which will be available for other purposes . The question then is , does the necessity exist ? That is a question which I propose in some degree to discuss , because I admit fully and decidedly that the Government , or the country , rather , is to be sustained in its present undertaking , and that we are bound to obtain the means to effect that object . If the necessity exists , I have no hesitation upon the subject , and shall have none . If there is nothing left for us to do but that , and that will effect the object , I am perfectly willing to do that . The question , however , is whether it is necessary , whether we have arrived at that stage , and whether something can or can not be done in order to accomplish the object . Sir , I do not hesitate to say here , that I would advocate the use of the strong arm of the Government to any extent in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ivould take the money of any citizen against his will to sustain the Government , if nothing else was left , and bid him wait until the Government could pay him . It is a contribution which every man is bound to make under the circumstances . We can take all the property of any citizen . That is what is called a forced contribution . Thank God , we have not arrived /z/ at that ; but I am not certain that it would not be a more manly course to meet the matter straight in the face , and if we are to compel a man to part with his property , to do it without offering him what may appear to be security , and yet I am not certain that that would not be the more manly and praiseworthy course to pursue . Then , sir , as to this question of necessity , I wish to ask the gentlemen to consider upon what public credit is founded ? According to my reading and my view of the case , it has but one foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability and integrity of the Government , and its power and its will to pay . Public credit has no other foundation that I am aware of than that . If that is so , then the question arises , what is the ability and what is the integrity of this Government , and what is its will to pay ? Are they such as of themselves , under proper legislation , will enable the Government to raise means in the ordinary way ? " Mr. FESSENDEN went on to show that the country was rich in means , land fertile , people industrious , agricultural and manufactured products in r great abundance , and that under any circumstances we must be entitled to credit for our ability to pay , and that no person placing himself in the position of a money-lender could hesitate to say that we were entitled to all the credit of a great , productive , strong and healthful people . He said our credit had been somewhat injured by the conduct of the war , and yet he thought unreasonably . He saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . He then proceeded : " The question , after all , returns : is this measure absolutely indispensable to procure means ? If so , as I said before , necessity knows no law . What are the objections to it ? I will state them as briefly as I can . The first is a negative objection . A measure of this kind certainly can not increase confidence in the ability or the integrity of the country . It can make us no better than we are to-day , so far as this foundation of all public credit is concerned . Next , in my judgment , it is a confession of bankruptcy . We begin and go out to the country with the declaration that we are unable to pay or borrow , at the present time , and such a confession is not calculated to increase our credit . Again , say what you will , nobody can deny that it is bad faith . If it be necessary for the salvation of the Government , all considerations of this kind must yield ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , and encourages bad morality , both in public and private . Going to the extent that it does , to say that notes thus issued shall be receivable in payment of all private obligations , however contracted , is in its very essence a wrong , for it compels one man to take from his neighbor , in payment of a debt , that which he would not otherwise receive or be obliged to receive , and what is r probably not full payment . Again , it encourages bad morals , because , if the currency falls , ( as it is supposed it must , else why defend it by a legal enactment ? ) what is the result ? It is , that every man who desires to pay off his debts at a discount , no matter what the circumstances are , is able to avail himself of it /z/ against the will of his neighbor , who honestly contracted to receive something- better . Again , sir , necessarily as a result , in my judgment , it must inflict a stain upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been loaned to this country , and to the people of this country , in good faith . Stocks of our private corporations , stocks of our States and of our c'ties. are held and owned abroad . We declare that for the interest on all this de ! r. and the principal , if due , these notes , made a legal tender by act of Congress , at whatever discount they shall stand , shall be receivable . Payment must be enforced , if at all , in the courts of this country , and the courts of this country are bound to recogiii/e the law that v That result , then , is inevitable . Again , sir , it necessarily changes the values of all property . It is e : -v well known that all over the world gold and silver are recognized as money , as currency ; they are the measures of value . We change it here . What is the result ? Inflation , subsequent depression , all the evils which follow from an inflated currency . They can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the notes , to be sure . ) : i -s precisely at par , gold appreciates and property appreciates . Again , sir , a stronger objection than all that I have to this proposition I am stating the objections which everybody must entertain , because I suppose these facts are palpable is , that the loss is to fall most heavily upon the poor , by reason of the inflation . " ' Mr. Fessenden continued his argument at great length , urging taxation , good faith and economy , as the best means of maintaining the credit of the Government . Said he would not argue the constitutional question , proposing to leave his own mind uninstructed on this question , and if need be , leave that question to be settled by the courts . That this was a great crisis truly , but he believed we would be as well able to meet the difficulties without the legal tender clause as with it . And concluded as follows : " We always meet , and must always expect to meet , in a Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now perhaps not so great , but greater or less in the course of time . Xo nation ever escaped them , and no nation can hope to escape them . I would not have perfect quiet always , in a republic especially . It would be a bad sign if it were so . It is contrary to the very nature of our Government that it should exist . You never tind quiet except under a tyranny . Only in the dead sea , of despotism is there a perfect calm . It can not be looked for in the wide ocean of liberty . Storms arise inevitably , and the waves roll and dash tnrbulently , but bright skies again cheer us , the agitated waters subside , and their broad bosom is traversed by thousands of tall ships laden richly with hope for the nations of the world . " /z/ . Mr. COLLA.MKII , of Vermont , made an elaborate . speech against the legal tender clause in the bill : lie argued that it was unconstitutional , and that even if it was a / , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oath he had lor taken to support the Constitution , was recorded in Ilc. - m- n aa vcll as upon earth , and there is no necessity that , in his estimation , would justify him iu the breach of it . He admitted that when the Government borrows money , it must give some evidence of the debt , whether by the name of Treasury note or some other name , is immaterial , but denied the power of Congress to make them a tender in payment of debts . He quoted largely from Story on the Constitution , to show the illegality as well as inexpediency of this measure . He said it would be aiding and assisting men who owed debts , to pay those debts with a depreciated paper , at the cost and expense of the creditor . His honest opinion was that the Constitution never intended to invest Congress with any such power . He referred to the debates in the convention that formed the Constitution , to show that the men of that period always entertained the opinion that the ' United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While they lived there never was such a thing thought of as attempting to make the evidences of the debt of the Government a legal tender , let their form bo what they might . He argued that there was an express power ' to borrow money on the credit of the United States . ' That where there is an express power to do a thing , there can be no implied power to do the same thing . There were two modes of replenishing the Treasury . One was by taxation , and the other to borrow money . To borrow money there must be a lender and a borrower , and both should act voluntarily , and not compel the lender to part with his money without an inducement . The operation of this bill was not anything like as honorable or honest as a forced loan . Such paper always depreciates , and generally fails altogether , and is never paid . " He urged taxation , and the issue of Treasury notes receivable for public dues , and closed as follows : " You have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding the resources that you can command , and you can have money and credit enough . I think some little courage becomes us , too , in performing our duty . 1 have no doubt that this country is able to sustain itself in this strife , pecuniarily as well as physically . I , for one , desire to do that ; but I do not want to do it by saying that now , because the necessity requires money , I will go and steal it , or authorize anybody else to steal it . I will not say to a man : ' Here is my note for so much , and if I do not pay it , you must steal the amount from the first man you come to , and give him this note in payment . ' I will do nothing of that kind . I have faith in the Government . I no way despair of the success of this Government . It can not fail . Its power , its resources , its members are such that it is not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise the proper moral courage to do our duties and come up to what is wanted , I hope we shall give place to men who are . " /z/ Mr. HOWK , of Wisconsin , made a lengthy speech in favor of the bill , which will be found in the Appendix to the Cony . Globe , p. 51-2-3 . " Mr. PRESIDENT Hitherto the effort of the Government has been to borrow the immense sums demanded for the war in coin . It is clear to my mind that this effort should be abandoned . We arc excluded from borrowing in foreign markets for the present . It suits both the financial /z/ and political purposes of other nations , at this time , to discredit our ability . Not until we have demonstrated that , in the devotion of our own people , the Government has resources equal to its utmost needs , can we command the confidence of the gold-mongers of Europe ? To borrow of those communities , in their present temper , would subject us to such discounts now as would neither comport Avith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter to heavy annual exportations of specie for the payment of interest . To continue borrowing of our own banks , and borrowing coin , is impossible . They have not the coin to lend . In their efforts to lend to the Government they have already been forced to suspend the payment of specie upon their own notes . The entire sum of specie in all the banks in the United States , in May last , was only $99,751,627 ; of that sum $27,125,000 was in the vaults of banks within the seceded States , and not just now available for the purposes of this Government . Thus the specie capital , which the banks of the loyal States could place at the disposal of the Government , was but little more than seventy-two millions of dollars . That sum wiU not defray the expenses of the Government for fifty days . The Government may be able to borrow of the banks , but the Government can not borrow specie of the banks . If it borrows anything from them it must borrow , not their money , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , whatever our wishes may be , it is impossible to command the revenues for this war in coin . We must rely mainly upon a paper circulation ; and there is another thing equally certain , which is , that that paper , whoever issues it , must be irredeemable . All paper currencies have been , and ever will be , irredeemable . It is a pleasant fiction to call them redeemable ; it is an agreeable fancy to think them so . I would not dispel that fancy , I would not expose that fiction , only that the great emergency which is upon us seems to me to render it more than usually proper that the nation should begin to speak truth to itself ; to have done with shams , and to deal with realities . To talk of borrowing of your banks the money to support your army and your navy , is as idle as for England to talk of borrowing from her national bank the money to pay her national debt . There is but one fund adequate to supply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . There is but one guarantee upon which the national credit can securely rest , and that is the national faith . In the discharge of that duty Congress is clothed with unrestricted power to raise and support armies , to provide and maintain navies . Congress is also clothed with power * to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States . ' To preserve for these eleven misguided States a republican form of government , we have raised such armies and provided such navies as this continent never before saw such as the world has rarely seen . I deem those armies and navies * necessary and proper ' for the occasion . To support those armies and maintain those navies I deem the measure before the Senate ' necessary and proper . ' Those who deny the constitutional authority to pass this bill must deny its necessity or its propriety . Those who deny its necessity or its propriety ought to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the emergency , and more proper than the one proposed by this bill . /z/ Two months have elapsed since the policy of this bill has been discussed , and no one of its opponents has yet produced a substitute . The total neglect to offer a substitute is prima facie evidence of the necessity for this . But it is not the only evidence of that necessity . It is evident that no substitute can be provided , except it be taxation or direct loans . I have already said that taxation is inadequate to the supply demanded for this terrible occasion . No nation of modern times has been able to provide from taxes alone , the immense sums we are called upon to expend . I will presently show that direct loans are quite as impracticable as taxation . The Senator from Ohio Mr. Sherman , proposes to amend this bill , so as to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the public stocks for whatever he may be offered for them ; to go into the market with the national credit , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to offer for it , to fling the financial character of the Republic , as a bone , to be quarreled and growled over by the bulls and bears of the stock market . To that amendment I am opposed . If you notify the capital of the country that you are prepared to pay for money , whatever it is pleased to exact , it will be hoarded to wait the extremity of your distress . No man likes to sell for less than he buys . No man likes to buy for more than his neighbors . And if we advertise to the world that , like any other spendthrift , we are prepared to pay for money according to our necessities for it , no man will purchase our bonds at ninety cents for fear we shall presently sell at seventy-five ; and if we offer them at seventy-five per cent. , we give the best of assurances that we will soon sell at fifty . Sir , if one of your soldiers shrinks from duty , and deserts his country 's cause for fear of losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ignominiously dismissed from his company , or shot in its presence . By what fitting term , then , shall we designate him who deserts his country in its greatest need , for fear of losing his money ? By what penalties should he be visited ? Money and men alone do not constitute the wealth of a nation . The genius , the generosity , the courage , the intellect , and the patriotism of the people are all national resources . In an emergency like this , the Government should not draw upon one fund alone , but every fund should respond alike . Surely avarice and cowardice should not alone be exempt from the common burdens . " Mr. FESSENDEN moved to amend the bill so that the six per cent , bonds should be * ' redeemable in five years , and payable twenty years from date . " /z/ Mr. CHANDIER , of Michigan , spoke on the amendment to make the bonds redeemable in Jive years . " Mr. CHANDLER " I am in favor of the amendment of the Senator from Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow money at long dates at a high rate of interest . Still , I object to the Senator 's hypothesis that this war may last one or two years . There lias not been a day since /z/ the 1st day of November , when we could not have closed the war in sixty days , with our forces then in the field , and from this day forth we can close the war in sixty days , by an advance of our armies ; and I believe that the time has now arrived when we will advance our armies , and when the war will be brought to a close within sixty days from this date . I am therefore , in favor of restricting the bonds , and giving the Secretary of the Treasury the right to redeem them within five years , and I would even make the time shorter than that , and say " within three years . " The time has arrived when this rebellion is within our grasp . The time has arrived when the order , " forward/ ' will close this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . We can remove the only obstacle that stands in our way , and we can close this rebellion before the 1st day of May next , and I believe , I believe solemnly , that we shall do it . We have but one obstacle , and that obstacle is so small that we can remove it to-morrow , if Congress , if the Senate s ; iy so . It is a ' very small obstacle , yet it has stood in our way for four months . I hope that the amendment of the Senator from Maine will prevail : and I would prefer to reduce the time which he has fixed , from live years to three years . I would not pay seven per cent. , nor even six per cent. , more than three years . Our five per cent , bonds will be worth more than par in three years from this date . I know that the money market is the touchstone of the national credit ; but I know , at the same time , that the United States five per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the countr3 r and Congress knew our present position . One obstacle stands in our way , and that is a very small one . I hope the amendment will prevail , and that we shall reduce the time at least to five years . I should prefer its reduction to three years . This war is nearly ended . A single order , " forward , " to-morrow , and we have the man to give the order in the Secretary of War , and the war is ended . " The amendment was agreed to . On the 13th inst . Mr. Collamer moved to strike out the legal tender clause in the bill , and on this motion Mr. Wilson obtained the floor . /z/ Mr. WILSON , of Massachusetts , spoke as follows : " Mr. PRESIDENT This proposition is a very simple and plain one . and certainly very easy of comprehension ; but , it seems to me , the fate of the measure itself is involved in the decision . If the amendment proposed by the Senator from Vermont is accepted , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , for I conceive that it would be unjust to issue a currency of $150,00,000 of Government paper , and impose it upon all persons in the employ of the Government , upon our soldiers in the field , and upon those who have made contracts to supply the armies of the Republic , and to do nothing to protect the credit of that currency when in their hands , imposed upon them by our necessities . I should consider such a measure as that unjust , wickedly unjust ; and I could not , and I would not , under any circumstances , be guilty of giving a vote of that character . If that amendment should be adopted , I hope every Senator in favor of the legal tender clause will vote against the bill and defeat it if possible . I think we owe it to the character of the Senate , and the character of the country . Ill Passing by the question of constitutional powers , and confcto i simply as a practical question , it is a contest between brokers , anaroUraB *** &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Station the other . I venture to express the opinion that ninety-nine of every hundred of the loyal people of the United States are for this legal tender clause . I do not believe that there are one thousand persons in the State I represent who are not in favor of it . The entire business community , with hardly a solitary exception , men who have trusted out of the country in commercial transactions their tens and hundreds of millions , are for the bill with this legal tender clause . Yes , sir , the people in sentiment approach unanimity upon the question . What is true of Massachusetts is , in my judgment , true to a considerable extent of New England , and true to some extent of the Central States and the West . I believe that no measure that , can be passed by the Congress of the United States , unless it be a bill to raise revenue to support the credit of the Government , will be received with so much joy as the passage of this bill with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of doubt . If you pass this bill with the legal tender , the legal tender can not injuriously affect the credit of tli is currency you propose to circulate . No harm can certainly come of it . It seems to me , sir , the argument made by the Senator from Vermont , and the Senator from Maine , is an argument against issuing these notes as a currency at all . The legitimate inferences from their arguments are against this proposition for $150,000,000 of demand Treasury notes . I have received several letters from my own State in fjvvor of the bill persons representing millions , in favor of the legal tender clause . The intelligence I obtain from all portions of the country is to the same effect . I shall , therefore , vote against striking out that clause . If it is retained , I shall vote for the bill ; if it is stricken out , I shall give my vote against putting upon the people , upon the soldiers of the country , $150,000,000 of demand notes , and doing nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " /z/ Mr. SHERMAN , of Ohio , made an elaborate speech in favor of the bill , and in opposition to the motion of Mr. Collamer to strike out the legal tender clause . " The motion of the Senator from Vermont now for the first time preH-nfs to the Senate the only question upon which the members of the Committee of Finance had any material difference of opinion , and that is , whether the notes provided for in this bill shall be made a legal tender in payment of public and private debts ? Upon this point I will commence the argument where the Senator from Maine left it . In the first place , I will say , every organ of financial opinion if that is a correct expression in this country agrees that there is such a necessity , in case AVO authorize the issue of demand notes . You commence with the Secretary of the Treasury , who has given this subject the most ample consideration . He declares not only in his official communications here , but in his private intercourses with the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the security and negotiability of these demand notes . We all know from his antecedents , from his peculiar opinions , that he would be probably the last man among the leading politicians of our country to yield to the necessity of substituting paper /z/ money for coin . He has examined this question in all its length and breadth . He is in a position where he feels the necessity . He is a statesman of admitted ability , and distinguished in his high position . He informs us that without this clause , to attempt to circulate as money the proposed amount of demand notes of the United States , will prove a fatal experiment . In addition to his opinion , we have the concurring opinion of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of New York . With almost entire unanimity they have passed a resolution on the subject , after full debate and consideration . That resolution has been read by your Secretary . You have also the opinion of the Committee of Public Safety of the city of New York , composed of distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who agree fully in the same opinion . I may say the same in regard to the Chambers of Commerce of the city of Boston , of the city of Philadelphia , and of almost every recognized organ of financial opinion in this country . They have said to us in the most solemn form , that this measure was indispensably necessary to maintain the credit of the Government , and to 5 keep these notes anywhere near par . In addition , we have the deliberate judgment and vote of the House of Eepresentatives . After a full debate , in which the constitutionality , expediency and necessity of this measure were discussed , in which all the objections that have been made here , and many more , were urged , the House of Representatives , by a large vote , declared that it was necessary to issue demand notes , and that this clause was indispensable to their negotiation and credit .

They have already tied up their capital in your bonds . Among others , the cashier of the Bank of Commerce , ( Mr. Vail , ) the largest bank corporation in the United States , and one that has done much to sustain the Government , appeared before the Finance Committee , and stated explicitly , that the Bank of Commerce , as well as other banks of New York , could no further aid the Government , unless your proposed currency was stamped by , and invested with the attributes of lawful money , which they could pay to others as well as receive themselves . Bonds can not be sold except at a great sacrifice , because there is no money to buy them . As soon as the banks suspended , gold and silver ceased to circulate as money . You can not seU your bonds for gold and silver , which is the only money that can now be received under the Sub-Treasury law . This currency made a legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He argued that the bill was constitutional . The Senator from Vermont has read extracts from the debates in the national convention , and from Story 's Commentaries , tending to show that Congress can not authorize the issue of bills of credit . But I submit to him that this question has been settled by the practice of the Government . " We issued such bills during the war of 1812 , during the war with Mexico , and at the recent session of Congress . We receive them now for our services ; we pay them to our soldiers and our creditors . These notes are payable to bearer ; they pass from hand to hand as currency ; they bear no interest . If the argument of that Senator is true , then all these notes are unauthorized . The Senator admits that when we owe a debt and can not pay it , we can issue /z/ a note . But where does he find the power to issue a note in the Constitution ? Where does he find the power to prescribe the terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues ? He draAvs all these powers as incidents to the power to borrow money . According to his argument , when we pay a soldier a ten dollar demand bill , we borrow ten dollars from the soldier ; when I apply to the Secretary of the Senate for a month 's pay , I loan the United States $250 . This certainly is not the view we take of it when we receive the money . On the other hand , we recognize the fact that the Government can not pay us in gold . We receive notes as money . The Government ought to give , and has the power to give , to that money , all the sanction , authority , value , necessary and proper , to enable it to borrow money . The power to fix the standard of money , to regulate the medium of exchanges , must necessarily go with , and be incident to , the power to regulate commerce , to borrow money , to coin money , to maintain armies and navies . All these high powers are expressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emit bills of credit , and to make anything but gold and silver a legal tender . But Congress is expressly invested with all these high powers , ' and to remove att doubt , is expressly authorized to use all necessary and proper means to carry these powers into effect . If you strike out the tender clause you do so with a knowledge that these notes will fall dead upon the money market of the world . When you issue demand notes , and announce to the world jour purpose not to pay any more gold and silver , you then tender to those who have furnished you provisions and services this paper money . What can they do ? They can not pay their debts with it ; they can not support their families with it , without a depreciation . The whole then depends on the promise of the Government to pay at some time not fixed on the note . Justice to our creditors demands that it should be a legal tender ; it will then circulate all over this country , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will enable capitalists to buy your bonds . The only objection to the measure is that too much may be issued . He did not believe the issue of $150,000,000 would do any harm . It is only a mere temporary expedient , and ought not to be repeated . " He closed as follows : " Ihave thus , Mr. President , endeavored to reply to the constitutional argument of the Senator from Vermont . Our arguments must be submitted finally to the arbitration of the courts of the United States . When I feel so strongly the necessity of this measure , I am constrained to assume the power , and refer our authority to exercise it to the courts . I have shown , in reply to the argument of the Senator from Maine , that we must no longer hesitate as to the necessity of this measure . That necessity does exist , and now presses upon us . I rest my vote upon the proposition that this is a necessary and proper measure to furnish a currency a medium of exchange to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and support a navy . Believing this , I find ample authority to authorize my vote . We have been taught by recent fearful experience that delay and doubt in this time of revolutionary activity are stagnation and death . I have sworn to raise and support your armies ; to provide for and maintain your navy ; to borrow money ; to uphold your Government against all enemies , at home and abroad . That oath is sacred . As a member of this body , I am armed with high /z/ powers for a holy purpose , and I am authorized nay , required to vote for all laws necessary and proper for executing these high powers , and to accomplish that purpose . This is not the time when I would limit these powers . Rather than yield to revolutionary force , I would use revolutionary force . Here it is not necessary , for the framers of the Constitution did not assume to foresee all the means that might be necessary to maintain the delegated powers of the national Government . Regarding this great measure as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enact , I see plain before me the path of duty , and one that is easy to tread . " /z/ Mr. COWAX , of Pennsylvania , made a lengthy speech in favor of the amendment to strike out the legal tender clause in the bill , on the ground that Congress had no power to make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of private debts . " He argued at length that Congress had no power to ' emit bills of credit , make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts , or pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts . " They are powers which belong neither to the United States nor to the States , and they ought to belong to no Government anywhere . He had supposed that this question could never enter the American Senate ; that the day had gone by when it was open to discussion , if it ever was open since the Constitution was formed . Surely , if anything in the world is settled settled by the fathers , by cotemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all precedent for the exercise of these powers it is that they were not delegated , nor intended to be delegated . The exercise of such a power would be subversive of all our notions of Government , and the ends for which it is established , which are , the protection and preservation of society . The life and soul of society is the faith man has in his fellow-man ; that he will speak truth , deal justly , and perform his engagements and maintain his credit . Will it strengthen this credit ? It proposes that in all money contracts notes shall be taken as money , the same as gold and silver ; all men who have money due them will be obliged to receive these notes as money at par ; they are made a legal tender on all debts . The power claimed for the Government subverts the Government itself , and makes it destroy that which it was intended to protect and preserve . It is abhorrent of reason , justice and all notions of right . He thought that the legal tender clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injurious to them . It would disturb the relations between debtor and creditor , and impair all the contracts of the people , more or less , all over the country . ' ' He concluded as follows : " I am willing to yield to the better judgment of the administration in all matters of policy or expediency , but I am still my own conscience keeper , and in all questions of power under the Constitution I must judge for myself , and act accordingly . That Constitution is the charter of our liberties , and the covenant for the Union which we are all so anxious to preserve and defend . I will stand upon it to the last , despite every necessity , however imperious ; and if the time comes when we must all go down together , I say let it come ; but let us go down as honest men , with our faith unviolated ; and in that spirit , I hope the amendment to the bill may prevail . " /z/ Mr. Dooi.mu : , of Wisconsin , regretted that this bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If we had a sufficient tax law to sustain the credit of the Government , he would vote to strike out the legal tender clause . He was assured that this bill must pass immediately , or the Government could not go on . As an original proposition , he did not believe in paper money , but it had become engrafted on our system . He thought the framers of the Constitution intended nothing but hard money , coined gold and silver . Had their intentions been carried out ; had we always held fast to the Constitutional currency ; had not paper money , under both State and Federal authority , become the actual currency of our people ; had we to-day no other currency but gold and silver , I w T ould not tolerate the idea of passing this bill for a single moment . But , such is not our condition ; we are in the midst of a gigantic war ; we can not go back ; we must go forward ; we must go through ; we must start from where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must behold the real necessities of our position as it is , and not as we would have it , and look those necessities squarely in the face . The truth is , while in theory the only money of our people is gold and silver , the fact is otherwise . It is almost exclusively of paper . Aye , sir , at this moment it is the irredeemable paper of suspended bank corporations . Most unfortunately , paper money does now exist , and has existed so many years in this countiy , issued under the sanction of State authorities in violation , as I admit , of the spirit and intentions of those who framed the Constitution , that a man must be blind , indeed , who would not now , in time of war , in a measure of practical legislation , recognize the stubborn fact that these banking corporations , created by the States , so long acquiesced in by this Government , have become great and powerful institutions , and have practically displaced the currency of the Constitution , by substituting in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much the greater part of our circulating medium , and when , in times of panic and disaster , comes suspension of specie payments , it becomes our only currency . Such is our condition now . What shall we do now ? We must have deeds , not words ; facts , not theories . We can not sell our bonds abroad . The paper money issued by banking corporations is all , or nearly all , the money our own people have . Shall we sell our bonds for the paper money of suspended banks ? No , sir ; no man will advocate that . The only alternative is to issue these Treasury notes , which will go into the circulation of the country as a part of its currency . If , as I have said , the question now were whether we should begin to build up a paper currency in this country , or hold fast to the currency of the Constitution , I would oppose this measure . But we cut our moorings from the solid ground long , long ago . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . We have suffered periodically financial crashes and revulsions , tossed upon its uncertain waves , blown up and down by the breath of speculation . We are still at sea , and in the beginning of a terrific financial storm , and the question is whether we shall seize the rudder and direct the ship , or suffer it to go without direction , to founder and make shipwreck of all public and private securities and values , to become the prey and spoils of wreckers along the shore . The simple /z/ question which presses upon us in this extremity is , whether we shall rule this currency , created by these corporations , in violation , in my opinion , of the original intention of the Constitution of the United States , or whether they shall rule us . For their good , for the security of all , as well as for its own safety , this Government must assert its Constitutional authority over the currency of the country , in some practicable way , and it seems to me that the mode proposed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigencies , as a temporary measure , until the great measure of finance , the tax bill , can be perfected and set in operation . " /z/ Mr. SIMMON ? , of Rhode Island , opposed the legal tender clause in this bill . " He did not see its necessity , nor the Constitutional power for passing it . He thought the Constitutional objection about as difficult a matter to get over as anything could well be . He thought that if the legal tender clause was stricken out , the notes would not be bills of credit , but mere evidences of debt . In contemplation of the Constitution , the old fashioned bills of credit were promises to pay , with a State law enforcing their passage against the will of those who were to take them . These were the national bills of credit , which were made a tender by State laws under the old Confederation . He thought it better to make our securities desirable by increasing the rate of interest , as high even as eight per cent . He intended to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to eight per cent , on notes and bonds payable in two years . " /z/ Mr. BAYARD , of Delaware , opposed the legal tender clause , because it is unconstitutional , impolitic and inexpedient . " He concurred in the argument of the Senator from Vermont , who has moved to strike out the legal tender clause in the bill . The first article of the Constitution , in its first section , provides that ' all legislative povveis herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States ' not an indefinite delegation of all powers of legislation , as is the case in our State Constitutions , where the legislative power of the community is vested in a Senate and House of Representatives ; but here in this Constitution of specially delegated powers , ' all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress , ' and none other . When you come to the other clause , which specifies these powers , you find but a solitary provision which has any relation to the power to make money . The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make money , is ' to coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures . ' I have supposed that the power being designated in that form , and Congress having a right to exercise only the power granted , under no species of interpretation could you hold that a power to coin money implied , or could be extended to a power , to make your own paper , your promise to pay money , for the purpose of discharging debts between individuals , or as against yourself . In my judgment , therefore , apart from the constitutional objection , which alone would be sufficient to control my vote , upon the ground that /z/ you have no power to insert this clause in any law , I can not vote for a bill which embodies it . It is impolitic and inexpedient , as well as unconstitutional . It is a mere temporary expedient . It may give present inflation and present relief for the hour , and a very brief hour indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of the Government , a depreciation of its credit , and it will produce nothing but disaster and ruin to tho country. * ' /z/ Mr. WILLEY , of Virginia , spoke as follows : " I do not rise , Mr. President , certainly not at the present time , for the purpose of making a speech , but I wish to place upon record the reason why I shall give the vote which I feel compelled to give on the present occasion . If this were a question merely of expediency , I would most readily defer my judgment to that of other gentlemen better capable of forming a correct estimate . But , sir , consulting my own opinion , I should say that the legal tender clause of this bill will have the contrary effect upon the currency and credit of the Treasury notes from that which some gentlemen seem to suppose . I believe it will depreciate their credit , and I fear it will depreciate the character of our Government and our country in the estimation of all honest and well-meaning nations abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this clause is unconstitutional , I can not vote to retain it in the bill . I have felt the appeal of my honorable friend from Ohio the plea of necessity . Sir , that is a dangerous plea , and it found its origin in a dangerous quarter . It is said that the plea of necessity is the plea of tyrants . I nevertheless recognize the fact that there are occasions in the history of a nation when the old maxim salus popidi suprema lex , may apply ; but it is my opinion that the exigencies of the country do not , at this time , warrant the application of that maxim ; and I should be sorry if , in prosecuting this holy war to put down an infamous rebellion , to restore and maintain the Constitution , we are ourselves , in the very act of doing so , guilty of a most palpable violation of that instrument . " /z/ Mr. HOWARD , of Michigan , said : " I do not rise , Mr. President , at this late period of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . When this measure was first proposed , and after I had given it merely a perusal , I came , or thought I came , to the same conclusion at which the gentleman from Virginia seems to have arrived , and was rather disposed to think that there was no authority in the Constitution to warrant such an enactment as this , which constitutes the Treasury notes a legal tender in the payment of private debts . The thing was so anomalous , so unusual to me , that I could scarcely entertain the idea , and I confess that my mind struggled strongly against it . But after a little reflection , and giving the question of constitutional power such examination as I have been able to give it , I have arrived at the conclusion that Congress has the constitutional power , particularly under the clause authorizing them to borrow money , to declare this species of paper a legal tender in the payment of debts between individuals . It is undoubtedly a hard necessity to which we are driven ; but the /z/ necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked question of authority , under the Constitution . If I were convinced that we had no authority , under the Constitution , to enact such a clause as this , I should not feel at liberty to vote in favor of it , and should certainly vote to strike it out ; but such is not my conviction . I believe that we have the authority ; and still , while I say this , I must say at the same time , that I think several gentlemen who are friends of this bill , have placed too high an estimate upon this particular clause in the bill . I doubt very much whether it will add greatly to the currency and credit of the paper itself . They think it will , and I am certainly disposed to give it a trial . We have , under the Constitution , the power to borrow money . This no one disputes . If we have the power to borrow money , we have the right ; and it is our duty to place in the hand of the lender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed it , and further , that we intend to pay what we have borrowed . These two things are manifestly , in their very nature , inseparable ; and the only real question , it seems to me , which addresses itself to the Senate is this : whether we have any power , after having issued this description of paper to the public creditors , in payment of their debts , to protect the credit of the United States , expressed upon the face of the paper , while it is in the hands of innocent and honest holders ? I think we have . I think this is one of the most obvious means of extending protection to the public credit thus expressed upon the paper . If we have it not ; if we can not subject , so to speak , the entire property of the nation , to something like an assistance to the public credit , then this power to borrow money at once ceases to be a power of any value , and it is a mere mockery upon the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall , in commercial transactions , be of equal validity to transactions based upon gold and silver , then I say that the power to borrow money ceases , in and of itself , to be of any benefit to the Government or to the nation ; and it is because I believe that we have this power , thus to protect the public credit , expressed and pledged on the face of a Treasury note , that I shall vote to retain this clause in the bill . I think we have the constitutional power , and I am willing to use it on this occasion . " /z/ Mr. McDouGALL , of California , advocated the bill as a lawful and proper measure to be adopted at this time . " He thought this a just and reasonable war measure . Necessity , it is said , is above all law ; it is better said , ' necessity makes its own laws . ' Our Treasury is now exhausted . Money is the first necessity of warvigorous successful war . Delay is not to be contemplated not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To give efficiency , the legal tender clause should be retained the bill ought not to be amended by striking it out . He argued that the bill was constitutional ; that we had the right to issue these notes as money , to be used as a currency for the country in the present exigency . He was not able to maintain against it any good constitutional objection , and did not see in it any special injustice . We are at war ; this is a war measure ; we must take war responsibilities . This measure can ruin no one , destroy no one , and we are advised upon the highest authority that it is needed for the maintainance of the Republic . I believe the law constitutional , just and necessary . I hope to see it passed , and when passed , I shall hope on . " /z/ Mr. SIMNKII , of Massachusetts , made a lengthy speech in favor of the constitutional and expediency of the legal tender clause , and said he would confine his remarks to this feature of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be had ; and we are told that the credit of the Government can be saved only by an act that seems like a forfeiture of credit . Paper promises to pay are to be made a legal tender like gold and silver , and this provision is to be ingrafted on the present bill authorizing the issue of Treasury notes to the amount of $150,000,000 . It seemed to him that the power of Congress to make Treasury notes a legal tender was settled as long ago as when it was settled that Congress might authorize the issue of Treasury notes ; for from time immemorial the two have gone together ; one is the incident to the other , and , unless expressly severed , they naturally go together . It is true , that in the Constitution there are no words expressly giving to Congress the power to make Treasury notes a legal tender ; but there are no words expressly giving to Congress the power to issue Treasury notes . If we consult the text of the Constitution , we shall find it as silent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , on the other hand , the States are expressly prohibited to ' emit bills of credit , to make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts . Treasury notes are l bills of credit , ' and this prohibition is imperative on the States . But the inference is just that this prohibition , expressly addressed to the States , was not intended to embrace Congress indirectly , as it obviously does not embrace it directly . The presence of the prohibition , however , shows that the subject was in the minds of the frarners of the Constitution . If they failed to extend it still further , it is reasonable to conclude that they left the whole subject in all its bearings to the sound discretion of Congress , under the ample powers intrusted to it . The stress that is so constantly put upon the prohibitions addressed to the States will justify me in introducing the opinion of Mr. Justice Storj r in his Commentaries : ' It is manifest that all these prohibitory clauses as to coining money , emitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver in payment of debts , are founded upon the same general considerations . The policy is to provide a fixed and uniform rule throughout the United Slates , by which commercial and other dealings of the citizens , as well as the moneyed transactions of the Government , might bo adjusted . " ( 2 Story 's Com. , Sec. 1372 . ) If this view be correct , then no inference adverse to the powers of the national Government can be drawn from these prohibitory clauses ; for whatever may be the policy of the national Government , it will be a fixed and uniform rule throughout the United States . From the proceedings of the Federal Convention it appears that a proposition empowering Congress ' to emit bills of credit ' was negatived , after discussion , in which Mr. Madison said : ' Will it not be sufficient to prohibit the making them a tender ? This w r ill remove the temptation to emit them with unjust views . ' And in a note to the debate , this same great authority says that he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disable the Government from the use of public notes , as far as they could be safe and proper , and would only cut off the pretense /z/ for a paper currency , and particularly for making bills a tender , either foi ' public or private debts . ' Then it appears that the suggestion was made to prohibit the making of bills a tender ; but this suggestion was not acted on , and no such prohibition was ever moved . It is evident that the Convention was not prepared for a measure so positive . Less still was it prepared for the prohibition to emit bills . Such is the record . While all words expressly authorizing bills were struck out , nothing was introduced in restraint of the powers of Congress on this subject . Indeed , Mr. Madison declares his own personal belief , that the striking out of the power ' to emit bills of credit , ' would not disable the Government from the issue of public notes , so far as they could be safe and proper , but would only cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this language , in so careful a writer , that he imagined the whole subject was left substantially to the sound discretion of Congress . Indeed , the inference from his report and comment , is identical with the inference from the text of the Constitution itself . ( See Madison 's Papers , vol. 3 , p. 1343 . ) But in conceding that Congress might issue ' public notes , as far as they could be proper , ' in other words , ' bills of credit , ' the whole question was practically settled ; and the usage of the Government has been in harmony with this settlement . Treasury notes were issued during the war of 1812 , also during the war with Mexico , and constantly since , so that the power to issue them can not be drawn into doubt . If there was any doubt originally , an unquestioned practice , sanctioned by successive Congresses , has completely removed it . I do not stop to consider whether the power is derived primarily from the power ' to borrow money , ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unenumerated powers . It is sufficient that the power exists . ' But it is difficult to escape the conclusion , that if Congress is empowered to issue Treasury notes , it may affix to these notes such character as shall seem just and proper , declaring the conditions of their circulation and the dues for which they shall be received . Grant the first power and the rest must follow . Careful you will be in the exercise of this power , but if you choose to take the responsibility , I do not see what check can be found in the Constitution . It appears that the phrase ' bills of credit , ' was familiarly used for bank notes as early as 1683 , in England , and also as early as 1714 , in New England . But the first issue in America was in 1690. by the Colony of Massachusetts , and the occasion , identical with the present , was to pay soldiers returning unexpectedly from an unsuccessful expedition against Canada . Mr. Summer went into a brief history of the issue of bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , Connecticut , Virginia and Korth Carolina , which led to the passage of an act by the Imperial Parliament , ( 24 George II , Sec. 2 , Chap . 53 , ) 1751 , which expressly forbade the issue of any paper bills , or bills of credit , except for certain specific purposes , or upon certain specified emergencies ; and declaring that such paper money should not be a legal tender for private debts . Continental paper money was issued during the Revolutionary war , not made a legal tender by Congress , although the States were recommended to make them such . He argued at great length the power of Congress to issue Treasury notes and make them a legal tender ; and that it was purposely left by the framers of the Constitution to the sound discretion of Congress , in great emergencies , to decide whether it was necessary to exercise the power or not . " He closed as follows : /z/ " But , while recognizing the existence of the discretion , in the I ; IM resort , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity now exists ? And now , as I close , I shall not cease to be frank ; i it necessary to incur all the unquestionable evils of inconvertible p forced into circulation by act of Congress to suffer the stain upon national faith to bear the stigma of a seeming repudiation to lose for the present that credit which , in itself , is a treasury and to teach debtors everywhere that contracts may be varied at the will of the stronger ? Surely , there is much in these inquiries which may make us pause . If our country were poor or feeble , without population and without resources ; if it were already drained by a long war ; if the enemy had succeeded in depriving us of the means of livelihood , then we should not even pause . But our country is rich and powerful , with a numerous population , busy , honest , and determined , and with unparalleled resources of all kinds , agricultural , mineral , industrial and commercial ; it is yet undrained by the war in which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any of the means of livelihood . It is hardvery hard to think that such a country , so powerful , so rich , and so beloved , should be compelled to adopt a policy of even questionable propriety . If I mention these things if I make these inquiries it is because of the unfeigned solicitude which I feel with regard to this measure , and not with the view of arguing against the exercise of a constitutional power , when , in the opinion of the Government , in which I place trust , the necessity for its exercise has arrived . Surely , we must all be against paper money we must all insist upon maintaining the integrity of the Government and we must all set our faces against any proposition like the present , except as a temporary expedient , rendered imperative by the exigency of the hour . If I vote for this proposition it will be only because I am unwilling to refuse to the Government , especially charged with this responsibility , that confidence which is hardly less important to the public interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exigency is sufficiently imperative ; but the Secretary of the Treasury , whose duty it is to understand the occasion , does not doubt . In his opinion the war requires this sacrifice . Uncontrolable passions have been let loose to overturn tranquil conditions of peace . Meanwhile your soldiers in the field must be paid and fed . Here , then , can be no failure or postponement . A remedy which , at another moment you would reject , is now proposed . Whatever may be the national resources , they are not now within reach , except by summary process . Reluctantly , painfully , I consent that the process should issue . And yet I can not give such a vote without warning the Government against the dangers from such an experiment . The medicine of the Constitution must not become its daily bread . Nor can I disguise the conviction that better than any legal tender will be vigorous , earnest efforts for the suppression of the rebellion , and for the establishment of the Constitution in its true principles over the territory which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yeas and nays on the motion of Mr. Collaraer to strike out the legal tender clause in the bill , and resulted as follows : Yeas Messrs .

So the motion to strike out the legal tender clause was not agreed to . On Mr. Simmons ' motion to pay eight per cent , interest on two years ' notes or bonds , the amendment was agreed to ayes 20 , noes 16 . The other amendments proposed by the Finance Committee were agreed to substantially as reported by the Committee . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter contracted , but the amendment was not adopted . /z/ Mr. KING , of New York , spoke as follows : " My opinion is so decided against this measure , which , it is evident , has the favor of a large majority of the Senate , that I must vote against it ; but I deem it due to myself to offer a substitute for the first section . I propose to strike out the first section of the bill , which relates to Treasury notes and the tender , and to insert what I send to the chair in three sections . The second and subsequent sections of the bill , providing for bonds and making other provisions , I do not propose to interfere with . The change which this amendment proposes , is to strike out the tender clause , to make the demand notes , which are issued without interest , five year notes , bearing an interest of seven and three-tenths per cent , per annum , receivable for all Government dues , or exchangeable for long bonds at six per cent. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and providing by tax a sufficient sum , which is pledged to the redemption of these notes , and ultimately to pay them , principal and interest ; which I think is a provision that ought to accompany any measure providing for borrowing money , either by notes or bouds . " The amendment was not agreed to . /z/ Mr. PEARCE , of Maryland , opposed the legal tender clause in the bill . " Ours is a Government of limited and granted powers . AVe can exercise no authority which Congress has not , by reason of the grant of some express power , or some power necessarily implied from that which is granted . If there be a power necessary and proper to carry into execution any of the granted powers , we possess it under the general clause of the Constitution in reference to that subject . The power to make a legal tender is not granted expressly in the Constitution , nor , as I think , by any implication from any of the granted powers . It is true there is a qualified power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause which /z/ authorizes us to coin money , and to regulate the value thereof , because there can be no purpose in regulating the value of the money we are authorized to coin , except to make it a legal tender . When we establish the value of gold and silver coin , which we have the express authority to do , we of course have the implied authority to declare that its value thus fixed by law , shall be the measure of value in all contracts , and to make it a legal tender . There is no other purpose for giving us the authority to regulate the value of the money which we are authorized to coin ; and , accordingly , Congress has declared silver coins to be a legal tender . I do not know whether that provision is in the law regulating the value of the gold coins . I suppose , however , that it must be so . I know that when we passed the act by which we apportioned the silver and the alloy in our silver coins , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under five dollars . Even , however , if that vere not so , it would follow necessarity , it being provided in the Constitution expressly that gold and silver may be coined by authority of Congress , and their value regulated by law , that they must necessarily be a legal tender . It is so according to the custom of all civilized nations , and so the convention that framed the Constitution assumed it to be . But I can see no power from which we can infer authority in this Government to make paper money a legal tender . It clearly can not be inferred from the power to coin money , which is to be made of metal . I do not see how it is to be inferred , as I think one Senator derived it , from the power to borrow money , since , to make paper money can not be necessary to the execution of the power to borrow money . As well could we infer a general authority to lend money or to deal in brokerage . Mr. President , the exigencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to co-operate with gentlemen here in furnishing the Government with the means of carrying on all its operations ; but when a constitutional objection is presented to me , the very allegiance which I owe to the Constitution , and therefore to the Union , compels me not to violate any one of its provisions , as I think I shall do if I vote for this bill . I must , therefore , cast my vote against it . " Mr. SAULSBUKY , of Delaware " It was my desire and intention to vote for this bill , provided the provision making these notes a legal tender had been stricken out . That provision has been retained in the bill . It is so clearly unconstitutional , in my opinion , that I can not conscientiously vote for it . I can not attempt at this late hour to assign the reasons for my opinion . The speech of the Senator of Vermont has not been answered , and it is not in the power of man to answer it . " Mr. POWELL , of Kentucky " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would affordme pleasure to vote for any measure I thought constitutional to relieve the country from its present embarrassment ; but believing that this bill is unconstitutional , I can not vote for it . I had intended , if time permitted but the hour is too late now to give briefly , my reasons for the vote I shall give ; but after the very exhaustive speech made by the Senator from Vermont yesterday , it would be unnecessary , particularly after the excellent speech made by the Senator from Pennsylvania to-day , and the brief but very pointed speech of the Senator from Maryland , who has just taken his seat . In my judgment this bill is plainly and palpably violative of the Constitution of the United States , and I do not believe that issues of paper money , unless they are convertible into coin at the pleasure of the holder , /z/ ever did , or ever will , relieve any country permanently from any embarrassment . I think all such issues of irredeemable paper lead the country into further and greater embarrassments , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who expect great benefits to the country from this bill will be greatly disappointed . I shall not detain the Senate by speaking . ' ' /z/ THE PRESIDING OFFICER " The question is on the passage of the bill . " Mr. HOWARD " I call for the yeas and nays . " The yeas and nays were ordered . Mr. LATHAM , of California " I merely desire to say , in order that I may appear right upon the record , that I have entertained very grave doubts during this discussion as to the constitutionality of the legal tender issue , and entertaining those doubts , I cast my vote against that clause when it was under consideration . The majority of this body having now , however , indicated their desire that it should be in the bill , I can not , consistently with my sense of duty , withhold my vote from the bill . I shall therefore vote for it . " Mr. ANTHONY , of Rhode Island " I voted against the vital clause of this bill making the paper issued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own to present to the Senate , I shall not take the responsibility of voting against the only measure which is proposed by the Government , and which has passed the House of Representatives , and received the sanction of a majority of this body . " The question being taken by yeas and nays , resulted yeas 30 , nays 7 ; as follows : Yeas Messrs . Anthony , Chandler , Clark , Davis , Dixon , Doolittle , Fessenden , Foot , Foster , Grimes , Hale , Harlan , Harris , Henderson Howard , Howe , Lane ( of Indiana ) , Latham , McDougall , Merrill , Pomeroy , Rice , Sherman , Sumner , Ten Eyck , Trumbull , Wade , " Wilkinson , Wilson ( of Massachusetts ) and Wilson ( of Missouri ) 30 . Nays Messrs . Collamer , Cowan , Kennedy , King , Pearce , Powell and Saulsbury 7 . So the bill was passed . /z/ Letter of JAMES W. SIMONTON to N. Y. Times . " WASHINGTON , D. C. , Feb. 13 , 1862 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kote bill , including the legal tender clause , is a subject of very general congratulation among the friends of the Administration . Among the opponents of the legal tender provision were some of the ablest and firmest friends of the Administration , whose sincere desire for the most effective support of the Government can not for a moment be justly questioned . They honestly believed the policy injudicious , and made strenuous fight in support of their theory . /z/ But the overwhelming necessity existing for the measure is a stronger argument than anything offered against , the bill , and received the decisive vote of 30 to 7 . Haying made their record , the opposition yielded with excellent grace , and the Democratic opponents in both Houses confess to a sense of relief when the bill , legal tender and all , had passed . There are few members who would care to assume the responsibility which would have rested upon them in the event of the defeat of the measure , and the risk of the consequences to themselves of the financial panic that would speedily follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill has passed , it is but just that due credit should be awarded to the author of the legal tender scheme , the Hon. E. G. Spaulding , ; Member of Congress from the Buffalo ( N " . Y. ) District . It was Mr. Spaulding who originated the proposition to force a fixed paper currency upon the country by making Treasury notes a legal tender . His practical knowledge and experience as a banker and financier , early disclosed to his own mind the fact , which since then has become so patent to overwhelming majorities in each House of Congress and the country , to wit : that no other scheme could possibly provide for the wants of the Government in time to save it from absolute financial ruin . He gave the subject unremitting study and attention , devoting to it the entire holiday season , and maturing , finally , a measure which has received the endorsement of the Administration and of Congress , and withstood the combined assaults of selfish and honest opponents alike . He has reason to be proud of the triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget his services . " /z/ The main principles of the bill seemed to be well settled by the preceding full and able discussion , and its passage by large majorities through both Houses ; and the Secretary of the Treasury in administering the Finances during the war , would find it easy to execute the two simple provisions of the bill , viz : 1 . Issue these Treasury notes fitted for circulation as money , and by the legal tender provision made a forced loan from the people to the Government , without interest , which could only be justified by the imperative necessities of the Treasury , and by the fair and equitable provision , 2 . That these notes might at any time , at the option of the holder , be funded in six per cent , twenty year bonds , interest payable semi-annually . The Secretary could issue notes and pay them out for supplies and material of war , and to the Army and Navy , making money plenty , and filling all the channels of circulation , which would , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , bonds , and funding would take place , thereby preventing too great an excess of this circulating medium . The Senate amendments seemed in some measure to complicate these simple provisions . Several of the amendments of the Senate were very important in regard to details and special provisions of the bill , but the most of them were verbal and unimportant . The four amendments of /z/ the Senate , to which a large number of the members of the House made the most objection , were in substance as follows : 1 . Requiring payment of ' interest semi-annually in coin on bonds and 7-30 notes . ' 2 . Conferring on the Secretary power to sell six per cent , bonds , ' at the market value thereof for coin , ' which would reduce the price . 3 . And the provision making the bonds * redeemable in five years , and payable in twenty years from date , ' at the option of the Government , making them less valuable . 4 . Temporary deposits in the Sub-Treasury at 6 per cent. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan laws passed by Congress , from the organization of the Government to this time , contained only a provision to pay ' dollars . ' The word dollars had a well known legal meaning under our coinage and legal tender laws , and it was difficult to see any good reason for changing the phraseology , and thereby make a departure from established usages at this time , especially if six per cent , bonds ( which were then selling at about 88 , ) should , as a necessary consequence of such provision , be sold at the market price to raise the coin to pay this interest . At this stage of the bill there was no provision in it , or in the Senate amendments , to collect the duties on foreign imports in coin , so that as the bill then stood , there was no other mode of obtaining the coin except by a forced sale of bonds . This coin provision was deemed by many members to be an unnecessary discrimination in favor of the bond-holders over other creditors of the Government equally meritorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin interest to the bondholders while the soldiers and others were paid in notes ; and besides , the terms used made the coin payment of interest applicable to the 7-30 Treasury notes and bonds issued to the banks during the previous summer . /z/ The bill and Senate 's Amendments were returned to the House on the 14th hist , and on motion of Mr. Stevens , were referred to the Committee of Ways and Means . This Committee had a long discussion upon the Senate 's Amendments , and were about equally divided on the most material and important of them . Some were disagreed to , others were concurred in , and some unimportant amendments to the Senate amendments were recommended . On the 18th , Mr. Stevens , from the Committee of Ways and Means , reported back the bill and amendments to the House and said : /z/ " I have no purpose of considering the bill at this time . I desire that it shall be referred to the Committee of the Whole , and be made the special order for to-morrow at one o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments . They are very important , and , in my judgment , very pernicious , but I hope the House will examine them . " The motion was agreeed to . On Wednesday , the 19th hist. , the amendments of the Senate to the bill being the special order , Mr. Spaulding opened the debate in opposition to some of them , as follows : /z/ Mr. CHAIRMAN I desire especially to oppose the amendments of the Senate which require the interest on bonds and notes to be paid in coin semi-annually , and whih authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to sell six per cent , bonds at the market price for coin to pay the interest . The Treasury note bill , as reported first from the Committee of Ways and Means as a necessary war measure , was simple and perspicuous in its terms , and easily understood . It was so plain that everybody could understand that it authorized the issue of $150,000,000 of legal tender demand notes , to circulate as a national currency among the people in all parts of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be funded in six per cent , twenty years ' bonds . The passage of this measure in this House was hailed with satisfaction by the great mass of people all over the country . It received the hearty indorsement of such bodies as the Chambers of Commerce of New York , Cincinnati , St. Louis , Chicago , Buffalo , Milwaukee , and other places . I have never known any measure receive a more hearty approval from the people . Nearly every amendment to the bill since it was matured has rendered it more complex and difficult of execution . I ' regret to say that some of the amendments of the Senate render the bill incongruous , and tend to defeat its great object , namely : to prevent all forcing of the Government to sell its bonds in the market to the highest bidder for coin . It might be very pleasant for the holders of the seven and three-tenths Treasury notes and six per cent , bonds , to receive their interest in coin semiannually , but very disastrous to the Government to be compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every six months to pay them gold and silver , while it would pay only Treasury notes to the soldier , sailor , and all other creditors of the Government . I am opposed to all those amendments of the Senate which make unjust discriminations between the creditors of the Government . A soldier or sailor who performs service in the army or navy is a creditor of the Government . The man who sells food , clothing , and the material of war , for the use of the army and navy is a creditor of the Government . The capitalist who holds your seven and three-tenths Treasury notes , or your six per cent , coupon bonds is a creditor of the Government . All are creditors of the Government on an equal footing , and all are equally entitled to their pay in gold and silver . I am opposed to all those amendments of the Senate which discriminate in favor of the holders of bonds and notes by compelling the Government to go into the streets every six months to sell bonds at the ' market price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the interest ' in coin ' to the /z/ capitalists who now hold United States stocks and Treasury notes heretofore issued , or that may hold bonds and notes hereafter to be issued ; while all other persons in the United States ( including the Army and Xavy and all who supply them food and clothing , ) are compelled to receive legal tender Treasury notes in payment of demands due them from the Government . Why make this discrimination ? Who asks to have one class of creditors placed on a better footing than another class ? Do the people of Xew England , the Middle States , or the people of the West and Xorthwest , or anywhere else in the rural districts , ask to have any such discrimination made in their favor ? Does the soldier , the farmer , the mechanic , or the merchant ask to have any such discrimination made in his favor ? Xo , sir ; no such unjust preference is asked for by this class of men . They ask for the legal tender note bill pure and simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal value in all parts of the country . They want a currency that shall pass from hand to hand among all the people in every State , county , city , town and village in the United States . They want a currency secured by adequate taxation upon the whole property of the country , which will pay the soldier , the farmer , the mechanic , and the banker alike for all debt due . They ask that the Government shall stand upon its own responsibility , its own rights , and exert its vast powers , preserve its own credit , and carry us safely through this gigantic rebellion , in the shortest time , and with the least possible sacrifice . They intend to foot aU the bills , and ultimately pay the whole amount principal and interest , in gold and silver . Who , then , are they that ask to have a preference given to them over other creditors of the Government ? Sir , it is a very respectable class of gentlemen , but a class of men who are very sharp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing classes not among those who , by their labor and skill , make the wealth of the country ; but a class of men that have accumulated wealth men who are willing to lend money to the Government if you will make the security beyond all question , give them a high rate of interest , and make it payable in coin . Tes 7 sir , the men who are asking these extravagant terms , who want to be preferred creditors , are perfectly willing to lend money to the Government in her present embarrassment , if you will only make them perfectly secure , give them extra interest , and put your bonds on the market at the * market price , ' to purchase gold and silver to pay them interest every six months . Yes , sir , entirely willing to loan money on these terms ! Safe , no hazard , secure , and the interest payable ' in coin ! ' Who would not be willing to loan money on such terms ? Sir , the legal tender Treasury note bill was intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , w r ho pay the taxes , from all such hard bargains . It was intended as a shield in the hands of the patriotic people of the country against all forced sales of bonds , and all extravagant rates of interest . The legal tender note bill is a great measure of equality . It proposes a currency for the people which is based upon the good faith of the people and all their taxable property . All are obliged to receive and pass it as money , and att are obliged to submit to heavy taxation to provide for its ultimate redemption in gold or silver . Every attempt on the part of any class of citizens to create distinctions and secure a legal preference , mars the simplicity and success of the whole plan . The very discrimination proposed carries on its face notice to everybody that although the notes are declared /z/ to be ' lawful money am ! a legal tender in payment of debts , ' yet that there is something of higher value , that must be sought after at a sacrifice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom it owes money a kind of absurdity and self-stultification which does not appear well on the lace of the bill . It is an unjust discrimination which does not appear well now , and w r ill not look well in history . You will , if the Senate* s amendment is adopted , depreciate , by your own acts , your own bonds and notes , and effectually destroy the symmetry and harmonious ivorking of the whole plan . I am in favor of having the Government pay in coin , if it can in this case , from the usual practice of the Government in expressing the mode of paying the interest . All bonds and Treasury notes heretofore issued are payable generally without specifying that either the principal or the interest shall be paid in coin , and yet the legal effect is the same . I do not see why we should now , in the present embarrassed condition of the Goverment , give any preference to one creditor over another , or change the form of our bonds and Treasury notes by inserting- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bonds or seven anji three-tenths Treasury notes is not entitled to any preference over the soldier or the man who furnishes supplies to your Army . AVe should pay both in specie , if possible ; but I am unwilling to tie up the hands of the Government by compelling it to pay ' in coin , ' the interest on all the bonds and notes heretofore issued , or that may hereafter be issued . The bonds and notes heretofore issued contain no such express provision ; it is not ' so nominated in the bond ; ' and I am unwilling to have it inserted at this time , either as to those now outstanding or as to those that are hereafter to be issued . Besides , if you commence in this way , by stipulating expressly to pay in coin on the bonds to be issued , it becomes a contract which can not , without a breach of faith , be changed by a repeal of the law . You unnecessarily commit the Government to a stipulation which may be very inconvenient , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to $2,000,000.000 , the interest upon which , at six per cent , per annum , would be $120,000,000 annually , requiring $60,000,000 of coin every six months to pay interest on your funded debt . I think we should pause before committing ourselves to any such proposition , for no man here is wise enough to tell how long this war will continue , or how many complications with foreign nations will grow out of it , or how great will be the war debt . By all means let us pay the interest in gold to those who desire it , if it is practicable to do so ; but let us keep the power in the Government itself , and exercise it wisely for the best interest of the whole people . The people in the country who hold seven and three-tenths Treasury notes are patriotic enough , while the war lasts , to receive their interest in any money that will pass currently at the banks and among the people . Money with them is only valuable for its uses . Legal tender Treasury notes can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to sell its bonds at fifteen or twenty per cent , discount to procure coin when it is entirely unnecessary . At the extra session in July we passed two very important bills one to borrow $250,000,000 , for which bonds and notes were to be issued , and the other to call into the service five hundred thousand volunteers , and pay the soldiers thirteen dollars per month , and the officers a higher rate of fixed compensation , Both bills were war measures , both were necessary , and action has been had under both . Under the first bill the associated /z/ banks of Xew York , Boston and Philadelphia took the sum of $100,000 , - 000 of seven and three-tenths three years Treasury notes at par , and $50,000,000 twenty years six per cent , bonds at a discount of ten and two thirds per cent , from their face say net $44,661,230.97 , being a loss of $5,338,769.03 on this transaction . This is a higher rate of interest than our Government , with all its immense power and resources , ought to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only refer to it now for the purpose of showing what has been done under these two acts of Congress . Under the army bill , five hundred thousand volunteers have been called into the service , and are now in the field . Under both of these bills a debt has been created against the Government . The associated banks of New York , Boston and Philadelphia are creditors of the Government to the extent of $150,000,000 . The five hundred thousand volunteer army are also creditors of the Government to a large amount . We owe them both , and both are creditors under laws passed by us at the extra session . Are not both classes of these creditors on the same footing ? Are the bankers entitled to any preference over the volunteer army ? Is the banker 's monej ' any more sacred than the services of the soldier in battle , on guard , or in the tented field ? I can not see that the banker or the holder of Treasury notes is entitled to any preference over the soldier , under these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these hardmoney amendments of the Senate , you will compel the soldier to take legal tender Treasury notes in payment for his thirteen dollars per month which you agreed to pay him , while you pay the banker his high rate of interest , semi-annually , in gold and silver coin . Is this right ? Will this be meting out just and equal laws to the loyal citizens of this Government ? What will your army say to an arrangement of this kind ? Sir , I can consent to no such discrimination , no such amendment , no such injustice . **** * * ****** It is to be hoped that this will be a short Avar . It is very desirable that it should be pressed on with the utmost vigor , and be brought to a speedy and successful termination . God grant that this may be the issue . I have no expectation , however , that the authority of the United States Government will be respected and enforced in all the Southern States for many years . I think the rebels are desperate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws until compelled to do so by armed force . They may be beaten and compelled to fall back , but until Union governments are successfully established in all the Southern States the laws of the United States will not be respected , and can only be enforced by the army and navy in actual occupation of the rebellious States . This will require a large and expensive army for many years , the total expenses of which can not now be estimated . It will require Federal troops in every rebellious State to collect your direct taxes and internal duties ; and until you can peaceably collect taxes in all the rebellious States the rebellion is not ended . In every aspect in which you view this hard-money provision , its practical workings will be disastrous . It would be all very well if the amount was small and applied to carrying on the Government on a peace footing , when you know what amount will be required ; but in carrying on the Government at this time , when the magnitude of the expenditures are so overwhelming , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities that are forced upon us in the prosecution of this war . Look at your long line of offensive operations , extending from Kansas to /z/ this capital , and Ihenee to Fortress . Monroe , ilatteras , Beaufort , Key NV. -t , IVnsacola , and Ship Island a , distance of more than four thousand miles . This very long line of military operations can not be maintained except at an enormous expense tor transportation , supplies , and material of war . One million six hundred thousand dollars does not cover the daily expenditures . Peace theories of finance must give way to what is practicable to be done in the present exigency . The Government is at this momenin the situation of a merchant who has overtraded , who owes more than he has the present means of paying . He may be compelled to stop payment in specie , when he has ample assets to cover all his liabilities . A mere suspension of specie payments does not imply bankruptcy or insolvency . Our country and Government at all hazards must be preserved . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practical . As has been shown , we have various descriptions of property in abundance . We have not the money to meet the sudden demands that are thrown upon us . Is it not better to pledge our honor , our lands , houses , personal estate , incomes , and wealth of all kinds to create this money , on the faith of the nation , than to run the risk of utter ruin to all interests for the sake of holding on to theories which may be excellent in time of peace , but which are wholly impracticable in the prosecution of this war . * It is very clear that in the prosecution of this war to maintain this Union , the ways and means of carrying it on can only be limited by the actual expenditures . We must , while the war lasts , incur all the debt necessary to crush out the rebellion , and maintain the authority of the United States Government over all the thirty-four States . We can not , therefore , now limit the amount of the debt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notes and bonds must be issued in some form for all the debt incurred , excepting what we may realize annually from taxes , excises , and duties on imports . In issuing these notes and bonds I think it will be much better for the Government , and for the people , to have one uniform , system . It would be better for all concerned to have a fixed policy , not to be changed , so that all business men may conform to it at once . That policy should , in my judgement , be the issue of legal tender demand Treasury notes not bearing interest , to be paid out for what is necessary to support the army and navy , and fundable at any time in twenty years bonds , bearing interest at six per cent. , payable semi-annually . This is as high a rate of interest as the Government ought to pay , especially as our people are to be heavily burdened by taxation to pay , ultimately , the interest and principle in gold and silver of all this debt . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall hear no further importunities for higher rates of interest , or for any preference of one class of creditors over any other class equally meritorious . I regret that my sense of duty compels me to differ so widely from the Senate . I have great respect for that body , and would gladly yield to their views , if I did not regard it so fatal to the public interest . So soon as our funded debt reaches $700,000,000 , which will be in a very few months , I believe it will be impossible to procure the coin to pay the interest semi-annually without the most serious consequences to our credit . The amount of discount on our bonds to procure specie would be very large . In every view , the Senate amendment seems to me unnecessary , injurious , partial and unjust . I trust the House will non-concur in the amendments . " /z/ At the time the above remarks were made by Mr. Spanieling , t/ie duties on imports were , as the bill then stood , payable in legal tender notes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making those duties payable in coin , so that the interest might be paid in coin , without being obliged to force the bonds on the market to obtain coin for that purpose . This was probably the best compromise that could be made , as will more fully appear in finally adjusting the disagreeing votes between the Senate and House . /z/ Mr. POMEROY , of New York , spoke one hour in favor of paying the interest in coin on bonds and Treasury notes . He said : " The action already had upon the bill has , so far as the sense of Congress is concerned , settled , if not the constitutionality and expediency of issuing , to a limited amount , Treasury notes , made a , legal tender in payment of debts , at least the existence of a necessity , under which such constitutional power will be assumed and its exercise declared expedient . I do not propose , therefore , to enter at all upon the discussion of those questions , nor would it be pertinent to the only amendment I propose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest on the national debt in coin . They were fully discussed when the bill was first before the committee , to the neglect , as I then thought and now think , of the point presented by the pending ' amendment , upon which alone I desire to submit a few remarks . The question is not now whether $150,000.000 of Treasury notes shall be issued and made a legal tender in payment of public and private indebtedness . That proposition has been decided in the affirmative ; but if my faith in the necessity and expediency of such issue was stronger even than that of the able and distinguished Representative , Mr. Spaulding. who has originated this measure , and carried it triumphantly over the Administration and through Congress , still , deeming this amendment , as proposed by the Senate and now under consideration , vital to the success of the scheme , and the only regulation by which financial explosion under it can be prevented , I could not , as an original proposition , and can not now , without such amendment , support this bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it is , if this amendment is to fail . I have no pride of opinion upon this matter , but I have convictions , clear , decided and conscientious , which I can not trample upon without violating- my own sense of self-respect and of public duty . The opposition which this amendment meets from the framers of the bill sufficiently demonstrates to us and to the country that it is not merely formal in its character , but is of primary importance and entitled to the highest consideration . I shall be very brief , and will endeavor to be plain in my views respecting it . It is conceded by the friends of the House bill , that the policy of issuing Treasury notes under it with the characteristics of money is to be temporary , and that it is a divergence from the correct principles of political economy , to be justified only by necessity , and yet the primary and principal fault I find with it is , that instead of being a temporary measure , it really , by its failure to make adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessitates the perpetuation of a reliance upon a forced paper currency alone to meet the demands of the war , the amount of the issue of which , if sufficient for that purpose , must depreciate it to a mere nominal value , and result in ultimate repudiation . It may be expedient as a remedy for an existing political disorder , but it is death if relied upon for permanent existence . The credit of the Government has been recently brought to the test of practical experiment in a much more favorable time than the present , when the banks were plethoric with gold beyond all former experience and promptly meeting all engagements in coin , when suspension had not been thought of , and the patriotism of the people was fully aroused in the enlistment of those armies that are to-day more than meeting our proudest anticipations ; and yet , under those most favorable auspices , the rate of interest , as established , was seven and three-tenths per cent , for three year coupon bonds , and seven per cent , for those running twenty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to the banks , who were the purchasers , of holding the proceeds on deposit without interest until drawn out in the usual course of expenditure ; and $50,000,000 of the long bonds , authorized at the extra session , have not been , and could not be , sold even at the rate above named . * * * The science of Government is one purely experimental . A code of laws designed for men as they ought to be , would be a terrible code applied to men as they are . We experience no difficuly in recognizing in legislation the natural laws of matter , and we should have no more in recognizing the natural laws of mind , association , trade , commerce and business . If we are to borrow money , we must recognize these laws ; and I may well call them higher laws , for while legislation can not change them , they are continually changing legislation . One of these is that the precious metals are the representative of value . The gold dollar of our currency is the unit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . Those who invest money or loan will make it a condition precedent that the interest shall be in money , and not in promises to pay money . Legislation has not changed , and can not change , paper currency into coin or its equivalent , except through convertibility . Without this requisite it is a mere naked promise . We can not make Treasury notes money until we can change by act of Congress a promise into a performance , and Almighty power alone can do that . We propose to compel the Government and citizens to receive this paper as money in payment for debt ; but we do not propose to attempt to compel anybody to take it by way of loan , nor to compel anybody to loan it , not even to Government . Then people must be induced to loan it ; and how can you expect them to do it at rates less favorable than you have already established in more prosperous times , to wit : a rate of seven and three-tenths per cent. , payable in coin . Xow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My colleague may take whichever horn of the dilemma he pleases . If it is not , it is folly to suppose that people are voluntarily going to place themselves in a position where , for a term of years , they compel themselves to receive it as interest , and assume all the risk of depreciation . If it is equal , then there can be no unjust discrimination in paying interest in gold . I prefer to look at the question just as it is , and admit the fact that it is not and can not be made equal , because it lacks the essential quality of convertibility . To the extent to which it is not equal , we work a hardship in forcing it into circulation ; but we IIMVC already decided that ' a necessity exists which /z/ compels us to accept this hardship rather than to inflict upon the people or submit the Government to a greater . And we believe farther , that the evils thus produced will , in the aggregate , if not in each individual case , be more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as a medium of exchanges , especially with the Government itself . While , however , we exercise the power to compel the people to receive it as gold in payment of debts , we , unfortunately , have not the power to compel them to loan it back to us on time , and receive more of the same kind as interest . There is just the practical point where our new political physiology fails . As ' Arternus Ward ' would say , ' its forte is not in borrowing , but in paying , ' and we have got to make it work both ways . It is all nonsense to say that while we pay out Treasury notes from necessity in some cases , we will forbear to borrow money , without which our credit must go down entirely , because it will necessitate the payment of interest in coin , and thus conflict with our theory ; that because we pay ourselves and our soldiers and everybody else with whom we are under contract , in paper , we will stop paying even them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowing money and stipulating in advance to pay the interest in a different commodity . The inconsistency consists in not considering that we must first get the principal before we put on airs about the manner in which we will pay the interest , in which transaction the lender as well as the borrower is usually consulted . The Committee of Ways and Means are talking about paying , whereas the problem is how to borrow . ISTor does the agreement to pay interest in coin tend in the least to depreciate the value of the notes . The very necessity for this agreement arises from the fact of the pre-existing differences in value between coin and paper . It does not create the inequality . It recognizes an existing fact , and applying legislation practically to that , fact , enhances the value of the paper , by allowing its conversion into a permanent loan , the principal and interest of which are to be paid in money ; and instead of depreciating the paper , checks depreciation by reason of this very convertibility , and presents the only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious depreciation can be prevented and the funding process kept in operation . In fact , this very difference between the intrinsic values of notes and coin , thus recognized and embodied in our legislation , tends to produce the very object desired the funding of the public debt . If capital will seek Treasury notes at par , for the purpose of investment in bonds , with the interest payable in notes , how much more readily will it seek these same notes , at a slight depreciation , for the purpose of such investment , with the interest to be paid in gold ; and the very demand for this purpose , while it prevents serious depreciation , is induced by the very depreciation inherent in the character of the paper which it continually checks . It produces a self-adjusting funding access , based upon things as they exist in the commercial world , by which the disparity between the value of the two currencies ceases to be an element of discord , and becomes , during the temporary period in which the funding process is going on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the happy instrumentality which may in this way be exerted by these notes , imperceptibly , and through the ordinary channels of financial operations , the whole process of funding the public debt will be accomplished . /z/ One thing further is evident . If the debt can be funded under the provisions of the IIou.se bill , it certainly can under the Senate amendments . The Treasury has prided itself on its ability to obtain money at the rate proposed by the latter in more prosperous times . If it was satisfactory then , it should be still more satisfactory now . In this work we can not a ( lord to fail . The part of wisdom is , then , to accept the greater safety . When paper shall have taken the place of coin , and the latter , true to its instincts , shall have taken wings and flown away it can not be whistled back . It is idle to argue that two representatives of value of equal nominal amount , but intrinsically unequal , will stay together and consent to become convertible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more must not be overlooked in considering this matter that the security remains the same in all cases , namely : the faith of the Government . Xo inducement is offered by the House to fund these notes in the nature of the new security . The credit of the Government is alike bound for the payment of both classes of indebtedness ultimately in gold . Each derives its entire value from that . The only advantage that can be then offered in funding is the mere convenience in the form of the security , and the payment of interest in a commodity similar to that which the principal represents . Xov , I do not know by what class of soldiers my colleague Mr. Spaulding , may be represented in the field , but I do know the character of the two thousand soldiers from my own county , and of the four thousand soldiers in the field from my congressional district , and I know that their present condition as soldiers is purely ephemeral . Their normal condition is that of citi/ens , and as such I represent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the appeal of my colleague in their behalf as a class , as soldiers , in distinction from their character as American citizens . * ********* I believe I have never failed to sustain , whether it be to my credit or otherwise , any recommendation backed by a majority tf the Committee of Ways and Means of this House . As amended by the Senate in this respect , I will cheerfully support this bill . In its original form I could not , though it lias been unpleasant to diverge from so large a proportion of my political associates . It were easier to have followed in the wake of inclination , and covered myself from criticism with the mantle of necessity . I have preferred to w r alk the plank of duty , trusting to time and practical results for the vindication of its policy . " /z/ Mr. CALVERT , of Maryland , advocated the payment of interest in coin . He said : " Let me tell the gentleman from New York , Mr. Spanieling , that it is useless to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . When you want to borrow money you must go to the brokers to borrow it . Farmers and others may be induced by the brokers to invest their money in your bonds ; but they will not do it wit hout the advice of the brokers or agents with whom they are in the habit of counseling , and therefore it is the broker at last who holds in his hands your credit , and it is useless for gentlemen of this House to talk about a proposition to put down the brokers w r ho are constantly dealing in these notes . He contended that the amendment of the Senate would benefit the /z/ credit of the Government more than anything else that could be done . People would not loan money to be payable in paper , because , although you make paper a legal tender by legislation , it will not be so in fact the question has yet to be tried before the State Court , as well as before the United States Court . The only way in which you can possibly have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then if the notes fall below par they will be immediately funded . " /z/ Mr. MORRILL , of Vermont " Our whole difficulty in this matter , it appears to me , arises from our departure from sound principles in the first place . It appears that the House and the Senate have both decided that they will issue paper and make it a legal tender . I deeply deplore the fact as a blot on our national history that can not be effaced ; but as I do not now see it probable that any other result will be reached , my only purpose and desire is to perfect and pass the best possible bill to be obtained . I believe the Senate amendments are , on the whole , a great improvement upon the bill as it passed the House . I could wish that we might , even at this hour , slaughter both the original bill and the Senate 's amendments , and then mature such financial measures as would preserve a sound specie-paying basis ; but having no hope of that now , I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some degree at least , mitigate the evils to be apprehended from the bill as it left this House . Xow , the gentleman from Xew York ( Mr. Spanieling ) talks as though it would be an abandonment of the honor and good faith of the Government to pay the soldiers in any different species of money from that which we pay our public creditors . I recollect to have read that Frederick the Great , upon a certain occasion , directed his minister , when he was about to seize upon some province of one of his neighbors , to draw tip a proclamation justifying the measure to the world ; and his minister drew it up , commencing . ' In the name of God . ' Said Frederick , ' strike out all about God , and say that I did it . ' Xow , I recommend to the gentleman from Xew York , when he is talking about this subject of compelling the public and private creditors to take paper money for all debts heretofore or hereafter contracted , to omit all mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact in reference to this matter of paying off the soldiers in any different money ? " Vhy , the fact is that we are going to pay them in paper , according to this bill . ISTow , if these soldiers were debtors , and owed a grocer at home or here , and could make a tender of this paper , it might then indeed be of some service ; but how are you to compel the grocer , or any man who has anything to sell upon which these soldiers or their families subsist , to take this paper at anything more than its market value ? Of course , if coin is worth more than paper , they have to pay to that extent more than they would pay if they had coin ; and I am in favor of keeping our promises equal to coin . In my judgment , if we pay the interest on the public debt in specie , it will have a tendency to keep up the credit of the country , and there will be less depreciation upon these notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great object is to fund some portion of the public debt . Xow , it is perfectly apparent , not only from the statement of the gentleman from Xew York ( Mr. Spaulding ) , but from the knowledge all /z/ have of the subject , that our wauls are large , and that e ill pellcd to issue our bonds or notes , or paper of some kind , to a lai hereafter . Xow it , is proposed to issue twice , thrice or quadru amount of this legal tender paper before this session of Congress Within sixty days we must have at least twice the amount of notes is proposed now ; and unless - they can be funded into debts due at future time , from necessity , as we shall again be told , we shall have to repeat the dose we are now offering to the public . Anybody may see that while it might be possible for this country to endure $150,000,000 of additional currency , even if it did unhinge all commercial transactions , that it would be utterly impossible that AVC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of the Avhole monetary system of the country turning even sober and industrious citizens into the wildest of speculators . * * ******** But , Mr. Chairman . I believe that if we could stand up here in the vigor of a nation not yet ( axed a single dollar for the cost of this war , and mature a proper poliey by which we can negotiate a loan standing on the credit of the country , standing m the proposed taxation of the country , standing on our hitherto untarnished honor , that there could be no need whatever of a resort to such a desperate scheme as the one now under consideration . I hope , therefore , that we shall adopt the amendment of the Senate . I wish that we might go much further , but that at least is better than a measure whose symmetry is only measured by its exclusively paper character . " /z/ Mr. DUNN , of Indiana , spoke as follows : " Mr. Chairman when this bill was under consideration in the House , ( in . Committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition to pay the interest on the bonds in coin , and the Committee sustained that proposition by a very decided vote . I do not quite understand by what legerdemain the bill went to the Senate in a different form . I voted then that the interest should be paid in coin , and I shall vote so now , notwithstanding the arguments employed here to induce us to vote differently . The principal argument urged against the Senate amendment is that it provides for paying our creditors in different ways , and an appeal is made to the patriotism of the House to know if we are willing to pay different kinds of money for our interest from that with which we pay our soldiers . Now , I shall vote for this proposition with the direct view and object of making the paper we offer to the soldier as good as possible . I believe that it is impossible to pay them in coin , or I would vote for that . It is accessary to make our notes as good as possible , and if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nearly as possible . If we can not remove the cloud of debt , let us , at least , give it a golden lining . One mode of sustaining the credit of the notes is to have them converted into bonds ; and in order to make those bonds acceptable to those lio have money to lend , we must make the interest payable in coin . We must try to induce capitalists to lend us money ; for we have no mode of compelling them to do so . The gentleman from Vermont , Mr. Mori-ill , who has just taken his seat , said that the West expected some advantages from making Treasury notes a legal tender . The members from the West , generally , who voted for making the notes a legal tender , did so because we believed it to be a governmental necessity . We wanted a bridge to /z/ carry us over the morass . We make it of trestle-work , a temporary work , to serve only until the ground hardens . We do not believe this war is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legal tender clause will long exist . I think that those who were despondent ten days ago have now great reason to rejoice . The rapid succession of Union victories has filled every loyal heart with joy , and I do not doubt but that we shall soon be relieved from our pecuniary difficulties . " /z/ Mr. ENGLISH , of Connecticut , spoke in favor of paying the interest in coin . He concurred with Mr. Pendleton on the constitutional question , and considered it settled by his argument that it was not constitutional to make these notes a legal tender . lie also argued at considerable length that the measure was not nwsstiry at this time . He was in favor of ample taxation , and that the States should be allowed to collect the taxes and pay over the money to the United States . He wanted no Government tax collectors . On the pending amendments he said : " In order to make these bonds valuable to those who have money to invest , we must adopt the amendment of the Senate providing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ascertained , that the interest is to be paid in gold and silver , then the bonds will be sought for investment . If you issue Treasury notes , and if these Treasury notes go into the market and depreciate as I think they will not what will be the effect ? The effect will be that , just in proportion as the Treasury notes depreciate , in the same proportion will the interest payable on bonds be diminished . These Treasury notes answer very well as a means of circulation , provided the amount of the issue shall not exceed that provided for in this bill . My opinion is that these Treasury notes may answer a very good purpose ; but the moment their volume is swollen beyond that , so soon will they depreciate . I trust that the amendment of the Senate will be concurred in by this House . In my judgment , it is the very best thing that we can do under the circumstances . I voted for the issuing of these Treasury notes , but against the ' legal tender ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure ; but the judgment of the House Avas against me on that point . I think that now the best thing the House can do is to concur in the Senate amendment ; and I trust that it will be concurred in. " /z/ Mr. PIKE , of Maine , spoke as follows : " Mr. Chairman with all due deference to gentlemen who differ with me on this subject , it does seem to me that this matter of paying interest in coin is a controversy about goat 's wool . The interest will be paid in coin in any event . The recent victories of our armies have changed the whole matter . ( Just heard of the capture of Fort Donelson and the movement on Xashville . ) We have now to return to a normal condition of currency . * * /z/ " I not only assent most cheerfully to the proposition to pay the interest in coin , lint , I a ! o as-cut to ( lie connate proposition to sell these bonds at the highest price we can get tor them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cans- of the ruturn as well as the return itself . Let us sell our bonds to pay the creditors whom vc are under contract to pa ' . We never can have a better time 1'or doing so than uov , when an effervescence of delight is felt all over the country , because of the victories achieved by our armies . It is felt everywhere now that we not only have a Government , but a country on which to base this issue . Therefore , I say , let us now sell these bonds . Let us reali/e as much money from them as we can . Let us provide to pay the interest in coin , and let us pay the public creditors . " /z/ Mr. DIVEN , of New York , spoke as follows : " It strikes me , Mr. Chairman , that the fallacy of all the arguments in favor of this amendment consists in the fact that the amendment fails to meet the evil . It is not proposed to go back and remedy the great national wrong , national dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by declaring that these notes shall be a legal tender . If this House is determined to adhere to that , if as the gentleman from Vermont has said the child is dead , if the national credit is gone , if we are ready to assume the humiliating attitude that national credit and honor are dead , then the argument of the gentleman from ! NTew York ( Mr. Spaulding ) is sound . The same plea of necessity which is resorted to in support of the legal tender clause , will require us to resort to every effort to do away with all distinction between this paper money and coin . The requiring the payment of interest in coin will have a tendency to make such distinction . It will have that effect , and all that we can do will not help it . Let me make one appeal to members . It is not yet too late to retrieve the error . We have not yet declared that we will compel men to take those promises to pay , and to treat them as substance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The times are auspicious . One good reason urged in favor of that policy was that the people were discouraged from the want of success in our army . We have now the encouragement of success . Only let the moneyed men of the country believe that the Government is to succeed in putting down this rebellion , and we will not have to plead for credit . It is not gold and silver that we w r ant . It is not things that are to be taken for gold and silver that we want . It is credit ; it is confidence on the part of men who have money to lend , and who can lend it to the Government with the assurance that it will be returned to them . That is all that is wanted . And now , in view of the brilliant prospect before us of a speedy termination of the rebellion , and in view of the immense resources of the Government , in Heaven 's name , let us leave no national dishonor , to forever remain a stain upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great wrong . I appeal to the House , in the name of honor and justice , to retrace the step it has taken , and to save the Union from the loss that will aiflict it by the passage of this law . " Mr. WINDOM , of Minnesota , objected to the proceeds of the public Is being pledged to pay interest or principal on the bonds , as /z/ proposed by the Senate , for the reason that it would tend to defeat the Homestead Law . This provision was afterwards struck out in the Conference Committee . On the 6th amendment of the Senate , providing that these Treasury notes should be received for all claims and demands against the United States of every kind whatsoever , * except for interest on bonds and notes , which shall be paid in coin , ' Mr. Pendletoii moved an amendment to the effect l that the officers , soldiers , seamen and mariners engaged in the military service of the United States , ' should also be paid in coin . Being opposed to the whole legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentleman from New York , Mr. Spaulding , in reference to our unjust discrimination against soldiers and others . He said : " I am not in favor of that discrimination , but am in favor of paying the officers and soldiers in the military and naval service of the Government in the legal coin of the country . " The amendment was not agreed to . The amendments of the Senate having been acted upon in Committee of the Whole , Mr. Stevens moved that the Committee rise and report the bill and amendments to the House , which was agreed to . The bill and amendments were accordingly reported to the House . On the 20th , the House resumed the consideration of the Senate amendments . Mr. STEVENS was entitled to one hour in closing the debate . He gave a part of this time to Mr. Hooper , of Massachusetts . /z/ Mr. HOOPER , of Massachusetts , spoke as follows : " Mr. SPEAKER with the present large expenditures of the Government , and while the banks throughout the country are acting under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on the strict enforcement of the existing laws , which require all Government receipts and payments to be made in coin . It is absurd , in my opinion , because it is impossible ; and it is also absurd because it is useless . What private corporations or individuals in this country receive and pay coin in the conduct of their business ? There are none . Nearly all the ordinary receipts and payments throughout the country are made in bank notes , bank checks , or credit in some other form ; and coin is only required occasionally for a very small per cent , of those receipts and payments , which in amount , extend , in the course of a single year , to thousands of millions of dollars . The object of this Treasury note bill is to furnish a substantial and /z/ uniform currency that will aid the Government , and enable it to receive its dues and make its payments , like all others , with credits . This bill declares that , for all dues to the Government and for all payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the same as coin . ' One way to make them ' the same as coin ' would be to make them at all times convertible into coin . Another is to use them , so far as possible , for all the purposes for which coin is used ; and in this latter mode their value will be the same as coin , unless the amount that is issued exceeds the amount needed for such uses . At the end of twelve months from this time the receipts of the Government and the payments by the Government , amounting to many hundred millions of dollars , will be found to be nearly equal ; that is , the Government during that time will have received about the same amount that it will have paid ; and if these ' Government notes ' are , in part , paid out by the Government , as it is proposed they shall be , in anticipation of the receipts for taxes and loans , they must all come back again in the course of the year , when those taxes and loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these notes more convenient for other uses , and may , therefore , prefer to make their payments to the Government partly in coin . Unless , therefore , the Government is to be broken down , by the refusal to furnish the means in the form of taxes and loans to carry it on , these notes can not depreciate to any extent , because they will be needed , and probably a large amount of coin in addition , to pay into the Treasury for the loans and taxes ; they will be received by the Government the same as coin , and therefore must be for this purpose , and all others , the equivalent of coin , unless they are imprudently issued in excess of the requirements for such purposes . I am opposed to this amendment of the Senate which requires the interest on Government notes and bonds to be absolutely paid in coin , because its effect will be to depreciate these notes as compared with coin , by declaring them in advance to be so depreciated . It creates a necessity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is not received in payment of taxes and loans , which hold out an inducement to speculate on the necessity of the Government , by collecting and hoarding the coin against the time that will be required by the Government to pay its interest ; and because it is an unnecessary inconvenience to require the whole amount of the interest to be paid in coin , when only the small amount is necessary that is to be remitted to foreign holders of bonds , which could easily be obtained at small cost , if the effect of the issue of the Government notes should be what the friends of this bill expect . * If the opponents of this bill have proved anything , they have proved too much in reference to the question now before the House , which is to make a distinction in favor of the holders of Government securities , and pay what may be due to them in coined money , while all other creditors of the Government shall be paid in what they have denounced to the country from the high places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CLOSING DEBATE MR . STEVE Ns ' si'l.KCH . Mr. STEVENS , of Pennsylvania , spoke as follows : " Mr. SPEAKER I have a very few words to say . I approach the subject with more depression of spirits than I ever before approached any question . No personal motive or feeling influences me . I hope not , at least . I have a melancholy foreboding that we are about to consummate /z/ a cunningly devised scheme , which will carry great injury and great loss to all classes of the people throughout this Union , except one . With my colleague , I believe that 110 act of legislation of this Government was ever hailed with as much delight throughout the whole length and breadth of this Union , by every class Of people , without any exception , as the bill which we passed and sent to the Senate . Congratulations from , all classes merchants , traders , manufacturers , mechanics and laborers poured in upon us from all quarters . The Boards of Trade from Boston , New York , Philadelphia , Cincinnati , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its provisions , and urged its passage as it was . I have a dispatch from the Chamber of Commerce of Cincinnati , sent to the Secretary of the Treasury , and by him to me , urging the speedy passage of the bill as it passed the House . It is true there was a doleful sound came up from the caverns of bullion brokers , and from the saloons of the associated banks . Their cashiers and agents were soon on the ground , and persuaded the Senate , with but little deliberation , to mangle and destroy what it had cost the House mouths to digest , consider and pass . They fell upon the bill in hot haste , and so disfigured and deformed it , that its very father Avould not know it . Laughter . Instead of being a beneficent and invigorating measure ; it is now positively mischievous . It has all the bad qualities which its enemies charged on the original bill , and none of its benefits . It now creates money , and by its very terms declares it a depreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks and brokers , and another for the people . It discriminates between the rights of different classes of creditors , allowing the rich capitalist to demand gold , and compelling the ordinary lender of money on individual security to receive notes which the Government had purposely discredited . Let us examine the principal amendments separately , and see their effect . The first important one ( being the fifth , ) makes the notes issued under the laws of July 17 , a legal tender , equally with those authorized by this bill . There can be but little wisdom in putting these two classes on an equality . The notes of July bear seven and three-tenths per cent , interest , and are payable in three years . This gives them a sufficient adVcintage over notes bearing no interest and payable virtually in twenty years bonds , with six per cent , interest . Why give them this additional advantage ? Simply because the $100,000,000 issued are all held by the associated banks , and this is their amended bill . They would displace $100,000,000 of this money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any considerable amount of these United States notes as a currency . These notes have served their purpose . Why allow them to block up the market against further relief to the Government ? The banks took $50,000,000 of six per cent , bonds , and shaved the Government $5,500,000 on them , and now ask to shave the Government fifteen or twenty per cent , half yearly , to pay themselves the interest on these very bonds . They paid for the $50,000,000 in demand notes , not specie , and now demand the specie for them . Yet gentlemen talk about our making other loans in these times . They are crazy or sleeping , one or the other , I do not know which . When this question was discussed before , the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky ( Mr. Crittenden ) asked me whether it was the intention or expectation of the House to go on and issue more than one hundred and fifty millions of dollars of legal tender notes a pertinent question , which I saw the whole force of at the time . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more would be issued by the ' Government ; that they would be received and funded in the twenty year bonds . " Mr. LOVEJOY " I ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania whether $150 , - 000,000 of gold could not be put into circulation as well as $150,000,000 of Treasury notes ? " Mr. STEVENS " If this $150,000,000 would come out of the banker 's and in i -i -r 's hoards ; but they have suspended specie payment , and would not give out a dollar . They say pay us a discount , and then when these notes are made a legal tender we will be again in the clutches of these harpies . I do not want to use hard names . I suppose these men act from instinct . If I were now to answer the question of the gentleman from Kentucky , I would not give that answer . I do not expect one dollar of the $150,000,000 of legal tender notes ever to be invested in the twenty years bonds . I infer from the amendment that before we adjourn $150,000,000 will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds , and so on , as they are needed , as no bonds will be funded until our circulation will become frightfully inflated . ********** But now comes the main clause . All classes of people shall take these legal tender notes at par for every article of trade or contract , unless they have money enough to buy United States bonds , and then they shall be paid in gold . Who is that favored class ? The banks and brokers , and nobody else . They have already $250,000,000 of State debt , and their commissioners would soon take all the rest that might be issued . But how is this gold to be raised ? The duties and public lands are to be paid for in United States notes , and they or bonds are to be put up at auction to get coin for these very brokers , who would furnish the coin to pay themselves , by get " ting twenty per cent , discount on the notes thus bought . * * * * I have proposed an amendment to the Senate amendment upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make as palatable as you can an amendment which you do not like , before the vote is taken upon it . My amendment is offered for the purpose of curing a little the evils and hardships of the original amendment of the Senate . And though it may be adopted , I shall vote against the whole as amended . My amendment is to except from the operation of the legal tender clause the officers and soldiers of the army and navy , and those who supply them with provisions , and thus put them upon the same footing with the Government creditors who hold their bonds . I hope they will not be thought less meritorious than the money-changers . I trust it will be adopted as an amendment to the Senate amendment , so that if this pernicious system is to be adopted , if the beauty of the original bill is to be entirely impaired , those who are fighting our battles , and the widows and children of those who are lying in their graves in every part of the country , killed in defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those who hold the bonds of the Government and the coin of the country . " At the conclusion of Mr. Stevens ' speech the House proceeded to vote on the Senate amendments , some of which were concurred in , and others were disagreed to . The first important division of the House was on the sixth amendment of the Senate , as follows : " Immediately after the clause last quoted , strike out the words ' and for all salaries , drbl- : iml di'inaml owing by the United States to individ- /z/ uals , corporations and associations within the United States , ' and insert , ' and of claims and demands against the United States , of any kind whatsoever , except for interest upon bonds and notes , which shall be paid in coin .

The amendment providing for a sinking fund , being the fifth Section of the Senate amendments , was now concurred in jeas 51 , nays 52 . The remainder of the amendments being merely verbal , were read , voted on in gross , and all concurred in . On the same day , 20th inst , the amendments were returned to the Senate with a concurrence of the House in a part of the /z/ amendments , a non-concurrence in others , and with some amendments to the Senate 's amendments . Mr. FESSEXDEX moved that immediate action be had on the amendments . The motion was agreed to , and after some preliminary remarks by Mr. King and Mr. Sherman , and without any separate action on the several amendments , Mr. Fessenden said : " I will move , as I understand the House has adjourned until to-morrow , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , and disagree to the amendments of the House to the amendments of the Senate , and ask for a Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses . " The motion was agreed to , and the Chair appointed Mr. Fessenden , Mr. Sherman and Mr. Carlisle , as such Committee . On the 21st. , the action of the Senate was reported to the House , and on motion of Mr. Stevens , a Committee of Conference was appointed on the part of the House , as requested by the Senate , consisting of Mr. Stevens , Mr. Horton and Mr. Sedgwick . The Conference Committee had long consultation , extending through two or three days . They finally compromised some of the most material of the disagreeing votes between the two Houses . The most material change made was to require the duties on imports to be paid in coin , and held as a fund to pay the interest in coin on the funded debt , thereby doing away with the necessity of forcing the bonds on the market to procure coin for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to in the Committee of Conference . On the 24th , Mr. Stevens reported to the House the action of the Conference Committee , which was agreed to yeas 97 ; nays 22 . On the 25th , Mr. Fessenden made the same report in the Senate which was agreed to by the Senate without a division ; and on the same day President Lincoln approved the bill , and thus the Legal Tender act , after a most able and determined opposition , became a law . It is not deemed important to set forth in detail the several amendments and compromises made in the Committee of Conference . A copy of the bill as it passed the House on the 6th inst , will be found on page 96 , and the following is a copy of the bill as it finally passed both Houses , and became a law . By comparing them , the amendments made after the bill first passed the House will fully appear : /z/ " An Act to authorize the issue of United States notes , and for the redemption or funding thereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States .

Approved February 25 , 1862 . A. LINCOLN . " Passage of the Treasury note bill . /z/ WASHINGTON , Tuesday , Feb. 23 , 1862 . The Conference Committee of the Treasury note bill having concurred , and Mr. Washburne having defeated another endeavor to adjourn the House yesterday as early as two o'clock , the prospect of an invigoration of the war by a supply of money , and the payment of soldiers and contractors , was good . The bill as agreed upon by the conferees authorizes the issue of $150,000,000 of Treasury notes , uniform in similitude , and a legal tender in the payment of all debts , public and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as it conveniently can be done , makes the new notes fundable at any time in six per cent , twenty years bonds , redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after five years ; makes the interest on the bonds and notes payable in coin , and ( a new feature ) makes the duties on imports also payable in coin , and devotes them to the payment of the interest on the notes and bonds , and the creation of a sinking fund by setting apart one per cent , of the amount . The provisions insisted on by the Senate authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell six per cent , bonds for what they will fetch , in order to raise coin for interest , is retained in the bill . All the funded debt is exempted from taxation . Authority is given to temporarily deposit demand notes to the extent of twenty-five millions , on an interest of six per cent , after thirty days . The bill has gone through both Houses , and . it is supposed , will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York sent the bill back again to the Senate this morning , for an amendment that should permit sixty millions of Treasury notes to be used for the payment of custom duties , the fifty millions authorized in July , and the temporary relief ten millions authorized this month . This was adopted and accepted by the House , and it is to be hoped that the President will now have a chance to sign the bill , and the abused public creditors get their pay . It is but just to say , that to the patient labor of the Hon. E. G. Spaulding the country is greatly indebted for the early maturity of this finance measure , and for what vigor has been displayed in its passage through Congress . " /z/ It will be noticed that by the 4th section of the Legal Tender act the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to receive deposits in the sub-Treasury to the amount of $25,000,000 , in sums of not less than $100 , at five per cent , interest , with the privilege to the depositors of drawing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after thirty days . This was but another form of borrow- /z/ ing money by the Government at a low rate of interest . Its operation at the sub-Treasury was somewhat like that of a Saving 's Bank , and the privilege was largely availed of by banks , insurance companies and individuals . It became a very popular mode of temporary investment for corporations and individuals , and although it operated against funding in the 5-20 bonds , yet it/q/
