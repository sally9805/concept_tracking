ART . V. - Messages of the President of the United States to Congress , with accompanying Documents relating to Mexican Affairs . 1862-1866 . THE existing complications in Mexico are mainly attributable to the influence of the Mexican Church party . From the outset Spain governed the colony of Mexico by means of the clergy . The Church eagerly accepted its position . It formed an oligarchy more deeply rooted than any purely political class could be , because it controlled the consciences of the people . It was clothed by the government with great privileges . It acquired vast wealth , and held a large portion of the land of the country . Until the year 1810 Spanish ecelestiastical rule held Mexico in subjection . At that time Hidalgo raised the standard of revolt . The revolt was but the result of the liberal ideas of the age , which at length began to be felt iu Mexico . The Church took its natural position , against those ideas , and in favor of the absolute government of Spain . From 1810 till 1821 a cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of caste , native against the Spaniard . But while this war was going on in Mexico , a change was taking place in Spain . Up to 1810 , the policy of Spain had been to place all political power in Mexico in the hands of Spaniards . No one born in Mexico had any voice in the administration of affairs . But in the year 1821 the Spanish Cortes did two things as astonishing to the people as to the clergy . It curtailed the power of the viceroy , heretofore dependent only on the crown , and it took from the Church a part of its property and sold it for the benefit of the people . This necessitated a change in the policy of the clerical party . They had favored Spanish rule , because their wealth and influence would be more secure . From the same motive they now took a new position . In 1821 the Viceroy attempted to restore throughout the whole of Mexico the absolute power of Spain . For this purpose the command of the loyalist army was offered to Iturbide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , he was to unite under the old rule native and Spaniard . With this undcr // standing he assumed the leadership ; but , instead of proclaiming the power of Spain , the Church compelled him to put forth in February , 1821 , the famous document known as the Plan of Iguala , by which the Mexican nation was declared independent of Spain . Thus by the strength of the Church party ,  --  a power created by Spain to keep Mexico in subjection , and which had done the work with an iron hand for two hundred and eightysix years , - was Mexico freed from Spanish rule . While Spain ruled Mexico* the Mexican Church was in communication with the Church in Spain , and had no direct rela*ions with the See of IRome . But after the independence of Mexico the Pope ventured to acknowledge the Mexican Church , and despatch his Nuncio to the new republic . Under this order of things the concentration of ecclesiastical power became greater than ever . The Church attained an overwhelming strength in all the affairs of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established what are known as fueros , or special privileges , by which it constituted itself a religious and moneyed hierarchy , controlling all affairs , secular and ecclesiastical . It was not amenable to the laws of the republic . It owned immense territories , and held innumerable mortgages , of which there was no record , and which were not subject to taxatidn . So that , although Mexico , in 1821 , became independent of the despotic rule of Spain , it at the same time fell more than ever under the tyrannical and unyielding rule of the Church . In direct opposition to the ascendency of the Church party , however , there sprung up a Liberal party . From 1821 till 1857 , the different revolutions , seemingly inexplicable , which have harassed Mexico , confused its history , and wearied the world , have been due entirely to the antagonisms of these two parties . Their alternate triumphs and defeats have produced , in the space of thirty-three years , thirty-six different forms of government , represented by seventy-two individuals , who have , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with various fortunes , appeared and disappeared in the vortex of events . It is unnecessary to speak in detail of these changes . It is sufficient to say , that all the while the Liberal party was gaining strength and consistency , and preparing the people to throw off the incubus that had so long // oppressed it . In 1857 it made a vigorous attempt to reform the government . Up to this time the Church property and Church revenues had been protected by the government . With a kind of parental fondness , it had invested the priest and the soldier with the privilege of being tried by special tribunals , constituted by themselves . It had declared the Catholic religion to be the exclusive religion of Mexico ; it had placed the press under strict censorship ; and had limited immigration solely to persons from Catholic countries . The Liberal party , represented by the Constitutional Con. congress assembled in Mexico in 1857 , overturned with one blow this whole system . This Congress declared the establishment of a constitutional federal government , freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press and religion , the subordination of the army to the civil power , and the opening of the country to unrestricted immigration . But its great act , levelled directly at its old antagoiiist , the Church party , was the nationalization of two hundred million dollars ' worth of property held by the clergy . In February , 1857 , this Congress completed its work . On the 16th of September the new government commenced its life under the presidency of Comonfort , who took the oath to support it on December 1st of the same year . These reforms were but the embodiment of the ideas evolved in the previous struggles of half a century . It never entered the minds of the Church party , however , to submit quietly to the new order of things . It began by compelling the honest but feeble Comonfort to break his oath , and to set aside the constitution in just sixteen days after he had sworn solemnly to support it . Cornonfort 's subsequent career was one of indecision , He pronounced in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . In order not to be opposed he arrested Juarez , the President of the Supreme Court , upon whom , by the constitution , the office of President of the Republic devolved in the absence or default of the person elected . He SOOIl perceived , however , that he was merely the tool of the clerical party , and had been made by them to play a contemptible part ; lie therefore arrested their leader , Zuloaga , who was already aspiring to occupy his posi // 1866.1 The Mexican Question . tion . At the same time , in spite of himself , he was compelled by the strength of party spirit to liberate Juarez . Juarez , set at liberty on the 11th of January , 1858 , repaired to Guanajuato , and organized there the constitutional government . In the mean time Comonfort , abandoned by the Liberals whom he had betrayed , and by the Church party for his vacillating course , relinquished , of his own accord , the presidency , and on the 15th of January assumed the position of general-in-chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national palace being vacant , the Church party took possession of it , declared Zuloaga President , and obtained from the Diplomatic Corps his recognition . On the 30th of January , 1859 , Zuloaga was set aside by the same party that had raised him to power , and the presidency conferred by them on Miramon . Again the Diplomatic Corps recognized Miramon as the President of the Republic , at the instigation of the Church party . But on the 17th of November , 1860 , he was utterly defeated by the Liberal army under Juarez , and fled from Mexico . In December the constitutional army entered the capital without resistance , and on the 11th of January , 1861 , Juarez was peaceably installed in the place whence , three years before , he had departed . To comprehend exactly the position of Juarez to-day , we must bear in mind , with this summary of events , two facts , each equally important . The first is , that the Church party had never overthrown the constitutional government ; on the 22d of January , 1858 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took possession of the capital , not as a conquered , but as an abandoned post . But Juarez had already , under the constitution , organized a government at Guanajuato , and had notified foreign ministers of the fact . If , therefore , the constitutional government had never ceased to exist , the insurrectionary party under Zuloaga had no claim to the quality of the government de facto . The other fact is , that the Diplomatic Corps , through the instrumentality of M. de Gabriac , the French Minister , recognized this party as the government de facto , and thereby gave to it a certain character and a moral prestige which otherwise it never would have had . This abtion misled people abroad , amid // held in power for the space of three years the Church party , enabling them to keep the country during this time in a state of civil strife , and to prolong a struggle with the government of Juarez which otherwise might have been ended in three months . It gave to this party , moreover , the opportunity to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the three great powers of Europe thought a sufficient pretence to justify an armed intervention in the affairs of Mexico . These acts and enormities were the forcible seizure of the British bondholders ' money by Miramon , November 16th , 1860 , the making of the Mon-Almonte treaty , so called , with Spain , and the decree of October 29 , 1859 , known as the Jecker Bond Contract . The rebellion by which the Church party had lifted Miramon into power had been sustained hy the money of the clergy . It was reasonable to suppose that the hoards of wealth accumulated in the Church would continue to maintain it . Not s* , however . About the middle of Septemher , 1860 , the supply gave out . So Miramon , with no scruples certainly , and with but little fear of the consequences , resolved to seize upon ? 152,000 sterling , belonging to English bondholders , which had been deposited in the safes of the British Legation , doubly protected by the British flag and by the seals of the office bearing the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition . Under his orders Colonel Jauregni , at the head of a party of armed men , broke into the house of the Legation , and in spite of the English flag , English seals , and the protest of the Spanish Minister , who happened to be present , took away the ? 152,000 sterling deposited there for safe-keeping by the agent of the bondholders . About a month before this , Miramon had called together twenty-six capitalists , and had told them in pretty plain terms that he must have ? 100,000 , with which he undertook to whip General Ortega , who had defeated him forty days before near the town of Silao . But this money was not enough ; the Liberal army was pressing him on all sides ; his men were exasperated by their wants and defeats . So he resolved upon and accomplished the robbery of the house of the British Legation . This was substantially the ground of England 's complaints against Mexico . // 1866 . The Mexican Question . A year before this event occurred , September , 1859 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Paris with Spain , known as the Mon-Almonte treaty . This treaty recognized the validity of certain Spanish claims denied by the constitutional government . To understand the conditions of this treaty , it is necessary to bear in mind that the Mexican debt has always been divided into two branches , the internal and the external debt . The one is a privileged debt , the other subject to the fluctuations which have disturbed the government for the last forty years . The internal debt is made up of sums due to the citizens of Mexico , and the government has always held that nothing could divest it of its character of a debt essentially Mexican , and to be paid in any event . The Spanish government contended that the bonds of the foreign debt , bought by foreigners in the market at the lowest price , should be placed on the same footing with the privileged debt owed by the government to its own citizens . This demand had always been resisted hence arose a conflict between the two governments , which , in 1857 , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of payment of the whole Spanish debt . But the insurgents , in order to testify their gratitude to Spain , whose sympathy had been with them , authorized Almonte to comply with this claim , so that one of the results of the triumph of the reactionary party was the MonAlmonte treaty . Upon the overthrow of the insurrection , the treaty , of course , fell to the ground . The constitutional government gave notice that it could not recognize an yof the acts of the rebellion , and certainly not the treaty . This was substantially the ground of Spain 's complaint against Mexico . We now come to consider the Jecker Bond Contract , the pretext which France seized upon to justify her invasion of Mexico . Jecker was a needy Swiss banker , who came to Mexico to build up his fortune , and who in twenty years by foreign commerce had amassed three millions of pounds . In possession of a sum so considerable , he plunged into a variety of industrial schemes , and by his speculations in 1857 he became embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more embarrassed . That man was Miramon. // The Church was drained ; the Liberal army was on one side of him , his own rapacious troops on the other . With empty coffers he turned to Jecker for money . The two concocted a scheme to replenish the coffers of both . It was this . On the 29th of October , 1859 , a decree was published in the name of the re* actionary administration , creating a paper issue of ? 3,000,000 sterling . By the articles of this decree , the bonds issued by it were to be received in part payment of all taxes and duties which should be imposed . It was also provided that they should bear an annual interest of six per cent , . that half of the interest should be guaranteed for five years by the house of Jecker , and that the holders of old bonds could convert them into Jecker bonds by paying into the hands of Jecker a sum of twenty-five per cent for the " revalidation " of bonds of the old internal debt , twenty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , 1850 , and twenty-eight per cent for the bonds created by the famous Peza law . Jecker , then , was the banker whose signature was to authorize the issue of the bonds . ? 3,000,000 were to be issued by him , but the whole amount the sch*e was ever calculated to produce in the gross was but ? 750,000 . Of this sum Jecker , for conceiving and carrying out the brilliant idea , was to receive five per cent , or one twentieth of the total issue ; in other words , ? 150,000 . He was also to receive and hold the interest which was to be paid for the loan , which was ? 450,000 , so that in reality all that could ever get into the hands of Miramon , supposing that the contract had been carried out in accordance with the decree , was ? 150,000 . But the contract was not carried out according to the terms of the decree of October 29 , 1859 . It was violated by Jecker himself . It ' was modified to suit his convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to their interests , the agreements they signed ; but , above all , they materially altered the basis of the legislation under which they acted . Finally Jecker proposed , and Miramon accepted , a modification of the contract , by which the administration was to receive nominally the sum of ? 287,554 . Of this sum ? 123,785 only was to be hard cash ; the balance was made up of ? 73,600 for clothing furnished the army by Miramon 's nephew , of bonds , bills , credits , // - in fact , the scori* of all stock-jobbing operations in Mexico for the last forty years . For this sum the public treasury undertook the reimbursement of ? 3,720,000 . In other words , Miramon was mortgaging the public revenues of the country for an indefinite period , for the purpose of hiring money at the rate of about ninety per cent . The whole transaction shows that the contract was the desperate expedient of au expiring rebellion . It was not carried out , however , according to the last modification ; Jecker failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of May , 1860 , the house of Jecker suspended payment , and the bonds passed into the hands of his creditors . It is true that each of the allied powers made other charges against Mexico . In 1859 Marquez ordered the frightful massacre of Tacuhaya . On the 8th of April , this man , with six thousand soldiers and forty pieces of artillery , laid siege to that place . At noon the same day , Miramon made a junction with him . 1-laying carried the intrenchments and laid waste the village , they both went straight to the hospital , where the wounded of both sidcs lay huddled together . They found here seven surgeons , generous and devoted men . Marquez seized them , and in cold blood slaughtered them , together with all the wounded prisoners . Aimong these seven surgeons was one of English descent . But at the time the English Minister not only made no protest against the inhuman act , he did not think it worth the while to mention the *act ; and if the British government was afterwards informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the dismissal of M. Pacheco another ground of complaint . Jnarez entered the capital , January 11 , 1861 , and immediately afterwards gave sumnmary notice to the Spanish Ambassador , to the Papal Nunclo , and to the Ministers of Ecuador and Guatemala , to leave the Mexican territory , in consequence of their declared hostility to the lawful government . This act was rendered necessary by the circumstances , and justified by the conduct of the ambassadors . It in no way violated international law , for if governments may refuse admission into their territory to foreign agents on the ground of suspicion that they are in league with its enemies , afortiori they may // dismiss them when these suspicions by overt acts have been changed into certainty . It was to the lawful government established at Vera Cruz that M. Pacheco should have presented his credentials . Instead of doing so , he had chosen to remit them to the chief of the rebellion . He thus divested himself of his ambassadorial character , and became identified with the party whose fortunes he was bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two powers . She had another claim against Mexico . It was for the sum of $12,000,000 , being the grand total of all reclamations , good , bad , and indifferent , made on account of various alleged wrongs committed by Mexico up to the year 1861 . But it is evident that the seizure of the British bondholders ' money , the refusal to carry out the provisions of the Mon-Almonte treaty , and the plump repudiation of the Jecker contract , were the main pretexts upon which the three powers relied to justify their combined attack upon Mexico . With respect to these grounds of complaint there is this much to be said , applicable alike to all . They were the acts of an insurgent government , done while the constitutional government was in existence , and against its protest . They could not therefore be binding upon that government . The constitutional government , so long as it existed , repiesented the nation . It alone had power to make contracts , sign treaties , or issue decrees , and as a consequence hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of dispute . It becomes an imperative necessity , therefore , to demonstrate that the real government had succumbed under the assaults of the reactionary party , before France , England , and Spain can be justified in their course . As the last two powers haveleft France alone to carry on the war , it becomes necessary to say a few words more about the Jecker contract . It is readily seen that it was a transaction between the firm of Jecker and a revolutionary party , undertaken for the purpose of subverting the legitimate government . Jecker , therefore , committed the grave fault of contracting witim an insurrection incapable of contracting . The whole thing was void ab initio . As a result , if the rebellion failed , Jecker must go down with it , for no government could be compelled to pay // a debt contracted for the purpose of enabling an insurgent party to make war against it . Though , therefore , the Minister of France at Mexico , M. de Saligny , asserted it to be an undisputed principle , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize international engagements undertaken by them , he overlooked the very important fact upon which the whole thing hinged ; namely , that the administration of Miramon was not recognized by Mexico as a government at all , but as an unsuccessful insurrection . In spite , however , of these pretexts , put forth with so much parade , the progress of events in Mexico has developed with unexpected clearness the real cause of European intervention . The rebellion of 1857 ' had been put down . The constitutional government had been established , and with it the reforms that had taken from the Church party so much of its wealth and so many of its privileges . What was the next step of this party ? As a last resort , they determined to seek the aid of foreign intervention , hoping by some fortunate turn of events to build up a monarchy upon the ruins of the republic , and , by placing upon tile throne a European prince , to obtain a repeal of the odious laws . For this purpose , Miramon , Alnlonte , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , that Mexico was incapable of self-government , and unfitted for free institutions . The idea which they sought to convey was , th ' * t that country was so weary of agitation , that there would be no difficulty to be met with ; that , as soon as a European flag should appear *n its shores , there would be a general uprising , and that tile prince who should be sent there would be received with acclamation , and would ascend a perfectly solid throne . Thus they gradually prepared the way for foreign intervention , while they used means to render intervention inevitable . They did what they set to work to do . Five months after the beginning of tile expedition against Mexico , May 27 , 1862 , the London Times says : " We now understand the origin of the whole affair . The monarchy with the Archduke Maximilian for Emperor was the idea of certain Mexican refugees , meinhers of the reactionary or clerical party in Mexico , and partisans of Marquez and other ruffians whose misdeeds have been among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to Mexico , he will find his most active friends among the men who have shot , tortured , and robbed until Europe has lost its patience . " That French intervention had been thought of , and had been finally brought about , by the reactionary party , appears more clearly still from the protest of the supreme tribunal of Mexico addressed to the regency because that body had refused to repeal the laws of the Liberal government aimed at the Church . This tribunal alleges that these laws " are wanting in the most essential thing , justice , and to put them into practice it was necessary to have recourse to the ominous means of force . To avoid them , and far that reason only , the Mexican people were obliged to recur to the last extreme , the last supreme effort left them , and that was to solicit aid from a foreign land . And when France extended hers she understood their true position , and felt the evils that surrounded them , helping to apply the remedy . " As this party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms of the Spanish Cortes , wrested Mexico from that power , it now for the same purpose sought by means of foreign intervention to bring Mexico back to a monarchical rule . The three powers having for the reasons alleged by them agreed to invade Mexico , the next thing to do was to sign a convention . In October , 1861 , this was done in London . This convention provided that the contracting powers should send equal naval forces , and that the number of troops should be proportioned to the number of their subjects resident in Mexico . It is to be observed , that the powers solemnly declared in this acreement , that they would not meddle in the politics of the country , but only demand the sums due to European governments and to individuals . It was then provided that , in case of refusal , they should take possession of Mexican ports , one half of whose revenues should go to liquidate their claims , and the other half be left to the Mexican government . The ports were not to be occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three squadrons were to take measures to secure a settlement of the demands claimed , but neither of them had power to bargain for special privileges . An effort was to be made to pacify the different factions ; but the Mexicans were to be left free in the choice of the government . // Upon the signing of the convention active preparations were at once commenced by the allied powers . The whole thing was managed so adroitly by France , that the other two governments did not know , until after the expedition was begun , what was demanded by that nation of Mexico . In fact , the ultimatum of France was not drawn up till after the arrival of the expedition at Vera Cruz. * Two of its clauses were at once contested , Articles I. and III . These articles were as follows - " Art . 1 . Mexico engages to pay France a sum of $ 12,000,000 , at which amount are calculated the total French demands consequent upon events which have occurred up to July last , with the exceptions stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Article III . Mexico shall be held to the full loyal and immediate execution of the contract concluded in the month of February , 1859 , between the Mexican government and the firm of Jecker . " As soon as Lord Russell was informed of these demands by Sir Charles Wyke , he wrote to the English Ambassador at Paris : " It is surely not possible that reclamations so excessive as $ 12,000,000 in mass , and without detailed accounts , and that $ 18,000,000 for $ 750,000 received , can have been made with any hope of their being entertained . " General Prim took the same view of the matter . M. Thouvenel hastened , by a despatch sent February 28 , 1862 , to M. de Saligny , to soften down the absolute nature of the demand . Although he contended that no one of the three powers had the right to exercise a binding control over the claims presented by any of them , he instructed M. de Saligny to be less exacting in the point of the Jecker contract , if it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diP ferent countries . But it had already made a disagreement , Spain and England thinking alike , and in opposition to France . This disagreement was the natural result of events . In France the ideas of the Mexican exiles had been received with great favor . It was thought that it was possible not only to pacify Mexico , but to establish a monarchical government there with a European prince . England had no such idea . And when // Spain , dreaming of the grandeurs of a monarchy in Mexico represented by a Bourbon prince , wanted to join in the scheme , and opened negotiations with the English Cabinet , she was told in the most formal manner that England wished only to hold the ports of Tampico and Vera Cruz . France , on the other hand , did not tell her that they should confine themselves to holding Tampico and Vera Cruz . They entered into the monarchical ideas of Spain , but they gave her to understand that they could not adopt a Spanish prince . This cooled dowex the ardor of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , and agreed with England that the claim specified in Article uT. of the ultimatum of France " was not one of those engagements which deserved such protection as that it should be necessary to lay down the execution of it as one of the conditions of the ultimatum. " * On the afternoon of January 6 , 1862 , the allied squadrons arrived at Vera Cruz . On the 7th , the troops were disembarked , the English landing 800 men , the French 2,800 , and the Spaniards 6,300 . On the 9th , General Prim , who took command of the expedition , occupied Yera Cruz and the castle of San Juan de Ulloa . The next day a proclamation was issued , in which it was announced that the expedition was not for the purpose of conquest , or to revolutionize the country , but to see that justice was done and protection afforded to citizens of foreign nations . Having landed these troops , and issued this proclamation , the allies came to a dead halt . The Mexicans did not oppose their advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To conquer Mexico with a force which hardly reached ten thousand men was an absurdity . To advance to the capital over a difficult road , occupied by a vigilant enemy , was impracticable . To remain where they were and subject themselves to the vomito , sure to be fatal to unacehimated strangers , was suicidal . What was to be done ? Beside , General Prim saw that the people of Europe had been deceived . The monarchical party , which was to rise on the first appearance of the European flag , made no sign whatever . What lie did // see was a marked movement of the country in favor of Juarez , because he was threatened by foreign nations . Already the Spaniards had two thousand sick , and the number was increasing every day . Something must be done . The allies therefore entered into negotiations . General Prim was entrusted with the management of the affair . He agreed to meet the Mexican General Doblado at the little village of La Soledad . From this meeting originated the famous convention known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Count de Rens for Spain , afterwards approved by Sir Charles Wyke and Admiral Dunlop , and finally accepted provisionally by the representative of France . This treaty displays great diplomacy on the part of Mexico . It allowed , it is true , the allies to leave the pestiferous shores of Vera Cruz , and to occupy the highlands of Orizaba . But this advantage was a seeming one , for , if negotiations ceased , they were to retire to their original position . But what is more to the point , it was an acknowledgment on the part of the allies that the government of Juarez was the de facto government ; it allowed the flag of Mexico to float beside the flags of Spain , England , and France ; and above all , it gave time to Juarez . The convention in Mexico astonished the cabinets at home . Both England and Spain at first objected to some of its stipulations . But in the end the Spanish Cortes gave its unreserved approval of the course pursued by General Prim , and J*ord Russell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiation . M. Thouvenel , however , did not regard matters in the same light . It was not according to the programme of Napoleon . French troops had been sent to Mexico to fight , not to negotiate . What he demanded was not only redress for wrongs , but a government that would give guaranties for the future . Further negotiations had been postponed till the 15th of April . In the mean time , Almonte , the most active agent of the monarchical party in Europe , came to Vera Cruz . On his arrival he announced that lie had received a commission to re-establish a monarchy in Mexico in favor of an Austrian prince . Sir Charles Wyke , who was always exact in following his instructions , asked him in the name of what government he spoke ? Certainly not in his , for he had orders quite to the contrary . // General Prim declared quite as positively that Spain had no such ideas . Almonte replied that he had the confidence of the French government , and that he acted by the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did not look much like settling grievances by negotiation , when at the same time the allies received into their camp a man who at once announced his intention to revolutionize the country . It became evident that the representatives of France had received special orders , and that these orders were favorable to the plans of Almonte . They refused to exclude him from their camp , at the command of Juarez , and , finding that this refusal was considered by General Prim and Admiral Dunlop as a violation of the convention , they left Tehuacan without consulting them . A conference was requested at Orizaba . Angry altercations took place between the leaders . M. de Saligny did not pretend to conceal the fact that he had never wished to negotiate with Juarez , and that he had always been of the opinion that a monarchy should be established in Mexico . The result was a separation , on the 9th of April , 1862 . The English and Spanish forces embarked at once , and left the French alone in Mexico . It is plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew anything about when the convention was signed in London , which had been broken by Jecker himself , and was therefore void , which had been made with an unsuccessful insurrection and therefore was not binding on the constitutional government , was the prime cause of the rupture between the three powers . The disagreement began in Mexico . The first thing that was done there was what ought to have been done before they started . Each party set forth its claims against Mexico . When these claims were added up , it was found that they amounted to the grand total of $40,000,000 . Now to demand of a nation $40,000,000 , when its whole yearly revenue never amounted to $ 10,000,000 , was somewhat embarrassing . The claimants were just in this state of embarrassment when M. de Saligny declares that this is not all , France has another demand , and produces the Jecker debt , by which $18,000,000 more were to be added . This was the beginning of the rupture . The real cause of the separation , behind and deeper than the refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico with a different purpose from that of England and Spain , namely , with the resolution of founding there a monarchy in favor of an Austrian prince . It may be that this separation was what was desired by France from the outset . At any rate , after the summary departure of the allies , she entered upon the conquest of Mexico with increased vigor , and with a more open purpose . Even the unfathomed Emperor permits us to see in a shadowy manner his object . General Forey is appointed commander-inchief of all the forces , and must advance on the capital without delay . Napoleon thinks it useful , as he is to be invested with military and political power , to make him acquainted with his ideas . They were as follows . " This is the line of conduct you are to pursue - 1 . To issue a proclamation on your arrival , the principal ideas of which will he indicated to you . 2 . To receive with the greatest kindness all Mexicans who may join you . 3 . To espouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is provisional until Mexico shall have declared its wishes ; to show a great respect for religion , hut to reassure at the same time the holders of national property . 4 . To supply , pay , and arm according to your ability the auxiliary Mexican troops ; to give them the chief part in combats he end to he attained is not to impose upon the Mexicans a form of government which will he distasteful to them , but to aid them to establish , in conformity with their wishes , a government which will have some chance of stability , and will assure to France the redress of the wrongs of which she complains It is not to be denied that , if they prefer a monarchy , it is in the interest of France to aid them in this path . Persons will not be wanting who will ask you why we propose to spend men and money to establish a regular government in Mexico . In the present state of the world 's civilization , Europe is not indifferent to the prosperity of America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to our commerce .

There is nothing left but to do it . He attacks Puebla , which Juarez had strongly fortified , and which in fact protected the capital . After repeated assaults the French carry the intrenchments , and rout Comonfort , whose disorganized army falls back pellmell upon the city . Forey follows , and enters Mexico amid tumultuous demoiistrations of joy from the clerical party and the French residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and his records , retreats to San Luis Potosi . Forey made his entry into the capital on the 12th of June , 1863 . In just four days from this time , M. de Saligny concocts for Mexico a system of government . To use his own words , it was the result of a long and deep study of the situation and necessities of the people . By some process which the Mexicans had not yet found out , it was to place the country far along upon the road of social and political regeneration , and dry up forever the sources of evil by which she had suffered . In this scheme the people of Mexico had no voice , it is true ; but that was impossible , for outside the city the whole country was in arms against the invaders . But the capital was enough for his purpose . That contained two hundred thousand inhabitants . Among them , M. de Saligny says , were the most illustrious citizens of the state , men of intelligence , accustomed to political life and public affairs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the centre of all the traitors to the cause of Mexican liberty ; it was the head-quarters of the reactionary party ; it was the citadel of that political and priestly cabal which had , for the last forty years , plotted against its rights . As the first step necessary to reconstruct Mexico , General Forey silences the press . This being done by the decree of the 16th of June , 1863 , he announced to the Mexican people the plan of government which is the result of the deep study of M. de Saligny . First , a superior Junta composed of thirty-five members was established . This Junta was to nominate a Regency composed of three citizens , to whom were given the executive power of the state . The Junta itself was divided into various committees to deliberate upon ministerial questions . In addition to this the Junta was to associate itself with two // hundred and fifteen other persons , and the two bodies together formed the Assembly of Notables , who were to decide upon the permanent government of Mexico . The decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the desired vote can not be obtained in three days ' balloting , the Assembly was to be dissolved , and a new one formed , to which members of the former were eligible . The Regency had the power of vetoing the acts of the Assembly . Now , as the Junta was appointed by forey , and as the Junta was to nominate both the Regency and the Assembly of Notables , upon the last of which bodies devolved the duty of declaring the permanent government of Mexico , it follows that the government to be established was nothing in fact but the government of the French Emperor , about which the Mexican people had absolutely nothing to say ; for , with all the deep study which M. de Saligny had given to the subject , the very obvious idea of consulting the views of the people never occurred to him . Forey at once nominated the thirty-five members of the Junta . It has been incorrectly stated that " representatives of all parties " were included in this Junta . It was composed of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected as the Regency the traitor Almonte , the Archbishop of Mexico , and Jos6 Mariano Salas . The Junta then undertook the organization of the Assembly of Notables , and although but two hundred and fifteen members were required , two hundred and fifteen men could not be found who could be trusted , and so the Assembly was never fully completed. * However , without waiting to comply with the terms of the decree , the Notables set to work on the 11th of July . It was a grave piece of irony to insert a clause in the decree , that the Assembly should be dissolved if they could not agree in three days ' balloting upon a form of government . It was a graver one to declare solemnly that a two-thirds vote was required . On the same day , by a unanimous vote , almost without discussion , they declared that the Mexican nation adopted as its form of government a limited hereditary monarchy with a Catholic prince , and that the crown should be offered to his Imperial Highness Maximilian of Aus // tria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maximilian should not accept , Napoleon was requested to indicate a substitute . On the 18th day of August , a deputation headed by Estrada , formerly Minister of Mexico to the court of Rome , left Vera Cruz for Miramar , to offer the Archduke the crown . In this whole proceeding there is nowhere found any intimation that the vote of the Assembly was to be ratified by a vote of the people . The decree of Forey , by which the Junta and Assembly of Notables were created , nowhere refers to an appeal to the people . The articles of this decree which relate to the form of government are thus stated : - " Art . 14 . The Assembly of Notables shall occupy itself especially with the form of the permanent government of Mexico . The vote on this question must be such that two thirds of the ballots cast , at least , shall be necessary for a decision . " " Art . 17 . The Notables shall occupy themselves , after having determined on the form of the permanent government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the executive department . " " Art . 23 . The functions of the executive department shall cease from the moment of the inauguration of the permanent government proclaimed by the Assembly of Notables. " * The Assembly of Notables , therefore , in their haste to fasten upon Mexico a monarchy , went a little out of the course laid down in the imperial programme . Under the spur of the same motive they made another seeming mistake . The Emperor , in his letter to General Forey , had said : - " When you shall have reached the city of Mexico , it is to be desired that the principal persons of all political shades who shall have embraced our cause should come to an understanding with you to organize a provisional government . The government will submit to the Mexican people the question of the political re'gime which is to be definitively established . " But the Assembly did nothing of the kind . They declared that the nation had adopted the monarcby as a permanent government . Consequently M. Drouyn do Lhuys hastened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be scrupulously followed . On the 17th of August , 1863 , he wrote : - // " We have noticed with pleasure , as a symptom of favorable augury , the manifestation of the Assembly of Notables in Mexico in favor of the establishment of a monarchy and the name of the prince called to the empire . But as I indicated to you in a former despatch , we can only consider the vote of this Assembly as a first indication of the inclinations of the country . With the great authority which attaehes to the men of mark which compose it , the Assembly recommends to its fellowcitizens the adoption of monarchical institutions and designates a prince for their suifrages . It is now the part of the provisional government to collect these suifrages . I shall not indicate to you the mode to adopt to completely obtain this indispensable result . It must be found in the institutions of the country and its local customs . " Words like these look well in a despatch , but the vote never was and never could be taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concealed purpose of France can be seen , always carried out , running along side by side with its declared purpose , never carried out and never intended to be carried out . The declared design , namely , the submission of the monarchical government to the suifrages of the Mexican people , was never afterwards thought of . In the mean time , buoyant with success , the Churchman Estrada and his party proceeded to Austria , and on the 3d of October , 1863 , obtained an interview with Maximilian . Estrada offered him the crown . The Archduke replied in conformity with the line of conduct traced by the French government : - " I am profoundly grateful for the wishes expressed by the Assembly of Notables . It can not be otherwise than flattering to our house , that the thoughts of your countrymen turn to the descendants of Charles T It is a proud task to assure the independence of Mexico under the protection of free and lasting institutions . I must , however , recognize the fact  --  and in this I entirely agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the regeneration of Mexico possible - that the monarchy can not be established in your country on a firm and legitimate basis , unless the whole nation shall confirm by a free manifestation of its will the wishes of the capital . My acceptance of the throne must then depend upon the result of the vote of the whole country . Further , a sentiment of the most sacred duties of the sovereign requires that he should demand for the proposed empire every necessary guaranty to secure it against the dangers which // threaten its integrity and its independence I beg of you to communicate these my intentions , frankly expressed , to your countrymen , and to take measures to obtain from the nation an expression of its will as to the form of government it intends to adopt . " With this coquettish reply Estrada and his associates were obliged to be content to return to Mexico . But meanwhile events had taken place in Mexico which compelled the Church party to take a new position . On the day that the Notables decided to offer Maximilian the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , the Regency should exercise the powers of sovereignty . Now that the French had possession of the capital , and had successfully inaugurated a government , chief among the ministers of which was the Archbishop of Mexico himself , the Church believed , and with the best grounds , that the laws made by the Liberals which had stripped them of their property would be repealed , and that their former influence in the state would be restored . But here a grand difficulty arose . This very property had been bought by numbers of French citizens . If the demanded restoration should be made , bankruptcy would follow . As France had pretended that one of its causes of intervention was to protect the rights of these people , it would hardly do , as one of its first acts , to take from them property to which they had a good title . It may be that Napoleon saw that his true position was not on the side of the Church party , - that , if he would " regenerate " Mexico , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working out a policy of his own , of which as yet no one knew the end , and which in its execution would trample alike on liberal and conservative . At any rate , he instructed the Regency not to annul the laws . So that , though he sent his army . to Mexico as an ally of the monarchical party and to set up a despotic government , by this act he placed himself exactly in the position of the Liberal party , to overthrow which the Church party had sought his aid . The issue between the government and clergy arose in this way . After the nationalization of the Church property certain suits were commenced upon notes given for the purchase of it , to the settlement of which the Church had interposed a variety // of obstacles , all tending to delay final action . In fact , under their influence the courts had hesitated to take jurisdiction of these suits . On the 24th of October , General Bazaine , who had succeeded Forey , ordered notice to be given officially to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and commanded the Regency to make such rules as would carry this order into effect . This proceeding of course woke up the opposition of the Church party . To acquiesce would be to abandon their cause . They did not by any means intend to do this . The Archbishop had weight enough to bring over Almonte partly to his way of thinking . He had a conference with Bazaine , and asked that the matter might be delayed till after the coming of Maximilian . Bazaine would not consent to this , and the Archbishop offered to give his reasons in writing , and left for that purpose . But , after preparing an elaborate argument , what was his surprise to find that the order had been issued by two members of the Regency before his conference with Bazaine , and was already in circulation . Bazaine had seen the influence of the Archbishop , and had thus summarily checked it . Now began the quarrel . The Archbishop at once declared the order null and void . The Regency in turn , under the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archbishop , being in open opposition , was no longer a part of it . The Archbishop replied , that he could not be removed ; that two members could not constitute the Regency in direct opposition to the terms of the decree which called it into being that the body was created for the purpose of deciding grave questions , and if , when these questions arose , he could not express an opinion , he asked for what purpose he occupied a place in that body . Bazaine answered , with military brevity , that his removal was reiidered necessary by the attitude he took , and that the course adopted was the only way of avoiding this interruption to the grand march of events ; and on the 15th of December , without more ado , removed all obstacles to rights of action respecting the claims concerning which the quarrel had begun ; The Archbishop , having interrupted the march of events , which meant in Mexico opposition to the Napoleonic plan , was set aside , and at the same time politely asked by Bazaine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // to fight Juarez , or , to use his own words , to " pacify and regenerate Mexico . But neither the Archbishop nor the clergy did keep quiet . On the 26th of December they published a lengthy protest , in which in lugubrious terms they set forth their grievances , fob lowed on the 31st by one from the Supreme Tribunal . The iRegency took no further notice of the bishops , but by a decree of the 2d of January , 1864 , they turned out all the judges , as by refusing , in spite of the order of Bazaine , to take cognizance of the causes specified , they also interrupted the grand march of events , and then , on the 21st , in a manifesto addressed to the Mexican people , some of whom were highly elated with this new phase of affairs , they command them to be perfectly tranquil , declaring that they had only freed Mexico from the tyranny of a court which had proved reereant to its trust , which had forgotten nothing and had learned nothing , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , a country whose dissensions " were conducting it to certain ruin when the powerful hand of the Emperor Napoleon was stretched out to arrest it on the fatal decline . " After the fall of Puebla and the entry into Mexico organized resistance on the part of Juarez had ceased . For though the Mexican army still formed a large body , it was made up for the most part of detached bands , under slight discipline and badly supplied with the material of war . Their strength lay rather in their complete knowledge of the country , and in their ability to harass the troops of the enemy . The French , on the contrary , commenced the year with renewed vigor . They already held central Mexico , and the line between Vera Cruz and the capital . They were now getting ready to extend their dominion west and north . The Liberals were still in possession of the Pacific coast and southern Mexico . But their seat of government changed as the army , which was gradually retreating towards Monterey , moved . At Monterey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His position was a peculiar one . He professed to be a Liberal , and held the office of Governor under the constitutional government , but he took no // pains to conceal his hatred to Juarez . His hate was more than a match for his patriotism . On the approach of the Liberal army lie declared against Juarez and escaped to the capital . The cause of Juarez certainly had a bad look . Defeat and defection make any cause look ill . The French press in Mexico were all the time writing France up and writing Juarez down . His own generals were despondent . Even Doblado advised him to resign , as the only way to obtain peace . He did not resign , however . He declared it his duty to strnggle for his country , and lie inspirited the army to continue the war against the enemy . He had that persistence of character which is the salvation of many a cause which looks hopeless . Let us turn to another part of the French programme . It was high time for Estrada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer the hope of the Church . The clerical party was in a very bad way . Intervention had been as bitter a pill to them as to their old enemies , the Libcrals . They had the added mortification that it was brought about by their instrumentality . But Maximilian being a good Catholic , it was hoped , if the clerical party put forth their efforts , he would repeal the hated laws and restore the Church to its pristine power . The deputation arrived a second time at Miramar on the 10th of April , and at once proceeded to the business before it . Estrada made a very fair case . He applied himself to overcoming the objections raised by Maximilian at the last conference . He asserted that , though it was impossible to take a vote of the people , yet the st*mission of the country to the French arms and the consent of the municipal corporations were tantamount to such a vote . But the Archduke 's scruples had been done away with long before the expiratiou of the six months by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . The crown of Mexico was duly accepted . Maximilian said - " Mature examination of the acts of adhesion you have come to lay before me affords me the assurance that the resolution of the Notables , which brought you the first time to Miramar , is confirmed by an immense majority of your compatriots , and that I may with good right consider myself the legitimate elect of the Mexican people . I am thus cuabled to fulfil the promise I made six'months ago , and I now solemnly declare // 1&amp;A ) The illexican Que8tion . July , that , with the aid of the Almighty . I accept the crown at the hands of the Mexican nation which tenders it to me . " He then declared that he should place the monarchy under the safeguard of constitutional laws , and asked all Mexicans who love their country to aid him in the accomplishment of his splendid but difficult task . Finally he directed Estrada to stop at IRome on his way to Mexico , and receive " at the hands of the holy father those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid shouts of " God save Maximilian the First " from Estrada and his party , while salvos of artillery peeled from the castle of Trieste . After this Maximilian signed the acceptance of the crown of Mexico ; but , what was more significant , he entered into a convention with France , among the articles of which were the following : - " Art . II . The French troops at present in Mexico shall be reduced as soon as possible to a corps of twenty thousand men , including the Foreign Legion . This corps , in order to guard the interest which led to the intervention , shall temporarily remain in Mexico on the conditions laid down in the following articles . " Art . 2 . The troops shall evacuate Mexico in proportion as the Emperor of Mexico shall be able to reorganize the troops necessary to replace them . " Art . 3 . The Foreign Legion in the service of France shall nevertheless remain in Mexico six years after all the other French troops shall have been recalled . " 4 After the settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having there received the benediction of the Pope , with his wife started for Mexico , the Land of the Sun , which Cortez , almost three hundred and fifty year.s before , under his ancestor , Charles V. , had taken from the Aztecs and given to Spain . He reached Vera Cruz , May 28th , and , without stopping , proceeded at once to Orizaba . It was to be expected , if Estrada had told the truth , that the most uiirestrained enthusiasm would accompany him in his progress . But the Mexican people , with the exception of the clergy and the French residents , exhibited the greatest apathy . At last , from the vale of Puebla , Maximilian ascends the ridge of mountains which separates him from the city . As he turns the edge of the Cordilleras , the valley of Mexico , ten thousand feet // above the level of the sea , is at once revealed to him in all its indescribable loveliness . He goes over the same ground troddcii by the feet of Cortez and his followers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conquest . He entered the capital with a pomp seldom seen . Amid the clangor of bells and the roar of artillery , the imperial cort6ge wound its way through streets spanned with arches , and adorned with the flags of all nations , to the Cathedral . There the solemn services were to be performed which should consecrate the new government . But it was observed that it was the Church party and its adherents that caused all the enthusiasm . Among the multitude of mottoes and inscriptions borne by them , and scattered over the city , the political influence to be attempted upon Maximilian was apparent . He was apostrophized , not as the founder of a new dynasty , but as the defender of the faith and the bulwark of the Catholic Church . The ceremonies ended , Maximilian sat himself down to his " splendid but difficult task . " He attempted two things , neither of which was successful . He tried to improve the finances of the country , and he invited Juarez and other Republican leaders to meet him at the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire . The finances certainly needed oversight . They were in a chaotic state . No revenue flowed into the public treasury , and none was likely to . A committee was appointed , to whom the grave question was referred . But the committee did no good . They were unable to grapple with so hard a question . If they had been men of financial ability , it would have been pretty difficult work to squeeze from the Mexican treasury a quarter part of the money required . As it was , they went to discussing general principles . It was easier to do this than to solve the knotty problems set before them . The result was , that the Emperqr was accused of appointing them as a pretext for establishing despotic rule , on the ground that popular bodies could not deal with practical questions . The attempt to bring over the Liberal leaders met with no better success . All of them refused to hold any communication with the " agent of Napoleon . " Juarez replied to the invitation with great dignity : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city whither you yourself // are about to proceed , to the end that we may there have a conference , in conjunction with other Mexican chiefs who are now in arms , promisino ' us all the force necessary for an escort in the transit , and pledging as security your public faith , your word , and your hondr . It is impossible for me to accede to this call ; my official occupation will not admit of it . But if in the exercise of my public functions I could accept such an invitation , the public faith , the word and honor of an agent of Napoleon , the perjured , would not he sufficient , - of a man whose safety reposes in the hands of Mexican traitors , and of a man who at this moment represents the cause of one of the parties who signed the treaty of Soledad . " It has been seen that the reactionary party had not met with much success in their contest with the Regency . The Archbishop had been disposed of , the Supreme Tribunal had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lib-. erals in the confiscation of Church property . They were be*unn*n g to think that foreign intervention was a great mistake . To sustain their privileges , they had disturbed Mexico from the time of Iturbide ; to sustain them still , they now debated another overturn in this grand theatre of revolution . One hope only remained to them . Maximilian was a strong Catholic . He reverenced the Church . With this lever they hoped to induce him to annul the acts of Bazaine , to annul the acts of the Liberal party , to make them what they must be , if anything , the ruling power in the state . From his entry into the capital , they therefore paid sedulous court to him . But to no purpose . However much Maximilian may have desired it , " the march of events " would not permit him to come in conflict with the policy of the Regency . His decision , after all , may have been based upon the belief that the Liberals were the strongest party , and his desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others to unite with him for the consolidation of the empire . One more resort was open to the clerical party . In October , at their intercession , the Pope of Rome sent to Maximilian a letter , through his Nuncio , Meglia . In this letter the Pope writes to Maximilian as follows : - " SIRE , - When in the month of April last , before assuming the reins of the new empire , your Majesty arrived at this capital , in order to // , ) i : ) worship at the tombs of the holy Apostles and to receive our benediction , we informed you of the deep sorrow which filled our soul by reason of the lamentable state into which the social disorders during these last years have reduced all that concerns religion in the Mexican nation . Before that time , and more than once , we had made known our complaints in public and solemn acts protesting against the iniquitous law , called the law of reform , which attacked the most inviolable rights of the Church ,  --  agninst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrimony . " The Pope then asks him to put his hand to the holy work and repeal the laws . For this purpose he sends his Nuncie . He tells him that , in order to reform the evils inflicted by the revolution , and bring back happy days for the Church , he must restore the Catholic religion , to the exclusion of all others ; that the Bishops must be perfectly free in the exercise of their diities ; that religious orders must be established in conformity with instructions from the Pope ; that Church property , and the rights , which attach thereto , must be restored and protected and that all instruction , public and private , must be directed and watched over by the ecclesiastical authorities . For the sake of form , merely , Maximilian opened negotiations with the Nuncio . The Nuncio told him that he brought no special instructions from the Pope . However , the Emperor submitted to him four propositions to be submitted to the Pope , which he had already determined to enact into laws . 1st . Ratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d . The institution of the civil contract of marriage , instead of the religious one . 3d . Liberty of worship . 4th . Endowment of the clergy by the state . It will be seen that the first three of these propositions had been enacted by the constitutional government . The last one had been rejected , on the ground that , where liberty of worship existed , it was not necessary for the state to support the clergy . Maximilian , however , did not wait for any further correspondence from the Pope . Before the departure of the Nuncio he directed the Minister of Justice to frame the laws decided upon . In August Maximilian set out on a tour of observation through the country held by the French . Before he went away , he did one thing which showed the action of liberal // ideas ; he removed the restrictions from the press . On his return he did another thing , which indicated the character of the war and the designs of France : he determined to treat all opponents of the monarchy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conclusion , as he alleged , from observation that his government was based upon the will of an immense majority of the people , and that this m*ajority desired above all things peace . Up to this time he had shown leniency , now he must protect the nation with an iron arm . lie therefore commanded " all functionaries , magistrates , and military authorities " to annihilate the Liberals by all means in their power . There can not be the slightest excuse for the promulgation of so barbarous a mandate . It was against the laws of war . But it was the legitimate result of what was intended fi-om the beginning , - the determination to crush out all attempts to restore liberty in Mexico . The government of Maximilian has been recognized by the powers of Europe . It was hoped by Napoleon that by this time it would staiid alone . Will it ever stand alone ? Let us see . It has lost the support of the party that has for forty years made and unmade governments in Mexico , and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotting to overturn this its last work . The people are against it . Juarez , their representative , retreating and fighting with no idea of submission , still struggles with an undaunted tenacity of purpose . If we believe the French press , the Liberals were conquered in 1864 . If we trust to the French Minister , resistance , localized at some points , has now lost all national color . It has become but a question of brigandage , which will be readily put down by a well-organized system of police . If we rely upon events , it is seen that Maximilian requires as large an army as ever in order to hold his place on the throne . But the one thing more alarming than all the rest is the state of his finances . Before Maximilian left for Mexico he signed a contract at Miramar between himself and Napoleon . After providing that the French troops in Mexico shall be reduced as soon as possible to a corps of twenty thousand men including the Foreign // Legion , and that the Foreign Legion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall nevertheless remain in 1*fexico six years after all the other French troops shall have been recalled , it stipulates as follows : - " Art . 7 . So long as the requirements of the French corps d*arm 6e shall necessitate a tn-monthly service of transports between France and Vera Cruz , the expense of said service , fixed at the sum of 400,000 francs per voyage going and returning , shall be paid by Mexico . " " Art . 9 . The expenses of the French expeditioa to Mexico , to be paid by the Mexican government , are fixed at the sum of 270,000,000 francs for the whole duration of the expedition down to the first day of July , 1864 . This sum shall bear interest at the rate of five per cent . From the 1st of July all the expenses of the French army shall be at the charge of Mexico . " " Art . 10 . The indemnity to be paid to France by the Mexican government for the pay and maintenance of the troops of the corps d'arm6e after the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of one thousand francs a year for each man . " " Art . 14 . The Mexican government engages to indemnify French subjects for the wrong they have unduly suffered , and which was the original cause of the expedition . " In additiou to this , he had to pay his own current expenses , ( for after the first day of July , 1864 , the whole burden fell upon him , ) which , according to the official paper of the capital , would amount to the sum of $40,000,000 per annum. * Now what had Maximilian with which to meet this debt as it became due ? He could not tax the people . The official gazette admitted that there was but little money in the country , and that it would be useless to attempt it . He must depend upon the revenue , or make a loan . What are the revenues of Mexico ? M. do Aranriez , formerly Minister of Finance , made a report to Maximilian upon this extremely interesting question . From this report it is evident that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more than ten or eleven millions of dollars . So disheartened was Maximilian by this financial embarrassment , that he sent a letter to Napoleon asking the assistance We have not taken into account in this estimate the claim of England , amounting to about $ 16,800,000 , or the Spanish claim , amounting to about $8,000,000 , both of which must be paid , if France succeeds in establishing Maximilian . // of practical business-men to establish the credit of his government , and he afterwards sent Don Eustaquio Barron to Europe to raise funds . In 1864 the French government attempted to raise the first loan for him of 120,000,000 francs ; and supposing he got the whole of it , be had already , in the shape of current expenses , interest , &amp;c. , a debt of 125,000,000 francs , which must be paid . But if it was necessary to raise this loan in 1864 , it will be necessary to raise another , and still another , until the bubble bursts , for the country is no more selfsustaining to-day than it was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present year it was asserted " that the imperial government had exhausted the last loan , and that it is existing upon the precarious receipts daily collected from all quarters . So serious are the necessities of the government , that but a short time ago Marshal Bazaine , acting , it is said , upon orders received from France , loaned out of the French funds in this country $ 300,000 to the Emperor . " Of such momentous importance is this financial matter , that the present Minister of Finance announced semi-officially that the existence of the government depended on the success of a new loan . Before the new loan can be effected , however , Napoleon must convince the capitalists who are to lend , that their money will be safe . To do this he must show them that the work of pacification is going on , that all parties are gradually rallying round him , and that the government will be self-sustaming . But Mexico is not pacified , and the Liberal army is not crushed . Letters received from the capital as late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state that , according to calculations made from official reports , there were fought during the first seven months following the arrival of Maximilian , between the Liberals and the Imperialists , one hundred and twenty-two battles , in which 1,300 men were wounded and 3,277 killed . That'during the year 1865 the number of engagements reached three hundred and twenty-two , in which 1,279 were wounded and 5,674 were reported as killed . The total number of battles , therefore , fought since Maximilian bad accepted " from the majority of the Mexican nation the voluntary offer of the throne , " a period of only nineteen months , is // four hundred and forty-four , in which 2,650 were wounded and 8,951 killed . Two facts appear from these statements . The contest is growing more deadly . From the small number reported as wounded in comparison with the number killed , it is evident no quarter is given to the wounded . Juarez is able to carry on a constant and stubborn warfare . In addition to this , it appears from the same sources that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of life by executions is even greater than that in battle . If the negotiation of the new loan depends upon the fact that Maximilian is pacifying Mexico , it will never be made . The only thing that remains , therefore , if the loan fails , is to make a forced loan from the Mexican people , - a result by no means improbable , and of which they stand in great fear . It is well understood , that through a long period , up to the end of the year 1860 , the power of the United States and the sentiment of the people in respect to foreign interference in American affairs was sufficient to protect Mexico against foreign aggression . It is just as well understood , that the time of the rebellion in the United States was seized upon by France as opportune to begin its attack upon Mexico . The expedition follows close upon the heels of the rebellion . Our government , intent upon putting this rebellion down , and to the eyes of European governments deprived of its weight thereby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any conquests planned by them . Nevertheless , explanations were at once required of France by the United States as to the objects proposed by it . France answered , that it was a war for the redress of grievances ; that she did not intend permanently to remain in or occupy Mexico , and that she should leave to the people a free choice of their institutions of government . This is the language which the French government , through its minister , held then , and has held to this day . To be sure , it does not agree with the ideas expressed in the letter of Napoleon to Forey . If that letter can be understood , the great object of the expedition was to restore to the Latin race its former prestige on this continent , as an offset to the development of the Anglo-Saxon . This object was to be attained , not by imposing on the Mexican people a government obnoxious to them , but // by assisting them to establish a stable one , which would yield to France all she demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Napoleon , " that , if the Mexicans prefer a monarchy , it is for the interest of France to support them in that path . " In spite , however , of facts , the United States have assumed that France was honest in her assertions . As a government , it perhaps could not as yet do otherwise . If it were simply a war for the redress of grievances , the United States must remain neutral . In the despatches of September 26 , 1863 , to Mr. Dayton , and of October 9 , 1868 , to Mr. Motley , Mr. Seward gives a very clear and concise view of the principles which determined the course of the government at that time toward France and Mexico . He says : - " The United States hold in regard to these two states and their conflict the same principle that they hold in relation to all other nations and their mutual wars . They have neither a right nor a disposition to intervene by force in the internal affairs of Mexico , whether to establish or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government there , or to overthrow an imperial or a forei * n one , if Mexico shall choose to establish or accept it . The United States have not the right nor the disposition to intervene by force on either side of the lamentable war which is going on between France and Mexico . On the contrary , they practise in regard to Mexico , in every phase of the war , the non-intervention which they require all foreign powers to observe in regard to the United States . " Mr. Seward says , however : - " This government believes that all foreign resistance to American civilization , and all attempts to control it , must and will fail before the ceaseless and ever-increasing activity of material , moral , and political forces which peculiarly belong to the American continent Nor do we practise reserve upon the point that , if France should , upon due consideration , determine to adopt a policy in Mexico adverse to the American opinions and sentiments which I have described , that policy would probably scatter seeds which would be fruitful of jealousies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , and other American republics . " This being the position , th United States was compelled to determine these material questions , - which government it would reco*nize as the de facto government of Mexico , and the // more grave one , whether France conformed to the principles upon which it declared the war was undertaken and carricd on . The first question it decided at once . It recognized only the Juarez government . This decision has remained unchanged . When M. Drouyn de Lhuys , in October , 1863 , stated to Mr. Dayton at Paris that the dangers of Maximilian 's government would come principally from the United States , and the sooner that government showed a willingness to enter into peaceful relations with it , the sooner France would be ready to leave Mexico ; and that an early recognition would tend to end all fears of troublesome complications with France , Mr. Seward replied , that France knows that the opinion here is that the establishment of a monareby in Mexico is neither easy nor desirable ; that the United States can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have no desire to interfere in their choice of a government ; that Mexico must as yet be regarded as the theatre of a war which has not ended in the subversion of the government long existing there ; and that " the United States , consistently with their principles , can do no otherwise than leave the destinies of Mexico in the keeping of her own people , and recognize their sovereignty and independence in whatever form they themselves shall choose that this sovereignty and independence shall be manifested . " It is interesting to trace the gradual solution of the other question . We believe that it will be found to have been dependent on the conviction , held from Monroe 's time down , that the successful career of the United States intimately depends upon the continuance of free institutions throughout the American continent , - on the further belief , " that the inherent normal opinion of Mexico favors a government there republican in form and democratic in its organization in preference to any monarchical institution to be imposed upon it , " - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against French intervention . In April , 1864 , the House of Representatives declared , by a unanimous vote , against the recognition of the Mexican Emperor . Mr. Seward , April *T , sent a copy of this resolution to Mr. Dayton , and at the same time said , " It is hardly necessary , after what I have written with perfect candor for the information of France , to say that the resolution truly interprets // the unanimous sentiment of the people " ; but that the decision of this question belonged to the Executive , and whether he was prepared to express himself so bluntly was quite another matter . It however caused a good deal of uneasiness in France , and was the occasion of a circular from the Minister of Foreign Affairs in explanation ; but in the debate in the Corps Legislatif which followed upon it , May 12 , M. Rouher , Minister of State , said that the real reason that induced the resolution was perfectly well understood by all acquainted with American affairs . " A Presidential contest is in progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is strong for popularity ; and some think they will attain their purpose by opposing the new American establishment . " In spite of all that had been said in the despatches of Mr. Seward , this was accepted by the Corps Legislatif as the true reason of the vote. * From this time the course to be pursued by the United States becomes plain . There can be no doubt now as to the policy of Napoleon , however much lie may assert that all he wants is a redress of grievances . In November , 1865 , Mr. Seward wrote to Mr. Bigelow : - " The presence and operations of a French army in Mexico , and its maintenance of an authority there resting upon force and not upon the free will of the people of Mexico , is a cause of serious concern to the United States . Nevertheless , the objection of the United States is still broader , and includes the authority itself which the French army is thus maintaining . . . . . They still regard the effort to establish permanently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again , in December , he says that the real cause of discontent prevailing in the United States in regard to Mexico is not understood . The chief cause is not that there is a foreign army in Mexico . The right of sovereign nations to carry on war is recognized . " The real cause of national discontent is , that the French army which is now in Mexico is invading a domestic republican government there which was established by her people , and with which the United States sympathize most profoundly , // 1*i for the avowed purpose of suppressing it and establishing upon its ruins a foreign monarchical government . " This is pretty plain talking , and we are therefore not surprised when , on the 16th of the same month , he writes as fob lows - " It has been the President 's purpose that France should be respectfully informed upon two points , viz. - " First . That the United States earnestly desire to continue and to cultivate sincere friendship with France . " Second . That this policy would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her interest and honor to desist from the prosecution of armed intervention in Mexico , to overthrow the domestic republican government existing there , and to establish upon its ruins the foreign monarchy which has been attempted to be inaugurated in the capital of that country . " Very decided results followed these plain words . M. Drouyn do Lhuys declared that the Emperor was willing to withdraw from Mexico , and asked some assurance that , in that event , the United States would recognize the government of Maximilian as a de facto power . This was precisely what the United States had refused to do from the beginning , and what it refuses to do now . On the 22d of January of this year came Napoleon 's speech to the French legislature , which , though studiedly ambiguous , intimates plainly enough that his Mexican policy must be changed . He is in fact coming to an understanding with Maximilian for the recall of French troops without compromising French interests ; and M. Salliard is despatched without credentials and without documents to tell the Archduke that Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time has arrived when he must depend on his own resources without the help of the French army . On the 5th of April , and as a result of the letter of Mr. Seward to the Marquis do Montholon of February 12th , it was officially announced that the French troops should evacuate Mexico in three detachments , the first to depart in November , 1866 , the second in March , 156T , and the third in November of the same year . There can be no doubt that Napoleon would have hesitated to embark in the expedition , if the restoration of the American // Union had not appeared at the time of its inception exceedingly problematical . In this he committed a great error ; and it is evident that for some time his aim has been to escape from his position iu such a way as to conceal from the sensitive cars of France the chilling sound of his retreating footsteps . The ability , judgment , and skill with which Mr. Seward has conducted the correspondence with France on these difficult and delicate questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and brought about a result in the highest degree satisfactory , deserve the gratitude not only of our own people , but of the Mexicans as well . The Mexican question , so far as the establishment of a foreign monarchy is concerned , is obviously approaching its solution .
