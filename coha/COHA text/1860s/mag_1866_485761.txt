' Study , " in whose atmosphere at the first rising of the curtain there is more geniality than light . An interesting literary contribution is that of Mr. Conway 's , in which he lays the wandering newspaper ghost of that " pall-bearer of William Shakspere " who was buried in Virginia . The stone seems to have been found , and the erased inscription recovered from a soldier 's diary . The date , 1618 , makes it our oldest known epitaph . But there is nothing said of the funeral at Stratford . General McCiellan 's paper on the militia is the most important in the number , in public interest . That it advocates a new army and militia is a matter of course , and General McClellan gives his advice in detail as to its formation , composition , training , and disposition in the different parts of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not uncommon ones , and are certainly to be admitted as valid for a reform of some sort in our system of defence and armed national police , though perhaps so complete a system as he argues for may be a matter of army logic rather than civil necessity . One reason only we note as unusual , and it is to be observed that it is given in connection with a prophecy of a speedy restoration of our mercantile navy . Then , says General McClellan , " we will begin to ask ourselves by what right a foreign nation holds a cordon of fortified naval stations commanding so many avenues of approach to our shores , and enabling it to cut off our vessels in the event of war . " He refers to Halifax , the Bermudas , Nassau , and Jamaica ; and clinches his comment by deAaring that had we possessed the Bermudas and Nassau the civil war would have been shortened " by some two years .

The prediction of cold waves by the Signal Service is one of the most practical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual householder who shakes down and covers over his own furnace , as well as the larger interests of the dealers who ship cattle by the carload from the West , and the requirements of the unattractive occupation that is thought to be characteristic of Cincinnati , are all served by the timely announcement of the change from thawing to freezing weather . A recent Signal Service note on ' Cold Waves and Their Progress , ' by Lieutenant Woodruff , is therefore of more than usual popular interest . It is based on an examination of the cold waves occurring from January to June in the years 1881-84 , when eighty-eight sudden abnormal falls of more than 15 ? were recorded . The waves appear in the far Northwest ; 15 per cent . of them came from the Pacific , but the larger remaining portion were first detected in Montana or Dakota . It is therefore conclmied that their origin is north of our stations , in British America . They always follow an area of low barometer , and are accompanied by high pressure ; and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction of the progress of the cold waves would be made more accurate than it now is . According to their direction of advance , three classes of waves are distinguished : the first move eastward over the great lakes and across New England , not extending south of the Ohio ; the second spread southeastward and cover the whole country east of the Rockies in their progress , and this class occurs as frequently as the other two together ; the third move southward from Montana and Dakota to Texas , then eastward over the Gulf States , and finally to the Atlantic slope ? these sometimes are felt at St. Louis and Shreveport before they reach St. Paul and Chicago . Thirty-three examples out of sixty-six reached Bismarck as soon as Helena ; Washington has to wait thirty-two to fifty-six hours later for their appearance . The cold wave that spread over the country on March 18 and 19 , 1883 , is described in some detail as a well-marked and typical illustration of the phenomena in question : from New England to Texas there extended a broad belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 ' , and even 4i ' , in twenty-four hours . A comprehensive table , giving the numerical elements of the eighty-eight waves , closes the note . ? Not long ago Capt . Willard Glazier succeeded in gaining considerable newspaper notoriety by reason of his alleged discovery of a new source for the Mississippi River , in he form of a lake higher up on the stream than Lake Itasca . To this lake he modestly attached his own name , while the members of his family , his sisters and his cousins and his aunts , were all remembered in the distribution of names upm the minor lakes and streams in the field of his explorations , and he is now attempting in earnest to have his preposterous claims as a geographical discoverer recognized and his names adopted by the map-makers . As is well known , the country about the head of the Mississippi is not by any means a terra incognita . In 1832 Schooleraft explored the river to Lake Itasca , which he discovered . In 1836 Nicollet extended the work , including in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lake . He describes no fewer than five small lakes or ponds which are drained into Lake Itasca , and unquestionably one of these is Lake Glazier . " In later years settlements , roads , and railroads have approached the region , lumbermen have thoroughly explored it , and finally , in 1876 , it was sectionized by the General Land Office . Lines were run at intervals of a mile , both in the direction of a parallel and of a meridian , and every lake and pond half a mile in length was surveyed by traverse . A survey of this kind leaves little room for geographical discoveries . Five years after this survey was made Captain Glazier made his alleged discovery . From his map and narrative it is easy to see that his " Lake Glazier " is identical with Elk Lake , of the Land Office plat , which is situated in township 143 north , range 36 west . This lake , or rather pond , has an area of about half a square mile , and is about 200 yards distant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Japanese seem determined to be in line with the other civilized nations of the world , and their seriousness and perseverance contrast sharply with that trivial view of them which is popularly held in Christendom . Americans are even surprised when told that the subjects of the Mikado do not enjoy the burlesque and caricature of him as seen on the theatre boards , and accepted as the mirror of fact and history . One of the most recent indications of progress in Dai Nippon is the formation of the Roma-ji Kai ( Roman Alphabet Association ) in TOkid . The object of this band Of scholars , which is composed of both natives and foreigners , is to discard the old cumbrous modes of writing and printing , borrowed from China , and to substitute the Roman letters . Most of the Japanese members are students who have studied in Europe or the United States , and are familiar with one or more of the modern languages of the West . They propose to use twenty-two of the twenty-six Roman letters , omitting 1 , q , v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty members , adopting the standard pronunciation of the capital TC46.5 , agreed upon a simple system , and the Society is now prepared to print , in accordance with it , both books and vernacular newspapers . They accept the consonants at their usual English values , and the vowels at those of Italian ( German or Latin ) , and thus write Japanese words , discarding the usual kana spelling . Heretofore the Chinese ideographs have been employed in writing on serious subjects , and the Japanese syllabary of forty-eight sounds for phonetic transliteration , for trivial correspondence , story-books , novels . and such literature as uneducated women and children make use of . It has been demonstrated that , by mastery and use of the system of the Roma-ji Kai , a Japanese lad may learn to read as w ell in one year as of old he was able to read in ten years . Seine go so far as to make the advantage fifty times greater  --  a week in Roma-ji being equal to a year in Shina-ji . Of course , easy practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spoken tongue . Already the members of the Roma-ji Kai have begun to print a newspaper ; prominent journals are devoting a column per day to matter printed in Roman letters ; and dictionaries , text-books , native literature , and the classic texts are to be thus set forth . It will thus be possible for Europeans to study Japanese without trial to the eyes , and waste of years in deciphering and remembering the so-called idea-writings of the Chinese . As matter of fact , the Chinese characters are no better fitted to express Japanese than to express Latin or English . The Roman letter is thus destined to be in eapan an engine of progress . ? From indications sufficiently abundant , it seems highly probable that the Roma-ji system will prevail in Japan . The missionaries and native Christians already make use of it to an encouraging degree . The entire New Testament and specimens of the growing Christian literature are now published with twenty-two letters . Prof. Martin N. Wyckoff , who has recently prepared for the press in TOkiii a work in Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Chinese character and native kana , at the last moment transliterated his MS. into Roma-ji , because , as he says , it " is now the fashion . " The pioneer and persistent advocate of the system , who must now rejoice in the flattering prospect of long-awaited triumph , is our own American scholar , Dr. J. C. Hepburn , of Kanagawa . Besides his missionary and medical labors since 1859 , Doctor Hepburn , who has made the standard Japanese-English dictionary , issued the first edition in 1867 , and the fourth is now nearly ready . In this monumental work , from first to last he has made use of substantially the same system as that of the Roma-ji Kai , in whose conferences he has taken part . As early as 1873 he issued the translated New Testament in Romanized Japanese . Much credit for the final results is also to be given to Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain , the accomplished English translator of the Ko-ji-ki , or Japanese " Bible , " and the Rev. C. E. Eby , an American missionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Quia  --  te of La Mancha . By Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra . A Translation , with Introduction and Notes , by John Ormsby , translator of the ' Poem of the Cid . ' Macmillan &; Co. 1885. 4 vols .. 8vo . PASSING now to the volumes before us , which have been put forth in the best tastc , correct in typograpny , convenient in form , appetizing in every respect , we are impressed with the conviction that all the conditions required in the interpreter of such a work have been successfully met in this . After a neat map of the district familiar to all as the scene of Quixotic adventure , there follows an explanatory preface , giving an interesting moonlit of the earlier English versions , and sonic of the principles on which the present one is based , all pervaded by a scholarly , modest tone that invices our respectful attention . The Life of Cervantes is a well-ordered exhibition of the materials Navarrete left behind , in which , however , we miss the new data gathered from that scholar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished by Moran and the Marquis de Molins . The text of the translation is interspersed at convenient intervals with annotations brief but sufficient , to which attention is called by references at the foot of the page . The whole is furnished at the close with a collection of all the proverbs scattered through the work , given in the original Spanish with the literal English version , followed by a bibliography of chivalry fiction and of the editions of Don Quixote . ' In the compilation of these lists , Gayangos and the Valencia Salvd have been freely used , but Hidalgo , the Birmingham study , and the Ticknor catalogue would have supplied additional matter . However , with the exception of Moran 's edition of the romance , which is of the highest importance , the leading reprints have been given with completeness enough , since the aim seems not to have been to present an exhaustive array of editions . Ortego 's latest specimen of Quixotomania was of course too recent for insertion , and we believe has not been made known abroad save to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1846 , that heads the Biblioteca de Autores Espalioles ' ? a collection that does more credit to the energy of its publishers than to the diligence and accuracy of its editors , with prominent exceptions  --  was reset in larger type in 1848 , and is one of the best readings to follow , since it generally reproduces the Madrid editions of 160815 . As a whole , there can be no just doubt of the superiority of Mr. Ormsby 's translation over all that have preceded it . With a careful revision , to which every such effort is subject on its first appearance , the removal of occasional blemishes , faults arising from incorrect readings , and excesses of literalism , we think it is destined to replace all past efforts in this field , all contemporary competitors , and to moderate to a salutary degree any inordinate ambition in future aspirants . He has used Shelton freely , as was legitimate and traditional , and in many passages it would have been wiser to follow his text , the original of which was certainly that of Brussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking of text , it will be as well to make a digression . That of ' Don Quixote , ' which was always slovenly , doubtless , in the MS. , is still unreliable even in the best modern editions . Each editor , now for more than a century , has considered it a duty , and apparently an easy task , to correct the author of his own book , storing it with the gratuitous changes and interpretations of fertile inventors . The writer of the preface to Bohn 's edition justly remarks : " An original work of literature , if it deserve to live , ought to be permitted to pass through its mortal course unaltered , preserving the identical form in which it was left by its author . " But that was written in England , a country where there is patience and fidelity and care ; in Spain , however , where such qualities are considered irksome and slow , where the sun snakes indolent students whose motto " , TO ands da  - -  God will provide , " unwrinkles the conscience and shirks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the reading as the editor unders ands it , than to compare and investigate to reach the author 's idea . So Clemencin says practically countless times in his six volumes of comments : " Cervantes was a poor dog , who forgot what he had written before , " and down goes some Quixotic nonsense that is copied for a score of years as pure gold refined . Hartzenbusch was his successor , and he has left four sumptuous tomes , duplicated in 16mo , which were printed at great expense in the traditional prison of Cer vantes at Argamasilla de Alba , the village of La Mancha whose name he did " not care to remember . " With his literary lance in rest , Hartzenbusch has dashed into windmills , ejected vials of editorial balsam over the Sanchos of the plume , and mistaken droves of innocent sheep for veteran forces against whom no word of warning could restrain him . He was a clever writer , and a genial , obliging old gentleman as head of the National Library , whose acquaintance we cherished and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fondness for tinkering nearly spoiled Alarcon , Calderon , Lope , and Tirso for the Biblioteca de Autores Espadoles , ' and at last the great Cervantes , treating their texts as school compositions sent to him for correction . Our friend , M. Morel-Fatio , now of the College de France , an unwearied student of Spanish archives , writes thus of Hartzenbusch 's Calderon : " 11 a presque partout cm rigd , sans faire part au leeteur des motifs qui l'obligeaient h s'ecarter de la lecon traditionelle . " Unluckily , Mr. Ormsby has generally adopted Hartzenbusch 's reading , although in many passages he has been on his guard and adroitly avoided the shoals . In tasks like this , it should not be a question what the author ought to have said or might have said , but only what he did say in the recognized editions of his own time . Of the First Part of the Quixote ' there are three Madrid editions printed by Juan de In Cuesta , the first of 1605 with the Privilegio for Castile only ; the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Portugal . and the third of 1608 . Each of these differs notably from the others , especially the third , which is now most esteemed and followed . An independent and carefully revised edition is also that of Brussels , 1607 . For the Second Part there is but one Cuesta edition , that of 1615 . Since Cervantes died the folio wing year , no other could be corrected by him . All these texts are needful to build up a standard reading , and there will never be one till this collation is accomplished . A copy of some one of the early editions , with marginal and interlinear emendations in the handwriting of Cervantes , has lately been discovered in Spain by a Mr , F. Ortego , of Palencia , who published it there in 1883-4 , in two volumes , quarto , one containing the corrections compared with various modern editions , and the other with the revised text alone . As far as we have been able to examine this trouvaille , it seems to be an extremely valuable contribution to the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early printed lections . The title and preliminary matter are wanting to Sr. Ortego 's original , so that its identity has not been established  --  a thing , however , easy enough to do by comparing it with all the ancient editions stored in the vast collection of Senator Heredia , the Madrid owner of the late Salva library . So excellent a result as that which Mr. Ormsby has given us deserves an extended review to set forth some of its charming naivetds and happy hits . The defects inherent in it , as in all such undertakings , must , however , here be left largely unmolested for lack of space . We should have liked to speak of the duelos y quebrantos , and what Oudin found them to be as recorded in the third edition of his ' Tesoro , ' Paris , 1621 ; to offer an excursus on Spanish swearing to amateurs and antiquaries , because it involves a good knowledge of the itas Patrum ' ; to explain that " by Roque " ( re-ky 138 ) is a harmless invocation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to good Saint Roch of Montpellier , the patron of pest and torture. * Haldudo himself ( long togs , Ni Rem ni Roque ( vol. iii , p. 12 , , which is translated " King , Rook ( : ) , or earthly man , " is therefore King ( highest of men ) or Saint ( best of men ) . The Spaniard Clemencin did not understand it , because " Roque " was not a coact de Espana , a , but imported ( religionts causal . alluding to his Moorish kirtle ) is a relic of the wars of the Alpujarras ( 1568 ) , as Mendoza and Marmol tell us , the survivors of which were interned in La Mancha by Philip II. , where they may still be recognized , as in Murcia , by th ) zaragiielles ( Turkish trowsers ) and their manner of sitting cross-legged on the ground . Hence the phrase , " There may be Haldudos knights , " simply says : " Even seedy Moors may be gentlemen . " " Real by real , and perfumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " every blessed real . " " I shall find you font though you should lie closer than a lizard ' ' ; closer to what ? why , ei la tapia , " to a wall . " " For if he spoiled the bather of the shoes you paid for , you have damaged that of his body " ; the leather of his body ? We in America say " hide " in both cases , as they do in Spain ( cuero ) , which satisfies the word-play . The portion in the Second Part erased by the Inquisition ( hi , 399 ) , but preserved by Shelton , and in modern Spanish editions by Aribau ( 1846 ) , first appears in the Index ' of Seville , 1632 , appendix ; not in that of 1619 , which never existed , except as a Geneva reprint of the Madrid folio of 161214 . We will close , if allowed one moment more , just for the love we bear the dear old book .

The adjective " disreputable " is strong : Shelton 's " bad " is preferable , since the allusion is to the three sources of taint in one 's pedigree , blood of Jew , Moor , or Lutheran heresy , each of which was ( and is ) malsonante , not necessarily " disreputable " in those still faithful , but a drawback , a blemish . " Old rusty Christians , " an entire misconception of the term cristiano viejo . Old Christians " should have always quotation marks in the text , because used technically . It stands opposed to " New Christians , " that is , Jewish and Moorish proselytes who consented to be baptized as an exemption from the persecutions of 1390 and 1492 , and applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , old denizens of the Peninsula , of pure Iberian , Celtic , Roman , Gothic blood , prided themselves on their untainted pedigree . They were the yens de vieille race , the true " Brand of Spain " " Old Christians . " The word " rusty ' ' is here a sad let-down , taken , however , bodily from Shelton , who did not comprehend it . Nor could he from books alone . The original ranciaso ( obsolete for rancio ) tallies with its etymon rancidus in so far as it means " rank , " " musty , " " pungent " ; but here it stops , and turns into another channel , partly traced by the later dictionaries , and partly not . From " musty " it comes to signify " old , " " ancient " ; then " old-fashioned , " " out of date " ; next , " through and through , " " out and out , " " genuine , " " uncompromising , " meanings these which the lexica do not give , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sore-headed , narrow-minded , exclusive hidalgos of the past wrote in their books : see the ' Carta de Paracuellos , ' and the ' Journey of the Coaches from Madrid to Alcald , ' which are full of this sense of rancio . When a native wishes to declare emphatically the pride he feels in his intense nationalism , his Espailolismo , he will as often say. : Soy un Castellano rancio , as Soy Castellano por los cuatro costados , both of which profess him to be an out-and-out , through-and - through Spaniard , from the delectable mountains of Castile , Old or New . Hence the common phrase , El FilOsofo Rana ? , is not " the Rusty Philosopher , " but an uncompromising adherent of the old school , sworn foe to imported United States . . . has received a development beyond that which it has reached in England ; but it is an idea not so much unknown to as deliberately rejected by the constitution-makers of France and of other Continental countries which have followed French guidance . " It is described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' then , which forms a fundamental principle of the Constitution , has three meanings , or maybe regarded from three different points of view . It means , in the first place , the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power , and excludes the existence of arbitrariness , of prerogative , or even of wide discretionary authority on the part of the Government . Englishmen are ruled by the law and by the law alone ; a man may with us be punished for a breach of law , but he can be punished for nothing else . It means , again , equality before the law , or the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law courts . The ' rule of law ' in this sense excludes the idea of any exemption of officials or others from the duty of obedience to the law which governs other citizens , or from the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals ; there can be with us nothing really corresponding to the administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion which lies at the bottom of the administrative law ' known to foreign countries , that affa rs or disputes in which the Government or its servants are concerned are beyond the sphere of the civil courts , and must be dealt with by special and more cr less official bodies ( tribunaux adrninistratifs ) , is utterly unknown to the law of England , and , indeed , is fundamentally inconsistent with our traditions and customs . The ' rule of law , ' lastly , may be used as a formula for expressing the fact that with us the law of the Constitution , the rules which in foreign countries naturally form part of a constitutional code , are not the source , but the eon-sequence of the rights of individuals , as defined and enforced by the courts ; that , in short , the principles of private law have with us been , by the action of the courts and Parliament . so extended as to determine the position of the Crown and of its servants . Thus the Constitution is the result of the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of the rule of law is devoted to showing the application of it ? " the manner in which the law of England deals with . . . the right to personal freedom , the right to ( so-called ) freedom of discussion , the right of public meeting , the use of martial law , the rights and duties of the army , the collection and expenditure of the public revenue , and the responsibility of Ministers . " This part of the book is full of interest , but we can not dwell upon it , further than to remark the curious fact that English law appears to have furnished no definite answer as yet to some pretty obvious questions . It subjects a soldier , or rather it leaves him subject , to the special rigors of military law ; he may be shot if he does not obey the order of his officer to fire on a mob . On the other band , it also subjects him to the ordinary law of the land ; if he does fire on the mob when ordered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author , " is , from a legal point of view , the duty of the soldiers ? The matter is one which has never been absolutely decided . " But a test is cited from Mr. Justice Stephen , which , as Dicey guardedly remarks , " is , it may fairly be assumed , as nearly correct a reply as the state of the authorities makes it possible to provide " - the test , namely , of whether the soldiers " might fairly suppose their superior officer to have good reasons " for issuing the order . The last of the eight lectures which make up this volume disthisses " the connection between the law of the Constitution and the conventions of the Constitution . " The real sanction of these conventions , which are happily described as " the constitutional morality of the day , " is found to lie , after all , in the force of law , in " the fact that the breach of these principles and of these conventions will almost immediately bring the offender into conflict with the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
