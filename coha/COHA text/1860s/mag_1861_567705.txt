ARTICLE V.-THE DUTIES TO THEIR COUNTRY IN THE PRESENT CRISIS , OF THOSE WHO REMAIN AT HOME , WHILE THEIR BRETHREN GO DOWN TO THE BATTLE . FROM all the loyal portions of the United States , we have recently said farewell to our **25;0;TOOLONG , friends , kindred-fathers and sons , husbands and brothers-who have gone to fight the battles ot our country in this war of rebellion and treason so wickedly waged upon it . The inquiry rises spontaneously in the hearts of us all who remain at home , what can we do for our country ? As in ancient Israel , they who " tarry by the stuff , " and they that " go down to the battle , " share alike in the results of martial success . The immense benefits of victory in this righteous war  --  the re*istablishment of law and order , and the strengthening of our beneficent system of free government , which gives protection and stimulus to the human powers in all productive effort , effort productive of wealth , of intellectual , moral and religious culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally with those who defend and sustain the government at the peril of life on the deadly field . It well becomes us , then , to ask what part of duty , as well as of benefits , we have who stay at home . We shall share in the beneficent results of the conflict . What part can we have in the service attending it ? That which naturally first occurs to our thoughts is , to be ready to follow those who have gone to the conflict , if we shall be needed . Every man capable of bearing arms , by *e and physical condition , and who comes within the prescribed military rule in these respects , should be willing , in such an exigency , to defend his country by bearing arms . It is well and requisite that suitable numbers of them should be preparing themselves for a call to such a patriotic service , however sudden , // by acquiring the necessary military knowledge and discipline . It is to be gratefully and joyfally recognized as a fact , shining out by abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are thus willing for all necessary martial service . The government of our fathers , which we so justly value and love , can have an army of a million for its defense , whenever it shall call . Let us keep up this tone of feeling as long as the war shall last , however lone that shall be . Let it not be feeling merely , ( as it is not ) , but feeling united with and founded on the principle of patriotism , of duty , and of piety . But there are many , even the greater part of our communities , who , from age , or sex , or physical disqualification , do not come within the prescribed conditions of military service , to whom , therefore , in answer to the question , What shall we do for our country in this crisis ? it is not pertinent to say , be ready to follow to the field those who have gone . Yet for them , as for all , of whatever condition , who stay at home , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first , of what we can do for the health and comfort and true welfare of those who have gone in our stead to the martial field . They have been suddenly called , and have left home in haste , and on that account , in many instances , not sufficiently prepared for the exigencies of a campaign , in a distant region , and in a very different climate from ours . We should hold ourselves ready to prepare , and should be preparing , so far as it is to be done unofficially , all necessary garments for the sick and wounded , and for needful change in the fierce and debilitating heat of southern climes ; remembering that the health of our troops is of prime importance ; since in a campaign sickness usually destroys more lives than the sword . In this good work we may rely chiefly on those who are excluded from entering our armies , except in a limited number to care for the sick-those who were last at the cross and first at the sepulchre , and are ever most eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let ways and means be devised to employ for the comfort and welfare of those who have gone // down to the battle , the industry and skill of our patriotic women-our women , we might say ; the adjective is unnecessary ; they are all patriotic . Then we should favor a sufficient remuneration of those who have gone , or who shall go , to the martial field . Surely , they who go on this service of certain hardship , and of probable deadly peril , should be well paid-should receive certainly the average wages of such men when engaged in the employments of peace . And we who stay at home and send them to fight our battles  --  the state and nation , whose welfare and very life they are saving from destruction ,  --  can well afford to pay it , and should be enthusiastically willing to pay it . Let us not , as communities , or states , or as a nation , shrink at all from any taxation which is needful for the fair expenses of this conflict , and especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assured that they will receive , as their just due , a support for themselves and for their families or dependents . The fact that this remuneration makes in the aggregate a large sum , should not alarm us . We should accept it cheerfully , as our part , and less than our parta part surely less difficult than theirs of hardship and peril . We should protest , too , by our influence , and in all proper ways , against our legislators taking advantage of the patriotic enthusiasm of our volunteers to employ their services at any less than a fair remuneration , be the time of their service longer or shorter . But the most important duty of those who remain at home , while their brethren go down to the battle , is to perform the home work  --  to attend to the necessary business of the country , in all its departments , industrial , moral , religious . In ancient times , it was the duty of those who " stayed by the stuff " while their brethren went to the fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us who remain at home in this time of war , to take care of home , and all the duties of home  --  to administer energetically and successfully the ordinary business of the country , in all its various forms . This , this is now our great duty to our country . // Let us consider it , as it is comprehended in two general departments  --  the industrial or secular , and the moral or religious . First , the industrial or secular . We find here a two-fold reason for industry and energy . On the one hand , much of the laboring or productive force of the country is taken away for the service of war ; and , on the other hand , we need the full ordinary amount of production , and more than the ordinary amount , to support the country in the war . Multitudes of men have been taken from the fields for the duties of war . At the trumpet call of our nation 's martial leaders , they have laid down the implements of agriculture , and seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as ever , and more than ever , all that our fields can produce . For , besides supplying the ordinary wants of the country , we must feed our armies . And this , though there are not literally any more mouths to be fed , involves a large additional outlay of labor , in the way of storage and transportation . The Commissary department , in time of war , the office of feeding an army of a hundred or two hundred thousand men , is very responsible and onerous . We must see to it , then , that the great business of agriculture is not allowed to languish . We must raise enough from the bountiful earth , both for those who stay at home , and for those who go down to the battle ; and also , if possible , for sale in other countries , that we may obtain in return other products , or money , for the support of the country in the war . It may be necessary , and expedient also , since many departments of manufacturing industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times , to transfer productive force from the workshops to the fields . At all events , and by all means , the earth , whether in the garden or in the field , must be made to produce as much as possible . So in other departments of business , there are none from which men have not volunteered for the war . Their places must be supplied , where the demands of business require it , by others . And while some branches of business are greatly restricted and deranged , others need to be greatly enlarged and // invigorated . There is need especially that the manufacture of arms , and ordnance , and the various munitions of war , should be pressed forward with all possible energy  --  a need greatly increased , if not wholly caused , by the shameful and accursed treachery of some of our late high officials , in sending our arms and ordnance into the seceded states , in anticipation of their rebellion , and by the equally shameful theft of those states . There must , also , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of our armies . And , without further specification , it may be said with regard to this branch of the , subject , the department of secular business , that in whatever form prod uction is needed , or may be profitably carried on , it should be energetically and industriously carried on . For we need to produce property , to make money , in time of war , more than ever ; not that we may hoard it , not that we may spend it on ourselves , but that we may devote it to our country in her time of need , and to the maintenance of her institutions , civil , religious , and benevolent . For money ( it has become a proverb ) constitutes the sinews of war . Kot that we are wholly dependent on what we shall make during the war , or on what we now possess . For , thanks to a bountiful Providence , and to the industrial skill and energy of the loyal part of the country , we have credit sufficient to avail us in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to produce property or values more than now . And , therefore , it is the patriotic duty of those who stay at home to be specially diligent and energetic in every form of productive industry that they can find . Let those , then , who stay by the stuff , while their brethren go to the battle , remember that it is no time to be idle . The way for us to serve our country in this crisis is to carry forward , in the best sphere we can find , the productive industry of the country ; and so give her food and clothing for her armies and nerve her with all the various and strong sinews of war . Let us pass now to the other general department of patriotic duty for those who remain at home  --  the moral and religious department . // This we all recognize at once as of the very highest importance for the true welfare of the country in the present crisis . The various organizations and operations for promoting the moral and religious health of the community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the world-these are all left in our hands ; and it is of vital importance , and therefore our imperative duty , to keep them up in full vigornot only to maintain them in outward form and prosperity , but to inspire them with the true life of benevolence and piety . It is ours to see that the institutions and operations of religion and benevolence do not languish , while our brethren are gone to the battle . They have gone , leaving them in our care . When they return , if ( which may God grant ) they are permitted to return , let them find these chief elements of their and our country 's welfare in vigorous life and prosperity . Let each one , then , remember that true patriotism forbids him to neglect those duties and services which are essential to the prosperity of religion , even though it be from martial zeal or an enthusiastic interest in public affairs . Let each one of us remember that in this crisis patriotism requires that he should be found in his place , sustaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality of religion-in his place in the church , in the ' Sabbath school , in the convocations for prayer , in the manifold movements of religious effort and benevolence , and be ready , if need be , to do double duty there , and to stand in every gap which is made by the absence of workers , or in any way by the exigency of the times . ' Let all remember that it is incumbent upon those who remain at home to keep the moral and religious tone fully up to the true pitch . There is unquestionably a peril here . For a time of war is a time of great excitement , when attention and interest are powerfully arrested and diverted to national affairs and distant objects  --  a time , moreover , when there is great liability to malign passions and evil measures . Of this peril we should beware ; and so triumph over it , as we may . But , on the other hand , there are moral advantages in a righteous war . It invigorates the righteous spirit . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to God 's ordinance of government and law , and thus loyalty to God himself . It cultivates the spirit of self-devotion and self-sacrifice-true heroism . It sends us to God as our refuge and strength , and teaches us ' to lean on him and call on him . Of this advantage let us avail ourselves , to keep np the moral tone of the community . Let us keep the moral aspect of this conflict in the foreground-as a conflict to which righteousness and piety call us . Undoubtedly we should humbly recognize our sins , as one reason why God permits this trial to come upon us , and even our sins as it respects the underlying cause of this war . Yet we are sure that on the part of our Government and its loyal defenders , the conflict itself is a righteous conflict , in which to yield would be recreancy to duty and to God . Certainly if ever there was a government ordained of God , and a ministration of God for good , this government is . If ever rebellion and treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely is-rebellion and treason against such a government as this . If ever , therefore , rebellion and treason should be put down by the sword , which God has given to his appointed rulers to be borne by them not in vain , this treason and rebellion should be thus put down . It is clearly the will , the cornmand , of God . We may expect , therefore , by recognizing this moral feature of the war , and putting it in the foreground ,  --  by looking upon it as a war on our side to which both patriotism and piety summon us-we may expect that the tone of morals and religion will be elevated , instead of being depressed . But , then , we must accompany this , as we have said , by the diligent employment of the usual instrumentalities of religion . And this , if done , must be done by unusual liberality and self-denial . The losses caused by the repudiation of debts in the seceded states , the derangement of business produced by that repudiation , and by the imminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of churches and mission schools , and especially of great organizations of religious benevolence like our Missionary Societies-all which need a steady support . If we do , in this respect , what the // Lord would have us , and what true patriotism requires , we shall have to exercise liberality and self-denial in an unusual degree . Those who have met with losses should make their appropriations to the objects of religion and benevolence the last place for retrenchment . And those who have been so favored as to have few losses , should , by the exceeding abundance of their liberality , make up for the necessary deficiency of others . The millions which have been poured forth , within a few weeks , to aid in our country 's defense , prove that a few hundred thousands , for those organizations which contemplate the spiritual salvation of the land and the world , might be easily given , if the fountains of our hearts should flow in that direction in a like manner , though in a very inferior degreeas in an inferior degree they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from year to year , while our country 's defense against treason and rebellion calls upon us rarely . We expect to settle this matter now so effectually that a like call will never come to us again . While , then , our patriotism gushes , as it should , in liberal streams for our country 's defense , let our benevolence and self-denial so abound that all the Christianizing agencies for our community , for our land , and for the world , shall be carried forward , at the same time , without embarrassment , and with vital and victorious power . In conclusion , we would press upon our readers this moral and religious department of duty for those who remain at home , while their brethren go down to the battle . For it is preeminently important . The moral and religious forces of the country-they must be kept up in full vigor during the war , or our country 's welfare will suffer immensely , though rebellion and treason be put down . Upon those moral and religious forces , war , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a war is not the greatest of evils ; it will even bring great benefits , if we keep up the vital moral tone . Yet it heals by wounding-by using the caustic . Its efficacy is like that of the ploughshare to the turf-bound earth ; or rather like that of the surgeon 's knife to the diseased body . Unless the body itself // is strong with healthy forces , the wounds will not result in healing , but in more rapid dissolution . These vital forces we must nourish , in the way which has been pointed ont , or fearful moral disaster will come upon us in connection with the war . Let us to this end be mindful of our position before God . Let not our elation at the righteousness of our cause , and at the unanimity and power with which it is espoused by the loyal part of the country , prevent a humbling sense of our unworthiness , and of the truth that this evil has come upon us as a judgment from God for our sins . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins , we are not free from guilt even with respect to that system of oppression , which most of us regard as the underlying cause , and all regard as at least the occasion , of this war of rebellion . If the guilt of that system of oppression more deeply stains one portion of this land than the rest , we are not on that account to maintain an attitude of self-righteous pride . The readiness with which our brothers and sisters , our sons and daughters , have adopted and defended that oppression , when once they have become domesticated in the midst of its perverting influences ; the zeal and spirit with which many among us have apologized for , and upheld it , and even endeavored to render odious all who have efficiently opposed it ; the cruel and oppressive legislation of many of the free states toward the defenseless colored race-all these declare too plainly a wide defect among us of that humane , much more of that Christian , sentiment , on which alone can be founded any claim by us that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that it is for our manifold sins , as a nation , that God has permitted this judgment to come upon us . Such a feeling will tend strongly to restrain us from that vindictive spirit to which we are , and shall be , so urgently tempted . And it will give us the best temper in which to meet the trials , which the war is sure to bring . We know not yet just what those trials will be . We know not where the bolt will strike ; but it has gone forth , and somewhere its blow will surely be felt . There is not one of us , probably , who will not experience something to remind us that we are suffering // under the chastisement of God . And some of ns will feel it in sorrows , that will end only with life . This swelling tide of patriotic excitement , which has lifted us up and floated us above all fear of personal peril or sacrifice , when it subsides , must give place to the endurance , which knows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservation of what reniains after much has been sacrificed . The power of the army itself , its healthy moral tone , the spirit which will make it strong in the force of right purpose and noble sentiment-this will depend very much on us who remain here at home . It will depend , more than can be computed , on the earnest prayers , offered in private and in public , to the God of nations and the God of battles . It will depend much on the tone of feeling , communicated from us , through so many channels , to those in the army who have with us the sympathy of friendship and kindred . Oh ! who is there , that feels strong enough in himself for such duties and responsibilities as are thrown upon us now ! What Christian does not now say with deeper meaning than ever , " God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble ; " and does not long to take a firmer hold on his arm , and to ally himself , more closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of his purposes in the earth ? Many of our readers , doubtless , feel as we do , that it would be a privilege to go down to the battle  --  a privilege which paramount duty denies to us . But we are not , therefore , precluded from labor and sacrifice for our country . There is labor and sacrifice for us who stay by the stuff . Our part , indeed , may be the most difficult  --  to take up , and bear with faith and patience , patriotic burdens at home  --  to endure here , every day , unheroic work and trial , with heroic hearts . Why is it that the people everywhere are radiant with joy , like the earth before the harvest ? Why is every face filled with light , so *nysterious in full view of the calamity of war ? Is it not that God is offering to crown this age with a glory like that , and even surpassing that , of the era of our great IRevolution ? He calls upon us to confirm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forth to it , with strong hands and pure hearts . So may we hope to make a chapter in the history of the land and the world which will be a fitting climax to theirs . It is surely a crisis with us . Let it be gl6riously met for ourselves and the world . " Forever ours ! for good or ill , on us the burden lies ; God 's balance , watched by angels , is hung across the skies . Shall justice , truth , and freedom , turn the poised and trembling scale ? Or shall the evil triumph , and robber wrong prevail . By all for which the martyrs bore their agony and shame ; By all the warning words of truth , with which the prophets came ; By the future which awaits us ; by all the hopes which cast Their bright and cheering beams across the blackness of the past ; And by the blessed thought of Him , who for earth 's freedom died , Oh , my people ! Oh , my brothers ! maintain the righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
