Chorus Raise the song , raise the song , Raise with grateful hearts the thankful song of praise , All the gifts of earth , here , by right of birth Springing , blooming , gushing , flowing , crown the cup . Then impart thou the blessing sent by heaven , With gentle hand the drooping soul sustaining ; Raise thy voice , till to every man shall equal rights be given , Till in thy universal reign the world be blest . SEMI-CHORUS . Semi-Chorus All hall to thee , O Liberty , With every bliss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here thy path surrounding . LIBERTY . Goddess of Liberty Well done , all my children ! your steps and your voices Make glad all the hearts that love freedom and truth ! Beneath your glad smiles , all the wide world rejoices , And the old turn again to the glory of youth . Still shine like a star to the souls that lie mourning , And pierce with your brightness Oppression 's dark night In peace or in war  --  still with loathing and scorning , Dash off every charm that would fetter your might . I have looked on the land where the tyrant was ruling . His foot on the necks of the honest and true ; Heaven save you , my children , from clashing and falling ! Let the hand of Oppression ne'er rest upon you ! Wide  --  wide o'er the empires that crumble to ruin , My kingdom shall flourish , from sea unto sea , And every dark land , all its evils undoing , Shall thenceforth be bright with the light of the free !
