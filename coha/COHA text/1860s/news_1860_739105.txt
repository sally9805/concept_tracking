txt A week ago there was no Europe ; the Emperor NAPOLEON and France were the only power ; theirs was the only voice capable of dictating terms or of being heard above the confusion . Is the waking up which has just taken place in England and Switzerland but a dying kick , or is it the forerunner of a European coalition against France ? Nobody believes a coalition possible , because nobody is willing to take the lead . The Emperor NAPOLEON tears up the treaties of 1815 , throws the pieces in the faces of the great Powers , and nobody dares reply by a call to arms . According to the Gazette of Augsburg , " England will not , Russia does not wish to , Austria can not , and Prussia will take good care not to do it . " This phraseology of the German journal expresses exactly the shade of senthae it of the different nations . Notwithstanding the efforts made in Germany , all attempts at a coalition have failed , and we may safely predict , will fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are afraid of the cost . But should they protest , France will do as the other Powers did when she protested against the annexation of Cracow to Austria : she will take note of the act , but pay no attention to it . In the late events , it is now seen that Austria was the only Power that retired with honor , for the fought and bravely fought to protect the line which is considered in Germany as German , while the rest have not even protested , much less taken up arms against France . The army in France , and not alone the army , but a majority of the politicians , are in the firm belief today that before the expiration of a year NAPOLEON will be on the Rhine . So widespread is this belief , that all Germany is in a fermentation , and they are now , perhaps , regretting at this late hour their former indifference . In France it is believed possible to remove the frontiers to the Rhine without a war . Thus the Emperor will offer to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Prussia Saxony , and perhaps other provinces ; to Bavaria a motley indemnity , and to England Sicily . The nationality of the Belgians will be swallowed up with as little ceremony as has just been that of the Savoyards . The Powers will be offered this arrangement or a fight , and since the former will cost infinitely less than the latter , it is thought in France that the proposition will be accepted , and the proposed change of frontiers take place without the least spilling of blood . You will appreciate the sudden alarm that has grown up within the last two or three days in England and Germany , when I tell you that this change of frontiers is talked of by men high in position as certain to take place . It is this growing feeling , no doubt , that influenced the late speech of Lord Joan RI:resent , when he almost declared that England was ready to go to a rupture with France in order to join a European coalition . On this question of a coalition , however , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without Russia , may form a coalition against her , but without her Europe can not form a coalition against any other power . The diplomacy attendant upon the annexation of Savoy and Nice to France has been but a comedy from beginning to end , put upon the stage to save appearances and to avoid establishing disagreeable precedents . The Emperor would have shown more dignity , however , in omitting certain portions of the programme , so palpably belonging to the decorator 's aft that even his friends laughed at their transparency . Of this catagory was the reception of the Savoyard delegation at the Tuileries . The French secret agents who had for some time been in Savoy organizing demonstrations and " trimming " the people for the coming change in their political condition , sent the deputation to Paris , giving them to understand that the Emperor was a man who did not forget his friends , and that the first in the market would be the first served . It is already said that the gentleman who headed the deputation and made the speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . After the prompt and determined manner in which Savoy and Nice were annexed to France , the Emperor had no need to invent so flimsy a pretence for the satisfaction of a public whose good or bad opinion in the matter he had totally disregarded up to that moment . It is not clear by any means that the majority of the people , of Savoy and Nice are in favor of annexation to France . The French journals count the abstentions from the polls , which form the majority , in favor of annexation , but upon what authority they do not tell us . We should rather be disposed to class them in the opposite category ; for where is the man , when he knows that the annexation is a fait accompli , who would derange himself in order to gain gratuitously the displeasure of the authorities which are to rule him for the future ? It is true that the language and the habits of the people of Savoy are French , and that the sympathies of the country are with France , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for a people so poor as the Savoyards , and that is the question of taxes . By their incorporation into the French Empire their taxes will be largely increased . while , at the same time , they will be subjected to the French system of espionage over speech and printed matter . On this question of taxes the same may be said of Tuscany and the other Duchies , which will in the future pay much-increased taxes , as parts of the new Kingdom of Italy , it being the singular privilege of large States to owe the heaviest debts , and require the most onerous imposts . The last speech of Lord JOHN RUSSELL has caused a good deal of irritation in France . and would have caused mere were it not regarded partly as a manouvre to give stability to the Ministry . But the fact that the Foreign Secretary is obliged b abuse France in order to retain power , is not exactly an agreeable reflection on this side the channel ; and if France can obtain the neutrality of Russia , and England does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive policy on the part of France in the direction of Belgium and the Rhine . The doctrine of " rectification of frontiers " and " natural boundaries " will be the pretext . France has no longer any regard for the rights of Prussia or the Confederation , and if England shows hostility about so insignificant a change as that of the annexation of Savoy , and Russia will remain tranquil , there is no longer any reason why NAPOLEON should hesitate in the movement he undoubtedly contemplates . But there is this singularity in the sudden change of position of the English Cabinet , that it gave its consent , or at least did not offer absolute resistance to the annexation of Savoy , till after Switzerland had made her reclamation on the neutrality of Upper Savoy , and till after the Emperor NAPOLEON had announced his willingness to Switzerland and the world to treat on the subject . Gen. DUFOUR , who was sent to Paris by the S wits Federal Council to confer with the Emperor , had left Paris entirely satisfied with the sentiments of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extraordinary speech of Lord JOHN RUSSELL had been made . In England they say that NAPOLEON , so soon as he obtained the advantages of the new commercial treaty , did not care longer to show any delicacy toward England , and is prepared no w to break the alliance ; in France they make exactly the same charge against England , with this fact in favor of the French view of the case , that while the people of France were so opposed to the treaty that nothing but the isolated action of a despot could have ever made it a law , the whole Government and people of England almost were in favor of it . This does not look like a premeditated trick on the part of France . Before the annexation of Tuscany and the Romagna to Sardinia , the French Government gave to the world the impression that it would oppose that measure ; the annexation nevertheless has taken place , and we hear of no protestation from France . We are therefore founded in the belief that the opposition of France was no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the other was but the cloak . But the singular feature of this part of the question is , that France is now wielding successfully against England the argument that it was England who forced the aggrandizement of Piedmont to an extent beyond the wishes or the anticipations of France , and which forced France , as the neighbor of so powerful a nation , to claim the French slopes of the Alps . By this argument , which is at least plausible on the surface , England is responsible for the annexation of Savoy and Nice to France . The Prince of Monaco , whose six-by-nine province lies in the county of Nice , and who , a few years ago , offered to sell his orange patch to the American Government under the pretext that it would make a good naval station , will now at last be bought out , and the ancient Principality of the Grinaldis , which has resisted so many storms and political convulsions , is about to cease its independent existence , if indeed the word independence can be applied to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove to Paris , and will receive from France gin annual pension , for him and his successors , of 200,000 francs .
