ART . VI . - DUTIES ON EXPORTS . IN one respect our American life has been changed by the war , and made to resemble that of the nations of Europe ; we have become , in less than four years , a people heavily indebted and heavily taxed . Four years of civil war have imposed on us almost as great a burden as twenty-five years of war against France , Bonaparte , and democracy did upon England . Unlike England , we expect to pay both principal and interest of our debt , so large are the resources afforded by our vast territory and the intelligent energy of our people . Meanwhile , however , the pressure will be felt by every one . Everything we use or consume nrnst pay its quota . Obviously , therefore , an object of taxation less burdensome than any other is at this time a thing to be desired . Such are exports of our own growth and manufacture , more especially of raw material . A tax on these would be paid by the foreign consumer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had this effect wonld , by lowering the price at home , encourage our own manufactures . These advantages have not escaped the notice of our men of business . The expediency of a tax on exports is generally admitted . That it would add largely to the revenue , without pressing injuriously upon any interest , no one doubts ; but every one seems to take it for granted that such a tax is forbidden by the Constitution . At the last session of Congress a proposition was introduced that the Constitution be amended to permit a tax upon exports . Is any amendment necessary ? The clause in the Constitution relating to this subject is as follows : " No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State . " Do these words mean that no tax or duty shall be laid upon exports at all ? Clearly not . The plain meaning of the clause is , that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any one or any single State . The addition of either of these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary to express the sense , which we shall endeavor to show harmonizes with the combination of federal and national , // or local and central power , which is the distinguishing feature of our government , and also with other provisions of the Constitution relating to the power of taxation . There are certain maxims of moral and political science which , as Mr. Hamilton says in the Federalist , No. 31 , " are , like the axioms of mathematics , self-evident , and carry conviction to every mind without the aid of argument . Of such are the truths that the means should be proportioned to the end ; that every power ought to be commensnrate with its object ; that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is in itself incapable of limitation . " As the command of money is necessary for all the operations of government , - necessary , therefore , for the honor , safety , independence , and existence of a nation , - every government must have unlimited power over all the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish its objects . This may therefore be stated as a natural and universal law of every political society ; and any constitution by which that power is restricted is so far defective . Every American citizen lives under two governments . State and Federal ; the former possessing power for State purposes only , the latter for National purposes only , and each supreme within its sphere . The sphere of local or State power is the good of the State ; the sphere of central or Federal power is the good of the whole country . Central power , charged with duty to the whole , can not use the power of the whole for the exclusive benefit of a part . Local power , confined to local objects , can not use the power of a part for the benefit of the whole . Congress can not tax the whole country for the exclusive advantage of Ohio . Ohio can not tax the people of Ohio for the advantage of all the other States . If revenue drawn from the whole may not be appropriated to a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole must be drawn from the whole , and not from a part . In other words , that , as the Federal government ought to exercise the power to impose taxes only for national purposes , so those taxes should be laid upon the whole nation , and not on a part of it , that all may bear a just share of the burden . These are plain and simple principles necessarily implied // from the relation of central to local power , which distinguishes our government ; and they are therefore provided for in the Constitution , which is the written plan of that government . The power to tax is granted in the fullest manner ; but at the same time the Constitution directs that it shall be exercised for the good of the whole nation , not of a part , and that the taxes shall be laid , not on a part , but on the whole . Such is the obvious meaning of the following clauses , which are all that relate to the subject . Art . 1 , Sect. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States ; but all duties , imposts , and excises shall be uniform throughout the United Stales . " Sect. 9 . " No capitation or other direct tax shall be laid , unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken , " for the purpose of ascertaining the population of each State , according to which it is provided , in Sect. 2 , that " representatives and direct taxes are to be apportioned . " And lastly ,  --  " No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State . " Here , then , we find the principles above mentioned applied . The power of laying taxes is granted for the advantage of the whole country , " the common defence and general welfare of the United States , " and the taxes must be drawn from the resources of the whole country . Direct taxes are to be apportioned according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposts , and excises , " that is to say , internal taxes and customs , or duties on imports , " shall be uniform throughout the United States . " Duties on exports ought to be uniform also . The productions of one part of the country ought not to be taxed , and those of other parts exempt . It would not be just to tax the cotton or rice or tobacco of the South , and let the grain and lumber and fish of the North go free . How is this uniformity secured ? By forbidding Congress to tax the exports of " any State , " or , by parity of reasoning , of any section or region of the country , whilst others remain untaxed . Such is the plain meaning of the words used , - " any State . " These words can not , without violence , be construed to mean a prohi // bition on Congress to tax exports at all . The presumption is in favor of the unlimited power to tax , - a power necessarily possessed by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also in favor of the restriction imposed , agreeing as it does with the ruling principle of our peculiar system , and with other provisions of like nature in the Constitution . This construction of the clause in question is supported by the , fact that it was adopted by the Convention instead of another clause offered by Mr. Piackney of South Carolina , viz. : " No tax shall be laid on articles exported from the States . " The Southern States , dependent almost exclusively on the export of the peculiar products of their soil , demanded that all exports should be exempt from taxation . They argued that , uiiless this were granted , the commercial States of the North might subject them to an unequal and oppressive burden , and injure or destroy the sources of their wealth . The proposition above mentioned is contained in a plan of a constitution presented by Mr. Piackney , at the opening of the Convention , May 29 , 1787 . Certain resolutions intended to express the general principles on which the future government was to be founded were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson . These were discussed till June 20th , and the result was the passing of nineteen resolutions , also declaratory of general principles . These were debated till July 26th , when twenty-three resolutions growing out of that debate , and containing a rough sketch of the proposed government and a statement of its ruling principles , were referred , together with ZL&amp; . Pinclcney 's plan , to a committee of detail , with instructions to report a constitution . Accordingly , on the 6th of August , the draft of a constitution was submitted to the Convention . Art . 7 , Sect. 4 , is hi these words : " No tax or duty shall be laid by the Legislature on articles exported from any State , nor on the migration or importation of such persons as the several States may think proper to permit ; nor shall such migration or importation be prohibited . " It would seem from this that the proposal of Mr. Pinckney to prohibit taxes on exports generally had been rejected by this committee . One would infer from the substi // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the words , " from the States , " in Mr. Pinckney 's plan , that the committee had regarded the demand of the South for the complete exemption of their principal source of wealth unreasonable , but had been willing to grant them protection from the inequality they professed to dread . Not only did the South claim the privilege of paying no tax upon their exports , but they demanded also that their principal article of importation , negro slaves , should be free from duty , and that the perpetuity of the slave-trade should be guaranteed so long as the Southern States chose to carry it on . This last demand was yielded by the committee . The constitution reported August 6th was discussed in the Convention , section by section , until September 10th , when , with the modifications it had received , it was referred to a coininittee of revision , who made a report on the 12th , submitting a constitution almost identical with that which now exists , which latter was signed September 17 , 1787 . In this constitution the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already quoted from the report of August 6th , was retained . But it is no longer connected in the same clause with the provision in relation to the slave-trade . It stands as a part of a clause intended to secure uniformity and equality in all commercial relations between the States . These are its words : - " No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State ; no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another ; nor shall vessels bound to or from one State be obliged to enter , clear , or pay duties in another . " From the company in which we last find it , as well as from the plain meaning of its languag9 and from its history , most people would think this paragraph , forbidding a tax on exports from any State , was also meant to secure equality and uniformity among the States . Looking therefore to the sense of the terms and the intention of the parties , which Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all instruments , ( Story , Coin. , 400 , ) and which intention is to be gathered " from the words , the context , the subject-matter , the effects and consequence or // the reason and spirit of the law , " the meaning we have given to the clause in question seems reasonable and just . The words are sufficiently clear , and the context and subject-matter confirm the obvious sense of the words . The subject-matter is the power of taxation , which is granted without limit : - " Congress shall have power to lay arid collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises . " Every species of tax is comprehended in these words , which cover every sort of property . The restrictions imposed do not limit the scope of the power , but the manner in which it is to be exercised . They relate first to the appropriation of the revenue collected , " to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States " ; and secondly , to the mode in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being intended for the beirefit of the nation , it is to be drawn from the resources of the whole nation , not from " any State " or any section . Thus duties , imposts , and excises are to be uniform throughout the United States ; that is to say , they shall be laid to the same amount on the same articles in every part of the country ; - as , for example , teas shall not pay a duty of five per cent in New York and ten per cent in Maryland ; nor incomes , profits of business , or coal or iron be taxed five per cent in one State and ten per cent in another . This is the only sort of uniformity attainable , for duties 011 imports and excises must necessarily press most heavily on those regions where they are most largely consumed . " Duties , imposts , and excises " are not laid upon the States , but upon the people , whether they are internal or external , that is , whether derived from articles produced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between these two last is , that whereas imports , wherever introduced , are consumed throughout the country , exports are local , the tax falling on the producer if high enough to check exportation . Consequently , a government that was willing to oppress one State or States could not do so by taxing articles imported by that State , but might accomplish its purpose by a tax on the exports of a State . In the former case , the tax would be paid by all the consumers of the article throughout the nation ; in the latter , by the produc*rs only . For this reason , the South claimed absolute exemption , a claim manifestly // unjust . The clause which declares that duties shall not be laid on the exports of any State , together with the provision that all duties " shall be uniform throughout the United States , " secures all the equality possible , without depriving the government of a most important and convenient source of revenue , one which may become absolutely necessary to the " common defence , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under these rules , Congress can not lay a duty of five per cent on wheat exported from New York , and of ten per cent on wheat sent from Pennsylvania ; neither can they tax exclusively the cotton of South Carolina or the tobacco of Virginia . The only sort of taxes that can be laid upon the States , as such , are direct taxes . There is no limit to the power of Congress as to the amount that may thus be raised , but care is taken that each State shall bear its fair share . " No capitation or other direct tax shall be laid , unless in proportion to the census . " It has been decided that Congress has no power to exempt any State from direct taxation or its portion of the burden . ( Story 's Coin. , 1008 . ) The clause relating to direct taxation is in Art . 1 , Sect. 9 , which contains the restrictions on the power of Congress . The next clause is that which relates to duties on exports . To construe this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to the first clause of the preceding Sect. 8 , which grants unlimited powers of taxation , but also to the other clauses on the same subject , which are restrictions , not upon the power , but on the manner in which it shall be exercised . Such a construction would violate the rule of interpretation above quoted , that the intention of the law is to be gathered from its context and subject-matter . It is also to be inferred from the " effects and consequences , or the reason and spirit of the law . " These we have already discussed . We have endeavored to show that the effect of our interpretation of the clause in question would be to produce that equality and uniformity in the distribution both of the burdens and benefits of taxation which the Constitution manifestly designed , as well in the grant of the power as in the restrictions imposed upon it , and which is in harmony with the " reason and spirit " that pervade and control , not a part only , but the whole of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , satisfied with the conclusion , that , in a time of need and peril to the nation , Congress , in order to save it , has absolute control over the whole of its resources , and that no amendment to the Constitution is necessary , as its framers did not commit the error of setting limits to a power " destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitatioii . " Nevertheless , the idea prevails that Congress has no authority to tax exports . Such also is the opinion expressed by our most eminent writers on constitutional law , Kent , Story , and Rawle ; and , if we may judge from the debates , so thought and intended the majority of the Convention that made the Constitution . The subject is of grave importance . A judicious tax on exports at this time would throw upon the foreign purchaser a large portion of a burden which presses injuriously upon the industry and business of the country and on the comforts of every individual . The burden is likely to increase , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which are now withheld . It is worth while , therefore , to inquire what the opinions above referred to really are , and whether they are binding authority on us . The clause restraining the power of the general government over exports was one of what are called the " compromises of the Constitution . " The Southern States , or rather Georgia and North and South Carolina , insisted upon the perpetuity of the slave-trade and of slavery , the representation of three fifths of their slaves , and the exemption of exports from taxation , as conditions precedent to their entering into the Union . They demanded them peremptorily , and threatened , if these terms were not granted , to prevent the Union of the States , as they have since threatened , from time to time , to destroy it . They were only too successful . They had the power to defeat a great and noble enterprise , to disappoiiit hopes dear to a generous and aspiring people , to blast the promise of a mighty future . They knew their power and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , on the interests of their section . They knew how anxious were the men associated with them in the work of creating a nation that their undertaking should not fail , and how deeply they felt the responsibility resting on // their labors . Much , doubtless , would be conceded by them , rather than behold their hopes vanish and the chaos of anarchy that would ensue . Much was conceded , much that ought to have been withheld at any risk , for some of the points yielded compromised the eternal principles of truth and justice ; and these ought never to be sacrificed , - caiinot be , indeed , without due punishment sooner or later . The punishment has come at last , and it has fallen chiefly where it was richly merited , - on the South . They could not see it at the time ; but the result has shown that the march of Sherman through Georgia and South Carolina last winter , and the surrender of Charleston and Savannah , were connected , in the relation of cause and effect , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , also , are the many battle-fields of this war , on which so much Northern blood has been shed , and the heavy load of debt and taxation it has imposed on us and on our posterity , connected in a like relation with the concessions of the Northern members , - concessions which violated their own sense of right , and contradicted their avowed sentiments . They sought to establish a great nation , but against their own convictions , forgetting that a nation is a moral being , they embodied in its structure a great wrong , destined to destroy their work . The wrong has destroyed it for a time , and will keep it a ruin forever , unless it can be done away . Let us hope that it will be , nay , that it has been done away , and that we may rebuild on surer foundations the stately edifice of our ancestors . The South got the slave-trade , but only for twenty years ; it got slavery ; it got the representation of three fifths of the slaves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of these was warmly contested in the Convention . The dogma that there could rightfully be property in men was denied , and both slavery and the slave-trade were denounced as criminal and destructive to the best interests of society . But our present topic is the prohibition of duties on exports . This was a question of expediency , involving no moral principle . Some of the most eminent mcmbers of the Convention - Madison , Gouverneur Morris , John Dickinson , Clymer , &amp;c. - argued that the power to tax exports was proper in itself ; that such a tax was often less burdensome and more productive than duties on im // ports , more especially where some of the productions of a country were peculiar to it and in universal demand , as was the case with some of ours ; that the power to lay such a tax was an essential prerogative of government , the exercise of which , even if not now proper , might become of the utmost importance hereafter , for revenue , for the encouragement of domestic manufactures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny the power would take from the government half the regulation of trade ; that the Convention were providing , not for the present only , hut for a distant future , and therefore it would be unwise to prohibit such a tax forever . ( 3 Madison Papers , 1383 , 1388 , 1395 . ) These arguments , however , did not prevail . The clause as it now stands was passed , and passed too , it must be confessed , with the understanding that it prohibited the tax . Clearly , however , such is not its meaning . But it was the meaning of the clause , " No tax shall be laid on articles exported from the States , " in Mr. Piuckney 's plan , already mentioned , and which was referred to a committee . That committee altered its language and substituted the words " from any State . " This change could not have been accidental . Obviously it not only narrowed , hut wholly changed , the character of the former clause . The one was an absolute denial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted only as to the manner in which it was to be exercised . How did it happen , therefore , that the Convention rejected the former , which unquestionably is prohibitory , and voted for the latter , which as plainly is not ? It is difficult to answer this question , as our reports of the debates are neither full nor accurate . Perhaps the change in phraseology was not noticed , perhaps some may have been willing to let it go to the people to be afterwards interpreted by them ; and others , who voted for it only to secure the Union , may " have seen lurking beneath the text what commended it to their judgment , against even present interest . " Possibly also the clause may have been left in its present shape through the inadvertence of the committee of detail . The Convention had under debate the draft of a constitution reported on the 6th of August . In it , Art . 7 , Sect. 4 , are the words , " No tax or duty shall be laid // on articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vote taken on this section say ( 3 Madison Papers , 1388 ) : " On the question on Art . 7 , Sect. 4 , as far as to No tax shall be laid on exports , ' it passed in the affirmative : Massachusetts , Connecticut , Maryland , Virginia ( General Washington and M* . Miadison , No ) , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , A ye , -7 ; New Hampshire , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , No , - 4 . " It would seem from this that the words , " from any State , " were intended to he left out hy the Convention , and that the words above quoted , emphatically excluding all exports , had been suhstituted in some previous debate , or in the debate of the same day , without attracting the attention of Mr. Madison , who merely noted the result . If this were the case , it was an accidental oversight of the committee of detail to report the clause in its present shape . Leaving this problem unsolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real intention of the founders ,  --  the purpose and motive by which they were governed . Evidently their first and general purpose was to secure equality of taxation , - to protect any State or section from oppression by the government . Their second and special purpose was to do this by a total prohibition of taxes on exports . The second was to the first as means to object . The first , being founded on justice , is in its nature above argument and unchangeable . The second , being founded on expediency , is by its nature always open to discussion , and its propriety must necessarily vary with the changes of time . Moreover , the primary intention , being founded on reason , was freely and spontaneously entertained , whilst the secondary was extorted by a threat . Time has shown the wisdom of those members of the Convention who spoke and voted against the prohibition . It was a mistake to tie up the hands of the government , to refuse adequate power for necessary purposes , to attempt to fetter the unknown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government now needs all the resources of the country ; and to withhold them cripples its ability to defend and preserve itself and the nation , - the chief object for which governments are created . Which , then , ought we to take as our guide , the general or the special , the paramount or the subordinate , intention of the // founders ? Shall we seek to execute their design only by the means they were forced to adopt , now that those means are no longer expedient , or , looking to what in their plan is permanent and disregarding the transient , endeavor to carry it out by means that suit our present circumstances , and which they have left to us , - the letter and spirit of the Constitution which they made ? The debates of the Convention are full of historical interest , and are most valuable aids to a proper understanding of the Constitution . They show how , by successive touches , it was gradually moulded from a vague and rude outline into symmetrical shape , as the statue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of our plan of government , and reveal the process by which it drew the materials of its structure from the thought and knowledge and experience of its founders , as the oak draws from the riches of earth and air the stuff of which it is made . But neither the debates nor contemporary interpretation are authority , however useful they may be " to illustrate and confirm the text , to explain a doubtful phrase , or to expound an obscure clause . " No point is better settled than this . ( Story 's Coin. , 407 . ) The Constitution , which is the matured result of the debates and judicial construction of it , is alone authority ; and for this plain reason , that , although the Convention made the Constitution , the people adopted it , and their adoption made it the law . The people had before them the Constitution only , not the debates . These were not published till long after the Constitution was ratified ,  --  the notes of Yates and Lansing in 1821 , those of Mr. Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the written law , not the conflicting opinions and heated discussion out of which that law grew . And this was all that the Convention intended they should have , for they determined to keep even their journals secret . ( 3 Madison Papers , 1604 . ) It was proposed that they should either be destroyed or placed in the custody of the President , which latter proposition was carried , and he was directed to retain them , " subject to the order of Congress , if ever formed under the Constitution . " If the debates and the interpretation of contemporary founders are not to be held as authority , neither are the mere dicta // of the courts nor the opinions of elementary writers on the law , however eminent . As no tax on exports has ever been laid by the general gov*ernment , no case has occurred involving the constitutionality of such a tax . In Hylton v. The United States , 3 Dallas , 171 , the question before the court related to the nature of direct taxes , and it was incidentally stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the point was not connected with the case , and was not argued . Judge Kent , in referring to that case , simply quotes the statement of the court , also without giving any reason . Congress , he says , " had plenary power over every species of taxable property , except exports . " ( 1 Kent 's Coin. , 240 . ) Mr. ilawle uses almost precisely the same language , ( Rawle on the Constitution , 74 , ) yet on page 111 , after quoting the clause in question , he says : " The leading principle of the Constitution is uniformity in respect to the several States so far as it can be obtained . The natural and artificial products of States are different . To lay a general duty on the exports of rice , or cotton , or tobacco , would affect only the Southern States ; on flour and grain , only the Middle States ; and on domestic manufactures , would operate chiefly on the Northern and Eastern States engaged in them ; - yet , without this restriction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that which the language of the clause lie was discussing imposes ,  --  the prohibition of duties on the exports of any State , the plain object of which is to secure that uniformity which , as he says , is the leading principle of the Constitution . Such is the obvious meaning of Mr. IRawle 's words , and possibly that which he intended ; for it is not inconsistent with what he says on page 74 , as the clause referred to does put some restriction on the " full power " of Congress over exports . Judge Story , however , after giving a similar explanation , for which he refers to Mr. Rawle , arrives at a different conclusion . When treating of the clause relating to duties on exports , and forbidding a preference of the ports of one State over those of another , lie says ( the italics are ours ) , Sect. 1014 : " The obvious object of these provisions is to prevent any possibility of applying the power to lay taxes or regulate commerce injuriously to the interests of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . If Congress were allowed to lay a tax on exports from any one State , it might unreasonably injure , or even destroy , the staple productions or common articles of that State . The inequality of such a tax would be extreme , " &amp;c . To prevent that inequality , one would think from this , was plainly the design , as it is the meaning , of the law . Yet immediately afterwards he says , " The power is therefore whol.ly taken away to intermeddle with the subject of exports . " He might as well have said that because , in the same clause , it is declared that " No preference shall be given , by any regulation of commerce or revenue , to the ports of one State over those of another , " Congress is prohibited from appointing any ports of eiitry at all . Whence did Judge Story get the idea that Congress is forbidden to iiitermeddle with exports ? Clearly not from the Constitution , for in the extract above given he had just put a different construction upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the Constitution . He knew from contemporary authority that such was the intention of the Convention ; and what he says must be regarded , not as an interpretation , but as the statement of an historical fact . Perhaps , had his attention been drawn to the real meaning of the law , by the stress of our present troubles , he would have reached a different conclusion . Whether the absolute denial of authority over exports to Congress was approved by him , he does not say . Probably not ; for he has denounced more than once , in his great and valuable work on the Constitution , the error of refusing to a government necessary power because it may possibly be abused . The history of the country has shown that the national government , as Hamilton and Madison predicted , is in far more danger from the , sectional selfishness , pride , and jealousy of the States , than they are from its power . State power destroyed the Confederation , State arrogance caused the war which for a time at least destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever oppress any State is a delusion . The attempt would rouse at once all the popular passions that are connected with State rights ; and how violent and sensitive these passions are , we have reason to know . No State , moreover , is isolated . It is connected by interest , intercourse , // geographical position , and manners with its immediate neighbors , and with them forms groups of States ; and the tendency of these is to crystallize more and more definitely into sections . Thus we have the South , the East , the Middle States , the Southwest , the Northwest , each powerful and growing in strength , each ready to resist an attack upon one of its members , and each able , by throwing its weight in favor of one of the political parties that divide the people , to secure to that party the control of the government . Thus it has happened that , by holding the balance of power , the Slave States , though a minority , and becoming always , relatively to the Free States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Mr. Stephens , late Vice-President of what Rebels and Democrats call " the Confederate States , " said in 1860 , almost always to rule the country , to enjoy most of the time the principal offices , to direct or greatly influence at all times the policy of the nation , and to interpret the Constitution to suit their own views and designs . The opinions of the founders and of eminent writers on the law are no doubt the source of the generally received notion , that a tax on exports would be unconstitutional . We have therefore endeavored to show the true character of those opinions at greater length than may seem necessary to some , since no one can regard them as binding authority on Congress or the courts , or on the nation . On this point , therefore , the Constitution is presented to us just as it was presented to the people of 1787 . They adopted it as they understood it , and we are at liberty to interpret it as we understand it . We are not bound by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a construction upon it as may suit our circumstances and accord also with its letter and spirit . Such must be the rule for interpreting ' the Constitution , which was intended not for the people of 1787 only , but for all that should come after them . It is virtually adopted by each successive generation , and belongs not to the past , but to the present and the future , and must satisfy the wants of the constantly shiftiug present , or be altered or destroyed . The process of alteration provided by the Constitution itself is difficult and cumbersome , and not always possible . It should be resorted to // only when urgent necessity demands an amendment , and the language of the law is too plain to be construed so as to meet that necessity , as is the case with slavery . It is well not to familiarize the minds of the people with the idea of change , which in laws should be silent and gradual , like the changes of time . Interpretation , therefore , to suit the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible . By this process the Constitution may be slowly and insensibly moulded by the wants and opinions of the people . Let us make our Constitution a protecting vesture for the living , not a fetter imposed by the dead , so that it may receive the love and reverence of successive generations of the living , and thus endure forever .
