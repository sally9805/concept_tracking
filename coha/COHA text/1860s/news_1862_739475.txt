txt It will be remembered that a few days ago we reported tho decision of the Provost Judge , directing the Bank of Louisiana to pay to a depositor , in rrent funds , the amount of his deposit made in Confeuerate money , which the banks themselves had made currency , Dy receiving and paying it um at their counters . The bank appealed fr out thie ruing to Gen. BUTLER , and here is the General 's decision , sustaining the view taken by the Provost Judge : HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT or WIZ GULF , Navy-ormserts , Lre , J une , 1862 . In the matter of the appeal of W. N. Meacea , President , and AtidUsTE ilioNriusen. , Cashier , of the Bank of Louisiana . defendants , from the judgment of the Provost Court , upon the complaint of A. DURAND , complainant . This is an application by the defendants representing the Bank , made to the General Commanding , asking him to revise and set aside the judgment or the Provost Court , made in favor of the plaintiff , DuRAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all matters within garrison , camp , and perhaps geographical military department , wherein martial law has been declared , the power of the Commanding General is absolute , and that , looking to him as the representative of the martial power of the Government here , all applications for redress must be made when any wrong is supposed to have been done . This view being sound , so far as I can see , I have , with the best thought possible under the circumstances , reexamined the case and the reasons assigned for the appeal . Error is claimed on two grounds ; first , that the Provost Court had no jurisdiction of the cause ; and second , that the judgment was not in accordance with the law which should govern its decision . The argument assumes that law to be Generej Order No. 30 , and does not dispute the authority which made , or the effect of that order , hut contents itself with endeavoring to construe the order . The objection to the jurisdiction of the Court is put upon two grounds  --  first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject matter ; second , that the proper parties were not before it , so as to enable it to act with regard to the rights of those who were not summoned in the case . It is said that this question , being one of a right of property , can not be entertained by a court which only acts to punish the infraction of military orders and police regulations . A technical answer to this objection , which is in the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction , would be that It does not appear this plea was put in till after the hearing upon the merits . It is a familiar rule that a party shall not be allowed to go into court and have a hearing on his , case , take the chances of a decision in his favor , and then , If adverse , repudiate the court before which lie has appeared , and to whose judgment be has submitted his cause . This rule has been hold very strictly , both as to jurisdiction over the subject minter and the parties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work injustice , a technical answer is not sefficient. 01 what , men , do the defendants complain ? The Bank says the Court has made an order which takes away the property of the Bank and gives it to another , and that the Court has no power so to act . But is that so ? Is it not the Commanding General 's order which clues that of which complaint is made ? The Bank nowhere complains that the General has not the power to make such an order , if , in his judgment , it becomes a military necessity , and that some order en the subject matter was so is shown by the fact that the first question out to him upon entering the city was , what currency would be provided for the people , to save them from starvation and bread riots . It has passed into history that lie permitted a vicious currency as a medium of circulation , for the purpose of meeting this exigency . Again , it will be remembered that the Bank now claims that it is exempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another military commander in September last . ( there was no civil taw fur it , ) It was &attired; to suspend specie payments , against its will , and substitute Confederate notes for its daily currency instead of its own bills . This order was submitted to , if not with joy , at least not under protest , so far as I am informed . thT , thtehoerBdearn , kassh all payas the law of the lane ! , then , is pay its depositors in gold , silver coin and United States Treasury notes , or its own bills . A citizen complains that this order of the Cornmendieg General has not been obeyed , to his prejudice . For what , then , is a Provost Court , in military phrase , constituted ? Confessedly , to inquire into , determine and punish the infraction of military orders . To do this , the Court must act in rent as well as in pers2narn . A familiar example would he , if the Commanding-General orders all arms to be given up , and Some citizen neglects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jurisdiction of a Provost Court , although its judgment should act upon a right of property involving millions of dollars worth of muskets It the act brought before the Court , therefore , is alleged to be an infraction of a military order , it is determinable in a military Court . Again , it is said that the Court has not jurisdiction , because the stockholders of the Bank were not summoned in and made parties , and that their rights and interests will be affected by the decision . This is all true . But did the teamed counsel for the Bank ever hear of a suit against a Bank , in any Court , where the stockholders were summoned in , unless It was sought to charge them individually , which is not the case here . A corporation acts through its authorized agents , and Is bound by their acts , and is to be charged upon notice to them . This objection of want of sufficient power in the President and Directors of the Bank of Louisiana to pay the depositor , Mr. DURAND , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of indebtedness from a depositor to a bill-holder. under toe order of the Provost Court , without tae consent of their stockholders , would provoke a smite in a less serious discussion , when we remember that this same board of Directors , without risking leave of their stockholders , against law and right , put $3,000 , e00 of its bullion out of their hands and out of the State , whence they will probably never see it again . I am of opit:ion that these objections to the jurisdiction of the Court are untenable . The other objection as to the inerils of the decision can , it seems to me , be tF. , pof.e.I of in a word . If the order is a proper one , It must be obeyed . Its propriety can not be discussed by me . It is admitted that DURAND is a depositor in the bank of what the bank chose to take as money  --  treated as money  --  credited to him as money  --  nav , forced upon the community as money . He has not been paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The decision , following the letter of the order , is that the bank may give him their own bills instead of money . Of that decision the bank has no cause to rota vl a i n . DURAND is now the creditor of the bank as a depositor . The decision makes him their creditor as a billholder . In equity they have nothing to complain of ? he may have , because he does not get his gold , to which . by the laws of banking , laws of the State and the United States , he is entitled . He does not seek to reverse the decision . Let it stand .
