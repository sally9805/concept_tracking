ART . VIII . -1 . The President 's Miessage on the Peace Negotiation , presented to Congress , February 10 , 1865. 2 . The Inaugurat Address , Miarch 4 , 1865 . IN the glare of our civil war , certain truths , hitherto unobserved or guessed at merely , have been brought out with extraordinary sharpness of relief ; and two of them have been specially impressive , the one for European observers , the other for ourselves . The first , and perhaps the most startling to th' Old World watcher of the political skies , upon whose field of* vision the flaming sword of our Western heavens grew from a misty speck to its full comet-like proportions , perplexing them with fear of change , has been the amazing strength and no less amazing steadiness of democratic institutions . An army twice lqrger than England , with the help of bounties , drafts , and the purchase of foreign vagabonds , ever set in the field during the direst stress of her struggle with Napoleon , has been raised in a single year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of heavy taxes not only devotes to the public service sums gathered by private subscription that in any other country would be deemed fabulous , but by sheer force of public opinion compels its legislators to the utmost ingenuity and searchingness of taxation . What was uttered as a sarcasm on the want of public spirit in Florence is her*e only literally true - " Many refuse to bear the common burden ; But thy solicitous people answereth Unasked , and cries , I bend my back to it . " ' And that the contrast may be felt in its fullest completeness , we must consider that no private soldier is tempted into the ranks by hopes of plunder , or driven into them by want of fair wages for fair work , - that no officer can look forward to the splendid prizes of hereditary wealth and title . Love of their country was the only incentive , its gratitude their only reward . And in the matter of taxation also , a willingness to help bear the common burden has more of generosity in it where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of their daily toil , and not a hoard inherited without merit , as without industry . // Nor have the qualities which lead to such striking results been exhibited oniy by the North . The same public spirit , though misled by wicked men for selfish ends , has shown itself in almost equal strength at the South . And in both cases it has been unmistakably owing to that living and active devotion of the people to institutions in whose excellence they share , and their habit of obedience to laws of their own making . If we have not hitherto had that conscious feeling of nationality , the ideal abstract of history and tradition , which belongs to older countries , compacted by frequent war and united by memories of common danger and common triumph , it has been simply because our national existence has never been in such peril as to force upon us the conviction that it was both the title-deed of our greatness and its only safeguard . But what splendid possibilities has not our trial revealed even to ourselves ! What costly stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state whose life is not narrowly concentred in a despot or a class , but feels itself in every limb ; a government which is not a mere application of force from without , but dwells as a vital principle in the will of every citizeii . Our enemies - and wherever a man is to be found bribed by an abuse , or who profits by a political superstition , we have a natural enemy - have striven to laugh and sneer and lie this apparition of royal manhood out of existence . They conspired our murder ; but in this vision is the prophecy of a dominion which is to push them from their stools , and whose crown doth sear their eyeballs . America lay asleep , like the princess of the fairy tale , enchanted by prosperity ; but at the first fiery kiss of war the spell is broken , the blood tingles along her veins again , and she awakes conscious of her beauty and her sovereignty . It is true that , by the side of the self-devotion and public spirit , the vices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will and must . We have had shoddy , we have had contracts , we have had substitute-brokerage , we have had speculators in patriotism , and , still worse , in military notoriety . Men have striven to make the blood of our martyrs the seed of wealth or office . But in times of public and universal extremity , when habitual standards of action no longer serve , and ordinary currents of thought are swamped in the flood of // enthusiasm or excitement , it always happens that the evil passions of some men are stimulated by what serves only to exalt the nobler qualities of others . In such epochs , evil as well as good is exaggerated . A great social convulsion shakes up the lees which underlie society , forgotten because quiescent , and the stimulus of calamity brings out the extremes of human nature , whether for good or evil . What is especially instructive in the events we have been witnessing for the past four years , is the fact that the people have been the chief actors in the drama . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have not been involved in war by the passions or interests of their rulers , but deliberately accepted the ordeal of battle in defence of institutions which were the work of their own hands , and of whose beneficence experience had satisfied them . Loyalty has hitherto been a sentiinent rather than a virtue ; it has been more often a superstition or a prejudice than a conviction of the conscience or the understanding . Now for the first time it is identical with patriotism , and has its seat in the brain , and not the blood . It has before been picturesque , devoted , beautiful , as forgetfulness of self always is , but now it is something more than all these , - it is logical . Here we have testimony that can not be gainsaid to the universal vitality and intelligence which our system diffuses with healthy pulse through all its members . Every man feels himself a part and not a subject of the government , and can say in a truer and higher sense than Louis XIV. , " I am the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon . Let us be thankful that we have passed beyond that period of political development when such productions are necessary , or even possible . It is but another evidence of the excellence of the democratic principle . Where power is the privilege of a class or of a single person , it may be usurped ; but where it is the expression of the common will , it can no more be monopolized than air or light . The ignorant and unreasoning force of a populace , sure of losing nothing and with a chance of gaining something by any change , that restless material out of which violent revolutions are made , if it exist here at all , is to be found only in our great cities , among a class who have learned in other countries to look upon all law as their natural enemy . // Nor is it by any fault of American training , but by the want of it , that these people are what they are . When Lord Derby says that the government of this country is at the mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demagogue is no exclusive product of a democracy , or that England would be in less danger of war if her governing class knew something less of ancient Greece and a little more of modern America . Whether or no there be any truth in the assertion that democracy tends to bring men down to a common level ( as it surely brings them up to one ) , we shall not stop to inquire , for the world has not yet had a long enou6li experience of it to warrant any safe conclusion . During our Revolutionary stiKiggle , it seems to us that both our civil and military leaders coinpare very well in point of ability with the British product of the same period , and the same thing may very well be true at the present time . But while it may be the glory , it can hardly be called the duty of a country to produce great men ; and if forms of polity have anything to do in the matter , we should incline to prefer that which could make a great nation felt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , to one which stunted the many that a few favored specimens might grow the taller and fairer . People of more sensitive organizations may be shocked , but we are glad that in this our true war of independence , which is to free us forever from the Old World , we have had at the head of our affairs a man whom America made , as God made Adam , out of the very earth , unancestried , unprivileged , unknown , to show us how much truth , how much magnanimity , and how much statecraft await the call of opportunity in simple manhood when it believes in the justice of God and the worth of man . Conventionalities are all very well in their proper place , but they shrivel at the touch of nature like stubble in the fire . The genius that sways a nation by its arbitrary will seems less august to us than that which multiplies and reinforces itself in the instincts and convictions of an entire people . Autocracy may have something in it more melodramatic than this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been brought against us as an accusation abroad , and repeated here by people who measure their country rather by // what is thought of it than by what it is , that our war has not been distinctly and avowedly for the extinction of slavery , but a war rather for the preservation of our national power and greatness , in which the emancipation of the negro has been forced upon us by circumstances and accepted as a necessity . We are very far from denying this ; nay , we admit that it is so far true that we were slow to renounce our constitutional obligations even toward those who had absolved us by their own act from the letter of our duty . We are speaking of the goveminent which , legally installed for the whole country , was bound , so long as it was possible , not to overstep the limits of orderly prescription , and could not , without abnegating its own very nature , take the lead in making rebellion an excuse for revolution . There were , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as simple a thing to do as to lead off a Virginia reel . They forgot what should be forgotten least of all in a system like ours , that the administration for the time being represents not only the majority which elects it , but the minority as well , - a minority in this case powerful , and so little ready for emancipation that it was opposed even to war . Mr. Lincoln had not been chosen as general agent of an antislavery society , but President of the Uiiited States , to perform certain functions exactly defined by law . Whatever were his wishes , it was no less duty than policy to mark out for himself a line of action which would not further distract the country , by raising before their time questions which it was plain would soon enough compel attention , and for which every day was making the answer more easy . While this was necessarily the attitude of the government , it is also true that the people ran before it , and were moved by a deeper impulse than the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to the public till , and the bounty which drew our best soldiers to the ranks was an idea . The game was the ordinary game of war , and they but the unreasoning pieces on the board ; but they felt that a higher reason was moving them in a game where the stake was the life not merely of their country , but of a principle whose rescue was to make America in very deed a New World , the cradle of a fairer manhood . Weakness was to be no longer // the tyrant 's opportunity , but the victim 's claim ; labor should never henceforth be degraded as a curse , but honored as that salt of the earth which keeps life sweet , and gives its savor to duty . To be of good family should mean being a child of the one Father of us all ; and good birth , the being born into God 's world , and not into a fool 's paradise of man 's invention . But even had this moral leaven been wanting , had the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been well content to claim as the result of democracy , that for the first time in the history of the world it had mustered an army that knew for what it was fighting . Nationality is no dead abstraction , no unreal sentiment , but a living and operative virtue in the heart and moral nature of men . It enlivens the dullest soul with an ideal out of and beyond itself , lifting every faculty to a higher level of vision and action . It enlarges the narrowest intellect with a fealty to something better than self . It emancipates men from petty and personal interests , to make them conscious of sympathies whose society ennobles . Life has a deeper meaning when its throb beats time to a common impulse and catches its motion from the general heart . But while the experience of the last four years has been such , with all its sorrows , as to make us proud of our strength and grateful for the sources of it , we can not but feel that peace will put to the test those higher qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the country our arms have regained ? It is by our conduct in this stewardship , and not by our rights under the original compact of the States , that our poiicy is to be justified . The glory of conquest is trifling and barren , unless victory clear the way to a higher civilization , a more solid prosperity , and a Union based upon reciprocal benefits . In what precise manner the seceding States shall return , whether by inherent right , or with some preliminary penaiice and ceremony of readoption , is of less consequence than what they shall be after their return . Dependent provinces , sullenly submitting to a destiny which they loathe , would be a burden to us , rather than an increase of strength or an element of prosperity . War would have won us a peace stripped of all the advantages that make peace a blessing . We should have so much more territory , and so much less substantial greatness . We did not enter // upon war to open a new market , or fresh fields for speculators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the experiment of democracy from destructiou , and put it in a fairer way of success by removing the single disturbing element . Our business now is not to allow ourselves to be turned aside from a purpose which our experieuce thus far has demonstrated to have been as wise as it was necessary , and to see to it that , whatever be the other conditions of reconstruction , democracy , which is our real strength , receive no detriment . We would not be understood to mean that Congress should lay down in advance a fixed rule not to be departed from to suit the circumstances of special cases as they arise . What may do very well for Tennessee may not be as good for South Carolina . Wise statesmanship does not so much consist in the agreement of its forms with any abstract ideal , however perfect , as in its adaptation to the wants of the governed and its capacity of shaping itself to the wants of the thne* It is not to be judged by its intention , but by its results , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its theoretic excellence . The Anglo-Saxon soundness of understanding has shown itself in nothing more clearly than in allowing institutions to be formulated gradually by custom , convenience , or necessity , and in preferring the practical comfort of a system that works , to the French method of a scientific machinery of perpetual motion , demonstrably perfect in all its parts , and yet refusing to go . We do not wish to see scientific treatment , however admirable , applied to the details of reconstruction , if that is to be , as now seems probable , the mmext problem that is to try our intelligence and firmness . But there are certain points , it seems to us , on which it is important that public opinion should come to some sort of understanding in advance . The peace negotiations have becim of service in demonstrating that it is not any ill blood engendered by war , any diversity of interests properly national , any supposed antagonism of race , but simply the slaveliolding class , that now stands between us and peace , as four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Divine right could make no lasting truce with the French Revolution , the Satanic right of the stronger to enslave the weaker can come to no understanding with de // mocracy . The conflict is in the things , not in the men , and one or the other must abdicate . Of course the leaders , to whom subniission would be ruin , and a few sincere believers in the doctrine of State rights , are willing to sacrifice even slavery for independence , a word which has a double meaning for some of them ; but there can be no doubt that an offer to receive the seceding States back to their old position under the Constitation would have put the war party in a hopeless minority at the South . We think there are manifest symptoms that the chinks made by the four years ' struggle have let in new light to the Southern people , however it may be with their ruling faction , and that they begin to suspect a diversity of interest between themselves , who chiefly suffer by the war , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own . However that may be , the late proposal of Davis and Lee for the arming of slaves , though they certainly did not so intend it , has removed a very serious obstacle from our path . It is true that the emancipating clause was struck out of the act as finally passed by the shadowy Congress at llichmond . But this was only for the sake of appearances . Once arm and drill the negroes , and they can never be slaves again . This is admitted on all hands , and accordingly , whatever the words of the act may be , it practically at once promotes the negro to manhood by brevet , as it were , but at any rate to manhood . For the offer of emancipation as a bounty implies reason in him to whom it is offered ; nay , more , implies a capacity for progress and a wish for it , which are in themselves valid titles to freedom . This at a step puts the South back to the position held by her greatest mcii in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness of things , all the physiological demonstrations , all Mr. Stephens 's corner-stones , Ham , Oiiesimus , heels , hair , and facial angle , -* all are swept omit , by one flirt of the besom of Fate , into the inexorable limbo of things that were and never should have been . I-low is Truth wounded to death in the house of her frieiids ! The highest authority of the South has deliberately renounced its vested interest in time curse of Noah , and its right to make beasts of black men because St. Paul sent back a white one to his master . Never wa6 there a more exact verification of the SpammiTh proverb , that // he who went out for wool may come back shorn . Alas for Nott and Gliddon ! Thrice alas for Bishop Hopkins ! With slavery they lose their hold on the last clew by which human reason could find its way to a direct proof of the benevolence of God and the plenary inspiration of Scripture . All that we have learned of the blacks during the war makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the master 's tyranny over the rest seem so futile , and the arguments urged against it by Mr. Gholson and Mr. Hunter are so convincing , that we can hardly persuade ourselves that the authors of it did not intend it to make the way easier , not to independence , but to reunion . It is said to argue desperation on the part of the chief conspirators at Richmond , and it undoubtedly does ; but we see in what we believe to be the causes of their despair something more hopeful than the mere exhaustion it indicates . It is simply incredible that the losses of four years ' war should have drained the fighting men of a population of five millions , or anything like it ; and the impossibility of any longer filling the Rebel armies even by the most elaborate system of pressgangs proves to our mind that the poorer class of whites have for some reason or other deserted the cause of the wealthy planters . The men are certainly there , but they have lost all stomach for fighting . Here again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement more easy than it would have been even a year ago . Though the fact that so large a proportion of the Southern people can not read makes it harder to reach them , yet our soldiers have circulated among them like so many Northern newspapers , and it is impossible that this intercourse , which has been constant , should not have suggested to them many ideas of a kind which their treacherous guides would gladly keep from them . The frantic rage of Southern members of Congress against such books as Helper 's can be explained only by their fear lest their poorer constituents should be , set a-thinking , for the notion of corrupting a fieldhand by an Abolition document is too absurd even for a Wigfall or a Charleston editor . Here , then , are two elements of a favorable horoscope for our future ; - an acknowledgment of the human nature of the negro by the very Sanhedrim of the South , thus removing his // case from the cout't of ethics to that of political economy ; and a suspicion on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes them readier to see and to accept what is right . We do not mean to say that there is any very large amount of even latent Unionism at the South , but we believe there is plenty of material in solution there which waits only to be precipitated into whatever form of crystal we desire . We must not forget that the main elements of Southern regeneration are to be sought in the South itself , and that such elements are abundant . A people that has shown so much courage and constancy in a bad cause , because they believed it a good one , is worth winning even by the sacrifice of our natural feeling of resentment . If we forgive the negro for his degradation and his ignorance , in consideration of the system of which he has been the sacrifice , we ought also to make every allowance for the evil influence of that system upon the poor whites . It is the fatal necessity of all wrong to revenge itself upon those who are guilty of it , or even accessory to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny . The eternal justice makes the balance even ; and as the sufferer by unjust laws is lifted above his physical abasement by spiritual compensations and that nearness to God which only suffering is capable of , in like measure are the material advantages of the wrong-doer counterpoised by a moral impoverishment . Our duty is not to punish , but to repair ; and the cure must work both ways , emancipating the master from the slave , as well as the slave from the master . Once rid of slavery , which was the real criminal , let us have no more reproaches , justifiable only while the Southern sin made us its forced accomplices ; and while we bind up the wounds of our black brother who had fallen among thieves that robbed him of his rights as a man , let us not harden our hearts against our white brethren , from whom interest and custom , those slier knaves , whose fingers we have felt about our own pockets , had stolen away their conscience and their sense of human brotherhood . The first question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstructioii is , What is to be done about the negro ? After the war is over , there will be our Old Maii of the Sea , as ready to ride us as ever . If we only emancipate him , // he will not let us go free . We must do something more than merely this . While the suffering from them is still sharp , we should fix it in our miiids as a principle , that the evils which have come upon us are the direct and logical consequence of our forefathers having dealt with a question of man as they would with one of trade or territory , - as if the rights of others were something susceptible of compromise , - as if the laws that govern the moral , and , through it , the material world , would stay their operation for our convenience . It is well to keep this present in the mind , because in the general joy and hurry of peace we shall be likely to forget it again , and to make concessions , or to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time has settled the blunders of our ancestors . Let us concede everything except what does not belong to us , but is only a trust-property , namely , the principle of democracy and the prosperity of the future involved in its normal development . We take it for granted at the outset , that the mind of the country is made up as to making no terms with slavery in any way , large or limited , open or covert . Not a single good quality traceable to this system has been brought to light in the white race at the South by the searching test of war . In the black it may have engendered that touching piety of which we have had so many proofs , and it has certainly given them the unity of interest and the sympathy of intelligence which make them everywhere our friends , and which have saved them from compromising their advantage , arid still further complicating the difficulties of civil war by insurrectioii . But what have been its effects upon the ruling class , which is after all the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish , cruel , and false , to a degree unparalleled in history . So far from having given them any special fitness for rule , it has made them incapable of any but violent methods of government , and unable to deal with the simplest problems of political economy . An utter ignorance of their own countrymen at the North led them to begin the war , and an equal misconception of Europe encouraged them to continue it . That they have shown courage is true , but that is no exclusive property of theirs , and the military advantage they seemed to possess is due less to any superiority of their own , than to the extent of their territory and // the roadless wildernesses which are at once the reproach and the fortification of their wasteful system of agriculture . Their advantages in war have been in proportion to their disadvantages in peace , and it is peace which most convincingly tries both the vigor of a nation and the wisdom of its polity . It is with this class that we shall have to deal in arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a broad view of the interests of the whole country and of the great mass of the Southern people , whose ignorance and the prejudices consequent from it made it so easy to use them as the instruments of their own ruin . No immediate advantage must blind us to the real objects of the war , - the securing our external power and our internal tranquillity , and the making them inherent and indestructible by founding them upon the common welfare . The first condition of permanent peace is to render those who were the great slaveholders when the war began , and who will be the great landholders after it is over , powerless for mischief . What punishment should be inflicted on the chief criminals is a matter of little moment . The South has received a lesson of suffering which satisfies all the legitimate ends of punishment , and as for vengeaimce , it is contrary to our miational temper and the spirit of our government . Our great object should be , not to weaken , but to strengthen the South , - to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat the stupid and fatal blunder of slaveholding publicists , that the wealth and power of one portion of the country are a drain upon the resources of the rest , instead of being their natural feeders and invigorators . Any general confiscation of Rebel property , therefore , seems to us unthrifty housekeeping , for it is really a levying on our own estate , and lessening our own resources . The people of the Southern States will be called upon to bear their part of the grievous burden of taxation which the war will leave upon our shoulders , and that is the fairest , as well as the most prudent , way of making them contribute to our national solvency . All irregular modes of levying contributions , however just , and exactly just they can seldom be , leave discontent behind them , while a uniform system , where every n-ian knows what he is to pay and why he is to pay it , tends to restore stability by the very evenness of its operatiou , by its mak // ing national interests familiar to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping confiscation , such as has sometimes been proposed in Congress with more heat than judgment , would render the South less available for revenue , would retard the return of industry to its legitimate channels , by lessening its means , and would not destroy the influence of the misgoverning aristocracy . On the contrary , it would give them that prestige of misfortune whose power over the sentiments of mankind is the moral of the story of Stuarts and Bourbons and I3onapartes . Retribution they should have , but let them have it in the only way worthy of a great people to inflict . Let it come in a sense of their own folly and sin , brought about by the magnanimity of their conquerors , by the return of a more substantial prosperity born of the new order of things , so as to convince , instead of alienating . We should remember that it is our coui ' *try which we have regained , and not merely a rebellious faction which we have subdued . Whether it would not be good policy for the general government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to devote the proceeds of their sale to actual settlers toward the payment of the national debt , is worth consideration . Texas alone , on whose public lands our assumption of her indebtedness gives us an equitable claim , would suffice to secure our liabilities and to lighten our taxation , and in all cases of land granted to freedmen no title should vest till a fair price had been paid , - a principle no less essential to their true interests than our own . That these people , who are to be the peasantry of the future Southern States , should be made landholders , is the main condition of a healthy regeneration of that part of the country , and the one warranty of our rightful repossession of it . The wealth that makes a nation really strong , and not merely rich , is the opportunity for industry , intelligence , and well-being of its laboring population . This is the real country of poor men , as the great majority must always be . No glories of war or art , no luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationality where this is wanting . If we free the slave without giving him a right in the soil , and the inducement to industry which this offers , we reproduce only a more specious form of all the old abuses . We leave all political power in the // hands of the wealthy landholders , where it was before . We leave the poorer whites unemancipated , for we leave labor still at the mercy of capital , and with its old stigma of degradation . Blind to the lessons of all experience , we deliberately make the South what Ireland was when Arthur Young travelled there , the country richest in the world by nature , reduced to irredeemable poverty and hopeless weakness by an upper class who would not , and a lower class who could not improve . We have no right to purchase dominion , no right to purchase even abolition , at such a price as that . No uti possidetis conveys any legitimate title , except on the condition of wise administration and mutual benefit . But xviii it be enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters also , that they may have that power of self-protection which no interference of government can so safely , cheaply , and surely exercise in their behalf ? We answer this question in the affirmative , for reasons both of expediency and justice . At best , the difficulty , if not settled now , will come up again for settlement hereafter , when it may not be so easy of solution . As a matter of expediency , it is always wisest to shape a system of policy with a view to permanence , much more than to immediate convenience . When things are put upon a right footing at first , - and the only right footing is one which will meet the inevitable demands of the future as well as the more noisy ones of the present , - all subsidiary relations will of necessity arrange themselves by mutual adaptation , without constantly calling for the clumsy interference of authority . We must leave behind us no expectation and no fear of change , to unsettle men s minds and dishearten their industry . Both the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of things with a sense of its permanence on the one hand and its rightfulness on the other . They will soon learn that neither intelligence can do without labor , nor labor without intelligence , and that wealth will result only from a clearly understood and reciprocally beneficial dependence of each upon the other . Unless we make the black a citizen , we take away from the white the strongest inducement to educate and enlighten him . As a mere proletary , his ignorance is a temptation to the stronger race ; as a voter , it is a dan gerto // Reconstruction . April , them which it becomes their interest to remove . It is easy to manage the mob of New York for the time with grape-shot , but it is the power for evil which their suffrage gives them that will at last interest all classes , by reform and education , to make it a power for good . Under the head of expediency comes also this other consideration , - that , unless made citizens , the emancipated blacks , reckoned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet without power to modify the character of the representatives chosen , will throw so much more power into the hands of men certain to turn it to their disadvantage , and only too likely to use it to our own . This mass , if we leave it inert , may , in any near balance of parties , be enough to crush us ; while , if we endow it with life and volition , if we put it in the way of rising in intelligence and profiting by self-exertion , it will be the best garrison for maintaining the supremacy of our ideas , till they have had time to justify themselves by experience . Have we endur*d and prosecuted this war for the sake of bringing back our old enemies to legislate for us , stronger than ever , with all the resentment and none of the instruction of defeat ? But as a measure of justice . Our answer to the question , What are we to do with the negro ? is short and simple . Give him a fair chance . We must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on the skin , and not on an inward virtue . Our war has been carried on for the principles of democracy , and a cardinal point of those principles is , that the only way in which to fit men for freedom is to make them free , the only way to teach them how to use political power is to give it them . Both South and North have at last conceded the manhood of the negro , and the question now is how we shall make that manhood available and profitable to him and to us . Dcmocracy does not mean , to any intelligent person , an attempt at the impossibility of making one man as good as another . But it certainly does mean the making of one man 's manhood as good as another 's , and the giving to every human being the right of unlimited free trade in all his faculties and acquirements. // We believe the white race , by their intellectual and traditional superiority , will retain sufficient ascendency to prevent any serious mischief from the new order of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we would by no means discuss or decide it on sentimental grounds . But our choice would seem to be unqualified citizenship , to depend on the ability to read and write , if you will , and setting the blacks apart in some territory by themselves . There are , we think , insuperable objections to this last plan . It would put them beyond the reach of all good influence from the higher civilization of the whites , without which they might relapse into barbarism like the Maroons of Surinam , and it would deprive the whole Southern country of the very labor it needs . As to any prejudice which should prevent the two races from living together , it would soon yield to interest and necessity . The mere antipathy of color is not so strong there as here , and the blacks would form so very large a majority of the laboring crass as not to excite the jealousy of rivalry . We can remember when the prejudice against the Celt was as strong in many of the Free States as that against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very long since this prejudice nearly gave a new direction to the politics of the country . Yet , like all prejudices , it had not coherence enough to keep any considerable party long together . The objections to the plan are , of course , the same which lie against any theory of universal suffrage . These are many and strong , if considered abstractly ; but we assume that theory to be admitted now as the rule of our political practice , and its evils as a working system have not been found so great , taking the country at large , as nearly to outweigh its advantages . Moreover , as we have said before , it compels the redress of its own abuses , and the remedy is one which is a benefit to the whole community , for it is simply to raise the general standard of intelligence . It is superior , certainly , to the English system , in which the body of the nation is alienated from its highest intellect and culture . We think the objections are quite as strong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as liable to be governed by its interests and passions as any popular one . Witness the elections at Oxford . YOL.c. - NO. 207. 36 // Is the average wisdom or unselfishness of mankind so high , that there should be no narrow minds and no selfish hearts in any body of electors , however carefully selected ? The only infallible sovereign on earth is chosen by the majority of a body in which passion and intrigue and the influence ( sometimes none of the purest ) of conflicting courts are certainly not inoperative . Man is perhaps not the wisest of animals , but he has at least as keen a sense of his own advantage in a hovel as in a palace , and what is for the interest of the masses of the people is not very far from being for that of the country . It is said , to be sure , that we are inadequately represented in Congress ; but a representative is apt to be a tolerably exact exponent of the merits of his constituency , and we must look for relief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and culture . We doubt if the freedmen would send worse members to Congress than some in whose election merchants and bankers and even doctors of divinity have been accomplices . With the end of the war the real trial of our statesmanship , our patriotism , and our patience will begin . The passions excited by it will , no doubt , subside in due time , but meanwhile it behooves the party in possession of the government to conciliate patriotic men of all shades of opinion by a liberal , manly , and unpartisan policy : Republicans must learn to acknowledge that all criticisms of their measures have not been dictated by passion or disloyalty , that many moderate and honest men , many enlightened ones , have really found reason for apprehension in certain arbitrary stretches of authority , nay , may even have been opposed to the war itself , without being in love with slavery , and without deserving to be called Copperheads . Many have doubted the wisdom of our financial policy , without being unpatriotic . It is precisely this class , dispassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in healing the wounds of war and giving equanimity to our counsels . We hope to see a course of action entered upon which shall draw them to its support . In peace , governments can not , as in war , find strength in the enthusiasm and even the passions of the people , but must seek it in the approval of their judgment and convictions . During v ar , all the measures // of the dominant party have a certain tincture of patriotism ; declamation serves very well the purposes of eloquence , and fervor of persuasion passes muster as reason ; but in peaceful times everything must come back to a specie standard , and stand or fall on its own merits . Our faith is not unmixed with apprehension when we think of the immediate future , yet it is an abiding faith nevertheless ; and with the experience of the last four years to sustain us , we are willing to believe almost anything good of the American people , and to say with the saint , Uredirnus quta impossibile est . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the moderation becoming men who profess themselves capable of self-government , conceding all that can be conceded without danger to the great principle which has been at stake , the North and the South should live more harmoniously together in the future than in the past , now that the one rock of offence has been blasted out of the way . We do not believe that the war has tended to lessen their respect for each other , or that it has left scars which will take to aching again with every change of the political weather . We must bind the recovered communities to us with hooks of interest , by convincing them that we desire their prosperity as an integral part of our own . For a long while yet there will be a latent disaffection , even when the outward show may be fair , as in spring the ground often stiffens when the thermometer is above the freezing point . But we believe , in spite of this , that all this untowarduess will yield to the gradual wooing of circumstances , and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to look forward . Even in our finances , which are confessedly our weakest point , we doubt if the experience of any other nation will enable us to form a true conception of our future . We shall have , beyond question , the ordinary collapse of speculatiofi that follows a sudden expansion of paper currency . We shall have that shivering and expectant period when the sails flap and the ship trembles ere it takes the wind on the neW tack . But it is no idle boast to say that there never was a country with such resources as ours . In Europe the question about a man always is , What is he ? Here it is as invariably , What does he do ? And in that little difference lies the security of our national debt for // whoever has eyes . In America there is no idle class supported at the expense of the nation , there is no splendid poorhouse of rank or office , but every man is at work adding his share to the wealth , and to that extent insuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , is mortgaged , but it is a mortgage which the yearly profits will pay off . Those who look upon the war as a wicked crusade of the North against the divinely sanctioned institutions of the South , and those who hope even yet to reknit the monstrous league between slavery and a party calling itself Democratic , will of course b* willing to take back the seceding States without conditions . Neither of these classes are any longer formidable , either by their numbers or the character of their leaders . But there is yet a third class , who seem to have confused their minds with some fancied distinction between civil and foreign war . Holding the States to be indestructible , they seem to think that , by the mere cessation of hostilities , they are to resume their places as if nothing had happened , or rather as if this had been a mere political contest which we had carried . But it is with the people of the States , and not with any abstract sovereignty , that we have been at war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , and not of some convenient quasi-entity , which is not there when the battle is raging , and is there when the terms of capitulation are to be settled . No , it is slavery which made this war , and slavery which must pay the damages . While we should not by any unseemly exultation remind the Southern people that they have been conquered , we should also not be weak enough to forget that we have won the right of the victor . And what is that right , if it be not to exact indemnity for the past and security for the future ? And what more nobly and satisfactorily fulfils both those conditions , than utterly to extinguish the cause of quarrel ? What we fear is the foolish and weak good nature inherent in popular government , but against which monarchies and aristocracies are insured by selfinterest , which the prospect of peace is sure to arouse , and which may make our settlement a stage-re conciliation , where everybody rushes into the arms of everybody else with a fervor which has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the public mind should be made up as to what // are the essential conditions of real and lasting peace , before it is subjected to the sentimental delusions of the inevitable era of good feeling , in which the stronger brother is so apt to play the part of Esau . If we are to try the experiment of democracy fairly , it must be tried in its fullest extent , and not halfway . The theory which grants political power to the ignorant white foreigner , need not be squeamish about granting it to the ignorant black native , for the gist of the matter is in the dark . mind , and not the more or less dusky skin . Of course we shall be met by the usual fallacy , - Would you confer equality on the blacks ? But the answer is a very simple one . Equality can not be conferred on any mati , be he white or black . If he is capable of it , his title is from God , and not from us . The opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Lincoln has announced it as the one essential preliminary to the readmission of the insurgent States . To our mind , citizenship is the necessary consequence , as it is the only effectual warranty , of freedom ; and accordingly we are in favor of distinctly settling beforehand some conditional right of admission to it . We have purposely avoided any discussion on gradualism as an element in emancipation , because we consider its evil results to have been demonstrated in the British West Indies . True conservative policy is not an anodyne hiding away our evil from us in a brief forgetfulness . It looks to the bug future of a nation , and dares the heroic remedy where it is scientifically sure of the nature of the disease . The only desperate case for a people is where its moral sense is paralyzed , and the first symptom is a readiness to accept an easy expedient at the sacrifice of a difficult justice . The relation which is to be final and permanent can not be too soon decided on and put in working order , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only safe relation is one that shall be fearlessly true to the principles in virtue of which we asserted our own claim to autonomy , and our right to compel obedience to the government so established . Anything short of that has the weakness of an expedient which will erebong compel us to reconstruct our reconstruction , and the worse weakness of hypocrisy , which will sooner or later again lay us open to the retribution of that eternal sincerity which brings all things at last to the test of its own unswerving standard .
