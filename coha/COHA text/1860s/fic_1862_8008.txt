Neal , John , 1793-1876 : BATTLE ANTHEM . from Battle anthem ( 1862 ) Up , Christian warrior , up ! I hear The trumpet of the North Sounding the charge ! Fathers and sons , to horse ! Fling the old standard forth , Blazing and large ! And now I hear the heavy tramp Of nations on the march , Silent as death ! A slowly-gathering host , Like clouds o'er yonder arch , Holding their breath ! Our great blue sky is overcast ; And stars are dropping out , Through smoke and flame ! Hail-stones and coals of fire ! Now comes the battle-shout ! Jehovah 's name ! And now the rebel pomp ! To prayer ! Look to your stirrups , men ! Yonder rides death ! Now with a whirlwind-sweep ! Empty their saddles when Hot comes their breath ! As through the midnight forest tears With trumpeting and fire A thunder-blast ; So , Reapers , tear your way Through yonder camp , until you hear , " It is enough ! Put up thy sword ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
