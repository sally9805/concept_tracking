txt THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE . Tim rule held , anciently , that a nation 's architecture was the exponent of its national character , growing with and out of its social , civil , and religious peculiarities , and modified by climate , habit , and taste . In those early ages , the halcyon days of the art , men built with a purpose , built what they wanted in a natural and appropriate way , and - built successfully . So true was this , that to this day , most of their relics proclaim their own origin , just as fossils determine the relative positions of their enclosing strata , and history owes to architecture the solution of many of her hardest problems . The ancient Egyptians , for instance , gloried in the erection of the most magnificent tombs that their genius could produce , and , ruined as they are , we find that it is in their sepulchral monuments  --  the rockwrought mausoleum and the stupendous pyramid-that their art-current found its readiest flow . Compare these with the light and graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tesselated pavements , the orange trees , and the fountains . But no comparison , ' says Fergusson , is applicable to objects so totally different . Each is a true representative of the feeling and character of the people by whom it was raised . The plaster Alhambra would be totally out of place and contemptible beside the great temple-palace of Karnak . No less would the granite works of Egypt be considered monuments of ill-directed labor if placed in the palace of the gay and luxurious Arab fatalist , to whom the present was everything , and with whom the enjoyment of the passing hour was all in all . ' Still another idea , grander than any aspiration of Saracen or Egyptian , we find , when Europe , slowly shaking off the lethargy of the Dark Ages , was developing the idea of religion . It was material , however , as well as spiritual . God was glorified , not only by repentance or holiness of life , but also by the devotion of hand and heart and fortune to His earthly temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus which is now given to religion itself was turned into the channels of religious art . And yet , temporally speaking , how grand were the results ! Slowly but surely arose those vast and wonderful cathedrals , springing lightly // out of the quaintly gabled streets , with their richly wrought transepts and their pinnacled spires . Not trailing along the ground like the Greek temple or the Arab mosque-of the earth , earthy  --  but leading the soul heavenward with their upward flow of harmony . Vast Bibles of stone , bearing on lofty facade and on buttressed flank the Fculptured details of Holy Writ-silent lessons , but not lost upon the rude though reverent men who dwelt within their shadow . It is sad to think that there can never be any more cathedrals . For they grew in those times : now they would have to be built . But we are following a tangent . Our idea is , that architecture , to be good , must be appropriate-expressive of the spirit of the age . It should be an epitome of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , and crystallized into an art . Of what use would a garment be , though ever so elaborate , if it did not fit ? Just so our houses , which are but a broader kind of clothing , should be fitted to their purpo*e , or they will never yield us any pleasure . Suppose that , in searching the ruins of ancient Greece , we found nothing but pusillanimous , sham imitations of Egyptian art . Would we not despise such a paltry method of making matter serve for mind-such a miserable makeshift to save the labor of invention ? And yet it is this same servile imitation of classical and foreign models that is fettering the progress of art in America . Instead of honestly constructing what we want , and then decorating it with a style of ornament that should assist , explain , and intensify it , we go wandering off to the ends of the earth , building Grecian temples and Veronese palaces , some entire and some in slices , dreary , indefinite-looking objects , devoid of all constructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck on in the hope of hiding rather than helping out the flimsy design . Our national style ' we are sure can never be born of any such travesties . Borrowed architecture never fits well . The fact is , we ignore the first great principle  --  the essence and sine qua nc*n of the art-DECORATED cORsTEUcTION . By construction is meant that mechanical arrangement of parts which is best suited to convenience and most conducive to stability . It is what the French would call the rnot*f , the end in view , while decoration is only the means . And the moment we lose sight of it , in our anxiety to make room for some pet ornament , that very ornament becomes an eyesore , and will persist in spoiling the design , for the simple reason that the end is sacrificed to the means . Set it down , then , at the start , that ornament must be dependent upon construction , and not construction upon ornament . The useful begets the beautiful , and the order can not be reversed . But before proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all fairness , examine it as it is . Our great cities , of course , claim our attention first , for these centres of wealth and intellect must necessarily be centres of art , and there , if at all , are we to discover our prospects for a national style . As a single example of what it has attained to so far , nothing can be better suited to our purpose than Broadway , New York , our bestknown and most essentially American thoroughfare . But what to compare it to we know not . Neither history nor geography affords a parallel . It resembles neither the London Strand nor the Parisian Boulevard , nor is it like the Ludwig Strasse of Munich , nor the Grand Canal of Venice ; and yet it has something or other in common with all of these : There is all the incongruity of the English thoroughfare and the brilliancy of the French , while the frequent succession of vast palatial structures allies it still closer to the lastnamed examples . Perhaps , after all , the Grand Canal  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it in // general effect than any other street in Europe . The one , it is true , is as straight as an airline , and the other nearly the shape of an S ; the one a paved roadway , noisy with the rush of traffic , and , in the other , the water washing the very walls of palaces that are mournful and deserted-while , as regards style , there is scarcely a single specimen of the Venetian in this country . But the resemblance is this : your prevailing impression from first to last is the absence of all general arrangement , and the independent elegance of each separate facade . Each tells the same story : it is the wealth and enterprise of the citizen , and not the munificence of the sovereign , that has added palace to palace , and made the dumb stones eloquent . Remembering , then , that it is private taste and influence that is to develop our art , we proceed to the analysis of the great thoroughfare in question . Fancy yourself , patient reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command its vista . What do you see ? Architecture ? Very little , we imagine . Save the buildings immediately at your right and left , all the others are seen in profile , a contingency never reckoned on by their builders . The decoration is all piled on the front , as elaborate a design , often , as *alladio ever dreamt of , but at the side , every cornice and stringpiece stops as short as if it had been sawn off , and the whole side is a fiat blank piece of brickwork . This is greatly aggravated by the disparity in height , and the ponderous cornices . As to construction , the prevailing type is a flimsy pile of brick and timber , put up , ' apparently , by mutual connivance of the contractor and the coroner , and screened off from the street by a thin veneer of architecture . ' Now there is a certain merit , sui generis , in a clever deception , but those in vogue here are too utterly transparent to claim even this . The telltale wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , no matter how charitably disposed . Were it necessary to represent this street upon the stage , the decorator would simply have to paint his scenes upon the edges , and leave the side toward the audience bare . As you walk along you see a given building sideways for five minutes or more , but you can not see it as it was meant to be seen-full in front-for as many seconds . We even know of churches in the cross streets , though near Broadway , whose square towers are stone-fronted after the usual fashion , but present nothing to the crowded thoroughfare but undressed walls of brick ! Yes , a Christian church , in flagrante delictu . It will be objected to this that there is no use in finishing the sides of city buildings , as they may afterward be hidden by others . This would do well enough if they were all of the same height ; but they are not , and never can be . Indeed , a house is by many considered handsomer ' than its neighbors , just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly think it a fair beat if the cornices corresponded . The successive erections on a row of vacant lots , usually illustrate this popular ambition . Some one secures the corner and builds his house . So far , *o good . Presently number two comes along , and , to secure himself from invidious comparison , piles his house half a story higher than number one . But his triumph is short , for the third aspirant soon arrives , who , true to principle , takes another step in the ascending series . So it goes till the block is finished , the whole thing looking as if architecture was a sort of auction , in which the prize of success was awarded to the highest builder . It being one of our social necessities that our houses differ in size , we must pay some attention to their sides . Not giving them as decided a treatment as the front , but something compatible with a plain surface . And , above all , // the principal cornice and roof lines should be carried round on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . In some rare instances , where this has been done , it is astonishing to note the improved appearance and finish that it gives . Did you ever consider the superior elegance of a corner house ? Yet it is not so much the position as the fact that the position is taken advantage of . Being finished on both sides , it gives to the mind the idea of thickness as well as length and breadth . It is , in short , a solid , while the affair next door , overtopping it perhaps a story or two , is merely a superficies . But this is only a side thrust . Our commercial palaces* challenge the same criticism face to face . For the front , considered by itself even , is generally incomplete . A supposititious formula determines that the house must be in the Italian palace style , but the narrow lot forbidding an entire design , the builder , as he can not put in all , puts in all he can , so that , instead of the house being a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has no particular beginning or middle or ending , and , with the long viscera of brickwork trailing off behind , it looks as if just wrenched out of the side of some Florentine or Genoese mansion . And , in very truth , is it not ? The common cause of these errors and incongruities is our self-abasement to a style which depends for its effect upon continuous uniformity of design , while , from the very nature of our society , our houses must be diverse in size and pretension . We are a social people , it is true , but our individualities are strongly marked , and our dwellings , while designed with reference to each other , should never be too uniform . How frightful those whiteshuttered brick piles which monotonize the streets of Philadelphia ! But to assert its individuality the house need not shoot up like a vein of trap rock through a stratum of conglomerate : an American rises , not through the mass , but out of it . Have you ever seen a street view of Bruges or Nuremberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember them , the tall gabled houses with projecting stories , the picturesque grouping of porch and gallery and oriel , the curious old bridges and the Gothic fountains , the grotesque carvings over the doorways , and the perfect population of dormer windows and turrets and lanterns . And did you not , entre nous , like it better than those stiff , formal views of the French and Italian cities ? Was not the poetry more pleasing than the prose ? Oh well , ' you say , these turrets and gables and things look all very well in pictures , but they would never do for our streets : we must build in some regular style , you know . ' The same old error again , the same servile imitation of a vague something or other , which we call classic . Do you think the old German burghers built in any regular style ? Not a bit of it . They built just what they wanted , in the most natural and plain-spoken manner . If they wanted a porch over the door , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy some favorite viewthey made them , put them just where they were needed . Convenience was everything , and precedent nothing . Is there not something about this individual originality , this perfect freedom of thought and expression , that might be adapted to express the American character ? And if more pleasing , why cling to the effete and cumbrous tyrannies of a soulless classicism ? Why crush out all symptoms of natural growth to make room for the unsightly exotic ? Nature herself has made the law that beauty is variety . Monotony , though magnificent , will become irksome , but variety is an unceasing delight . Versailles , with its formal avenues of shorn foliage , and its geometrical lawns and terraces , may please you // more at first sight than an English park , because the mind feels a sort of pride in being able to grasp such vast ideas at a glance . But you will find , upon a second or third visit , that the unnatural arrangement of the French pleasure grounds has something of staleness about it . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grew weary of his splendid plaything , almost before it was finished . How different the English landscape garden , where graceful sweeps and irregular masses of foliage meet the eye with unlooked-for beauties at every turn ! Well do we remember how , after a few days spent in viewing the grand dullness of the Bavarian capital , we looked wearily back to the delightful visit we made at Nuremberg , with its curious old streets and fountains : Quaint old town of toil and traffic , quaint old town of art and song ; Memories haunt thy pointed gables like the rooks that round them throng . ' To claim the merit of variety for our streets is wrong , for they are not varied , but only incongruous . Their variety is rather that of an architectural museum than the result of any combination . We have styles enough , in all conscience , but none that will tolerate any other . Against this may be urged the very argument with which we set out , that a nation 's architecture should be the exponent of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every people and every class , that this heterogeneous mdange is our normal style . But mark the distinction : Although we are made up of so many diverse elements , yet the component parts are severally and mutually held in solution . Each so affects the mass as to give rise to a new element-not a mere union , but a resultnot an addition , but a multiplication . But with the representative art , the materials have merely come in contact - nothing more . Our houses lack that social element which characterizes our people . Each is itself , and itself alone , ruining the appearance of its neighbors , and ruined by them in turn . Odi j fanum vulgus , et arceo , is the only law ; while we are a chemical solution , our architecture is only a mechanical one . How proceed , then , to develop our national style , that unborn something which a future age might refer to as American , just *s we speak of Byzantine or Gothic ? Are we waiting for somebody to invent it ? We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready made , like Minerva from the brain of Zeus . If this is our idea , we might ns well give up at once and confess to the world our imbecility . Never , from Adam 's day to this , did anybody ever invent a new architecture . It is purely a matter of genealogy . For just as we trace back a family line , can we trace the generations of art . Spite of its complications , many an offshoot can be followed up directly to the parent stock . Taking , for example , the medieval architecture of Spain , the brilliant Moresco , ' we find it to be a com bination of the vigorous Gothic of the North with the beautiful though effeminate Saracenic  --  the exotic of the South . And of these latter , each is traceable , though by different lines , to the same great prototype , the Roman . For when Rome was divided , the Dome fell to the inheritance of the Eastern Empire , and the Basilica ( which was only a Greek temple turned inside out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabian , and the latter to the Gothic , formed two great families , from the union of whose descendants sprang the Moresco . But even the Roman was a derivative style , leading us back successively through Greece , Assyria , and Egypt . Each step is visibly allied to the preceding , and yet how unlike the pyramid and the Spanish cathedral ! Did history permit , all the styles that have ever existed could be traced in the same way ; it is quite as easy to account for their diversities , as for those of the nations that produced them . Ham and Japheth were of the same // The Devel*pment of American Architecture . household , yet how different their descendants of to-day ! As from one man sprang all people , so was there an original germ of architecture from which all successive styles have been derived . The composite forms that have arisen since commerce and civilization have brought the ends of the world together , increase the complication . There have been marriages and intermarriages , some good matches and some bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some hybrids of such monstrous malformation as almost to make us fear that a new style can be invented . But the effect is impossible without the cause . Save the mysterious Pyramids , every structure extant acknowledges its ancestry . If physiologists are fond of claiming the history of the race as one of their own chapters , architecture has at least an equal claim . But all this does not mean that we are mere passive agents in the matter . We are , in a great measure , the external influences ' that modify art . The motion exists , but it devolves upon us to give direction . We have already alluded to Venetian architecture as being parallel in origin and tendency to our own , and much can be gained , we believe , by a careful examination of what it accomplished . Not that we ought to copy , line for line , the doge 's palace or the Casa d'Oro  --  the arabesque arcade , or the Gothic balcony-that would only be following the well-worn rut of imitation . We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes that produced the style in question were not unlike what we find at home to-day . A commercial republic , there was the same liberty of expression  --  the same preponderance of the individual over the national ; and there , as here , are we attracted rather by the elegance of independent units than by any general unity of design . But the growth of art in Venice ( we task special attention ) was due to her central situation , and the simultaneous influx of foreign elements . It was her commerce that made Venice great : her glory came and departed with it . Witnessing , as she did , the development of all the medheval styles , she became-geographically and historically  --  the metropolis of architecture . The Greeks , ' says Ruskin , gave the shaft , Rome gave the arch , the Arabs pointed and foliated the arch Opposite in their character and mission , alike in their magnificence of energy , they came from the North and from the South  --  the glacier torrent and the lava stream , they met and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very centre of the struggle , the point of pause of both , the dead water of the opposite eddies , charged with embayed fragments of the Roman wreck , is Venice . The ducal palace of Venice contains the three elements in exactly equal proportions , the Roman , Lombard , and Arab . It is the central building of the world . ' Truly , it was a glorious success that art achieved in the Italian republic . Whether the old precedents were violated or not , the result is unquestionably pleasing , and the pleasure-seeking tourist lingers there as long as the critic . At this transition state , through which Venice passed so nobly , have we now arrived . We have collected our materials , and piled them up together , but just as all seems most propitious , le mouvement s'arrete , the materials will not coalesce . The brass and the silver , the iron and the gold , are all in the crucible , but there is no fusion , only a discordant clash . Alas ! there is no heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for art . We are too much absorbed in the rapid accumulation of wealth , or the passing excitement of the hour , to attend to anything that is noble or honest or beautiful . And now that devastating war is sweeping through the land and // clogging the wheels of progress , we are learning terrible lessons ; but , with experience for our teacher , learning them well . Where war prevails , civilization for the time must stand still . Inter r silent-artes . And so long as we consider art a marketable commodity , and consign it , like merchandise , to soulless builders , so long will it remain in hopeless embryo . Only by taking a personal interest in it can we hope to make it our own . So much for what we have done . There is little to be proud of ; and little , we hope , that will influence our future art . To which we now turn our atten. tion . To begin with , great public buildings will never form a distinguishing feature of American architecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we differ from the European nations , for in art , as in politics , the people are the rulers . It is discouraging , at first thought , to reflect that no such magnificent architectural combinations as those of the French capital can ever find place in an American city . They are grand , they are supcrb , these endless successions of palaces and gardens and triumphal arches , with groves and fountains all in perfect symmetry , and wellbalanced vistas radiating in all directions ; but they are the result of centuries of despotism-of the impoverishment of the many and the aggrandizement of the few . This , we hope , is not to be the fashion in America . It is true that the ground plan for the city of Washington exhibits a design analogous to the above , but we think it will be a long time before it exists elsewhere than on the map . The Greeks and Romans , we know , confined their efforts to public buildings , but that was their business . They served their Governments , but our Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opposite direction . Since we are so fond of the classic , why not have chariots for carriages , and triremes instead of gunboats and steamers ? Our real style will first appear in our residences and warehouses , in our banks and hotels and railroad depots . It sounds odd , but it is manifestly so to be . We are a commercial republic . Old European palaces and cathedrals are doubtless very grand , and-for those who need such things-most excellent models . But with us the private element already predominates ; we only need to begin honestly , and the thing is half done . Our national dread of Gothic , except it be for church purposes , should be done away with . The Gothic neip ? , we mean ; the style we may follow or may not . But to be sincere and constructive , to build with a purpose , we must do as did the medkeval builders . In their hands , our daguerrean skylights and shot towers , our factory chimneys and signboards , would have become glorious objects , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day in seven ; it permeated the commonest details of every-day life , because they were common . Hence they ennobled everything . But the Romans , unfortunately , never had any shot towers , or hotels , or railroad depots , and so we think such things exceptions to the ordinary rules of architecture . But after all , perhaps , this is all the better for their future , as it leaves them comparatively untrammelled . In the matter of railroad depots , England has certainly stolen a march upon us , the large city stations in that rail-bound country being perfect Crystal Palaces in size and elegance , while those for the more rural places are often the most exquisite little villas , unapproachable in neatness and taste . In some parts of the Continent , the Swiss style has been pressed into this service with notable success . In regard to fire-alarm towers , we rejoice to be able to make an exceptional remark . New York city has actually produced two or three of these of new and elegant shape , perfectly adapted to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , not copied from anything else . Those in Sixth and Third avenues have a grace of outline thai is really elegant , and show what we can accomplish if we only build what we want in a natural and appropriate way . Nothing , however , is to exert a vaster influence on our style than the hotel . This institution , ' as we have it , is comparatively unknown in Europe ; beyond all nations are we a travelling and hotelbuilding people . Our hotels have not grown up with the scant traffic of the post chaise or diligence ; they overleaped that feeble infancy , and started at once with the railroad and steamboat . Large , luxurious , and well appointed , they are usually the prominent buildings in all our large cities . But as yet it is onty their size and social importance that distinguishes them , not their architecture . The recipe for a first-class city house is simple : a vast square front of white , with ninety-six or a hundred and forty-four windows , as the case may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this arrangement is much the same as that of an uncut sheet of postage stamps . In such large masses , a single color-white especially-is always disagreeable , unless treated with some variety of form . Brick , with stone dressings , will almost invariably produce a finer front than stone alone . But , after all , the most desirable kind of variety is that which seeks to express exteriorly the inner arrangement of the building , by giving some degree of prominence to the principal rooms . As to interior , our hotels neglect a grand opportunity in making no capital of the central space they generally enclose . This , instead of being abandoned to cats and ash barrels , might be made the feature of the establishment . Fancy such a court roofed over with glass , * and surrounded with light arcades of ironwork forming a continuous balcony at each story , arrange a garden in the centre with a fountain , * As in the Hotel du Louvre in Paris . and give the whole a sort of oriental treatment , and what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case would be , not on the street , but on one of the sides of this inner court , while an arched carriage way , to connect with the street , would render vehicles accessible under cover . The arcades , connecting all parts of the house , would take the place of halls and corridors , besides forming delightful promenades . Some few hotels could be named , in our large cities , which seem to have the germ of this idea , but we know no instance of its complete development . Still we have great hopes of the hotel , because it is the place of all others which it is to our interest to make look well . People go to the post office all the same , be it a barn or a parthenon , but they will go , other things being equal , to the best hotel . Here comes in the American principle of Competition , the keynote of all our enterprise . Competition is to do for us what tbe hope of earthly immortality did for the builders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the builders of the cathedrals . It is to be the soul of our art : what sort of a body it is to put on , we shall presently see . Even now it is safe to assume that no more such granite prisons as the Revere ' or the Astor* will be built for hotels . Lightness , variety , and vivacity will more probably characterize this style . The shop front is something that we must have in some shape or other , and , if fairly treated , it would become as decidedly American as business is . It is susceptible of great variety , but care must be taken that it harmonizes with the superstructure . How often we see massive structures of marble , five stories or more , supported on basements of plate glass , apparently ; while the real supports are carefully concealed ! The best method , so far tried , seems to be that in which the columns are made sufficiently prominent to show their object , and are surmounted by arches , // which give a good basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the store front . But we must make up our mind to part with those hideous signboards , which trail their loathsome length across our best buildings , regardless of console or capital or cornice . For the importance of the sign renders it constructive , and it has as much right to take part in the design as a door or a window . Instead of being pinned on like an afterthought , it should be built into the wall , panel fashion , and by a little taste in the selection of the style of letter , it might become one of the most striking features of the whole front . Color would be better for the letters than relief being more economical and more easily altered . Our warehouses and even our factories might become imposing objects if appropriately conceived , for is not labor ennobling ? Anything that is worth doing , is worth doing well ; and if any of our manufacturing towns are hideous , they are not necessarily soi ' There is a certain grandeur about many such places , with their myriad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corresponding grandeur of expression , and some of our Pennsylvania ironworks already affor* splendid examples of this . We have seldom been more impressed by the grandeur of mechanical operations than on a recent night visit to one of the large rolling mills of Scranton . The whole interior , vast as a cathedral , was brilliantly lighted by the numerous operations in molten and red-hot iron that were everywhere in progress , and , with its gleaming furnaces , ranged on either hand down the long vista , and glowing here and there from the galleries , really made us feel prouder of * The great Bible-printing establishment at Oxford encloses a spacious courtyard , which is laid ont as a garden . The foliage is agreeahly disposed , and there are shrubbery walks , flowers , vases , and parterres , all arranged in the best taste . Consider what a healthful influence this must have on the character of the workman. our race than did many a dim , dilapidated temple of the Old World . As to churches , we can not expect much , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate with the importance of their congregations . The religion of to-day appeals to soul , and not to soul and sense . The world is older and better educated than in the cathedral era , and the apostles and prophets are read , not from sculptured doors or painted windows , but from the printed page and the winged word . Childhood , that can not read , requires gaudily painted primers for its instruction and amusement , but the world is a grown man now ; the press has superseded the cathedral , and if we imitate those structures in our churches , we should bear in mind that it was their size that gave them grandeur , and that they would be caricatures without it . We have heard our American church interiors spoken of somewhere as divisible into two classes  --  the eharlotte-russe style and the molasses-candy style . This is not true , we hope ; but there is too much truth in it , for it shows the influence of a too close imitation of European palaces and churches , and the hard shamming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If our rural architecture has been more successful , it is because our better class of country houses are planned with reference to the landscapes they occupy . A rich level meadow with here and there a waving elm requires a different style of house from a fir-clad bluff on a river bank or a wild gorge in a mountain . No intelligent architect , we take it , would design a country house without an intimate acquaintance with the surroundings , and yet the same man , likely as not , would make you a sketch for the elevation of your house in town , without even looking td see what it was to adjoin on either side . Now this method may be correct , but it seems to us that , by first putting on paper the existing houses , say one or // two , on each side of the space to be built upon , the new front could be much better planned , and much of that unnecessary discord avoided which destroys so many of our best streets . This is what is done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Particular situations require particular treatments . A front that would appear well on a narrow street , would be inappropriate on a broad avenue or a square . A corner , or the head of a street , are most responsible situations . A tall marble front , placed in a modest row of freestone , is hideous , and yet the unrelieved monotony of many such rows is quite as bad . A dome , unless at the top of a street or on some open space , is next to worthless . Who would ever notice Boston State House or the Baltimore Cathedral , but for their elevated and central positions ? We often find among the old masters elegant architectural paintings , street views , taken from the picturesque cities they lived in . We should like to find some one bold enough to paint a street view of Broadway or Washington street or Chestnut street . It is a pity that our architects are unwilling to acknowledge the importance of the buttress . Concerning this feature , it is not easy to say whether beauty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strength , and hence its inherent *legaace . Suppose N6tre Dame or Milan Cathedral stripped of their double tiers of flying buttresses . Would you not say that their glory was gone-their beauty departed ? And yet the old builders did not pile them up against their naves for mere beauty 's sake . By no means . But they knew the immense weight of their vaulted roofs , and anticipated the outward thrust of the walls . That was the problem , and most fairly was it met . They counteracted the outward pressure from within by an inward pressure from without , and there was the buttress . But what if they had said , We are not going to spoil our fine churches by stickiag props al* around them , and had resorted to concealed bedplatcs and invisftde rods of iron , would their structures have been better or nobler or more enduring ? Fortunately , they gave themselves no concern as to how they would look for architecture was honest in those days-they simply built them , allowing decoration to come in afterward in its proper order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic art . Perhaps this is the very reason why we so neglect it ; but symptoms are already appearing which lead us to hope that gothophobia is on the decline , and not the least of them is the outcropping of something that would be a buttress if it dared to , but hides its real intention under a classic mask , and passes off as a pilaster or a panel border . But it has a guilty look , and the sooner it puts off its borrowed garments the better . Certainly the demand for it is immense . So long as we are a commercial people , vast warehouses , piled from cellar to roof with heavy merchandise , must abound in all our cities . And yet how utterly incompetent would many such buildings be to stand alone ! So long , too , as we are a manufacturiag people , must we have huge mills crowded full with heavy apparatus , vibrating machinery , and huma* lives . Have we forgotten Lawrence ? Let us not wait for another such holocaust crc we learn wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . A mere increase of dead weight is no remedy ; there should be a well-studied mechanical disposition of material . If buttresses are applied to warehouses and factories with sole reference to their utility , elegance will grow upon them afterward as naturally as leaves grow upon trees . Material must depend much upon locality , but iron is undoubtedly to hold an important place in our architecture . Already it is extensively used , but does not seem to command general // favor . The reason is that nearly everything that lyis been done with it so far is not iron architecture , but stone architecture done in iron . We do not let it speak its own language ; the truss , the tie rod , and the girder are kept out of sight , while every possible display is made of consoles and cornices and Corinthian columns and balustrades , and all sorts of foreign expressions . No wonder that it is unable to give an account of itself with all these false witnesses . Stone houses should be made of stone and if made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shams , unenduring and unsatisfactory . Now architecture requires the least amount of material that is compatible with the greatest amount of strength . The forms of different materials must be varied to suit their texture , according as it-is fibrous or crystalline , tough or brittle . Iron , of course , requires a peculiar treatment . At the risk of being charged with pedantry , we say that there have never been but two iron buildings , of any pretension , in this country-the Niagara Suspension Bridge and the Crystal Palace at New York . The first still speaks for itself ; and of the latter , no one who saw it can forget what an exquisite structure it was , so light and airy and elegant , and yet so strong . It was but a bird cage , though , compared with its enormous prototype at Sydenham . That is unquestionably one of the wonders of the world ; its internal coup d'o3il is without a parallel . Fancy a broad level vista , a third of a mile long , flanked on either side by graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch , a hundred feet above your head ; line it with a profusion of tropical foliage and clambering vines , that grow as luxuriantly as in their native woods , and interspersed with statuary and vases gleaming everywhere through the rich masses of verdure , while here and there fountains of rare and exquisite design , rising from broad marble basins , relieve without lessening the immense length  --  and you may have some faint idea of this peerless strncture . No material is used in it , ' says Fergusson , which is not the best for its purpose , no constructive expedient employed which was not absolutely necessary , and it depends wholly for its effect on the arrangement of its parts and the display of its construction . ' It is in iron what Gothic is in stone . Details , if fairly studied , would do much to nationalize our architecture . Why should we , in designing a capital or cornice , still cling to the classic acanthus or honeysuckle ornament , or even the English ivy , when we have such a fund of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prtato blossom and the cotton boll afford so many mines of treasure , that it is surprising that they have not already been worked . In the architecture of the Central Park , however , a decided impetus has been given in this direction . The details of the grand terrace at the end of the Mall are as elaborate as those of a European cathedral , but they are all American-all our own . Another excellent feature of our city houses is that little strip of garden in front , just within the sidewalk . For this , too , we think we have some claim of originality . At least it is not European , for in Berlin , Vienna , etc. , some of the most palatial quarters are without so much as a sidewalk  --  the paving stones reaching from wall to wall . Such barrenness of arrangement can not be relieved by any architecture , nor was there ever a building so good that it could not be improved by a setting of foliage . The power of mutual relief between art and nature is wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrated Place Napoleon , ' the court of the New Louvre at Paris . The contrast between the richly wrought facades of Caen stone and the foliage in the centre , is most grateful to the eye . Even the grand quadrangle of the Tuileries seems dismal after it , grand as are its ogre-roofed pavilions ' and // triumphal arch , for it lacks the refreshing verdure . The eye wearies of the everlasting buff color . Not to overstep the subject , we will say just one word about the street plans of our cities . It is really shameful that these are not more studied . No one seems to think of adapting them to the surface of the ground , but everything must needs be graded flat , and rectangular blocks laid out thereon . Our Western cities , particularly , appear to crystallize in cubes-their monotony is painful . An occasional introduction of the curved street , so common in Britain , would be a delightful , relief . The London Quadrant'is a superb example-the way in which the houses come into view , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be surpassed . But the chief secret of success in plotting a town is to seize upon the natural irregularities of the ground , and make them part and parcel of the design . The beauty of Edinburgh  --  the Scottish Athens , ' as Dugald Stewart called it-is entirely owing to this . The new town is a wilderness of granite , magnificently dull , ' and the old has barely enough of the picturesque to save it from being hideous . But there is a broad , natural ravine , dividing the two , which has been retained in its original shape , and being tastefully arranged with shrubbery and terraced wall*s , forms a fine park . Near one end of this the Castle Hill rises abruptly against the old town , while at the other end the view is closed by Calton Hill , with its classic monuments , and Arthur 's Seat rising grandly beyond . Two or three bridges afford a level communication between the old town and the new , and Prince 's street , the thoroughfare of the latter , forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing midway the Scott monument , a superb spire of Gothic . This latter is perhaps the only commendable feature per se in the city-for the details of Edinburgh are notably poor , its pictorial effect arising solely from the very happy manner in which they are grouped , amphitheatre-like , around the Gardens . ' Did such a vale lie in the track of one of our cities , we would consider it an unlucky blemish , to be filled up at once to the general level . It would be named in the contract as such-and-such sunken lots , ' and as the Castle Rock was digged down and dumped in , taxpayers would rejoice over the saved cartage . Having thus killed off Nature , we would put up squares of houses upon the dead level , while the local papers would comment upon the improvement of property . ' If we only had a Napoleon here , some think , his master mind might arrest this Vandalism , infuse some system into our rag-bag cities , and make each a Paris . But have we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of this current , guided by taste , be turned into the channels of art , and the results will soon be forthcoming . We seem to be hampered , as yet , with a kind of feudal system of architecture ; this will presently be done away with , for the American character is eclectic , and naturally selects and combines the best in art , as in politics and commerce . To combine English good sense without its heaviness , French vivacit3 without its hollowness , and the exuberance of German fancy without its inertiato combine and reflect all these should be the mission of our architecture . Neither is it too much to say that a genuine love for art may have its bearing on that part of us which is immortal . Not that any of these things will exist after this life , but as children are drilled by their teachers in many studies which have no practical bearing on their after life , so may we consider ourselves as only at boarding school with Nature while in this present temporary state ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to our more exalted future , we should remember that this is her method of discijp*ine . But she has done more ; she has made // the very tasks delightfuL Are not such studies more beneficial and satisfactory than the idleness and play which fill up so much of our lives ? No student can succeed , however , who tamely copies his neighbor 's work . Let us hope , then , that our art will soon drop its clumsy costume , and take to itself something natural and national ; that it will become , as it should , the type of our Western civilization-a civilization that spreads itself ; not by sword or sceptre or crozier , but by life and liberty and light .
