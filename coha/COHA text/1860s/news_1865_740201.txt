txt THE STORIES OF DISASTER TO SHERMAN . The bulletin of Geri . Litz announcing a check to Gen. SHERMAN 'S army , creates not the slighest uneasiness here . It is plainly discernable that it was written simply to shed a ray of hope over the fast sinking fortunes of the enemy . The force encountered by JOHNSTON was undoubtedly the advance of the left wing of SHERMAN 'S army , as Bentonville lies in the path which that column was pursuing . , No information concerning either SHERMAN or Senovinn has been received here to-day , save that obtained from the Richmond papers of Tuesday . DAVIS AND HIS CuNGEESS , The Richmond Whig of Tuesday prints the report made by the Committee on Military Affairs of the rebel House on JEFF DAVIS ' Message . The Whig says it was not formally adopted , for want of time and pressure of other business , but it is understood that the report expresses the sentiments of a large majority of the House . The report is similar in tone to that adopted by the Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that the House objected to giving DAVIS the sweeping militia law be asked for , siotply because it had already placed at his disposal all persons between the ages of 15 and 50 ; and they further add , " It seems manifest that the extension of the conscription to persons over 45 , while it has greatly impaired the productive power of the country , and in other respects prejudiced the public service , has been attended by no compensating advantage . " The report raps DAVIS very hard for asking more conscripts where he had already admitted that more than one-half of the army was absent without leave . It is suggested that as the laws already made for the government of the army can not be executed , they had better not make any more . The report further says that the Congress has made appropriations on the basis of an army half a million strong , and intimates that this ought to be sufficient . In regard to the delay in passing the negro soldier bill , the report quotes Davis ' own message at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes as pioneer and engineer laborers , he did not thing it necessary to go . The rebel Secretary of War is also quoted to the same effect . In conciesion , the report , says the , solemn arrival of deliberate opinion by the President and his own War Minister , communicated to Congress , and never revoked , changed or modified la any subsequent message , left Congress in the position of being compelled to override its judgment of the high functionaries on a subject about which they are presumed to be fully informed , and not likely to fall into error , or to delay action until advised of the happening of the contingencies which would justify a resort to the doubtful policy of arming the slaves . MOVEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT . The departure of President LINCOLN for Fortress Monroe and City Point , to-day , has given rise to much rumor and speculation , but there is nothing remarkable in it . The President , with Mrs. LINCOLN and young THADDEUS. taking advantage of the fine weather , and being desirous of a little recreation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a visit to Gen. GRANT . Before leaving , the President was in consultation with the Secretary of War .
