txt We left New-Orleans Jan. 26 , 9 A. M. for this port direct , and were over the bar at S. W. Pass same day at 6 P. M. The steamer Matanzas left on the same morning one hour earlier . The steamship Mississippi was to have sailed on the Saturday previous , but owing to some disarrangement of her propeller was obliged to remain for repairs ; she will probably get away by the 30th ; she is to bring home the Twelfth Connecticut Regiment . The steamer Gray Jacket Is still ashore at Pass a l'Outre ; her cargo has nearly all been lightered from her , and she will very soon be got off . On the morning of the 28th , at 9 A. M. , we sighted a steamer burning soft coal , steering N. N. E. Soon after we saw her she changed her course to S. W. , before the wind . We immediately gave chase , and came up with her at 12 A. M. , in latitude 24 ? 47 ' , longitude 83 ? 57 ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hove to . On coming alongside , we immediately lowered a boat , armed a crew with revolvers and cutlassee , and sent our second officer , Mr. CROWN , on boardof her , with Acting-Lieut . S.W. PanNINGTON , Acting-Master D. S. MURPHY , United States Navy , and Lieut . G. S. STEWART , United States Army , passengers , who volunteered to accompany him . On examination of her papers , they found her to be the steamer Rosita . The Captain informed them ne was from Havana on the 25th , bound to Nassau . When asked , " Why on this side of the Gulf if bound to that port 7 " he replied that he had been " blown off . " The only papers received was her register and crew list . The Captain told them that his manifest and clearance were taken from him on the day previous by a Spanish man-of-war . There is little doubt but that they were thrown overboard with other valuable papers , as one of her officers was seen to dispose of a bundle in that manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fruitless attempt . Without any further ceremony her flag was struck down , and her officers and crew were informed that they were prisoners , and to make ready to be taken on board the Weetern Metropolis Our second officer immediately reported back to Capt . HILTON , and he at once dispatched a crew of engineers , firemen and sailors , and gave him charge of the steamer . The officers and crew of the : Rosita , numbering twenty-five , were immediately taken on board of us and placed under a strong guard . Our officers , on taking charge , found her to be in a sinking condition , some three feet of water already in the hold . She was found to be scuttled , and the plug taken out from her sea-cock. : We immediately dispatched our two carpenters on board , with force pump and means to repair , In a short time she was reported to be safe , and quite free from water . The engineer , Mr. BURNS , on taking charge of her engine , found less than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure steam , and safety valve fastened down . It is perfectly evident they intended to destroy her , and would have accomplished it , had we not too quickly discovered their work . Her officers and crew , on being taken aboard of us , learning that they had been captured by an unarmed transport , were somewhat vexed , and said , " had they been aware of the fact they would have caused us much more trouble . " Whatever they might have known would have favored them but little , as our Captain was intent on capturing or sinking her . ? After proper preparation we took her in tow for Key West  --  arrived there on the 2atii , 7 A. M. On arrival , Capt . HILTON immediately reported to Admiral BAILEY , and delivered up to him the steamer with ner officers and crew for condemnation as a blockade-runner and a prize . Her officers and crew , on being searched , were found to have on their persons some thousand dollars in gold . The owner of the cargo was one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were bound to a Confederate port . lie said her cargo would purchase in Mobile 410 bales of cotton . She was freighted mostly with liquors and ammunition  --  a very valuable cargo for the Confederates . The steamer Rosita is a side-wheel vessel , nearly new , and is very fast ; was commanded by Capt . AL/.:formerly of the Gulf trade . She is 150 feet long . 25 feet beam , 7 feet hold , and is of about 400 tons burden . She has a beam engine with a 26 inch Cylinder . 9 feet stroke . Her machinery is in good order . She is estimated to be worth , with cargo , $50,000 . The steamer North Point was in Key West receiving cargo . She was to sail for New-Orleans on the 30th . The U. S. steamer De Soto was receiving coal at the Government dock . On the day previous to our arrival in Key West , the loyal citizens of that place held an enthusiastic meeting , the object of which was to appoint a committee to cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of taking measures to bring back the State of Florida into the Union .
