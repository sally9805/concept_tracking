txt CELESTIAL Corros. -A telegraphic dispatch from San Francisco last night brought us a noteworthy item . Among the arrivals of ships at that port , was one on day before yesterday from Shanghai , with late dates , ? and bringing as cargo seven hundred bales of cotton goods ( drills and sheetings ) from China . She also brings advices that hereafter the California market will be liberally supplied with cotton goods from that quarter . Considering the present enormous prices of cotton goods in this country , this is not at all wonderful . Cotton can be raised in China cheaper than in any other part of the world , except the Southern States , owing to the great abundance and low price of labor ; and from the same cause it can be manufactured cheaper there than anywhere else , except in Europe and this country , where there is laborsaving machinery . Immense quantities of cotton are raised , manufactured and consumed in China , and its cultivation has been carried on there for near a thousand years , if not indeed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for her own use , ' and has imported largely from the East Indies . But the temptation of the high prices ruling here is too much for the Celestials . These cotton goods , too , it must be remembered , left China when cotton in our market did not rate above thirty or forty cents a pound , and the manufactured article at a proportionate rate . When John Chinaman learns that cotton in New-York sells at ninety cents a pound , he will ship every ounce of it he can find or raise , and , if necessary , go naked himself . If cotton goods keep up at their present price for any length of ' time , we should not wonder to see all New-York during the coming Summer dressed in nankeens . Nothing could be better for the warm weather , or knore economical for the hard times . California will find this a fine beginning for that immense oriental - trade she so much covets , and is , bound Owe day to enjoy .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
