Enter Derric Van Slaus , L. H. Derr . Derric Van Slaus Should the present application fall , I am a ruined man ; all my speculations will be frustrated , and my duplicity exposed ; yes , the dissipation of my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To supply his wants , the public money has been employed ; and , if unable to replace it , heaven knows what may be the consequence . But my son is now placed with an able advocate in New York , and should he pursue the right path , there may be still hopes of his reformation . Herman . Herman Van Slaus Without , L. H. My father , you say , is this way ? Derr . Derric Van Slaus What voice is that ; my son ? What can have recalled him thus suddenly ? Some new misadventure  --  Oh , my forboding thoughts ! Enter Herman , L. H. Derr . Derric Van Slaus Herman , what brings you back ? Are all my cautions thus lightly regarded , that they can take no hold upon your conduct ? Herm .

Herman Van Slaus Not so , sir , but the reverse . List ! you know our neighbor . Rip Van Winkle ? Derr . Derric Van Slaus Know him ? Aye , his idleness is proverbial : you have good cause to recollect him too , since ' t was by his courage your life was preserved , when attacked by the famished wolf . Herm . Herman Van Slaus He has a daughter scarcely seven years old : now , the attorney whom I serve , has been employed to draw up the will and settle the affairs of this girl 's aunt , who , for some slight offered by Van Winkle , has long since discarded the family . At her death , the whole of her immense wealth , in cash and land , is the inheritance of the girl , who is , at this moment , the richest presumptive heiress in the land . Derr .

Now , my good father , am I comprehensible ? Derr . Derric Van Slaus Truly , this seems no visionary dream , like those in which , with fatal pertinacity , you have so oft indulged ; and , on recollection the rent of his tenement is in arreas ; ' twill offer favorable opportunity for my calling and sounding him ; the contract must be your cars Herm . Herman Van Slaus ' T is already prepared and lacks only his signature .  --  Presenting it . Lawyers , who would do justice to their clients , must not pause at conscience ; ' t is entirely out of the question when their own interest is concerned . Derr .

Exit , R. H. Herm . Herman Van Slaus Solus . True ; the honest lawyer lives by his reputation , and therefore pauses to undertake a cause he knows unjust : but how easily are some duped . Can my father for a moment suppose , that the rank weeds of youth are so easily uprooted ? No ! what is to be done , good father of mine , but to serve myself ? young men of the present generation can not live without the means of entering into life 's varieties and this supply will henceforth enable me to do so , to the fullest extent of my ambitious wishes .

Sensible , susceptible soul ! But merit ever meets its recompense . Alice . Alice Knickerbocker No wonder I am fascinated ; his figure is so elegant , and then his education ! I never see him , but I am ready to jump into his loving arms . Turning , she is caught in the embrace of Knick . Knick . Knickerbocker This is too much for human nature to support ; this declaration is a banquet that gods might prize . Beauteous angel ! hear me , whilst I proclaim  --  Kneeling . Dame . Dame Van Winkle Without . Go along , you drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Dame Van Winkle ! what 's to become of me ? Alice .

Rip , in his sudden alarm , upsets the porcelain and glass ; and , falling , rolls into the middle of the chamber , quaking in every limb , and vociferating loudly . Rip . Rip Van Winkle Help ! murder ! fire ! thieves ! Knickerbocker , in the interim , darts out of the closet , and , beyond the consiousness of future proceeding , throws himself into the arm chair  --  Alice , entering hastily , throws a cloak over him , which hides him from observation .  --  Dame enters , alarmed , R.

A devil , indeed , has been in the cupboard , and that 's you . The china , presented to me by my grand relations , which I set such store on , smashed into a thousand pieces : ' t is too much for my weak nerves . I shall awoon ! I shall faint ! She sinks in the arm chair , but immediately starts up , and , squalling , falls into Rip 's arms .  --  Knickerbocker regains the closet , unobserved by all , save Alice . Dame .

Knickerbocker I shall never be able to come again ,  --  the cross vixen will take care of that if she catches me here Alice . Alice Knickerbocker There is but one method of avoiding her wrath ; slip on the clothes the old pedlar woman brought for sale , and I 'll warrant you 'll soon be tumbled out of the house . Knick . Knickerbocker With a good thrashing to boot , I suppose . No matter , if I can but slip out of the house , I do n't care what I slip into .

Rip . Rip Van Winkle Hang me , if he has n't brought my heart up into my mouth what an outlandish being , a sea snake , by dunder ! Music .  --  Swaggrino , pointing to the cask , entreats Rip 's assistance in bearing it up the mountains . Rip . Rip Van Winkle Want me to help you up mit it ? Why not say so at first , my old codger ? What a queer old chap to be sure ; but I ca n't let him toil up the mountain with such a heavy load as dat , no , no , and so old broad chops I 'll help you .

Swaggrino taps the cask ; motions the astonished Rip to assist him in distributing its contents into various flagons ; an injunction with which he complies.  --  Swaggrino helps his companions . Rip . Rip Van Winkle On L. H. After all , they seem a harmless set , and there can be no argument with them , for they appear to be all dumbles.  --  Lord were my wife as silent . They 're a deadly , lively , jolly set ; but I wonder what kind of spirits dese spirits are drinking ! surely , dere can be no harm in taking a drop along mit dem .  --  Fills a flagon.  --  Here goes !  --  Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familly 's , and may you all live long and prosper .

He awakens in sudden emotion Eh ! by dunder ! what 's all dis , where am I in the name of goodness where am I ? gazing around . On the Catskill Mountains , by all that 's miraculous ! Egad ! my rib will play the very devil with me for stopping out all night . There will be a fine peal sounded when I get home .

Looking around . Where is my gun ? I left it on a little bush . On examining he finds the rusty barrel of his gun . Hillo ! come up , here 's a grab ! the unmanerly set of sharpers ! stolen one of the best fowling pieces that ever made a crack ; and left this worhless , rusty barrel , by way of exchange ! What will Dame Van Winkle say to this . By the hookey ! but she 'll comb my hair finely ! Now , I went to sleep beneath that hickory ;  --  ' t was a mere bush . Can I be dreaming still ?

Oh , my poor father ! little did you know the misery you have entailed upon your child . Knickerbocker and Alice enter , L. H. arm in arm . They are much more corpulent than when seen in Act 1 and dressed in modern attire ,  --  Alice in the extreme of former fashion . Knick . Knickerbocker Decided that cause in the most judgematical like manner . White was n't black . Saw that in a twinkling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come along , spouse ! Lauks ! how you do waddle up and down side to side like one of our butter laden logers in a squall , as the Dutchmen have it , ah , Lorrenna , you here ? but you appear more depressed than customary . Those saddened looks are by no means pleasing to those who would ever wish to see you cheerful . What the dickens prevents your being otherwise when all around are so anxious for your happiness . Lor . Lorrenna Truely , am I beholden for your protection and ever grateful . But to place a smile on the brow whilst sorrow lingers in the bosom , is a deceptive penance to the wearer  --  painful to those around who mark and must perceive the wizard ; to say that I am happy would be inconsistant with truth . The persecutions of Herman Van Slaus  --  Alice . Alice Knickerbocker Ah ! my dear Lorrenna , many a restless night have I had on that varlet 's account , as spouse knows . Knick .

Knickerbocker There , there Alice is getting into her romance again ,  --  plain as my fist  --  she has been moonified ever since she became a subscriber for books at the new library !

Lor . Lorrenna Gustaffe so near ? blessed intelligence ! Oh , the happiest wishes of my heart are gratified ! But are you certain ? Do not raise my hopes without cause . Are you quite certain ? speak dear aunt ; are you indeed assured , Gustaffe 's vessel has arrived ? Knick . Knickerbocker Did'nt think fit to break the news too suddenly , but you have it . Alice .

Knick Knickerbocker Aye , aye ; let me alone to manage him , as a barrister says to his client when he cross-questions a witness . See Miss Lorrenna to her chamber , Mrs. Knickerbocker .

Her . Herman Van Slaus You will not , I presume , dispute the signature of the individual who formed the contract ? Knick . Knickerbocker Oh , no ! not dispute Rip 's signature , but his error in judgement .
