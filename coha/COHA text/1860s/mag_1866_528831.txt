AN AMAZONIAN PICNIC . IT was about half past six o'clock on the morning of the 27th of October , i86* , that we left Manaos , ( or , as the maps usually call it , Barra do Rio Negro , ) on an excursion to the Lake of Hyanuary , on the western side of the Rio Negro . The morning was unusually fresh for these latitudes , and a strong wind was blowing up so heavy a sea in the river , that , if it did not acteally make one sea-sick , it certainly called up very vivid and painful associations . We were in a large eight - oared custom - house barge , our company consisting of his Excellency , Dr. Epaminondas , President of the Province , * his secretary , Senhor Codicera , Senhor Tavares Bastos , the distinguished young deputy from the Province of Alagoas , Major Coutinho , of the Brazilian Engineer Service , Mr. Agassiz and myself , Mr. Bourkhardt , his artist , and two of our volunteer assistants . We were preceded by a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and kind host , Senhor Honorio , who had undertaken to provide for our creature comforts , and had the care of a boatful of provisions . After an hour 's row we left the rough waters of the Rio Negro , and , rounding a wooded point , turned into one of those narrow , winding igarap6s ( literally , " boat-paths " ) with green forest walls , which make the charm of canoe excursions in this country . A ragged drapery of long , faded grass hung from the lower branches of the trees , marking the height of the last rise of the river , - some eighteen or twenty feet above its present level . Here and there a white heron stood on the shore , his snowy plumage glittering * Without entering here upon the generosity shown not only hy the Brazilian government , hut hy individuals also , to this expedition , - a debt which it will he my pleasant duty to acknowledge fully hereafter in a more extended report of our journey , - I can not omit this opportunity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Amazonas , for the facilities accorded to me during my whole stay in the region now under his administration . - Louis Agassiz. in the sunlight ; numbers of ciganas ( the pheasants of the Amazons ) clustered in the bushes ; once a pair of king vultures rested for a moment within gunshot , but flew out of sight as our canoe approached ; and now and then an alligator showed his head above water . As we floated along through this picturesque channel , so characteristic of the wonderful region to which we were all more or less strangers ,  --  for even Dr. Epaminondas and Senhor Tavares Bastos were here for the first time , - the conversation turned naturally enough upon the nature of this Amazonian valley , its physical conformation , its origin and resources , its history past and to come , both alike obscure , both the subject of wonder and speculation . Senhor Tavares Bastos , although not yet thirty , is already distinguished in the politics of his country ; and , from the moment he entered upon public life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amazons , its relation to the future progress and development of the Brazilian empire , has been the object of his deepest interest . He is a leader in that class of men who advocate the most liberal policy in this matter , and has already urged upon his countrymen the importance , even from selfish motives , of sharing their great treasure with the world . He was little more than twenty years of age when he published his papers on the opening of the Amazons , which have done more , perhaps , than anything else of late years to attract attention to the subject . There are points where the researches of the statesman and the investigator meet , and natural science is not without its influence , even on the practical bearings of this question . Shall this region be legislated for as sea or land ? Shall the interests of agriculture or navigation prevail in its councils ? Is it essentially aquatic or terrestrial ? Such were some of the inquiries which came up in the course of the discussion . A region i866. 313 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is flooded for half the year , where there can never he railroads , or highways , or even pedestrian travelling , to any great extent , can hardly be considered as dry land . It is true that , in this oceanic river system , the tidal action has an annual , instead of a daily , ebb and flow ; that its rise and fall obey a larger light , and are regulated by the sun , and not the moon ; but it is nevertheless subject to all the conditions of a submerged district , and must be treated as such . Indeed , these semiannual changes of level are far more powerful in their influence on the life of the inhabitants than any marine tides . People sail half the year over districts where , for the other half , they walk , though hardly dry-shod , over the soaked ground ; their occupations , their dress , their habits , are modified in accordance with the dry and wet seasons . And not only the ways of life , but the whole aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . At this moment there are two most picturesque falls in the neighborhood of Manaos , - the Great and Little Cascades , as they are called , - favorite resorts for bathing , picnics , etc. , which , in a few months , when the river shall have risen above their highest level , will have completely disappeared . Their bold rocks and shady nooks will have become riverbottom . All that one hears or reads of the extent of the Amazons and its tributaries does not give one an idea of its immensity as a whole . One must float for months upon its surface , in order to understand how fully water has the mastery over land along its borders . Its watery labyrinth is not so much a network of rivers , as an ocean of fresh water cut up and divided by land , the land being often nothing more than an archipelago of islands in its midst . The valley of the Amazons is indeed an aquatic , not a terrestrial , basin ; and it is not strange , . when looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be less full of life , comparatively , than its rivers . But while we were discussing these points , talking of the time when the banks of the Amazons will teem with a population more active and vigorous than any it has yet seen , - when all civilized nations shall share in its wealth , - when the twin continents will shake hands , and Americans of the North come to help Americans of the South in developing its resources , - when it will be navigated from north to south , as well as from east to west , and small steamers will run up to the head-waters of all its tributaries , - while we were speculating on these things , we were approaching the end of our journey ; and , as we neared the lake , there issued from its entrance a small , two-masted canoe , evidently bound on some official mission , for it carried the Brazilian flag , and was adorned with many brightly colored streamers . As it drew near we heard music ; and a salvo of rockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day or night , shot up into the air . Our arrival had been announced by Dr. Carnavaro of Manaos , who had come out the day before to make some preparations for our reception , and this was a welcome to the President on his first visit to the Indian village . When they came within speaking distance , a succession of hearty cheers went up for the President ; for Tavares Bastos , whose character as the political advocate of the Amazons makes him especially welcome here ; for Major Coutinho , already well known from his former explorations in this region ; and for the strangers within their gates , - for the Professor and his party . When the reception was over , they fell into line behind our boat , and so we came into the little port with something of state and ceremony . This pretty Indian village is hardly recognized as a village at once , for it consists of a number of si1z*s ( palmthatched houses ) , scattered through the forest ; and though the inhabitants look on each other as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitz* was to be seen ,  --  that at which we were to stay . It stood on a hill which sloped gently up from the lake shore , and consisted of a mud house ,  --  the rough frame // i866. being filled in and plastered with mud , - containing two rooms , beside several large palm-thatched sheds outside . The word sized , which we connect with a low , narrow out-house , gives no correct idea , however , of this kind of structure , universal throughout the Indian settlements , and common also among the whites . The space enclosed is generally large , the sloping roof of palmthatch is lifted very high on poles made of the trunks of trees , thus allowing a free circulation of air , and there are usually no walls at all . They are great open porches , or verandas , rather than sheds . One of these rooms was used for the various processes by which the mandioca root is transformed into farinha , tapioca , and tucupi , a kind of intoxicating liquor . It was furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper pans , for drying the farinha , with the troughs for kneading the mandioca , the long straw tubes for expressing the juice , and the sieves for straining the tapioca . The mandioca room is an important part of every Indian sitlo ; for the natives not only depend , in a great degree , upon the different articles manufactured from this root for their own food , but it makes an essential part of the commerce of the Amazons . Another of these open rooms was a kitchen ; while a third , which served as our dining-room , is used on festa days and occasional Sundays as a chapel . It differed from the rest in having the upper end closed in with a neat thatched wall , against which , in time of need , the altar-table may stand , with candles and rough prints or figures of the Virgin and Saints . A little removed from this more central part of the establishment was another smaller mud house , where most of the party arranged their hammocks ; Mr. Agassiz and myself being accommodated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the senbora of the sit jo , an old Indian woman , whose gold ornaments , necklace , and ear-rings were rather out of keeping with her calico skirt and cotton waist . This is , however , by no means an unusual combination here . Beside the old lady , the family consisted , at this moment , of her afihizada ( god-daughter ) , with her little boy , and several other women employed about the place ; but it is difficult to judge of the population of the sitios now , because a great number of the men have been taken as recruits for the war with Paraguay , and others are hiding in the forest for fear of being pressed into the same service . The breakfast - table , covered with dishes of fish fresh from the lake , and dressed in a variety of ways , with stewed chicken , rice , etc. ; was by no means an unwelcome sight , as it was already eleven o'clock , and we had had nothing since risin0 , , at half past five in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the meal the less appetizing that it was spread under the palmthatched roof of our open , airy diningroom , surrounded by the forest , and commanding a view of the lake and wooded hillside opposite , the little landing below , where were moored our barge with its white awning , the gay canoe , and two or three Indian montarias , making the foreground of the picture . After breakfast our party dispersed , some to rest in their hammocks , others to hunt or fish , while Mr. Agassiz was fully engaged in examining a large basket of fish , - Tucunar6s , Acaras , Curimatas , Surubims , etc. , - just brought in from the lake for his inspection , and showing again what every investigation demonstrates afresh , namely , the distinct localization of species in every different water-basin , be it river , lake , igara , or forest pool . Though the scientific results of the expedition have no place in this little sketch of a single excursion , let me make a general statement as to Mr. Agassiz 's collections , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pard , although his exploration of the Amazonian waters is but half completed , he has collected more species than were known to exist in the whole world fifty years ago . Up to this time , something more than a hundred species of fish were known to science from the Amazons ; * Mr. Agassiz has already * Mr. Wallace speaks of having collected over two // more than eight hundred on hand , and every day adds new treasures . He is himself astonished at this result , revealing a richness and variety in the distribution of life throughout these waters of which he had formed no conception . As his own attention has been especially directed to their localization and development , his collection of fishes is larger than any other ; still , with the help of his companions , volunteers as well as regular assistants , he has a good assortment of specimens from all the other classes of the animal kingdom likewise . One does not see much of the world between one o'clock and four in this climate . These are the hottest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can resist the temptation of the cool swinging hammock , slung in some shady spot within doors or without . I found a quiet retreat by the lake shore , where , though I had a book in my hand , the wind in the trees overhead , and the water rippling softly around the montarias moored at my side , lulled me into that mood of mind when one may be lazy without remorse or ennui , and one 's highest duty seems to be to do nothing . The monotonous notes of a violon , a kind of lute or guitar , came to me from a group of trees at a little distance , where our boatmen were resting in the shade , the red fringes of their hammocks giving to the landscape just the bit of color which it needed . Occasionally a rustling flight of paroquets or ciganas overhead startled me for a moment , or a large pirarucu plashed out of the water ; but except for these sounds , Nature was silent , and animals as well as men seemed to pause in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at the close of the afternoon in our airy banqueting-hall . As we were with the President , our picnic was of a much more magnificent character than are our purely scientific excursions , of which we have had many . On such occahundred species in the Rio Negro but as these were unfortunately lost , and never described , they can not be counted as belonging among the possessions of the scientific world . sions , we are forced to adapt our wants to our means ; and the make-shifts to which we are obliged to resort , if they are sometimes inconvenient , are often very amusing . But now , instead of teacups doing duty as tumblers , empty barrels serving as chairs , and the like incongruities , we had a silver soup tureen and a cook and a wai.ter , and knives and forks enough to go round , and many other luxuries which such wayfarers as ourselves learn to do without . While we were dining , the Indians began to come in from the surrounding forest to pay their respects to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was to be a ball in his honor in the evening . They brought an enormous cluster of game as an offering . What a mass of color it was , looking more like an immense bouquet of flowers than like a bunch of birds ! It was composed entirely of toucans with their red and yellow beaks , blue eyes , and soft white breasts bordered with crimson , and of parrots , or papagaios , as they call them here , with their gorgeous plumage of green , blue , purple , and red . When we had dined we took coffee outside , while our places around the table were filled by the Indian guests , who were to have a dinner-party in their turn . It was pleasant to see with how much courtesy several of the Brazilian gentlemen of our party waited upon these Indian senhoras , passing them a variety of dishes , helping them to wine , and treating them with as much attention as if they had been the highest ladies of the land . They seemed , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed before them , till one of the gentlemen who has lived a good deal among the Indians , and knows their habits perfectly , took the knife and fork from one of them , exclaiming , - " Make no ceremony , and do n't be ashamed ; eat with your fingers , all of you , as you re accustomed to do , and then you 11 find your appetites and enjoy your dinner. ** His advice was followed ; and I must say they seemed much more comfortable // in consequence , and did better justice to the good fare . Although the Indians who live in the neighborhood of the towns have seen too much of the conventionalities of civilization not to understand the use of a knife and fork , no Indian will eat with one if he can help it ; and , strange to say , there are many of the whites in the upper Amazonian settlements who have adopted the same habits . I have dined with Brazilian senhoras of good class and condition , belonging to the gentry of the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guests , used themselves only the implements with which Nature had provided them . When the dinner was over , the room was cleared of the tables , and swept ; the music , consisting of a guitar , flute , and violin , called in ; and the ball was opened . At first the forest belles were rather shy in the presence of strangers ; but they soon warmed up , amd began to dance with more animation . They were all dressed in calico or muslin skirts , with loose white cotton waists , finished around the neck with a kind of lace they make themselves by drawing out the threads from cotton or cambric so as to form an open pattern , sewing those which remain over and over to secure them . Much of this lace is quite elaborate , and very fine . Many of them had their hair dressed either with white jessamine or with roses stuck into their round combs , and several wore gold beads and ear-rings . Some of the Indian dances are very pretty ; but one thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man makes all the advances , while the woman is coy and retiring , her movements being very languid . Her partner throws himself at her feet , but does not elicit a smile or a gesture ; he stoops , and pretends to be fishing , making motions as if he were drawing her in with a line ; he dances around her , snapping his fingers as though playing on the castanets , and half encircling her with his arms ; but she remains reserved and cold . Now and then they join together in something like a waltz ; but this is only occasionally , and for a moment . How different from the negro dances , of which we saw many in the neighborhood of Rio ! In those the advances come chiefly from the women , and are not always of a very modest character . The moon was shining brightly over lake and forest , and the ball was gayer than ever , at ten o'clock , when I went to my room , or rather to the room where my hammock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , with a cat and her family of kittens , who slept on the edge of my mosquito-net , and made frequent inroads upon the inside , with hens and chickens and sundry dogs , who went in and out at will . The music and dancing , the laughter and talking outside , continued till the small hours . Every now and then an Indian girl would come in to rest for a while , take a nap in a hammock , and then return to the dance . When we first arrived in South America , we could hardly have slept soundly under such circumstances ; but one soon becomes accustomed , on the Amazons , to sleeping in rooms with mud floors and mud walls , or with no walls at all , where rats and birds and bats rustle about in the thatch ov&amp;i* one 's head , and all sorts of unwonted noises in the night remind you that you are by no means the sole occupant of your apartment . This remark does not apply to the towns , where the houses are comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten track , to make canoe excursions , and see something of the forest population , you must submit to these inconveniences . There is one thing , however , which makes it far pleasanter to lodge in the Indian houses here than in the houses of our poorer class at home . One is quite independent in the matter of bedding ; no one travels without his own hammock and the net which in many places is a necessity on account of the mosquitoes . Beds and bedding are almost unknown here ; and there are none so poor as not to possess two or three of the strong and neat twine hammocks // made by the Indians themselves from the fibres of the palm . Then the open character of their houses , as well as the personal cleanliness of the Indians , makes the atmosphere fresher and purer there than in the houses of our poor . However untidy they may be in other respects , they always bathe once or twice a day , if not oftener , and wash their clothes frequently . We have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor , unless it might be the peculiar smell from the preparation of the mandioca in the working-room outside , which has , at a certain stage in the process , a slightly sour smell . We certainly could not say as much for many houses where we have lodged when travelling in the West , or even " Down East , " where the suspicious look of the bedding and the close air of the room often make one doubtful about the night 's rest . We were up at five o'clock ; for the morning hours are very precious b* this climate , and the Brazilian day begins with the dawn . At six o'clock we had had coffee , and were ready for the various projects suggested for our amusement . Our sportsmen were already in the forest ; others had gone off on a A shing excursion in a montana ; and I joined a party on a visit to a si/ia higher up the lake . Mr. Agassiz , as has been constantly the case throughout our journey , was obliged to deny himself all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species of fish brought in kept him and his artist constantly at work . In this climate the process of decomposition goes on so rapidly , that , unless the specimens are attended to at once , they are lost ; and the paintings must be made while they are quite fresh , in order to give any idea of their vividness of tint . We therefore left Mr. Agassiz busy with the preparation of his collections , and Mr. Bourkhardt painting , while we went up the lake through a strange , halfaquatic , half-terrestrial region , where the land seemed hardly redeemed from the water . Groups of trees rose directly from the lake , their roots hidden below its surface , while numerous blackened and decayed trunks stood up from the water in all sorts of picturesque and fantastic forms . Sometimes the trees had thrown down from their branches those singular aerial roots so common here , and seemed standing on stilts . Here and there , when we coasted along by the bank , we had a glimpse into the deeper forest , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasitic sipos twining close around the trunks , or swinging themselves from branch to branch like loose cordage . But usually the margin of the lake was a gently sloping bank , covered with a green so vivid and yet so soft that it seemed as if the earth had been born afresh in its six months ' baptism , and had come out like a new creation . Here and there a palm lifted its head above the line of the forest , especially the light , graceful Assai palm , with its tall , slender , smooth stem and crown of feathery leaves vibrating with every breeze . Half an hour 's row brought us to the landing of the si/b for which we were bound . Usually the si/los stand on the bank of the lake or river , a stone s throw from the shore , for convenience of fishing , bathing , etc . But this one was at some distance , with a very nicely-kept winding path leading through the forest ; and as it was far the neatest and prettiest si/b I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stood on the brow of a hill which dipped down on the other side into a wide and deep ravine . Through this ravine ran an igara , beyond which the land rose again in an undulating line of hilly ground , most refreshing to the eye after the flat character of the upper Amazonian scenery . The fact that this si/ia , standing now on a hill overlooking the valley and the little stream at its bottom , will have the water nearly flush with the ground around it when the igara is swollen by the rise of the river , gives an idea of the change of aspect between the dry and wet seasons . The establishment consisted of a num // ber of buildings , the most conspicuous of which was a large and lofty open room , which the Indian senhora told me was their reception-room , and was often used , she said , by the brancos ( whites ) from Manaos and the neighborhood for an evening dance , when they came out in a large company , and passed the night . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ran along the sides of this room , wooden benches being placed against them for their whole length . The two ends were closed from top to bottom by very neat thatched walls ; the palm-thatch here , when it is made with care , being exceedingly pretty , fine , and smooth , and of a soft straw color . At the upper end stood an immense embroidery-frame , looking as if it might have served for Penelope 's web , but in which was stretched an unfinished hammock of palm-thread , the senhora 's work . She sat down on the low stool before it , and worked a little for my benefit , showing me how the two layers of transverse threads were kept apart by a thick , polished piece of wood , something like a long , broad ruler . Through the opening thus made the shuttle is passed with the cross-thread , which is then pushed down and straightened in its place by means of the same piece of wood . When we arrived , with the exception of the benches I have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a single piece of wood and common in every sub , this room was empty ; but immediately a number of hammocks , of various color and texture , were brought and slung across the room from side to side , between the poles supporting the roof , and we were invited to rest . This is the first act of hospitality on arriving at a country-house here ; and the guests are soon stretched in every attitude of luxurious ease . After we had rested , the gentlemen went down to the igara to bathe , while the senhora and her daughter , a very pretty Indian woman , showed me over the rest of the establishment . She had the direction of everything now ; for the master of the house was An Arnazoniezn Picnic . 319 absent , having a captain* s commission in the army ; and I heard here the same complaints which meet you everywhere in the forest settlements , of the deficiency of men on account of the recruiting . The room I have described stood on one side of a cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances , stood a number of little thatched houses , - casinhas , as they call them , - consisting mostly only of one room . But beside these there was one larger house , with mud walls and floor , containing two or three rooms , and having a wooden veranda in front . This was the senhora 's private establishment . At a little distance farther down on the hill was the*mandioca kitchen , with several large ovens , troughs , etc . Nothing could be neater than the whole area of this si/b ; and while we were there , two or three black girls were sent out to sweep it afresh with their stiff twig brooms . Around was the plantation of mandioca and cacao , with here and there a few coffeeshrubs . It is difficult to judge of the extent of these sub plantations , because they are so irregular , and comprise such a variety of trees , - mandioca , coffee , cacao , and often cotton , being planted pellmell together . But every sitbo has its plantation , large or small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the return of the gentlemen from the igara , we took leave , though very kindly pressed to stay and breakfast . At parting , the senhora presented me with a wicker-basket of fresh eggs , and some abacatys , or alligator pears , as we call them . We reached the house just in time for a ten-o'clock breakfast , which assembled all the different parties once more from their various occupations , whether of work or play . The sportsmen returned from the forest , bringing a goodly supply of toucans , papagaios , and paroquets , with a variety of other birds ; and the fishermen brought in treasures again for Mr. Agassiz . After breakfast I retired to the room where we had passed the night , hoping to find a quiet time for writing up letters // and journal . But it was already occupied by the old senhora and her guests , lounging about in the hammocks or squatting on the floor and smoking their pipes . The house was , indeed , full to overflowing , as the whole party assembled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way of living it is an easy matter to accommodate any number of people ; for if they can not all be received under the roof ; they are quite as well satisfied to put up their hammocks under the trees outside . As I went to my room the evening before , I stopped to look at quite a pretty picture of an Indian mother with her two little children asleep on either arm , all in one hammock , in the open air . My Indian friends were too much interested in my occupations to allow of my continuing them uninterruptedly . They were delighted with my books , ( I happened to have Bates 's " Naturalist on the Amazons " with me , in which I showed them some pictures of Amazonian scenery and insects , ) and asked me many questions about my country , my voyage , and my travels here . In return , they gave me much information about their own way of life . They said the present gathering of neighbors and friends was no unusual occurrence ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious in character , are also occasions of great festivity . These festas are celebrated at different si/los in turn , the saint of the day being carried , with all his ornaments , candles , bouquets , etc. , to the house where the ceremony is to take place , and where all the people of the village congregate . Sometimes they last for several days , and are accompanied by processions , music , and dances in the evening . But the women said the forest was very sad now , because their men had all been taken as recruits , or were seeking safety in the woods . The old senhora told me a sad story of the brutality exercised in recruiting the Indians . She assured me that they were taken wherever they were caught , without reference to age or circumstances , often having women and children dependent upon them ; and , if they made resistance , were carried off by force , frequently handcuffed , or with heavy weights attached to their feet . Such proceedings are entirely illegal ; but these forest villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may practise any cruelty without being called to account for it . If they bring in their recruits in good condition , no questions are asked . These women assured me that all the work of the si/los- the making of farinha , the fishing , the turtle-hunting - was stopped for want of hands . The appearance of things certainly confirms this , for one sees scarcely any men about in the villages , and the canoes one meets are mostly rowed by women . I must say that the life of the Iifdian woman , so far as we have seen it , and this is by no means the only time that we have been indebted to Indians for hospitality , seems to me enviable in comparison with that of the Brazilian lady in the Amazonian towns . The former has a healthful out-of-door life ; she has her canoe on the lake or river , and her paths through the forest , with perfect liberty to come and go ; she has her appointed daily occupations , being busy not only with the care of her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in drying and rolling tobacco , while the men are fishing and turtle-hunting ; and she has her frequent festa days to enliven her workio.g life . It is , on the contrary , , impossible to imagine anything more dreary and monotonous than the life of the Brazilian senhora in any of the smaller towns . In the northern provinces , especially , the old Portuguese notions about shutting women up and making their home-life as colorless as that of a cloistered nun , without even the element of religious enthusiasm to give it zest , still prevail . Many a Brazilian lady passes day after day without stirring beyond her four walls , scarcely even showing herself at the door or window ; for she is always in a careless dishabille , unless she expects company . It is sad to see these stifled existences ; without any // contact with the world outside , without any charm of domestic life , without books or culture of any kind , the Brazilian senhora in this part of the country either sinks contentedly into a vapid , empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as discontented as she is useless . On the day of our arrival the dinner had been interrupted by the entrance of the Indians with their greetings and presents of game to the President ; but on the second day it was enlivened by quite a number of appropriate toasts and speeches . I thought , as we sat around the dinner-table , there had probably never before been gathered under the palm-roof of an Indian house on the Amazons a party combining so many different elements and objects . There was the President , whose interest is , of course , in administering the affairs of the province , in which the Indians come in for a large share of his attention ; - there was the young statesman , whose whole heart is in the great national question of peopling the Amazonian region and opening it to the world , and in the effect this movement is to have upon his country ; - there was the able engineer , whose scientific life has been passed in surveying the great river and its tributaries with a view to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure science , come to study the distribution of animal life in their waters , with no view to practical questions . The speeches touched upon all these interests , and were received with enthusiasm , each one closing with a toast and music , for our little band of the night before had been brought in to enliven the scene . The Brazilians are very happy in their after-dinner speeches , and have great facility in them , whether from a natural gift or from much practice . The habit of drinking healths and giving toasts is very general throughout the country ; and the most informal dinner among intimate friends does not conclude without some mutual greetings of this kind . As we were sitting under the trees afterwards , having yielded our places in the primitive dining-room to the Indian 321 guests , the President suggested a sunset row on the lake . The hour and the light were most tempting ; and we were soon off in the canoe , taking no boatmen , the gentlemen preferiKng to row themselves . We went through the same lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had passed in the morning , floating between patches of greenest grass , and large forest-trees , and blackened trunks standing out of the lake like ruins . We did not go very fast nor very far , for our amateur boatmen found the evening warm , and their rowing was rather play than work ; they stopped , too , every now and then , to get a shot at a white heron or into a flock of paroquets or ciganas , whereby they wasted a good deal of powder to no effect . As we turned to come back , we were met by one of the prettiest sights I have ever seen . The Indian women , having finished their dinner , had taken the little two-masted canoe , dressed with flags , which had been prepared for the President 's reception , and had come out to meet us . They had the music on board , and there were two or three men in the boat ; but the women were some twelve or fifteen in number , and seemed , like genuine Amazons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rowing with a will ; and as the canoe drew near , with music playing and flags flying , the purple lake , dyed in the sunset and smooth as a mirror , gave back the picture . Every tawny figure at the oars , every flutter of the crimson and blue streamers , every fold of the green and yellow national flag at the prow , was as distinct below the surface as above it . The fairy boat , for so it looked floating between glowing sky and water , and seeming to borrow color fromboth , came on apace , and as it approached our friends greeted us with many a Viva / to which we responded as heartily . Then the two canoes joined company , and we went on together , taking the guitar sometimes into one and sometimes into the other , while Brazilian and Indian songs followed each other . Anything more national , more completely imbued with tropical coloring and character , An Amc*vonian Picnic . // 322 than this evening scene on the lake , can hardly be conceived . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fading into soft masses of white and ashen gray , and moonlight was taking the place of sunset . As we went up the green slope to the sitlo , a dance on the grass was proposed , and the Indian girls formed a quadrille ; for thus much of outside civilization has crept into their native manners , though they throw into it so much of their own characteristic movements that it loses something of its conventional aspect . Then we returned to the house , where the dancing and singing were renewed , while here and there groups sat about on the ground laughing and talking , and the women smoking with as much enjoyment as the men . Smoking is almost universal among the common women here , nor is it confined to the lower classes . Many a senhora , at least in this part of Brazil , ( for one must distinguish between the civilization upon the banks of the Amazons and in the interior , and that in the cities along the coast , ) enjoys her pipe while she lounges in her hammock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party broke up . The Indian women came to bid us good by after breakfast , and dispersed in various directions , through the forest paths , to their several homes , going off in little groups , with their babies , of whom there were a goodly number , astride on their hips , and the older children following . Mr. Agassiz passed the morning in packing and arranging his fishes , having collected in these two days more than seventy new species : such is the wealth of life everywhere in these waters . His studies had been the subject of great curiosity to the people about the sub ; one or two were always hovering around to look at his work , and to watch Mr. Bourkhardt 's drawing . They seemed to think it extraordinary that any one should care to take the portrait of a fish . The familiarity of these children of the forest with the natural objects about them - plants , birds , insects , fishes - is remarkable . They frequently ask to see the drawings , and , in turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will scarcely make a mistake ; even the children giving the name instantly , and often adding , " He fiho d'eiZe , " - " It is the child of such a one , " - thus distinguishing the young from the adult , and pointing out their relation . The scientific work excites great wonder among the Indians , wherever we go ; and when Mr. Agassiz succeeds in making them understand the value he attaches to his collections , he often finds them efficient assistants . We dined rather earlier than usual ,  - -  our chief dish being a stew of parrots and toucans ,  --  and left the sub at about five o'clock , in three canoes , the music accompanying us in the smaller boat . Our Indian friends stood on the shore as we left , giving us a farewell greeting with cheers and waving hats and hands . The row through the lake and i*ara was delicious ; and we saw many alligators lying lazily about in the quiet water , who seemed to enjoy it , after their fashion , as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we issued from the little river , and the Rio Negro , where it opens broadly out into the Amazons , was a sea of silver . The boat with the music presently joined our canoe ; and we had a number of the Brazilian rnodi , zhas , as they call them , - songs which seem especially adapted for the guitar and moonlight . These rnodinluzs have quite a peculiar character . They are little , graceful , lyrical snatches of song , with a rather melancholy cadence ; even those of which the words are gay not being quite free from this undertone of sadness . One hears them constantly sung to the guitar , a favorite instrument with the Brazilians as well as the Indians . This put us all into a somewhat dreamy mood , and we approached the end of our journey rather silently . But as we came toward the landing , we heard the sound of a band of brass instruments , effectually drowning our feeble efforts , and saw a crowded canoe coming towards us . They were the boys from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain nurn // ber of boys of Indian parentage , though not all of pure descent , receive an education at the expense of the province , and are taught a number of trades . Among other things , they are trained to play on a variety of instruments , and are said to show a remarkable facility for music . The boat , which , from its size , was a barge rather than a canoe , looked very pretty as it came towards us in the moonlight ; it seemed full to 323 overflowing , the children all standing up , dressed in white uniforms . This little band comes always on Sunday evenings and festa days to play before the President 's house . They were just returning , it being nearly ten o'clock ; but the President called to them to turn back , and they accompanied us to the beach , playing all the while . Thus our pleasant three-days picnic ended with music and moonlight .                    @
