txt THE DELUGE IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENCE . A Discourse . BY WILLIAM DENTON . WELLESLEY , MASS. : DENTON PUBLISHING COMPANY . 1882 . THE DELUGE IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN SCIENCE . If the Bible is God 's book , we ought to know it . If the Creator of the universe has spoken to man , how important that we should listen to his voice and obey his instructions ! On the other hand , if the Bible is not God 's book , we ought to know it . Why should we go through the world with a lie in our right hand , dupes of the ignorant men who preceded us ? It can never be for our soul 's benefit to cherish a falsehood . Science is , perhaps , the best test that we can apply to decide the question . Science is really a knowledge of what Nature has done , and is doing ; and since the upholders of the divinity of the Bible believe that it proceeded from the Author of nature , if their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science teaches . Science is a fiery furnace , that has consumed a thousand delusions , and must consume all that remain . We cast into it astrology and alchemy , and their ashes barely remain to tell of their existence . Old notions of the earth and heavens went in , and vanished as their dupes gazed upon them . Old religions , old gods , have become as the incense that was burned before their altars . I purpose to try the Bible in its searching fire . Fear not , my brother : it can but burn the straw and stubble ; if gold , it will shine as bright after the fiery ordeal as before , and reflect as perfectly the image of truth . The Bible abounds with marvellous stories ,  --  stories that we should at once reject from their intrinsic improbability , not to say impossibility , if we should find them in any other book . But , among all the stories , there is none that equals the account of the deluge , as given in the sixth , seventh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mount Washington does above the New-England hills ; and , as travellers delight to climb the loftiest peaks , I suppose that many would be pleased to examine this lofty story , and see how the world of truth and actuality looks from its summit . According to the account , in less than two thousand years after God had created all things , and pronounced them very good , he became thoroughly dissatisfied with every living thing , and determined to destroy them with the earth . He thus expresses himself : " I will destroy man , whom I have created , from the face of the earth ,  --  both man and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that I have made them . " Again he says to Noah , " The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them , and behold I will destroy them with the earth . " Why should the beasts , birds , and creeping things be destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bob-o-links done ? What had the squirrels and the tortoises been guilty of , that they should be destroyed ? He proceeds to inform Noah how he will do this : " And behold I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die . " And we are subsequently informed that " every thing that was in the dry land died . " But why not every thing in the sea ? Were the dogs sinners , and the dog-fish saints ? Had the sheep been more guilty than the sharks ? Had the pigeons become utterly corrupt , and the pikes remained perfectly innocent ? It may be , that the apparent impossibility of drowning them by a flood suggested to the writer of the story the necessity of saving them alive . But Noah was righteous ; and God determined to save him and his family , eight persons , and by their instrumentality to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . To do this , Noah was commanded to build an ark , three hundred cubits long , fifty broad , and thirty high . It was to be made with three stories , and furnished with one door , and one window a cubit wide . Into this ark were to be taken two of every sort of living thing , and of clean beasts and of birds seven of every sort , male and female , and food sufficient for them all . There are differences of opinion about the length of the cubit : most probably it was about eighteen inches ; but taking it at twenty-two inches , the largest estimate that I believe theologians have made , the ark was then five hundred and fifty feet long , ninety-one feet eight inches broad , and fifty-five feet high . Leaving space for the floors , which would need to be very strong , each story was about seventeen feet high ; and the total cubical contents of the ark were about one hundred and two thousand cubic yards . Scott , in his commentary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty yards ; but the necessity for room was not as well understood in his day . Each floor of the ark contained five thousand six hundred and one square yards , and the three floors sixteen thousand eight hundred and three square yards , the total standing-room of the ark . Into this were to be taken fourteen of each kind of fowl of the air or bird . How many kinds or species of birds are there ? When Adam Clarke wrote his commentary , two thousand three hundred and seventy-two species had been recognized . Ornithology was then but in its infancy , and man 's knowledge of living forms was very limited . Lesson , according to Hugh Miller , enumerates the birds at six thousand two hundred and sixty-six species ; Gray , in his " Genera of Birds , " estimates the number on the globe at eight thousand . Let us not crowd Noah , but take the six thousand two hundred and sixty-six species of Lesson . Fourteen of each of these would give us eighty-seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-four birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ostrich that fans the heated air of the desert ,  --  or over five for every yard of standing-room in the ark . If spaces were left for the attendants to pass among them , to attend to the supply of their daily wants , the birds alone would crowd the ark . But , beside the birds , there were to be taken into the ark two of every sort of unclean beast and fourteen of every sort of clean beast . The most recent zoological authorities enumerate two thousand and sixty-seven species of mammals , or , as they are commonly called , beasts . Of cetacea , or whale-like mammals , sixty-five ; ruminantia , or cud-chewers , one hundred and seventy-seven ; pachydermata , or thick-skinned mammals , such as the horse , hog , and elephant , forty-one ; edentata , like the sloth and ant-eater , thirty-five ; rodentia , or gnawers , such as the rat , squirrel , and beaver , six hundred and seventeen ; carnivora , or flesh-eaters , four hundred and forty-six ; cheiroptera , or bats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred and twenty-one ; and marsupialia , or pouched mammals , like the opossum and kangaroo , one hundred and thirty-seven . If we leave out the cetacea , that live in the water , and the cud-chewers , which are the clean beasts , we have one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five species ; and male and female of these , a total of three thousand six hundred and fifty . But , besides these , there were to be taken into the ark fourteen of every kind of clean beast . And what are clean beasts ? The scriptural answer is , animals that divide the hoof and chew the cud ; and of these at least one hundred and seventy-seven species are known . Fourteen of each of these added , make a total of six thousand one hundred and twenty-eight mammals , from the mouse to the elephant . These beasts could not be piled one upon another like cord-wood ; they could not be promiscuously crowded together . The sheep would need careful protection from the lions , tigers , and wolves ; the elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; much room would be required to enable them to obtain needful exercise , and for the attendants to supply them with food and water ; and a vessel of the size of the ark would be taxed to provide for these beasts alone ; and to crowd in , and preserve alive , beasts and birds , was an absolute impossibility . But there are of reptiles six hundred and fifty-seven species ; and Noah was to take into the ark two of every sort of creeping thing . Two hundred of these reptiles are , however , aquatic : hence water would not seriously affect them ; but crocodiles , lizards , iguanas , tree-frogs , horned frogs , thunder-snakes , chicken-snakes , brittlesnakes , rattlesnakes , copperheads , asps , cobras de capello , whose bite is certain death , and a host of others , must be provided for . It would not do to allow these disagreeable individuals to crawl about the ark ; and nine hundred and fourteen of them would require considerable space , whether they could obtain it or not . By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living cargo is not yet completed . A dense cloud of insects , and a vast army destitute of wings , make their appearance , and clamor for admission . The number of articulates that must have been provided for is estimated at seven hundred and fifty thousand species ,  --  from the butterflies of Brazil , fourteen inches from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other , to the almost invisible gnat , that dances in the summer 's beam . Ants , beetles , flies , bugs , fleas , mosquitoes , wasps , bees , moths , butterflies , spiders , scorpions , grasshoppers , locusts , myriapods , canker-worms , wriggling , crawling , creeping , flying , male and female , here they come , and all must be provided for . Nor are these the last . The air-breathing land-snails , of which we know four thousand six hundred species , could never have survived a twelve months ' soaking ; and they must therefore be cared for . The nine thousand two hundred of these add no little to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come : all are lodged in the ark of safety , and are ready for a year 's voyage . But we forget : the ark has not yet received one-half of its cargo . The command given unto Noah was , " Take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee and for them ; " and we are expressly told that " according to all that God commanded Noah , so did he . " Food for how long ? The flood began in the " sixth hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month . " Noah , his family , and the animals , went in seven days before this time , and left the ark the six hundred and first year of Noah 's life , the second month , and the twenty-seventh day of the month . They were therefore in the ark for one year and seventeen days . What a quantity of hay would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats four hundred pounds of hay in twenty-four hours . Since there are two species of elephants , the African and the Indian , there must have been four elephants in the ark ; and , supposing them to live upon hay , they would require three hundred tons . There are at least seven species of the rhinoceros ; and fourteen of these , at seventy-five tons each , would consume no less than one thousand and fifty tons . The two thousand four hundred and seventy-eight clean beasts ,  --  oxen , elk , giraffes , camels , deer , antelope , sheep , goats , with the horses , zebras , asses , hippopotami , rodents , and marsupials  --  could not have required less than four thousand five hundred tons ; making a total of five thousand eight hundred and fifty tons . A ton of hay occupies about eighteen cubic yards ; and the quantity of hay required would fill a hundred and five thousand three hundred cubic yards of space , or more than the entire capacity of the ark . If these animals were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obtaining and preserving those substances would counterbalance any advantage that might be gained by the economy of space . A vast quantity of grain would be necessary for thousands of birds , rodents , marsupials , and other animals ; and large granaries would be required for its storage . What flesh would be needed for the lions , tigers , leopards , ounces , wild-cats , wolves , bears , hyenas , jackals , dogs , and foxes , martens , weasels , eagles , condors , vultures , buzzards , falcons , hawks , kites , owls , as well as crocodiles and serpents ! Not one but would eat its weight in a month , and some much more . A full-grown lion eats fifteen pounds of flesh in a day : there are two species of lions ; and the four would eat twenty-two thousand pounds in a year . There would be , at least , three thousand animals feeding upon flesh ; and , if we calculate that they averaged two pounds of flesh a day , this would give a total of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stored up and distributed . And since dried , salted , or smoked meat would not answer , this flesh must have been taken into the ark alive . It would be equal to more than thirty thousand sheep at seventy-five pounds each ; a great addition to the original cargo , and necessitating an extra quantity of hay for their food , till their turn came to be eaten . Fish would be required for the otters , minks , pelicans , of which there are eight species , and must therefore have been fifty-six individuals in the ark ; one hundred and five gulls , for there are fifteen species ; one hundred and twelve cormorants , forty-nine gannets , one hundred and forty terns , two hundred and eighty-seven kingfishers , beside storks , herons , spoonbills , penguins , albatrosses , and a host of others ; mollusks for the oyster-catcher , turnstone , and other birds . The fish could not be preserved after death in any way to answer for food , and must therefore have been alive : large tanks for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's space . The water in such tanks would soon become unfitted for the respiration of the fish , and there must have been some provision , by air-pumps or otherwise , for charging the water with the air essential to their existence . Many animals live upon insects ; and this must have been the most difficult part of the provision to procure . There are nineteen species of goatsuckers ; and there must have been in the ark two hundred and sixty-six individuals . These birds feed upon flies , moths , beetles , and other insects . What an innumerable multitude must have been provided for the goatsuckers alone ! But there are a hundred and thirty-seven species of fly-catchers ; and Noah must have had a fly-catcher family of nineteen hundred and eighteen individuals to supply with appropriate food . There are thirty-seven species of bee-eaters ; and there must have been five hundred and eighteen of these birds to supply with bees . A very large apiary would be required to supply their needs . But , beside these , insects for swallows , swifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful trogans and jacamars , moles , shrews , hedgehogs , and a multitude of others , too numerous to mention , but not too numerous to eat . Ants , also , for the ant-eaters of America , the aard-vark of Africa , and the pangolin of Asia . The great ant-eater of South America is an animal sometimes measuring eight feet in length . It lives exclusively on ants , which it procures by tearing open their hills with its hooked claws , and then drawing its long tongue , which is covered with glutinous saliva , over the swarms which rush out to defend their dwelling . Many bushels of ants would be needed for the pair of ant-eaters before the ark landed on Ararat . How were all the insects caught , and kept for the use of all these animals for more than a year ? A hundred men could not catch a sufficient number in six months . And , if caught , how could they be preserved , together with the original stock of insects necessary to supply the world after the deluge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretions , the pith , solid wood , leaves , sap in the veins , as the aphid , flowers , pollen , and honey . Wood , bark , resin , and honey might have been supplied ; but how could green leaves , sap , flowers and pollen , be furnished to those insects absolutely requiring them for existence ? Thirty species of insects feed on the nettle , but not one of them could live on dried nettles . Roesel calculates that two hundred species subsist on the oak ; but the oak must be in a growing condition to supply them with food . In no other way , then , could the insects have been preserved alive than by large green-houses , the heat so applied as to suit the plants of both temperate and tropical climates , and the insects so distributed among them , that each could obtain its appropriate nourishment . Fruit would be necessary for the four hundred and forty-two monkeys , for the plantain-eaters , the fruit-pigeons of the Spice Islands that feed on nutmegs , for the toucans and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit-eating birds . As they did not know how to can fruit in those days , and dried fruit would be altogether unsuitable , there must have been a large green-house for raising all manner of fruit necessary for the frugivorous multitude . How were the various animals obtained ? The command given to Noah was , " Two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark . " Animals , as is now well known , belong to limited centres , outside of which they are never found in a natural state ; and naturalists know that these centres were established ages before the time when the deluge is supposed to have occurred . Thus , Hugh Miller , in his " Testimony of the Rocks , " says , " We now know that every great continent has its own peculiar fauna ; that the original centres of distribution must have been , not one , but many ; further , that the areas or circles around these centres must have been occupied by their pristine animals in ages long anterior to that of the Noachian Deluge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were preceded in them by animals of the same general type . There are fourteen such areas , or provinces , enumerated by the later naturalists ; " and Cuvier , quoted by Miller , says , " The great continents contain species peculiar to each ; insomuch , that whenever large countries , of this description , have been discovered , which their situation had kept isolated from the rest of the world , the class of quadrupeds which they contained has been found extremely different from any that had existed elsewhere . Thus , when the Spaniards first penetrated into South America , they did not find a single species of quadruped the same as any of Europe , Asia , or Africa . " The white bear is never found except in the arctic regions ; the great grizzly bear is only found in the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains . Nearly all the species of mammals found in Australia are confined to that country , as the wingless birds of New Zealand are confined to that , and the sloth , armadillo , and other animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be necessary to obtain the white bear , the musk-ox , of which seven would be required , since it is a clean beast ; seven reindeer , likewise ; the white fox , the polar hare , the lemming , and seven of each species of cormorant , gannet , penguin , petrel , and gull , some of which are as large as eagles , as well as mergansers , geese , and ducks , certain species of which are only found in the frigid zone . Noah or his agents must have discovered Greenland and North America thousands of years before Columbus was born : they must have preceded Behring , Parry , Ross , Kane , and Hayes in exploring the Arctic regions . They searched the ice-floes and numerous islands of the Arctic seas , snow-shoed , over the frozen tundras of Siberia , to be certain that no living thing escaped them ; then , after catching and caging all the animals , conveyed them , with all manner of food necessary for their sustenance , together with ice to temper the heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to be exposed , returned to the nearest port , and , after a toilsome journey from the sea-coast to Armenia , arrived at their destination . How many of these animals would survive the journey ? and , of those that did , how many would survive the change of climate and habits ? Another party must have visited temperate America ; traversed New England in its length and breadth , forded wide streams , made their way through unbroken wildernesses , traversed the Great Lakes , roamed over the Rocky Mountains , and secured the black bear , cinnamon bear , wapiti or Canadian stag , the moose , American deer , antelope , mountain sheep , buffalo , opossum , rattlesnake , copperhead , and an innumerable multitude of other animals  --  insects birds , reptiles , and mammals , that are only to be found in the temperate regions of America . A voyage to South America must have been made to obtain tapirs , pumas , peccaries , sloths , ant-eaters , armadillos , fourteen each of the llama , alpaca , and vicuna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel nearly as large as " The Great Eastern " must have been employed , or a number of smaller ones , to accommodate the collectors , the animals , and food for a voyage across the Atlantic . There must have been , at least , a thousand men , wandering through the woods of Brazil , along the valley of the Amazon , the Orinoco , and the La Plata ; paddling up the streams , scaling the mountains , roaming over the pampas , climbing the tall trees , turning over every stone and log , and exploring every nook , to discover the snails , bugs , insects , worms , reptiles , and other animals indigenous to South America , from the Isthmus to Tierra-del-fuego . There must have been obtained four elephants , for there are two species , the Asiatic and the Indian ; fourteen rhinoceroses , one of which is found only in South Africa , another in the island of Java , and a third in Sumatra ; two hippopotami , and possibly four , for some authorities say there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have been caught and driven from Central Africa ( many more , indeed , must have been caught , that the required number might reach the ark and be preserved ) ; twenty-eight camels , two hundred and eighty oxen ( for there are twenty species , and they are clean ) ; and no less than thirteen hundred and eighty-six deer and antelope , of which there are ninety-nine species recognized : these to be collected in various parts of Europe , Asia , Northern and Southern Africa , and America . New Zealand must have been visited to obtain its wingless birds ; Mauritius for its dodo , then living ; Australia for its marsupials and other peculiar animals ; and every large island , and most of the small ones , to obtain those forms of life that are only to be found in each . From the island of Celebes , they must have taken the eighty species of birds that are confined to it , which would require them to catch , cage , feed , and convey eleven hundred and twenty specimens : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could accomplish that , and carry them safe to Armenia , would do all that men could do in ten years . From the Philippine Islands , the seventy-three species of hawks , parrots , and pigeons , peculiar to them ; which would require , since fourteen of every kind of bird were to be taken into the ark , no less than one thousand and twenty-two specimens . From New Guinea , and the neighboring islands , two hundred and fifty-two of the magnificent birds of paradise , since there are eighteen species . A faint idea of the difficulties encountered and overcome by Noah 's agents may be gathered from what Wallace , in his recent work on the Malay Archipelago , informs us respecting these birds of paradise . " Five voyages to different parts of the district they inhabit , each occupying in its preparation and execution the larger part of a year , produced me only five species out of the fourteen known to exist in the New-Guinea district . " If it took Wallace , with all the assistance that he had from various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dead birds , how long did it take Noah 's agents to obtain eighteen species represented by two hundred and fifty-two live birds ? Wallace could only obtain two alive , and for these he had to pay five hundred dollars . If the antediluvian sinners were any thing like the modern ones , Noah must have been richer than the Rothschilds , or he never could have obtained their services ; which he must have done , or it could never be truthfully said , " according to all that God commanded him , so did he . " The collection of the land-snails alone would be no small tax . Seventy-four are peculiar to Great Britain : hence there must have been a hundred and forty-eight snails collected from that island . Six hundred species are found in Southern Europe alone , and twelve hundred must have been collected from there ; eighty in Sicily , ten in Corsica , two hundred and sixty-four in the Madeira Islands , a hundred and twenty in the Canary Islands , twenty-six in St. Helena , sixty-three in Southern Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hundred in New Zealand , and others on every large and some of the small islands of the globe . The world must have been circumnavigated many times before the vessel of Magellan was built , and every island visited and ransacked ages before the time of Captain Cook . But it seems surprising , since these voyages must have been performed by the sinful antediluvians , that they did not save themselves in their ships when the flood came ; for vessels that could perform such voyages would certainly have survived the flood more readily than the clumsy ark . But was it really done ? A thousand men in ten years , with all the appliances of modern art ,  --  steamboats , railroads , canals , coaches , and express companies ,  --  could not accomplish it in ten years ; nor ten times the number of men keep all the animals alive in one spot for one year , if they were collected together . " But , " says the Christian , " Noah never did collect them : no intelligent person in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The Bible expressly declares that ' they went in unto Noah into the ark . ' By instinct , such as leads the swallow to take its distant flight at the approach of winter , they came from all parts of the globe to the ark of safety . " It is true that one account does say that they came in unto Noah , for there are two very different stories of the deluge mixed up in those chapters of Genesis ; but , although flying birds might perform such a feat as going twelve thousand miles to the ark , which would be necessary for some , how could other animals get there ? It would be impossible even for some birds . How could the ostriches of Africa , the emus of Australia , and the rheas of South America , get there ,  --  birds that never fly ? There are three species of the rhea , or South-American ostrich ; and forty-two of these would have a journey of eight thousand miles before them , by the shortest route : but how could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have traversed the length of the American continent , from Patagonia to Alaska , crossed at Behring 's Strait when it was frozen , and then travelled diagonally across nearly the whole continent of Asia to Armenia , after a journey that must have required many months for its completion . The sloths , that have been confined to South America ever since the pliocene period at least , must have taken the same route . How they crossed the mountain streams , and lived when passing over broad prairies , it would be difficult to say . A mile a day would be a rapid rate for these slow travellers , and it would therefore require about forty years for them to arrive at their destination . But , since the life of a sloth is not as long as this , they must have bequeathed their journey to their posterity , and they to their descendants , born on the way , who must have reached the ark before the door was closed . The land-snails must have met with still greater difficulties . Impelled by most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before the time ; and their posterity of the five hundredth generation must have made their appearance , and been provided with a passage by the venerable Noah . Scott , who wrote a commentary on the Bible seventy or eighty years ago , must have seen some of these difficulties , though with nothing like the clearness with which science enables us to see them now . He says , " There must have been a very extraordinary miracle wrought , perhaps by the ministration of angels , in bringing two of every species to Noah , and rendering them submissive to him and peaceable with each other ; yet it seems not to have made any impression on the hardened spectators . " Think of a troop of angels fly-catching , snail-seeking , and bug-hunting through all lands , lugging through the air , horses , giraffes , elephants , and rhinoceroses , and dropping them at the door of the ark . One has crossed the Atlantic with rattlesnakes , copperheads , and boas twined around him , almost crippling his wings with their snaky folds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each wing , that the renewed world may not lack the fragrance of the old . What a subject for the pencil of a Raphael or Dore ! Had the " hardened spectators " beheld such a scene as this , Noah and his cargo would have been cast out of the ark , and the sinners themselves , converted by this stupendous miracle , would have taken passage therein . Not only must there have been a succession of most stupendous miracles to get the animals to the ark , but also to return them to their proper places of abode . But few of them could have lived in the neighborhood of Ararat , had they been left there . How could the polar bear return to his home among the ice-bergs , the sloths to the congenial forests of the New World , and all the mammals , reptiles , insects , and snails to their respective habitats , the homes of their ancestors for ages innumerable ? To return them was just as necessary as to obtain them , and , though less difficult , was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved in the ark , attend to all these animals ! Nearly all would require food and water once a day , and many twice . In a menagerie , one man takes care of four cages ,  --  feeds , cleans , and waters the animals . In the ark , each person , women included , must have attended each day to ten thousand nine hundred and sixty-four birds , seven hundred and sixty-six beasts , one hundred and fourteen reptiles , one thousand one hundred and fifty land-snails , and one hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred insects . Few persons have an idea of the difficulty of keeping even the common birds of a temperate climate alive in confinement for any length of time . Food that is quite suitable in a wild state may be fatal to them when they are kept in the house . Linnets feed on winter rape-seed in the wild state , but soon die if fed upon it in-doors . " They are to be fed , " says Bechstein , " on summer rape-seed , moistened in water ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radish , cabbage , lettuce and plantain-seeds , and sometimes a few bruised melon-seeds or barberries . " Nightingales , he says , should be fed on meal , worms , and fresh ants ' eggs : but , if it is not possible to get these , a mixture of hard egg , ox-heart minced , and white bread may be given ; but this often kills the birds . No such food would do for Noah 's nightingales , then , or where would have been the nightingale 's song ? They must have been fed on meal , worms , and fresh ant 's eggs . How they were obtained , we have , of course , no knowledge . Bechstein says that larks may be fed with " a paste made of grated carrot , white bread soaked in water , and barley or wheat meal , all worked together in a mortar . In addition to this paste , larks should be supplied with poppy-seed , bruised hemp , crumb of bread , and plenty of greens , such as lettuce , endive , cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says the cage should be furnished with a piece of fresh turf , often renewed , and great attention should be paid to cleanliness . The care of the birds in the ark probably fell to the women . As they had not read Bechstein , or any other author on bird-keeping ,  --  and thousands of the birds must have been total strangers to them ,  --  how did they know what diet to supply them with , and where could they get it , supposing they had time to supply them at all ? If the difficulty was great to keep the birds of a temperate climate , how much greater must it have been to keep tropical birds in a climate altogether unsuited to them ? The two birds of paradise bought by Wallace were fed , he says , on rice , bananas , and cockroaches : of the last , he obtained several cans from a bake-house at Malta , and thus got his paradise birds , by good fortune , to England . But how many cans of cockroaches would be necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number in the ark ? and where were the bake-houses from which the supply might be obtained ? To keep this vast menagerie clean would have required a large corps of efficient workers , especially when we remember that there was but one door in each story , as some suppose ; or one door to the whole ark , as the story seems to teach , and this door was closed ; and but one window , and that apparently in the roof . The Augean stable , the cleansing of which was one of the labors of Hercules , can but faintly indicate what must have been the condition of the ark in less than a month , supposing the animals to subsist as long . Whence came the water that covered the earth to the tops of the highest mountains ? " All the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered . Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered , " says the record . And to do this , it rained for forty days and forty nights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered a very heavy rain in Great Britain . The heaviest single rain recorded fell on the Khasia Hills in India , and amounted to thirty inches in twenty-four hours . If this deluging rain could have continued for forty days and nights , and had it fallen over the entire surface of the globe , the amount would only have been one hundred feet ; which , instead of covering the mountains , would not have covered the hills . But , of course , such a rain is only possible for a very limited time , and on a small portion of the earth 's surface . Sir John Leslie , in " The Encyclopedia Britannica , " says , " Supposing the vast canopy of air , by some sudden change of internal constitution , at once to discharge its whole watery store , this precipitate would form a sheet of scarcely five inches thick over the surface of the globe . " But if the water that covered the earth above the tops of the highest mountains came by rain , it must have rained seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have fallen each day , according to Sir John Leslie 's estimate , more than fourteen hundred times as much water on the earth as the atmosphere contained ! But the writer says , " The fountains of the great deep were broken up . " To the Jews , who supposed , with David , that God had founded the earth upon the seas , and established it upon the floods , this meant something ; but , in the light of geology , we see that it only demonstrates the ignorance of the man who wrote and the people that believed the story . Adam Clarke , commenting on this passage , says , " It appears that an immense quantity of water occupied the centre of the antediluvian earth ; and , as this burst forth by the order of God , the circumambient strata must sink in order to fill up the vacuum occasioned by the elevated waters . " If true , it would not have assisted in drowning the world one spoonful . For if the strata sank anywhere to fill the hollow previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains so much higher in comparison : hence it would require just that much extra water to cover them . In the light of geology , however , the notion is sufficiently absurd . A mile and a half deep , the earth 's interior is hot enough to convert water into steam ; there is , therefore , no chance for water to exist in its centre , or anywhere near it . It is as great a difficulty to discover where the water went when the flood was over . We are told that the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain was restrained . But this could do nothing towards diminishing the water . All that it could possibly accomplish would be to prevent the rise of the water . But we are also told that " God made a wind to pass over the earth . " All that the wind could do , however , would be to convey to the atmosphere the moisture it took up in vapor ; and this could not have lowered the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty-eight thousand feet high ; the flood prevailed one hundred and fifty days , and abated two hundred and twenty-five ; and if this abatement was done by the wind , it must have blown an ocean of water from the entire surface of the earth , one hundred and twenty-five deep , every day for eight months ! All the hurricanes that ever blew , blowing at once , would be the gentlest zephyr of a summer 's eve , compared with such a wind as that ; and by what possibility could such a craft as the ark survive the storm ? A question , proper to be asked is , How were the animals supplied with light ? and how did the attendants see to wait upon them in the first and second stories of the ark ? There was but one window , and that only twenty-two inches in size , and it appears to have been in the third story . It was a day when kerosene was unknown , and tallow dips were uninvented . How did these animals live in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family supply their wants ? It could have been no easy or pleasant thing to wait upon hungry lions , tigers , crocodiles , and rattlesnakes in the dark , to say nothing of the danger . How did they breathe ? There was but one twenty-two inch window ; the ark was " pitched within and without with pitch ; " " The Lord shut him in . " Talk of the Black Hole of Calcutta : it must have been pure as the breath of morning compared with the condition of the ark in one day . Where did they obtain water for drink ? Supposing all the additional water needed to drown the world was fresh , when mingled with the water of the sea , as much as one-tenth of it would be salt water , and this would render it utterly unfit for drink . Provision must therefore have been made for water ; and a space certainly half as large as the ark must have been taken up for the water necessary for this immense multitude . The fish , mollusks , crustaceans ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corals , must have died if such a flood had taken place ,  --  the fresh-water fish from the salt water at once added to their proper element , and the salt-water fish and other marine forms from so large an addition of fresh water . For months , there could have been no shore : what is now the margin of the sea was buried miles deep ; and all the fucoidal vegetation , upon which myriads of animals subsist , must have perished , and the animals with it , if the change in the constitution of the water had not killed them . Every time a man swallows an oyster , he has evidence that the Noachian deluge did not take place . The plants must have perished also . How many of our trees , to say nothing of the grasses and feeble plants , could endure a soaking of nearly twelve months ' duration ? Some of the very hardiest seeds might survive , but the number could not be large . The present condition of vegetation upon the globe is another evidence , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ark landed on Mount Ararat , and the animals went forth , how did they subsist ? As they went down the mountains , the carnivorous animals would have devoured a large portion of the herbivorous animals saved in the ark . Beside the lions , tigers , leopards , ounces , and other carnivorous mammals , amounting to eight hundred and ninety-two , there were in the ark six hundred and sixty-six eagles , for there are forty-eight species ; one hundred and forty-four buzzards , fourteen hundred and forty-two falcons , one hundred and forty hawks , two hundred and thirty-eight vultures , and eight hundred and ninety six owls . What chance would a few sheep , rabbits and squirrels , rats and mice , doves and chickens , have , among this ravenous multitude ? How could the ants escape , with ant-eaters , aard-varks and pangolins on the watch for them as soon as they made their appearance ? There were as many dogs as hares , as many cats as mice . How long a lease of life could the sheep , hares , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied , so as to furnish the carnivorous animals with food , they must all have been destroyed , after all the pains taken for their preservation . Noah should have given the herbivora , at least a year 's start , especially since the vegetation of the globe was so deficient . But we are told that the species of animals may have been much fewer in the days of Noah ; and , therefore , much less room would be necessary . A single pair of cats , say some , may have produced all the animals of the cat kind ; a pair of dogs , all the animals that belong to the dog family . Such an explanation might have been given when zoology was little known , and geology had no existence ; but there is no place for it now . Animals change , it is true , and all species have probably been produced from a few originals ; but the process by which this is accomplished is so slow in its operation , that we have no knowledge of the formation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cats of various species , existed long before the time of the deluge , and dogs , wolves and foxes ; and we find mummied cats , dogs , and other animals in Egypt , as old or older than the deluge , so little changed from those of the present time in the same locality , that we can not recognize any difference between them . " You seem to forget that all things are possible with God : he could have packed these animals into an ark of one-half the size , brought them altogether in the twinkling of an eye , and returned them as rapidly . " And you seem to forget that the account in Genesis gives us no hint of any such miracle . Noah was to take the animals to him , and to take unto him of all food that is eaten ; and , as Hugh Miller remarks , " the expedient of having recourse to supposititious miracle in order to get over a difficulty insurmountable on every natural principle , is not of the nature of an argument , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at an end when supposititious miracle is introduced . " But , if a miracle was worked , it was not one , but ten thousand of the most stupendous miracles , and entirely unnecessary ones . This , the Rev. Dr. Pye Smith saw , when he said , " We can not represent to ourselves the idea of all land animals being brought into one small spot , from the polar regions , the torrid zone , and all the other climates of Asia , Africa , Europe , and America , Australia , and the thousands of islands ,  --  their preservation and provision , and the final disposal of them ,  --  without bringing up the idea of miracles more stupendous than any that are recorded in Scripture . The great decisive miracle of Christianity ,  --  the resurrection of the Lord Jesus ,  --  sinks down before it . " It is a favorite method with the advocates of special revelations to show their agreement with the operations of natural law , till a difficulty is met with that can not be answered , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , in this case , miracle itself can not save them . Geology furnishes us with evidence that no such deluge has taken place . According to Hugh Miller , " In various parts of the world , such as Auvergne in Central France , and along the flanks of Etna , there are cones of long-extinct or long-slumbering volcanoes , which , though of at least triple the antiquity of the Noachian deluge , and though composed of the ordinary incoherent materials , exhibit no marks of denudation . According to the calculations of Sir Charles Lyell , no devastating flood could have passed over the forest-zone of Etna during the last twelve thousand years . " Archaeology enters her protest equally against it . We have abundance of Egyptian mummies , statues , inscriptions , paintings , and other representations of Egyptian life belonging to a much earlier period than the deluge . With only such modifications as time slowly introduced , we find the people , their language , and their habits , continuing after that time , as they had done for centuries before . Lepsius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , " We are still busy with structures , sculptures , and inscriptions , which are to be classed , by means of the now more accurately determined groups of kings , in an epoch of highly flourishing civilization , as far back as the fourth millennium before Christ . " That is one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years before the time of the flood . Lyell says that " Chevalier Bunsen , in his elaborate and philosophical work on ancient Egypt , has satisfied not a few of the learned , by an appeal to monumental inscriptions still extant , that the successive dynasties of kings may be traced back without a break , to Menes , and that the date of his reign would correspond with the year 3,640 B.C. ; " that is nearly thirteen hundred years before the time of the deluge . Strange that the whole world should have been drowned and the Egyptians never knew it ! From the " Types of Mankind , " we learn that the fact is " asserted by Lepsius , and familiar to all Egyptologists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the Upper Nile , 2,300 years B.C. " But this is only forty-eight years after the deluge . What kind of a family had Noah ? Was amalgamation practised by any of Noah 's sons ? If all the human occupants of the ark were Caucasians , how did they produce negro races in forty-eight years ? The facts again compel us to announce the fabulous character of this Genesical story of the deluge . " No intelligent person now believes that it was a total deluge : Buckland , Pye Smith , Miller , Hitchcock , and all Christian geologists , agree that it was a partial deluge , and the account can be so explained . " How strange that God should dictate an account of the deluge that led everybody to a false conclusion with regard to it , till science taught them a better . But let us read what the account says , and see whether it can be explained to signify a partial deluge . To save the Bible from its inevitable fate , such men as Buckland , Smith , Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their writings , were ready to resort to any scheme , however wild . I read ( Gen. vi . 7 ) , " I will destroy both man and beast , and the creeping thing . " How could a partial deluge accomplish this ? ( v. 13 ) ; " The end of all flesh is come before me . I will destroy them with the earth . " How could all flesh be destroyed with the earth by any other than a total deluge ? ( v. 17 ) ; " I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die . " Not only is man to be destroyed , but all flesh wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven , and every thing in the earth is to die . Can this be tortured to mean a partial deluge ? ( vii . 19 ) ; " And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven were covered ; and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man . All in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died . And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth , and Noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark . " Had the man who wrote this story been a lawyer , and had he known how these would-be-Bible-believers , and at the same time geologists , would seek to pervert his meaning , he could not have more carefully worded his account . It is not possible for any man to express the idea of a total flood more definitely than this man has done . He does not merely say the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered ; and lest you should think that he certainly did not mean the most elevated , he is careful to say " all the high " hills were covered ; and lest some one should say he only meant the hills in that part of the country , he says expressly " all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered . " He is even so cautious as to introduce the phrase " whole heaven , " lest some one in its absence might still think that the deluge was a partial one . To make its universality still more evident , he says , " All flesh died that moved upon the earth . " This would have been sufficiently definite for most persons , but not so for him ; he particularizes so that none may escape ,  --  " both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man . " To leave no possibility of mistake , he adds , " all in whose nostrils was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry land , died . " Can any thing more be needed ? The writer seems to see that some theological professor may even yet try to make this mean a partial deluge ; and he therefore says , " Every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; they were destroyed from the earth . " Is it possible to add to the strength of this ? He thinks it is ; and he therefore says , " Noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark . " Could any truthful man write this and then mean that less than a hundredth part of the earth 's surface was covered . If not a total flood , why save the animals , above all the birds ? All that Noah and his family need to have done would have been to move out of the region till the storm was over . If a partial flood , how could the ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seventeen thousand feet high , and it rises from a plateau that is seven thousand feet above the sea-level . A flood that enabled the ark to float on to that mountain could not have been far from universal ; and , when such a flood is accounted for on scientific principles , it will be just as easy to account for a total flood . " The flood was only intended to destroy man , and therefore only covered those parts of the earth that were occupied by him . " The Bible states , however , that it was intended to destroy every thing wherein was the breath of life ; and your account and the Bible account do not at all agree . But , if man was intended to be destroyed , the flood must have been wide-spread . We know that Africa was occupied before that time , and had been for thousands of years , by various races . We learn , from the recent discoveries in the Swiss Lakes , that man was in Switzerland before that time ; in France , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , as the caves in Devonshire show ; in North America , as the fossil human skull beneath Table Mountain demonstrates . Hence , for the flood to destroy man alone at so recent a period , it must have been as wide spread as the earth . Even according to the Bible account , the garden of Eden , where man was first placed , was somewhere near the Euphrates ; and in sixteen hundred years the race must have rambled over a large part of the earth 's surface . The highest mountains in the world , the Himalayas , are within two thousand miles of the Euphrates . That splendid country , India , would have been occupied long before the time of the deluge ; and , on the flanks of the Himalayas , man could have laughed at any flood that natural causes could possibly produce . " How do you account , then , for these traditions of a deluge that we find all over the globe ? " Nothing more easy . In all times floods have occurred ; some by heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irruption of the sea ; and wherever traditions of these have been met with , men with the Bible story in their minds have at once attributed their origin to the Noachian deluge . " But Jesus and the apostles indorse the account of the deluge . " Granted ; but does that transform a fable into a fact ? They believed the story just as our modern theologians believe it ; because they were taught it when they were children , and had not learned better . Jesus says ( Matt. xxv. 37-39 ) , " But as the days of Noe were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be . For , as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and knew not until the flood came and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be . " If the man had regarded the story as false , he never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this manifestation of credulity on the part of Jesus , we can see the very false estimate placed upon him by so large a portion of the people of this country . Let the truth be spoken , though Jesus and all other idols be overthrown . So he would say , if alive , or he was not as good and intelligent a man as I think he was . By this story the Bible stands or falls as a divine book . It falls , as we see , and takes its place with all other human fallible productions . For knowledge , we go to Nature , our universal mother , who gives her Bible to every soul , and preaches her everlasting gospel to all people .
