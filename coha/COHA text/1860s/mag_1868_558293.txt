txt ART . X. -1 . Allegiance and C*itizenship . An Inquiry into the 6 ! lainm of European aovernments to exact Jllilitary Service of Naturalized Citizens of the United States . By GEORGE H. YEAMAN . Copenhagen . 1867. 2 . Recent Debates in Congress . Congressional Globe . Washington . 1867 , 1868 . THE last weighty question of international law which has arisen to vex the diplomatists of these busy times concerns expatriation and naturalization . Like so many of its predecessors , it has assumed the form of a conflict between the New // and the Old World , between new and old ideas , between the doctrine of progress and the belief in precedent . America is at issue with England ; until within a few weeks she has been so with Prussia and the German States ; and though the vastly smaller amount of emigration from other European countries has prevented much dispute with any of them , still none has ever acknowledged that it held our views . First , the question is , Whether or not the right of expatriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise expressed , of government . Next , What are the rights , and what is the national character , of a naturalized citizen at home , abroad , in the land of his birth , in peace , and in war ? In the discussion of these topics no two nations of the civilized world will be found at quite the same stage of the road . America is at the head of the column ; Great Britain lags in the extreme rear . The exigencies of the present time , however , have , in the opinion of our statesmen , rendered it not only desirable , but absolutely necessary , to gently goad the lingering steps of the rearward line . America founds her theory on the broad , immovable basis of reason , abstract right , and the light of Nature . England takes her position on the weaker ground of human law and ancient precedent . Prussia and Germany have contented themselves with simply and resolutely asserting what they would do with persons of Prussian or German birth found on Prussian or German territory , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own property in his own hands . But one of the most cheerful gleams which have pierced the gloom of this troubled winter has been the announcement that Mr. Bancroft has succeeded in consummating a treaty with the Prussian government , by which the right of expatriation is admitted , and a person of Prussian birth who has resided in the United States for five consecutive years , and has been naturalized here , is recognized as having fully denationahized himself , and as being thereafter for all purposes , at all times and places , in all circumstances , an American citizen . Our success in this negotiation is due to the intelligent policy of Count Bismarck . In 1865 the same great statesman made a long stride towards us ; but we were not willing to advance over the narrow debatable ground which still intervened . The // April , truth , as all Americans feel it , is , that , if we are right at all , we are right wholly . The right can not be found at any halfway station , midway between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pure reason ; and if it is not utterly and absolutely truthful , then we can not claim that it has any elements of truth whatever . In England the matter has become subject of active discussion , and there are many indications of a rapid change of view . Able and cultivated Englishmen are dissatisfied with the position which the nation by its theory is compelled to hold . The vigorous and caustic pen of Mr. Vernon Harcourt , signing himself " Historicus , " and his merciless reductiones ad absurdum , make his countrymen sensible of the weakxiess of the arguments in support of the British doctrine . He has the indorsement of the " Times , " through whose columns his ideas have a wide and influential circulation ; and he is further understood to be unofficially connected with the Foreign Office . The English doctrine is certainly so extravagant that there is no danger that any effort will ever be made to carry it out in its fulness . It declares that allegiance is indefeasible , - that the male issue of an English male subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever inalienable subjects of the British crown . This would make a very large proportion of the present population of this country liegemen of Queen Victoria : for all are such whose lineage on the male side can be traced back to an ancestor who , since the American Revolution , was a British subject . All this is too absurd to be insisted upon in practice . Still it is the English statute law , and officially it must be recognized in all its monstrosity as the English doctrine . It has its foundation in the old feudal principles of vassalage , when the vassals and their increase were adscripti glebw , were bought and sold with the soil . In private life , this , of course , had , at a very early stage in the progress of civilization , to be abandoned ; yet a modification of the same principle is still held to be the law , governing the relations between the British crown and its liegemen . The English argument which seeks to sustain this doctrine is an artificial and technical mosaic of pre.cedents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statesman . It is true that we ourselves are only less submissive to precedent than are the English . We study and respect it ; yet our reverence for it , and our manner of using it , are widely different from those of our Transatlantic exemplars . An English statesman appeals to precedents as though they of themselves made right and wrong and created justice and reason . With us precedents are treated with just so much regard as their intrinsic truth entitles them to . We consult them for enlightenment and aid , and to gain renewed confidence in ourselves from the wisdom of others . But we are not blindly submissive to them . We acknowledge their usefulness in showing the doctrines of the conntry , and , c*teris paribus , we should follow their lead ; but we do not regard them as eternal pledges of an unchangeable national principle . Above all , we use them as weapons with which to combat those who themselves rely upon such weapons and consider them to afford the highest arbitrament . If we can by precedent make good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English minister , who regards precedent as an unanswerable argument , of course we bring forward the fruits of our historical research . It is because this furnishes us with a means of assault which our enemies will consider mighty , rather than because we ourselves hold it in similar estimation . Thus , when , as in the matter under discussion , we are accused of sudden tergiversation in the very teeth of our own record , when cavillers charge us with denying our own doctrines , and bidding others do just what we ourselves have never been willing to do , we can meet the attack with an unperturbed front . The doctrine of indefeasible allegiance was one of the prejudices and errors which our forefathers brought over . In many important matters our nation entered upon its career with inherited English notions : those of them that are good we cherish ; but we have not yet reached the end of our long task of plncking up and casting out the idle and the false . American beliefs have ever been as clay in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of events brought to our shores many millions of foreigners , - it is estimated that considerably over six millions have come here since fl90 , // - and when these men and women , of all ages and various conditions in life , sought to set up their household gods among us , gave us the benefit of their knowledge , their skill , and their strength , and reared their children among us to continue in contributing the same advantages , we were obliged to ask ourselves what were our reciprocal duties towards these adopted children . Then a new light dawned upon us . Heretofore the questions of expatriation and naturalization had been of little importance , either in Europe or elsewhere . Isolated cases had attracted slight notice . The views of feudal sovereigns had found none who sought or who were able to test their soundness , and they had passed unchallenged . But a new state of affairs called imperatively for a new organization of national principles in these matters . Our municipal rights in the cases of these persons , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the privileges of citizenship , such as the right of suffrage , &amp;c. , were undisputed ; that we might also undertake to protect them in foreign parts was a duty or a burden readily conceded to us , since we were willing to assume it . The point at issue was , what relation a citizen of a foreign state , having voluntarily expatriated himself and been naturalized in this country , held towards the state of his birth . Here the doctrines of indefeasible and defeasible allegiance directly clashed . This country then took a ground which has since caused her , though unfairly , to be charged with inconsistency . Our statesmen and diplomatists approached the subject , which had never before been fairly discussed , as if it were nova quwsho . They saw at once what was desirable , nay , what might be considered absolutely necessary to our national honor and to our future welfare . We must change the old rule , or we should have nearly as many British subjects as American citizens on our territory , not to mention large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this result been arrived at through subtle labyrinths of logic and the winding ways of technical sophistry , wherein plain reason is confounded , there would have been some ground for saying that self-interest was our guiding thread in the maze . When , however , we abjured such paths , and assumed only to make one direct stride to the fountain-head of everlasting truth and unchangeable right , we were // not open to such aspersions . We must then be met by answers , not by innuendoes . But diplomatists are cautious , and astute in avoiding difficulties ; and each petty case , as it arose , involving the affairs only of some insignificant individual , after some letter-writing , was settled to the moderate satisfaction of both parties , without the laying down of any greater amount of unacceptable principle than was utterly unavoidable , and with no positive recession or compromise . The first instance in which our policy was diplomatically announced in its present full and rounded shape was in 1859 . But while American statesmen , with that freedom of motion which diplomates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness into light , and had taken at last a resolute and tenable position , the judiciary , shackled by the legal enactments of past times , were in no condition to adapt the law to the diplomacy of the age . This point ought to be better understood , at least by such writers as Mr. Vernon ilarcourt , than it is , - or at least than they seem willing to confess that it is . In the absence of express statute , it is well understood that the old English common law , Ante-revolutionary English law statutes , and English legal precedents are recognized as authority in our courts , and as binding , except that in rare instances a decision may be reluctantly overruled . Thus , before our present theory of expatriation and naturalization had been perfected and adopted as the national theory , the courts had taken the old English view . They had done so with great caution and reluctance , and had avoided encountering the question by all possible arts of technical skill ; still the current of their opinions and the sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . Indeed , it is not clear , that , if the question were to arise to-day before the Supreme Court , ( the pending Naturalization Bill being not yet an act , ) that tribunal would feel authorized to decide otherwise than in accordance with the old English law . The courts are not to be blown about by every wind of doctrine . The correspondence of ministers of state is slender authority before the bench ; and the dicta of the foreign office are not principles of law . Further , we must acknowledge that our present system has been developed in its full extent only of late years , and has had // April , Expatriation and Naturalization. official expression in very few instances . The only document of weight , of a legal character , so far as we are aware , in which a new view of the law is taken , is a late opinion of Attorney-General Black . This able paper , however , belongs rather to the department of state than of law . The learned gentleman stands wholly alone in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all other professional authority . The opinion belongs to that class , well known to lawyers , which might be designated as tentative or revolutionary . Such opinions are given , when , for some strong reason , it is supposed that the courts may be willing to overrule or revise their previous decisions and adopt new views . In the case in hand , Mr. Black doubtless thought that it was worth while to try the temper of the court , and see how the manifest popular sentiment and the new diplomatic views might have affected it . It was probably with this experimental purpose that the opinion was written . It expressed what the writer thought , or hoped , might thereafter be declared law . But when foreigners taunt us with this state of our law , and reproach us with demanding of others that which we ourselves are unwilling to do the simple answer is , that such legislation as is required in order to bring about consistency on the part of our judiciary with our avowed governmental policy must be the first fruit of mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratuitously fetter ourselves with such statutes until others will do likewise , or until we are resolved to enforce our doctrines by any means which may become necessary . Of the treaty made with Prussia and the North German Bund , Prussians and Germans naturalized in America will hereafter have the benefit in all our courts , as a law of the land . We have said that our diplomatic policy has passed through a series of gradations , from a position not very far removed from that of England , to that point which we now occupy . It may be neither uninteresting nor unprofitable briefly to trace this progress . In 1840 a native of Prussia , previously naturalized in the United States , returned to Prussia , having , however , no idea of taking up his - abode there permanently , or resuming his citizenship . The Prussian government demanded of him com // pliance with their conscription laws . He claimed to be exempt , and appealed to Mr. Wheaton , then the American minister at Berlin . This gentleman declined to interfere , and wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia he would have been protected as an American citizen ; " but , " he added , " having returned to the country of your birth , your native domicile and national character revert , ( so long as you remain in the Prussion dominions , ) and you are bound in all respects to obey the laws exactly as if you had never emigrated . " This was laying down the doctrine of indefeasible allegiance in explicit and unmistakable terms . Even Mr. Webster , so late as 1852 , went so far as to state that the native of a country which maintained the principle of indefeasible allegiance might , whenever found within the jurisdiction of that country , be held to military service under its laws . Early in 1853 , Mr. Everett , apparently upon the strength of this despatch of Mr. Webster , took a similar ground , and has generally been cited as sustaining the same doctrine . Still , in the precise case in which he acted there was a distinguishing feature , the benefit of which he saved in these words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign country without obtaining the cert*ficate which atone can discharge him from the obligation of military service , he takes that step at his own risk " ; or , in other words , if a state prescribes preliminary conditions to the expatriation of its citizens , those conditions must be complied with . This case of Mr. Everett 's , then , differs in a vital point from its predecessors , and in fact is not fairly citable on either side of the controversy . It is a stepping-stone . Finally , when popular opinion , plain necessity , and sound argument had found their way into the American cabinet , and asserted supremacy over European statecraft and feudal precedents , Mr. Cass , in 1859 , for the first time , laid down in plain language our new doctrine , He wrote in the following bold language to Mr. Wright at Berlin : " I confine the foreign jurisdiction in regard to our naturalized citizens to such of them as were in the army or actually called into it at the time they left Prussia , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army after having been regularly drafted and called into it by the government to which // at the time they owed allegiance . " It is needless to say that this position was not acceded to by the Prussian Court . But no recession from it has ever since been made by any officer of our government . Soon after , in 1860 , in the case of a Frenchman , Michel Zeiter , Mr. Faulkner , then our minister to France , expressed the same view , with no less plainness and at greater length . The case came before the French courts , - it being in France a judicial question , - and was decided in favor of Zeiter , on the grounds laid down by Mr. Faulkner . Yet , in spite of this decision , it does not seem that the French principle corresponds with our own , though some writers of tolerable note have lately so interpreted it . The French law declares , that a Frenchman , obtaining naturalization in another country , by that act loses his character as a French citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended as a species of penalty . imposed on one who is regarded as a renegade . All the privileges of French citizenship are taken from him ; in any trouble in foreign lands he can look for no aid or countenance from French officials . But it does not seem that this law is intended to renounce the rights of the French government in his case , should he ever return to France ; he will then be held to all the duties of a French citizen , and may think himself lucky that he receives no specific punishment . Thus it seems to us clear that France is to be reckoned among the opponents of our doctrine , though the question has never assumed great importance between her and ourselves . In our late war we subjected to draft all our Irish citizens , with whom by the English theory we had no right to meddle . But nothing was said on either side about this matter . We had our own way , uninterfered with , and of course we were satisfied . England did not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a host of her own bitterest enemies , who had abjured her and hated her and would have thronged to fight against her , the privilege of living in comfort in our land . But now the Fenian excitement has aroused the dormant dispute ; and it seems not unreasonable to fear , that , if diplomacy does not soon effect an amicable accord , some petty act , obstinately adhered to , may refer the whole question to the // arbitrament of war . But we have fair grounds for hoping , that , if we manage our negotiations with delicacy and skill , duly respecting the frailties of a proud and sensitive people , we shall find the barriers of ancient prejudice already under- 4 mined and tottering to their fall . What , then , is the American position exactly ? Simply this : There is no such thing as indefeasible allegiance ; it is a chimera of the past . Every citizen of a foreign country , unless enrolled in the actual service of that country , or subject to a conscription actually ordered , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract binding upon him , has at any time the right to expatriate and denationalize himself , and to naturalize himself as the citizen of another country , - provided , of course , that country consents to receive him . After such naturalization , he becomes for all purposes , towards all countries , ( that of his nativity no less than any other , ) a citizen of his adopted country . Naturalized citizens of the United States stand upon precisely the same footing towards every other country in the world , and are entitled to precisely the same protection , as native-born citizens . Nor , though once so asserted by Mr. Webster , do we now admit that it makes any difference in this respect whether or not the nation of the citizen 's birth recognizes the perfect right of denationalization . As has been said , we rest this doctrine not on any technical basis of legal argument , propped and stayed by diplomatic precedents , but we ground it simply and solely upon natural right ; we go to first principles ; we appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these impregnable ramparts we intrench ourselves against the forces of sophistry and antiquity . We believe that men are born into perpetual political servitude no more than they are born into perpetual domestic servitude . We believe , that , as men are clearly free to choose the climate best suited to their constitutions , the creeds best suited to their understandings , the callings best suited to their abilities , they are equally , and by a like birthright of our common humanity , no less clearly free to choose the nation or government fitted above others to their tastes or desires . This we hold to be an axiom , a dictate of Nature within us , which neither needs nor even admits // argument . That an Irishman , whose only privilege in his native land may have been that of starvation , who abhors England with an ingrained hatred , who has escaped from British territory , or has even been helped away by the British government by every means short of actual physical coercion , and this , it may be , in tender infancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor and prosperity , of opening intelligence , awakened interests and affections , new and binding ties of home and friendship , perhaps a term of patriotic military service , in an adopted land , become a citizen of that land , but that he is still to be held to a fanciful inherited allegiance , seems to us a statement too monstrous for confutation . The right of a man to choose his own country is a natural right : we hold it to be self-evident . But this general doctrine is of course liable to certain reasonable limitations . Thus , if the emigrant before emigration has committed a crime , and flees his native land , leaving the debt of justice unpaid , he may upon his subsequent return be held to expiate it by the punishment in such cases made and provided . If in any voluntary contract , as of a business nature , he has failed to meet his obligations , he may at any time be held to their performance or be mulcted in damages , though he should return as the naturalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal law . If he has been enlisted into military service , or has been drawn in a 5onscription actually ordered before his expatriation , he can not evade his liability by subsequent emigration . This is evidently just . So long as he remains in the country , he takes his chances of any liability of a legal nature which may become fastened upon him ; and when once so fastened , he can escape it only by such means as are recognized by the laws of the land . No foreign power can rightfully intervene to protect him from these consequences of his voluntary tarrying in his native land . Every sane man is supposed to contemplate the reasonable results of his own acts . The notion , however , that so soon as a man is born he at once incurs a debt of military service to the state , which , if he lives to the requisite age , no intermediate act of expatriation can free him from , is not in itself just by abstract rules of // right , nor do we recognize any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country , and grow up unable to speak a word of any language but English , with no ideas save such as he has gathered among American institutions ; or a young man may have labored hard , denied himself every little pleasure of boyhood and early youth , for the express purpose of emigrating to our free country before the age of conscription . It would be diametrically opposed to the instinct of human freedom and the inalienable privileges of mankind to admit that such a person can be held to a long , ruinous , and perhaps fatal course of military service , because in later years he may return to pay a brief visit to an aged or a dying parent in the land of his birth . But this is a strictly partisan , so to speak , and American view of the case . The theory of Continental Europe is , that an infant comes into the world under obligation to discharge this military debt . They say , Is not the child protected during the feeble years of infancy and childhood , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-protecting , self-sustaining creature , by the laws , the officials , and the purse of its native land ? and shall it not for this pay the regular and customary price in a few brief years of military service ? There is a certain plausibility in this argument , but there is just as plausible an argument on the other side . A young man , so soon as he becomes really of value either to himself or others , is seized and compelled to perform military service . But be it fairly understood that this is a species of payment in advance . In return , he is entitled afterwards to enjoy immunity and protection ; but he is held to pay the price first , to prevent possible subsequent evasion by death , age , sickness , or other incapacity . He pays for his admission into what may be called a privileged guild . He pays for the benefit of those who are already members , and future candidates must in their due turn pay for his benefit . Having paid , he is then made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its privileges . Among these privileges is the right of thereafter living peaceably and undisturbed by his domestic hearth , of conducting his business and accumulating property without interruption , of marrying , of raising unto himself children , of having for himself , his wife , his children , his prop // erty that protection which all freemen of the guild may claim , - a protection for which he has already paid the price . While those children are yet immature , they enjoy the fruits of his labors as much in the benefit of the laws as in their food and clothing . After they arrive at maturity , they must look to their own acts to insure them the continuance of these privileges , which they are thereafter to enjoy in their own right , and not in the right of another . If they wish to remain in the land , they must pay the fee . If they do not wish to do so , they must be careful , at their own proper peril , not to stay till the fee has fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side . They are well enough to be bandied between men who seek to outwit each other by chopping logic ; but they are superficial frivolities , infinitely distant from the great root of the matter , which lies deep down among first principles , implanted by Nature in the breast of man . It is by virtue of these , and these alone , that we assert that any man who is under no already incurred actual obligation may change his nationality , and can not be afterward held to the perform- ance of a mere contingent or inchoate duty which his timely emigration prevented from ever maturing . Before this question can be finally laid to rest , it will be necessary to decide precisely what shall amount to denationalization , - that is , at what stage the alteration of nationality is fully completed . In our own country the existing regulations on the subject are chaotic ; every State has its own code , and scarcely two States agree . But this , so soon as it shall become needful , can , and of course will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Constitution " to establish a uniform rule of naturalization , " - a power which , in the present unsettled state of international law on the subject , it has never yet been deemed worth while to exercise . As a mere matter of extreme right , it is safe to say that the intent in good faith to change nationality , coupled with the necessary change of abode , could legally be declared sufficient . This is what on abstract theory would be justifiable . Though we ought , perhaps , to add to it , that , if the country of primary citizenship requires certain disavowals , or registration , or compliance with other formalities not unjustly restraining the freedom of the person , these formalities // should be duly complied with by all persons of age sufficient to comprehend and satisfy them . This would seem a fair preliminary condition . Yet , when we say that this is the correct abstract rule , we do not mean to assert that it would be either practicable or desirable to adopt this rule without modification . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we may negotiate and arrange as we may see fit . Wisdom for ourselves , no less than courtesy to others , may induce us to keep very far within it . No country is prepared to have citizens poured into it like water into a bucket , but prefers rather that they should come through some sort of filter . Some preparation is requisite to enable them to comprehend the nature of the duties and responsibilities which they are about to assume . Without such preparation , the immediate and unrestricted exercise of their novel and unappreciated privileges must be attended with many prejudicial results . They must be educated into some comprehension , however slight , of the nature of the institutions of their adopted country , before they can be permitted to aid in the working or alteration of those institutions . The regulations which any nation may see fit to make concerning this probationary period are matters of strictly municipal law . They are cognate to the business of internal police , which every nation must always be entitled to manage at its own discretion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be gone through with , as between nations themselves , is the important matter , which must be discussed by diplomatists , and settled in every case by treaty . Concerning this there is no set of rules which can be called absolutely binding , as embodying natural , inherent , and necessary right . Expediency and common convenience must govern . This part of the question is invested with many and serious practical difficulties . A perfect theory needs perfect men . Trouble lurks in the requisition of " good faith . " If a man 's intent were a visible , tangible thing , like his features , which must be worn open to inspection , we should do very well . But so long as rascals for their private ends will not stick at deception , or even perjury , and so long as honest men will indulge in the chimera of pious frauds , so long our perplexities must be endless . // A voyage over seas , or a trip across country , followed by the lip-service of an oath beginning , " I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnipotent to change nationality . In fact , one man may , from his honest intent , be entitled to claim citizenship so soon as he sets foot on our shores ; another may have lived here ten years , and gone through all the forms to superfluity , but , remaining all that time . only a sojourner , with covert and fraudulent purposes , he may not be honestly entitled to protection as an American citizen . But how to distinguish between these two , so long as we refer the question to intent ? In ordinary private litigation , questions of intent are daily left to juries . But suppose three or four regiments of Fenians , who had previously been naturalized in this country , should be surrounded and captured by a British force in Ireland . Here would be several thousand obscure cases , each one of which must separately drag through the tedious and expensive complications of a jury trial . Probably not in half a dozen would one tittle of evidence be obtainable . Yet it is clear that an Irishman may combine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armed Fenian . Thus it seems that the practical difficulties must drive us to some international stipulation , whereby an artificial test shall be set up as primarily conclusive , - as final in all cases save where such convincing contrary proof can be brought as to render the adopted country willing to acquiesce in the condemnation of the man as a fraudulent claimant of citizenship , or the injured country willing to go to war to salve her wrong . In this connection , and to this end , it has been wisely suggested , that , if a naturalized emigrant should subsequently be taken in arms against his native country , ( except in case of war betwixt the native and the adopted country , ) he should be deemed by that act to have repudiated his new citizenship , and should be stripped of his right to the protection of his new government . Something like this would seem to be no more than a fair way of meeting the awkward exigencies of this branch of the question . Perhaps it would be advisable to restrict such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in civil wars or disturbances in his native land . Whatever slight objections may be urged against // this plan , it seems that there is a vast preponderance of sound reason in its favor . It is a concession which the one country must in all human weakness be expected to ask , and which the other , for the sake of courtesy and of saving herself useless trouble and not honorable perplexities , for the sake of keeping herself from the complications and snares of international requirements , would naturally be even more ready to yield , nay , to insist upon yielding . In our treaty with Prussia and the North German Bund we have agreed that five years ' uninterrupted residence in the United States shall be considered proof of a bona fide intent . This is a purely arbitrary arrangement . It is based on the supposition that it will in the vast majority of cases work justice . But there is no intrinsic virtue in this number of years , which renders it an unerring test . It is assumed as the best one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of a compromise of our principle . We simply recognize it as reasonable that Prussia should have some convincing evidence of the bona fides of her emigrants , and by common agreement residence of this duration is admitted as a satisfactory test . This provision of course does not preclude us from investing Prussian emigrants with all the domestic privileges of citizenship , as among ourselves , at any time before the lapse of the five years ; it only declares that Prussia shall not be required to acknowledge the change of nationality until the conclusion of that term . The cry for the protection of our naturalized citizens rises loudly on every side . Of course we must protect them . One who in the ripeness of his intelligence has deliberately transferred his person , his fortune , his knowledge , skill , and labor , his aid and affectiou*  --  to us , deserves no less of us than one who happened by accident to be born on our territory . The righteousness of this is plain . But there is a strange vagueness in the ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the true nature and rightful extent of this just protection . Strange fallacies prevail . Some persons even labor under the remarkable hallucination that an American Fenian taken in Ireland red-handed is entitled to instant and honorable liberation , and to a gentlemanly apology from the English magis // trate . The simple fact is , that such a man could not be tried for treason , nor punished as a traitor . But he is liable to be punished by English law for breach of the peace , murder , arson , or other offence whatever , which he may have committed . If the English law makes a distinction by reason of the motive , and says that a blow stimulated by political hostility shall be punished by a heavier fine or a longer imprisonment than one stimulated by criminal hostility , this is a municipal or police regulation with which we can find no fault , so long as no distinction against the prisoner is made by reason of his birth in the ligeance of the British crown . This principle is so evident that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it not been so grossly misunderstood and so often ignored . The question is chiefly interesting to lawyers , and would generally make but little difference to the accused . It is only where the ordinary offence does not admit of so severe a penalty as is inflicted for treason , that the criminal would reap any benefit from the distinction . When the real merits of the points in dispute between the United States and England are examined , it certainly seems as if neither country were actuated by self-interest . England has found in emigration a safety-valve . She has encouraged it , even to the extent of paying the expenses of emigrants . What folly , then , to insist upon retaining the right to the allegiance of these men whom she herself has thrust out ! The unreasonable and vexatious pretence irritates and embitters that rancorous animosity which she ought to wish to see smoulder gradually to extinction . But for us the disadvantages of the new theoiy threaten to be far greater . If our naturalized Irish citizens , returning to share in the troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as English subjects , what an onerous burden of responsibility is lifted from our shoulders ! we then may placidly wash our hands of all the stains of blood and gunpowder . But if they could claim the privileges of American citizens , we should be under obligations towards them which we might find it an unwelcome and unfruitful task to fulfil . Nor could we long escape the complicated requirements of international law , and the perplexities of the rules of neutrality , which would , inevitably , soon entangle us in respon // sibilities and lay us under duties towards the English government which we could not safely or honorably shun , but to which it would cost us infinite vexation and annoyance to respond . Many a rich man has been ruined by a too careless and extensive indorsement of other persons ' paper ; and the habit is as dangerous in politics as in business . All this we say , however , not as furnishing any inducement to desist in pressing for the acknowledgment of our theory . That is a matter of honor and conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any motive of selfishness .
