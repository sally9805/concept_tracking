txt Recent events have certainly materially altered the state of things which existed when our government recognized the South as belligerents , and thus laid the foundation for the treatment of Confederate cruisers as lawful combatants . The South had then a regularly constituted government , with a capital and an extensive seaboard from which cruisers might sally forth on nostile missions . In point of fact the cruisers have chiefly sailed from neutral ports , and this is the case with the only two vessels now flying the Confederate flag . the Shenandoah at Melbourne and the Stonewall at Madeira . Wrille the legality of this practice has been nisputed by the North , European Governments have looked chiefly to the question of the commission , and when any cruiser , was commanded by an officer having a regular commission from Mr. DAVIS . as President of the Southern States , the belligerent character of the vessel has been admitted . But the status of a President , seated in a capital and surrounded by a Congress and by all the officers and orgenizA ? tion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defeated rebel hurrying from the socalled capital , which is now occupied by the United States troops , and representing neither a Government nor an army . Mr. Jefferson Davts , with his carpet-bag at Danville , is a very different person in Me eye of international law from Mr. President Davis in Richmond , backed by the army of Gen.l.ee . Whether the ti me has already come for the BritIsh Government to give all the effect of these changes which they must sooner or later demand is a question which is probably already under discussion . The United States have unquestionably now a right to dispute the validity of the commissions of Mr. DAVIS , and to de ? mand that the war vessels of the Veiled States shall not be subjected to vexatious restraints because two ships within the circumference of the earth , one south of the equator and one north , bear the commissions of a fugitive who was last seen with carpet-nag at Danville station . If their claims be not responded to , they have a perfect right to treat all war vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy as is meted out to them abroad .
