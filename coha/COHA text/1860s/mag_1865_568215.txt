ARTICLE ITh-THE LAW OF CONQUEST THE TRUE BASIS OP RECONSTRUCTION . IT is fortunate that the political victory achieved in the reelection of President Lincoln is generally received , not with noisy exultation , but with calm and thoughtful thankfulness . It gives ground for hope that in rejoicing over triumphs gained and dangers escaped , the nation will not be blind to the severer trial yet to be met , and the fearful responsibilities that will attend it . At the beginning of the war the nature of the struggle was almost universally misapprehended . We proposed to ourselves to put down cert2in insurgents  --  a mere feat of arms . We did not foresee a searching test , not merely of our military capacity , but of the inventive genius , the constructive skill , and the administrative energy without which the fighting faculty of a great nation can never be developed and displayed . Boasting of our productive power and increasing wealth , we little expected a strain upon our resources that should tax them to the utmost . Exulting in a strength to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit to which no disappointment had yet applied a test , we did not expect a prolonged trial of our pluck , in defeat as well as in victory , or an early and pressing need of the K2Jfens w*ua in arduis . " Nor was it our gravest error that we underrated the magnitude of the military task before us . It had been easy to ventilate patriotic fervor in Independence-day orations , but not many of us expected a sweeping blast of temptation and trial that would search out every hollow stick in the forest , and shake to the very roots the sturdy loyalty of the staunchest  --  a trial that would closely gauge our own appreciation of the boasted blessings and privileges of free government by our willingness to sacrifice for its maintenance wealth and comfort , party ties and inborn prejudices , and even the lives of our bravest and dearest . We had pointed to our free schools and general edu // EJan. , cation , as at once the proudest result and the surest safeguard of a free government , and it was yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to choose unerringly the truth in spite of all the clamor and perversion of an exciting contest , and deliberately to sacrifice the cherished treasures and fairest hopes of the present for the grander rewards of the future . Perhaps it was well that our foresight was so limited . Perhaps , had we then appreciated the full scope of the work before us , we should have shrunk from the Herculean task , and accepted a solution of the difficulty which would have made the glorious nationality of the future forever impossible . But slowly , as the contest continued , we have awakened to a realization that this is indeed a decisive trial of the manhood , virtue , and nationality that eighty years of self-government have developed . It is a test of all that makes a people great , a government stable , and a nation powerful and prosperous . To the wager of battle there was added a test of the endurance , intelligence , and patriotism of the people , and there yet remains a trial of statesmanship more pregnant than either with incalculable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely passed in July , 1863 . Till then we had been organizing and learning to fight . Nor had our earlier efforts been unattended by most shameful failures-failures in battle , failures in generalship , and failures in administrative talent and energy , by which a vast superiority of force was neutralized . But the opening of the Mississippi river and the victory at Gettysburg gave proof that our days of pupilage in the art of war were over , and that at last we could develop and direct our forces . The rebellion as a military power culminated in the great invasion by Lee ; at Gettysburg the mounting wave reached its highest point ; and with the calm review that followed the tremendous achievements of that period there came to every thinking man , North and South , the conviction that in so far as the contest should be one of arms alone , the North was sure of ultimate success . From that day the apprehensions of the wisest loyalists and the hopes of the shrewdest rebels were alike turned to the political contests at the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the victory which it could no longer hope to attain by triumphs in battle . The trial by ballot reached its crisis in the presidential election . In that most exciting canvass , conducted with the utniost license of speech and of the press even in the face of a great civil war , all the influences which could pervert the judgment , sap the loyalty , or shake the purpose of the people , culminated in a final appeal against the war and the administration . Ignorance of our system of government , of the duties of citizens and the rights of States ; gross misrepresentations of fact as to the events and results of the struggle ; attachment to a General who had been the popular favorite in the days of our military babyhood ; the conservative dry-rot , hostility to all reform , and especially hatred of the negro and the abolitionist prices , taxes , and pecuniary burdens already more grievous to sordid souls than any national dishonor or calamity ; dread of the phantom of usurpation and of the prospect of another draft ; influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret organizations , whose machinery was north but whose motive power was south of the border ; the magic spell of a party name , and the yet mightiGr power of a church and a foreign-born clan ; all threatened to bring about the abandonment of a struggle , the sufferings and sacrifices of which had been brought home to every household by the new-made graves in all our churchyards , and the little mounds of earth on a thousand fields of conflict . It would not have been strange if a few thousand votes had changed the result . But though , as at Gettysburg , the victory was won only when almost the last brigade of reserve had been called to the front of the battle , it was complete and overwhelming ; and the nation was saved in the trial of patriotism on the sth of November , 1804 , as decisively as on the 4th of July , 1863 , it was assured of final victory in the trial of arms . There remains the third and most serious test of all  --  the trial of wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political contest with which we have to deal ; it is a revolution . Our task is to obey and execute a fiat of the Almighty , written on the face of the Western hemisphere in the course // of the Mississippi river : " There shall be , upon this broad domain , one nation and but one . " The shock of arms revealed the fact that we had never been one people , and that a true nationality , embracing all States and sections , had never existed . Heterogeneous popnlations , hostile systems , and irreconcilable ideas had only been placed in contact , and held to bare juxta-position by a constitutional compact . No chemical union had ever taken place ; for that the white-hot crucible of civil war was found necessary . To keep up the fire until antagonistic elements are refined away and a perfect union is effected is needful , and is the deliberate purpose of the nation , expressed in the late election ; but that is not all . To direct the process of amalgamation , to determine the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new substance , will demand the most exalted statesmanship . A single error may cause a flaw that shall send the whole work back to the furnace . " A thousand years scarce serve to form a State , An hour may lay it in the dust . " To guide the resistless forces , and to shun dangers on either hand-as well the Scylla of a too timid conservatism as the Charybdis of an all-destroying radicalism  --  to settle the thousand questions and meet the thousand difficulties that will arise , will assuredly call for a higher wisdom , a wider knowledge , a profounder foresight than has yet been needed . If we were unused to war , and had to create an army and master the art ; if we had hitherto found no need of self-sacrificing patriotism in the halcyon days when love of country was an undeveloped and untested force , so it may almost be said that no statesmanship yet made manifest among ns is equal to the needs of the swiftly advancing emergency . All the maxims of the past are obsolete . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this trial , of as little use as the old Constitution frigate with her carronades in a battle of iron-clads . The machinery and framework of government may not improbably be found all too slender and weak for the mighty forces now evolved . A statesmanship will be needed that can steer by the compass instead of the lead-line , and can push boldly out of the narrow range of precedents and established forms into the deep // water of fIrst principles and permanent truths . lit is work for a discoverer rather than for a pilot . Nor is the difficulty of the task more conspicnons than its paramount importance . Military defeats might delay or political surrender postpone the establishment of a permanent n ationality , but nothing can make the Mississippi river run from east to west ; no conservative mop can keep back the swelling tide of progress and civilization ; and though years of strife might desolate the land and whole generations be swept away by the besom of anarchy , the struggle could never end except in the triumph of Justice and Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorious possibilities of free government , whether the harmony of forces and homogeneity of elements shall be complete , will depend upon the measure of statesmanship that may guide the work now close at hand . Already a great constitutional reform is demanded ; and we are but dull scholars if we have not learned through all the severe experiences of this war , that no work of human device is perfect , and that nations , like children , will outgrow their clothes . Already the financial problem calls for something more than temporary expedients . Already questions of a standing army , of a permanent revenue , and of tariff or direct taxation , require re*3xamination by the light of new events and needs . Already the problem of the future of the negro race assumes the gravest importance , and can be deferred but a little longer . Questions of amnesty or punishment of public enemies already engage the attention of rulers and people . Behind these there throng in the anteroom whole troops of problems new and strange-of interests needing protection and claims clamoring for adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , but now cast adrift by the storm . The change to which we are called is radical . It is the new-birth of the nation . In such a crisis it may be well to remember that the nation that governs itself has to pay for its blunders , and that it will not do to play at politics . There was never a time when the entire absence of party spirit and blind devotion to names , leaders , and organizations , was more imperatively demanded . // The nation needs the aid of every thinking and patriotic citizen . All measures should be scrutinized , not only by rulers but by people , with extraordinary care . The seeds of another war not less destructive than this may be hidden in the phraseology of a law , or the practical bearings of an enactment , which shall seem to us as harmless and as necessary as did the " persons held to service and labor " clause to the patriots of 178T , or the Missouri Compromise to the statesmen of 1S20 . Of all the unsolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most urgently thorough examination and final settlement , is that which concerns the present 8t at us of the rebellions States and the proper mode of reconstruction . It is too momentous a subject to be left to chance . Future generations will consider with amazement that , instead of first ascertaining the true theory , and guiding by that the decisions that shall serve as precedents for the future , we permit local , temporary , and often personal considerations to determine the decisions . Thus blind and often conflicting precedents are established ; and the theory is left to some era of leisure when the political geologist , by patient delving and much study of the fossil remains , may perhaps pick it out of the chaotic rec* ord . The organic law of ten future States ought to be arrived at in some different fashion . But this blindness of action , and the prevalence of views peculiarly chaotic and vague , are not wthout excuse . The question is one of no little difficulty ; it goes deeper than all our statutes and deeper than the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilobites . The very multitude of theories darkens counsel , and rarely , if ever , has the question been stripped of all extraneous matter and clearly stated . It has nothing to do with slavery or confiscation . It is simply this : " Do the civil rights under our government , once vested in certain States and the citizens of those States , still exist , and , if so , in whom are they vested ? " To discuss particular measures of reconstruction and attempt partial reorganizations , without first giving to this question a final and formal answer , is to put up a frame and finish off a wing before the shape of the building is fixed or the *oundation laid . // One theory , extracted as best we may from the opinions more commonly expressed-opinions which vary in detail as the leaves of the autumnal forest vary in tint-may be thus stated : " Those rights are in abeyance . All acts of secession are illegal and void ; therefore ( a logical non cequitur as may presently appear ) the several States still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all political privileges , but the loyal men of the South have lost no right whatever . Deprived of all exercise of their powers by the armed force of the rebellion , they are nevertheless the State , and have full right , as soon as that obstacle is removed , to reorganize under the old constitution and laws , and to resume the place and power of the State as a member of the Union . " Views not materially differing from these have directed most of the steps thus far taken with reference to reorganization , and not only many precedents but high authorities give them sanction . And yet few will deny that this theory is open to certain legal objections , and leads to many practical difficulties . Without attempting to decide a question upon which the ablest minds of the nation have been and will yet be exercised , these objections may be reviewed , and an opposite theory stated . It may first be noticed that the assumption that the States in question still exist as members of the Union , whether sound or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of secession is illegal , it is nevertheless so far operative as to constitute a crime under our laws , and to involve forfeiture of political rights by those who share in it . And so the act of the State , as a corporate body , is indeed powerless to abrogate the supremacy of the Constitution ; but it does not logically follow that the act of the State has not power to work the forfeiture of all its corporate rights as a State . The nullity of secession ordinances does not prove that the State exists ; it only proves that the Constitution is still of right supreme , over that as over every other part of the land . As to the fact , it will be objected that a State is an organization of the people , for local self-government and representation ; and that the rebel governments , though illegal and mere nullities , are absolutely the only organizations of the people that // now exist within the hostile territory . Nor can a State exist in contemplation of law without loyal citizens , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government can have no legal knowledge that there are loyal citizens in a State where the people , in their corporate capacity and by every mode and form of civil action , have deliberately put themselves in hostility to the Union . What organization of the people exists that can be called " The State of South Carolina ? " Without an official , without a pretence of power at home , without a voice in Congress , and , so far as government knows , without a single loyal constituent , is it not a phantom rather than a State ? Of the practical difficulties of this theory we have already had proofs . Granting that there are loyal citizens within the rebel lines , on the face of the record they are a minority everywhere . Can we safely concede recognition , as a right , to a State government which has to support it only a loyal few , surrounded by the disloyal many ? Military power could perhaps uphold it , but it is a fair question whether the Union can afford to rest upon pillars that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be propped up by bayonets are fit members of the federal family . If the loyal minority retain rights as the State , what authority has the federal government to refuse recognition or representation to any minority , however insignificant , if only due forms are observed in organization or election ? If a thousand loyalists , being a minority , are the State , by xvhat enactment or constitutional provision do they cease to be the State dwindling to one hundred , to ten , or to one ? In a legal point of view this theory rests upon the idea that traitors have lost their political rights and that loyal men have not . But under the civil law the traitor , no matter how notorious his offense , is deprived of nothing except upon trial and conviction ; in the presumption of law he is innocent until his / guilt is judicially established ; and he therefore retains every right that loyal citizens possess . Not a traitor in South Carolina , for example , has yet been tried and convicted ; in the contemplation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if there is anywhere in that State the right to reorganize its government and resume the powers of a State , that right pertains to every traitor in arms as well as to every loyalist in confinement . So of the right to be represented in Congress ; if it exists at all within the limits of the rebellious States , it belongs to the traitor as much as to the loyal citizen , for before all our laws they as yet are equal , and the right of suffrage is determined by the laws of the State . But the law , instead of conceding civil rights and political privileges to all , would seem to deny them to any . The Supreme Court has unanimously decided ( 2 Black , 635-637 ) , that there exists in this country no longer merely a rebellion or insurrection , to be suppressed under the operation of the civil laws alone , but a civil war , to be prosecuted according to the laws of war , and that under those laws all inhabitants of the hostile district have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a civil war the Court were unanimous , for a minority dissented only as to the act from which the state of war takes legal existence , the Court holding that it dates from the proclamations of blockade , and the minority dating it from the passage of the non-intercourse act by Congress . In this decision , speaking of the insurgents , the Court say : " Hence in organizing this rebellion they have acted as States claiming to be sovereign over all persons and property within their respective limits . * * * It is no loose unorganized insurrection , having no defined boundary or possession . It has a boundary marked by lines of bayonets , and which can be crossed only by force-south of that line is enemy 's territory , because it is claimed and held in possession by an organized hostile and belligerent power . All persons residing within this territory , whose property may be used to increase the revenues of the hostile power , are in this contest liable to be treated as enemies , though not foreigners . They have cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are none the less enemies because they are traitors . " And *lsewhere , in the same case , it is said : " The laws of war , whether it be civil or inter qentes , convert every citizen of a hostile State into a public enemy . " Is not the conclusion swiftfooted // and irresistible that there are within this hostile territory no citizens who retain political rights or privileges , and no States ? Can public enemies retain the right to be represented in Congress ? Can public enemies retain the right of local self-government upon part of our territorial domain ? Can public enemies still constitute a State which shall be a member of the Union ? If not , we must hold that when the insurrection became a civil war , it put an end to all civil rights under our government that previously vested in the inhabitants of the hostile territory , and the question is decided by the court of last resort . This decision is no legal novelty , and is but the necessary consequence of the well settled and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have validity over such part of its territory as may be held by a hostile force , and that such territory ceases for the time to be de facto a part of its territorial domain . ( See 4 Wheaton , 246 ) . In the Farna case , ( 5 IRobinson , 106 ) , and in the case of the United States vs . Perchiman , ( 7 Pet . 86 ) , the principle is clearly stated that the inhabitants of a country held by a hostile and belligerent power " change their allegiance , and their relation to their former sovereign is dissolved . " The country ceases for a time to be de facto a part of the United States , its inhabitants have no longer any right of protection from our government or any right of citizenship under it , and become de facto foreigners . Against them the government possesses full belligerent rights under the laws of war . The opposite theory is reviewed in a very instructive manner in the momentous decision above quoted , ( 2 Black . 635 ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly applicable only to those who are subjects or citizens of a foreign state at war with our own . * * * They insist , moreover , that the President himself in his proclamation admits that great numbers of the persons residing withirf the territories in possession of the insurgent government are loyal in their feelings , and are forced by coA-ipulsion and the violence of the rebellions and revolutionary party and its de facto government to submit to their laws and assist in their scheme // of revolution ; that the acts of the usurping government can not legally sever the bond of their allegiance ; they have , therefore , a corelative right to claim the protection of the government for their persons and property ; * * * and finally , that the secession ordinances are nullities , and ineffectual to release any citizen from his allegiance to the national government , and consequently that the Constitution and laws of the IJuited States are still operative over persons in all the States for punishment as well as for protection . This argument rests on the assumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the established laws of nations . It assumes that when a civil war exists the party belligerent claiming to be sovereign can not for some unknown reason exercise the rights of belligerents , although the revolutionary party may . * * * Now it is a proposition never doubted that the belligerent party who claims to be sovereign may exercise both belligerent and sovereign rights . " It follows as an inevitable consequence that after subduing the rebel armies the United States will possess the whole territory by right of conquest . Whatever measure of sovereignty vested in the former state government was contributed by the people , acting in their corporate capacity , to swell the pretended sovereignty of the Confederate government , and now passes to time conqueror . No innocent minority can claim it . " Every man is in the judgment of law a party to the acts of his own government , " says Kent , and with us the rule has especial force , since the goverI*ing power is held by the people themselves . It involves no other hardship thin is incident to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the rights of the innocent are forfeited by the illegal act of the majority of its members . Every local organization or government that existed within the hostile territory contributed whatever sovereignty or power it possessed to the work of rebellion , and to the pretended Confederate government , which is but their creature and organ , and between the power so developed and the United States a civil war now exists ; against all the inhabitants of that territory and all their pretended governments , Confederate or State , the nation has full belligerent // rights under the laws of war , and , with their overthrow , the measure of sovereignty held by the people of each rebellious state , and all political power held or exercised by them or any of them , vests absolutely in the United States . In a conquered country the only governing power is that of the conqueror . By the law of conquest the United States does not only recover her original powers under the Constitution , but she acquires all those which had contributed to form and strengthen the hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested in those state , county , or town organizations , which have by the people themselves been arrayed in hostility against her . It is not necessary here to quote from such cases as Cross vs . Harrison , ( 16 how . 164 ) , or Leitensdorfer vs . Webb , ( 20 How . 176 ) , to show that with conquest every power and right of state or local governments is merged in the absolute sovereignty of the conqueror . And thus the simple but inevitable consequence of the forfeiture of all such franchises , by the act of treason , is also the sure result of conquest , and follows the overthrow of the rebellion as night follows day . To the conqueror belongs the right to establish such territorial governments , to make such divisions , and assign such territorial limits as he may choose . That government might prefer not to exercise this right in any case is not to the question ; if it is not bound to leave local government to state authority , then , in law , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conquest be reconciled with the idea that the old States still exist , with their old constitutions and boundaries , and that the loyal citizens have the right to organize as a State and to resume political powers whenever they cease to be in duress by reason of the rebellion ? it is not surprising that the majority of loyal people hold this theory . They have been pushed into it by the very depth of their horror of treason and secession , and their resolve to maintain the Union at all hazards . We resist , with every drop of blood in our veins , the assertion that traitors can take a State out of the Union , and , to many minds , the conclusion is unavoidable that by some legal fiction , and in some // mysterious way , the State is still in being , and a member ot the Union . We welcome with eager joy the first sign of returning loyalty , and all our sympathies go forth to meet the suffering unionists of the Sonth , and it is easy to overlook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileges that we would so gladly accord them . But it is not wise to let our zeal to crush the rebellion strip the government of the surest agencies and most potent weapons for the accomplishment of that very purpose . " In medjo tutissimus . " While we avoid the yawning gulf of secession on the one hand , we should not the less look closely , lest on the other we plunge into a Serbonian bog of legal errors and practical mistakes , that will embarrass the task of reorganization , entail Herculean labors upon the next generation , and deface the national record for all time to come . Already a different theory has been stated by one of the most far*seeing statesmen ofthe nation , and it may be well to inquire whether , as a final answer to the question , the courts may not decide that rights and States have alike ceased to exist . " But this is secession ; it grants just what we are fighting against , that traitors can vote a State out of the Union ! " Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that can be taken against secession . There is a very common tendency to confound the State , as a geographical division , with the State as a political organization . As a part of our territorial domain the State has neither ceased to exist nor been taken from the Union . Though hostile armies bar the exercise of our rights , the soil is ours , and nothing but defeat can wrest it from us . A million traitors , by a million ordinances , can not abrogate the sovereignty of the United States as to a single county or square mile of that territory . But the State as a corporate body-the State as an organization of the people for local self-government , and as a member of the family of States -- is not a physical entity , but a creature of law . It has put itself in arms against the Supreme Law , and from that moment it ceased to have legal existence . The Constitution is a Gorgon 's head to every monster of treason ; of its own force it strikes dead every hostile organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // attempt hostility and live . Like a corporation , whose charter expires when the law that gave it being is violated , the member of the Federal Union that takes arms against it makes void its constitution and its laws , casts away all its powers , and forfeits all its rights . The State has committed suicide . But the Union still lives , its rights n imimpaired , and its territorial sovereignty undiminished . Is not this the only view that consists with the authoritative adjudication of the Supreme Court in the case above quoted ? We need not , under this theory , try to reconcile the possession of belligerent rights with the concession of political privileges . When the rebellion becomes a war , all civil rights of inhabitants of the hostile territory expire . We are no longer obliged / to hold that public enemies can vote for members of our Congress or constitute a State . We are no longer forced to the ' strange anomaly of denying to a man protection for person or property from the operation of the laws of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship . And so , when the combat ceases , to protect ourselves against reorganization in the interest of traitors , we are no longer forced to assume for Congress an authority that the Constitution does not giveauthority to deny to any State , for a time , self-government or representation . We recognize no claims that conflict with the laws of war and the right of conquest . States and civil rights have been swallowed up in the maelstrom of rebellion , and there remains only the untrammeled territorial sovereignty , which treason has in vain sought to destroy , and which conquest has secured and made absolute . Such temporary governments , military or territorial , as the circumstances may require , we may then establish . Under these we may carefully discriminate between leaders , whose deep-dyed guilt demands a condign punishment-followers , who may be spared the rigors of strict justice , but must yet undergo probation or be disqualified for places of honor and trust  --  and the truly loyal men , to whom may be safely entrusted the privileges of citizenship . When this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can establish a genuine government , able to execute the laws , and worthy of a place in the Union of Commommwealths , then // - " Congress may admit a new State , " which shall be a source of power and not a burden and a peril to the IRepublic . Under this theory the anomaly of minority governments is avoided ; local self-government can be rightfully denied until there is a healthy majority of sound loyalists to support it ; and States propped by bayonets are excluded until they can stand alone . The delay is no hardship to loyal citizens ; it is rather for their interest to defer the organization of a permanent government until they can have security that traitors will not control it . A government kept alive only by military force is a civil authority only in name , and can confer only the shadow of benefits . " Inter ar*ma 8ilent lege8 . " The thorough elimination of disloyal elements , and exact ascertainment of the loyal residuum , can precede and be made the basis of an equitable apportionment of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would surely be not a little to the credit of the nation to sweep away , by the operation of this theory , all those paltry 8imulctera of elections and organizations which have hitherto started up like mushrooms in the track of our armies . The abeyance theory makes every newly entered district a placer for political speculators to work , and it is notorious that not even the cotton mania has so much retarded our military success as the constant interference of such schemes . Have we not seen enough of these manufactured organizations , which " live , movg and have their being " in the baggage wagons of our army ? They afford excellent chances for political chicanery ; nice honors and fat offices are recovered from " abeyance " by men whose surprising merit had not been discovered in times of peace ; but is the Union cause materially helped or do the Union loving people of the South thereby obtain any substantial protection ? Is it not time to ask if these sickly plants do not cost more than it is worth to rear them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by removing all pretext for such premature growths , sweeps away the whole system of political jugglery so engendered ? Another consideration seems worthy of especial attention . Our law of treason is less effective or severe than that of other civilized nations . To the framers of the Constitution treason // seemed a crime strangely horrid and improbable , and there doubtless appeared to be greater danger from an over rigorous loyalty , which , in times of excitement , might mistake reasonable freedom of thought and speech for hostility to the government . Yet we have lived to see cabinet ministers , senators , and most trusted officers of the army and navy , participating in as foul a conspiracy as ever defaced the pages of history . We have lived to see them unite with Governors of States , with Legislatures and Conventions , in a treason as base , as subversive of all law and of the very existence of our government , and as terrible in its consequences , as has ever broken the peace of any nation . Compared with this conspiracy all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other crimes shrink to peccadilloes .

But , were the South to lay down her arms to-day , and resume the rights which the abeyance theory concedes , there is no security that even these leaders would not find absolute immunity from punishment . Even the most notorious traitor could exercise every right of citizenship until he had been tried and convicted by a jury from his own State , and nothing in the laws of that State would exclude any other notorious traitor from the jury-box . What punishment would Davis fear from a jury of Mississippians , of whom perhaps half had just laid aside smoking muskets and dripping swords to enter the panel ?

We are cramped by no legal forms or constitutional obligations , unless we choose , in punishing this rebellion . Rising to the proportions of a civil war , it has placed in the hands of the nation not only the remedial agencies of the courts , but the torch and sword of the conqueror . Rebels are now not rebels only , but public enemies ; Gettyburg 's slaughter and Sherman 's // march have a broader sweep than any enacted penalties ; and the right of conquest cnts deeper than any conceivable measure of confiscation . The law of war becomes supreme , and of that law " V* V*ct*s " is the epitome . We have only to apply the principles of the decision above quoted to the work of reconstruction , to make sure that the punishment , for leaders at least , shall be severe enough to prevent for all future time the recurrence of a crhne so terribly destructive to the national prosperity and the national honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as magnanimous in victory as they have been enduring in trial ; but they will not consent to see those whose rebellion has cost the nation all this treasure and blood , this agony and shame , return at once , without penance or probation , to the full enjoyment of privileges and blessings preserved only by loyal sacrifices and sufferings . Schemes of reconstruction which make possible immunity for the great conspirators , or instant return to all political privileges for traitors as well as loyalists , will not be such as the people will approve or the nation can safely adopt . Nor will it answer , in overflowing leniency for past offenses , to neglect security for healthy political action in the future . Men who have deliberately betrayed trusts guarded by all the sanctity , of an oath are not safely to be trusted as loyal and true citizens , whenever they may choose to renew an obligation once violated .

Instead of retaining these old constitutions , redolent of the slave-pen , defiled in every part by the use of traitors , and infested in every joint and crevice by claims that loyal men must loathe but can never wholly extirpate , the erection and admission of new States demolishes all these relics of a shameful past , and secures new and spotless constitutions , each in harmony in every part with the spirit of the new era , and instinct and vital with freedom and loyalty . There are many who shrink with horror from the idea that we have to-day fewer States than we had four years ago . This // conception of a State which exists only in a happy fiction of the intellect  --  a mysterious and immortal piece of mechanism , without component parts , visible whole , or " local habitation , " hanging , like Mahomet 's coffin , " twixt heaven and earth , " but always ready to yield a full set of offices whenever men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain portion of the State 's surface-however ludicrous it may be , still serves its purpose for those who daily cheer themselves with the thought that " not a State is lost ; not a star is blotted from the flag . " But are we any the better for calling that a State which is only a territory , held by hostile or trampled by contending armies ? Is it less than cowardly thus to cling closely to the victory that we mean to win as if it were already won ? Have we not kept our heads in the sand , after the wisdom of the ostrich , quite long enough ? Dreams of States are not States : Recollections or hopes of States are not States . A paper constitution and an imaginary boundary do not constitute a Commonwealth , any more than a map in the office of a western land-shark constitutes a city . Beside New York or Massachusetts , such States are but the shadow of a phantom . And yet , under the abeyance theory , these same mythical members of the Union actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of the people , and prevent the adoption of a greatly needed reform , even though it should receive the votes of every loyal and actual commonwealth ! Clinging to these shadows we enumerate thirty-six States . If this theory be law , the votes of twenty-seven States are required to prohibit slavery by constitutional amendment . The ten States " in abeyance , " in which we have not even a phantoni legislature , make us helpless . Even if Louisiana , as organized under Gov . Hahn , be recognized as a State ; and if , beside the vote of West Virginia , the Pierpont government be held competent to vote for old Virginia , there are yet enough , with a single negative vote froni Delaware or New Jersey , to defeat the desire of those to whom the Union is worth sacrifice and bloodshed , in the interest of those who have not only voluntarily deprived themselves of all share and voice in the government , but are now actively waging war against it . Thus , to the very people who are // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to prevent any reform , however necessary or however universally desired by those who fight to save it . No clearer illustration could be desired of the effect of a theory which confers upon public enemies civil rights and political privileges . While , if we hold that rebel States have ceased to have legal being , that creatures of law can not exist in hostility to law , and that a community of public enemies can not constitute a State within the meaning of the Constitution , more than three-fourths of the States that have actual existence stand ready to adopt the amendment , and the will of the nation can be the law of the land . Nothing in the past action of Congress should embarrass the decision of this question . The admission of West Virginia can be justified at least as logically on the basis of the absolute territorial sovereignty resulting from the demise of Virginia , as by the consent of the Pierpont government , which would itself never have been recognized as a legal entity had it not been deemed necessary to provide local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor should precedents , blindly adopted with little thought of their bearing upon the future , pushed through by local , petty , and personal interests , and adopted as temporary ex*edients at a time when the character and magnitude of the rebellion were not understood , and when its overthrow within sixty days was predicted by some who hold high place as statesmen , be held binding and final decisions of questions as momentous and far-reaching in their consequences as any that can engage the attention of our rulers . In this view all action thus far taken in the case of Louisiana must be held premature and ill-considered . False in theory , it has been not less pernicious in its consequences . How much the " abeyance " theory has helped Louisiana thus far , can be learned by a very slight examination of the character of the men brought to the surface of the political caldron . How much it has advanced military operations , let the IRed River performances answer . What sort of a " State** has been produced by this hot-house culture , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // range of our cannon , and that the loyal districts are but islets in * wide circumambient ocean of disloyalty . The question is already betbre Congress , and it is to be hoped that not only its special merits and demerits , but the whole theory of reconstruction , may now receive thorough consideration . Nor should those in power be left unwatched or unaided . Now , more than ever , when the history of ages hangs upon the record of each passing day , may the wisest leader welcome the thoughts of any that have thoughts to give , and court the freest discussion of the questions upon which he has to act . The navigator in unknown waters will not spurn the suggestions of the common seaman whose earlier rovings may have led him thither , nor despise the caution of the youngest cabin boy , whose eyes detect through gloom or fog " breakers ahead . " The general who leads his column through a strange and hostile country , will welcome the aid of the humblest private who can point out roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even from children by the wayside will not disdain to gather ideas of the opposing armies and their route . And neither navigator , traversing pathless and unexplored seas , nor general , penetrating forest and mountain wilds , has less of precedent or experience to ajd him , than the statesmen whose task it is to guide us through the perils of a revolution for which history has no parallel ; to determine questions not even dreamed of by the framers of the constitution ; to adjust differences which involve the rights and prosperity and future welfare of millions of people ; to deal with hereditary antagonisms , inborn prejudices , and hatreds burnt into the very fibre of the quivering flesh by the red-hot irons of civil strife ; to effect the harmonious union of forces which have made earth shake with the tread of their advancing hosts , and whose conflicts have been likened by observers to the battles of the Titans and the strange legends of the old mythology ; to handle the admixture of races the most diverse of the earth 's population ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glorious nationality that successful selfgovernment will have made 1 ) ossible on this continent . With not too much of reverence for the past , // and yet with not too boastful a confidence in our own wisdom , let such a task be approached . And let us hope that He who has brought hither this strangely composite people , with its representatives of every nation under the sun , to work out here a great problem for mankind , and who has given strength for the conflict of arms , and sturdy patriotism and unfailing intelligence for the trial of political decision , will grant us wisdom and statesmanship for the work that is to come .
