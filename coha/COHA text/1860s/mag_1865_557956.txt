ART . VIII . - AMERICAN POLITICAL IDEAS . THE American Republic is an unprecedented political organization . It has no parallel or exemplar in history . It is a new growth . It resembles , indeed , in numerous respects , former political organizations , but the resemblances are only or mainly in form , while the differences are in essence . Historically and externally it may be classed with other federal governments , with the Achaian League , with the Swiss and the Dutch Republics . But its genuine characteristics are omitted in any such comparison . It derives its peculiar quality , not from its Federal relations , not from its Republican form , but from what underlies and vivifies alike its Federalism and its Republicanism . It is not to be understood by the study of other states ; in order to understand it , it must be studied from within and in itself . It differs moreover from the intentions and expectations of those who have been called its founders . Neither Winthrop and his band of Pilgrim companions foresaw in their farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted the seed , nor did the framers of the Constitution of the United States fully comprehend the spirit which was to give vital energy and perpetuity to their work . Their wisdom did not devise the Republic as it existed or as it exists . They builded better than they knew ; for their work was controlled by supreme forces of which they had imperfect cognizance , and their highest praise is that they wrought unconsciously in harmony with these forces , whose irresistible power would ere this have rent asunder any fabric not thus constructed . Our commonwealth was never , in truth , founded ; it is not the result of pre-eminently wise forecast , or the product of any ordaining will . It was not made by mali ; it is no discovery or invention , but a natural growth , the slow , undiscerned , unimagined result of the instincts , desires , and efforts of individuals united in a society under novel conditions , and controlled by laws which mastered the thoughts and actions of men . The Republic has therefore naturally been a puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves . It has // continually baffled expectation , and turned prophecy to folly . In its progress it has seemed to be too good to be true , and to offer fairer promises there could be fulfilled ; but every year has taught us - and no years have taught us with more assurance than these late years of war- that its best promise was not beyond fulfilment ; that nothing was too good not to be expected from it ; that the best hopes of man for men might here find their accomplishment ; that there was neither failure nor disappointment in it ; that a perfect commonwealth might here become a reality . Every year has taught us - these last five years more than any others - that the crimes , the wrongs , the miseries which deface the ideal of our state , - the inherited errors of the past , the selfishness of materialism , the mass of ignorance , the corruption of politics , the atrocities of slavery , - that thcse arid all else of evil in their train were capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , were excrescences upon it which might be , which in time would be , got rid of , so that the actual commonwealth should assume slowly , imperfectly always , but ever more and more nearly , the image of the ideal . From the height of our Pisgah we have beheld the promised land , not as in dream , but in actual vision , and the cloud of the Lord by day and His pillar of fire by night have led us on our way . In spite of the evils which the United States share with all other political communities , in spite of mistakes and *defects which have seemed to superficial or faithless observers indications of radical unsoundness and approaching decay , yet the rational convictions of more competent and deeper thinkers have continually come into closer accordance with the instinctive confidence of the people - a confidence springing from experience of blessings - in the perpetual beneficent progress of the principles on which American institutions of government and of society are based , and in the excellence of the ideas which form the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and principles which have had the power , and still have it , to shape the political action of the American people ? What is this new thing in practical politics which the American Republic exhibits ? What consti // tutes its difference from all preceding political organizations ? This is tire problem of our history , and that history will not be correctly interpreted unless the problem be satisfactorily solved . The investigation of the political ideas original in America , so far at least as their practical embodiment iii institutions of government is concerned , is an inquiry of the highest interest arid importance . The true nature arid legitimate operation of these ideas is the greatest question iii the art arid science of government ; for the progress of democracy in America is a fact at once so great and so new , so far-reachin0 in its influences , so revolutionary not only of old theories , but of old systems , and the tendency of political communities throughout the civilized world is so plainly toward democracy in one form or another , that to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and excellence becomes more and more important , not only to the student and to the statesman , but also to the lover of mankind , to every one laboring for the advance of man . The great distinction between the new political world arid the old political world begins with the first serious attempts of our ancestors to colonize America , arid especially with the religious , industrial colonies that landed at Plymouth arid founded Boston . The dawn of modern political civilization first lighted up Massachusetts Bay . The colonies that settled the shores of New Englanid were of a new kind , arid they established the validity of an order of ideas in practical politics which had hnitimerto in the history of the world been relegated to the domain of theory , and which in their application have riot yet been fully expounded , have not yet been completely expressed in any political creed , but have from 1620 to 1865 been operative , whether recognized or riot , in all the political movemeiits of the American people . It was the force of conditions over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of those beliefs arid instincts which animated their souls and impelled them to their hard undertaking , that led to this advance in the art of politics . Hitherto , in the history of colonizing enterprise , the colonists had gone out as a swarm of bees from the hive , carrying with them unchanged the insti // tutions and the relations of the parent state . The Greek cobiiies were in form and system , in government and domestic and social order , but copies , as literal as was possible , of the cities of Greece from which they had come out . The military colonies of the Romans carried with them the military rule of Rome , acquiring no independence , but remaining Roman in thought and in deed , alike in Thrace , Illyria , or Britain . Rome was impressed on the soil by every step of the colonist 's foot . Rome , her mark , was written over bvery land of which her children took possession . Not so with the colonies of New England . The colonists still professed themselves and believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had left her of their own accord . They had come over the ocean and settled the wilderness under no direction from the authorities of England , with no aid from them , - at most with their God-speed , thankful as they may have been to get rid of so troublesome a crew . The expedition was of individuals united for conscience ' sake . The colony had a moral rather than a political foundation , and out of this fact sprang the first historical application of the truth , that politics are a branch of ethics , and are subject to its laws . The fact that these New England colonies were colonies of individuals united for conscience ' sake , had consequences that were wholly unanticipated . The colonists had really cut themselves off from all vital connection with the Old World , although they still remained in formal connection with it . They had left feudalism , or the right of might , embodied in institutions whose essence was the doctrine of privilege , - they had left Roman Catholicism , or the right of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cut loose from the two great stays of modern European civihizatioii ; they had swung off from the old moorings mossy with antiquated superstitions , - from the old moorings of priest and king and noble , - and they started in ignorant faith on a voyage of discovery . The guidance of Providence did not fail them . It led them to that New World which they were to make new indeed . Much of their work was unconsciously performed . They knew not fully the force of their own principles . For the right of might they substituted the right of man , for the right of authority voL. cI. - No. 209. // they substituted the right of independence , for king and priest and noble they substituted the People . This was the natural , the necessary conclusion from the fact of deriving political arrangements and systems from moral principles . In morals man is man , never less and never more , independent , equal , just . It is only in politics divorced from morals that man becomes more or less than man , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent , privileged , unjust . The people of the American religious industrial colonies was a new thing , - there had been no people of the kind before . The world had seen a Roman plebs , medieval burgesses and villeins , - it had never yet seen a people . It behooves us to find an intelligible definition of this people , and to understand what we as Americans mean by the phrase ; for it is on this that our idea of the state and of government in great part depends . Not merely the notion of this people , but the thing itself , has been of slow but regular growth . It did not spring fully de-. veloped on the landing of the Pilgrims , but it grew with the growth of the Colonies , acquiring strength , consistency , and conscious force during the long period of Colonial dependency , nurtured alike by the internal struggles of the nascent state and by its contentions with those who claimed to exercise authority over it from abroad . The circumstances of Colonial life , - the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes , the scattered settlements , each with its local government and institutions , the popular form and methods of most of the Colonial governments , the Church contests , the disputes between neighhoring Colonies , - all tended to promote the development not only of strong individualism , but also of the habit of combined action in the community . The quality , moreover , of the early settlers , marked as it was by their general intelligence , their attention to education , their deep moral sense , impressed itself upon their descendants , and upon the mass of the inferior emigrants of the later periods of Colonial history . A community grew up here , original not only in its modes of life , but in its composition . New England was throughout the whole Colonial perIod the typical portion of the English dominion in America . She was the mother of ideas // and of states . But similar influeiices to those which gave her her leading position were at work in the other Colonies . The Revolution welded the Colonies together . It taught them their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to themselves . The Confederation showed them their weakness . And the Constitution whIch gave to the States a iiational unity , which changed the Colonies into the United States , which raised them to a power in the world , was the embodiment of the long lessons of Colonial experience , and the expression not only of a new system of government , but of those new political ideas which had sprung up and were flourishing on American soil . Its opening words are the grand declaration of the existence of a state such as the world had not known , - a state not imposed upon a people , but having its existence and authority solely from them . " We , the people of the United States do ordain . " We , the people , - and this people means a civilized community spontaneously organized to promote the gen* eral welfare , and actuated by the moral forces which civilization has ingrained in the habits of a race , and which are derived from the Divine order of the universe . We , the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state , and organizing itself simply for the sake of establishing a frame of government , but a moral community , already organized . and governed by moral principles . We unite primarily not to govem or to be governed , but we the people frame a government as an expedient by which to confirm the already established moral order and the general welfare of the community , and thus to secure the progress of civilization . Neither the geo* graphical limits of the United States nor the government of time United States make us a nation ; but we , the people constituting a nation , make the United States and frame a govermmmem*t for them . 1-litherto , in political speculation , the state has been regarded as something apart from the people , or as embracing the people as one only of its elements . It has been considered as an abstract of the governmental institutions and political organization of any given country . But in this democracy of the New World the people constitute the state , its limits arc defimmed by *hose of timeir moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state includes potential independence of institutions of government . These institutions are inseparable accidents , not essential features in the body politic . Theoretically , at least , the people are not merely capable of self-governinent , but are self-governing . Such institutions of government as they frame for themselves are in the nature of conveniences , aids , and appliances , - are to promote their welfare , to advance civilization , - and have no inherent power , validity , or right in themselves , and no virtue but in so far as they are adapted to the ends for which they are established . The idea of sovereignty , as derived from ancient and mcdi*val times , has no moral weight in America , and no practical relation to our politics . The use of the word in our political debates has been a fertile source of fallacies , and has led to confusion and obscurity of thought in regard to the true character of our government . The government is in no proper sense sovereign in its relation to the people . Its laws are imposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original sovereignty existing in it , but purely in virtue of a derived authority . The States of the Union have no rights of soyereiguty over the general government of the United States , and none in their domestic relations . The States are mere conveniences . They represent no moral entity ; they are political contrivances ; their local governments are ingenious expedients for facilitating the interests of the people ; they have no rights inherent in themselves . The rights they possess are rights derived , not from any transmitted powers , not from any inherited privileges , not from any original title , but from the consentaneous action of the people . They are in themselves simply geographical divisions of the country , with limits arbitrarily fixed , and with institutions not independent of , but wholly dependent on , the will of their inhabitants , and of the nation of which those inhabitants form a part . The idea of sovereignty as it exists in our American politics , the idea that has been so fertile of evil , and is still so powerful in its capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - from royal colonial charters , - from the instincts of Leudalism , not yet wholly extinguished in the Now World . The notion of sovereignty residing in the States can // be maintained only by an appeal to an historical authority , against which the American Revolution was a successful conflict , and of which the American Constitution was the express denial . So , too , the general government of the United States derives no rights from the past ; it has no authority by inheritance . It is the fruit of revolution . In constituting it the people surrendered no natural rights ; they had no power to surrender these if they would , nor to inspire it with any inherent sovereignty . They constituted it as an agency , as the guardian of specified interests , as the means by which they might secure certain definite ends . The government of the United States , and that of each separate State , is valid only by reason of a popular sanction . There is in the nature of society , philosophically considered , no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , there exists outside of the individual no right to govern him . All government is an expedient , and it is founded , not upon right , but upon the consideration of the interests of the community . The divine right of kings is the expression only of the doctrine of a right inherent in power , whether the power of brute force or of superior intelligence . in politics there is no such thing as a natural right . Nat'ural rights exist only in morals , and inhere in the individual as a moral being . As ' a moral being every man has rights , which may be called divine , as inseparable from the spiritual nature implanted in him by the Creator . It is the fundamental prin ciple re only in man as of American politics that rio'hts inhe man . There is no better statement of these rights than that in the Declaration of Independence : " All men are created equal ; they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . " Powers , then , belong to governments , not rights , except such secondary rights as have their origin iii these powers . And these powers are not natural , hut derived ; j ) owers the exercise of which is authorized by the consent of the governed . No natural sovereignty inheres in a government . The sovereignty of the Union means the powers given // to the government by the people . We , the people of the United States , in adopting a Constitution as the symbol and expression of our national unity , gave to the government which that Constitution defined the powers necessary to secure its own existence and perpetuity , - powers of control over all inferior and subordinate governments , powers over communities and individuals , - but neither did nor could implant in it any natural right of sovereignty . This statement of the American idea of government needs to be carefully guarded , lest paradoxical conclusions be drawn from it . Such conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had , for example , the theory of no government advanced and strenuously maintained by a school of imperfect thinkers , who have professed to derive it from the principle of the unlimited freedom of the individual . But , as we have said , institutions of government , though not essential features , are inseparable accidents of the body politic . However self-governed the individuals of a community may be , yet , owing to the diverse wills and the variety of interests of individuals , the community requires , and must always require , an external governmePt to control those wills , and to regulate the pursuit of those interests in such a manner as to preserve the moral order , to secure the general welfare . The more highly moral and intelligent individuals become , the less will be the need of this external government ; but it is impossible that man , constituted as he is , should always , even with the highest moral and intellectual cultivation , subject his will , his passions , and his desires to the interests of the community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a main feature of which is the constant potential improvement of the individual , the functions of external government are redi*iced to their lowest point , and under this system the way is open for the realization of the most inspiring and most promising idea of modern Christian civilization , - the true brotherhood of man , in which man shall feel himself no longer an isolated individual , but shall find his completeness and perfection , his worth and his happiness , in the recognized relations of mutual dependence existing between himself and the community of which he forms an integral and essential part . Without the rest of mankind he is // poor , bare , solitary , and his own nature is incomplete . With them he is rich , completed , and capable of a spiritual development of which our present civilization affords but a faint and partial type . The principles thus recognized as essentially Americab , the principles , iiamely , that politics are a subordinate branch of morals , - that the people are , properly speaking , the whole community united in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , derives its existence from the people ,  --  and that the government is but a device , determined by considerations of expediency , for the attainment of certain ends , - are illustrated by a remarkable feature in our political system , which has not been hitherto sufficiently considered , although it is embodied in the actual functions and operations of our American commonwealth . No discovery more fertile in the most important results was ever made in political science than that which the early settlers of New England slowly wrought out . They found out by long and varied experience , that in a moral community civilized order may exist without governmental institutions , - an order proceeding from spontaneous moral and industrial co-operation , the result of a sense of mutual dependence , from which is developed an intelligent respect for mutual rights and interests . In a country of scattered settlements , often wide apart , and in which there are no long-established institutions of government , the share of any regularly constituted government in the preservation of social order mast of necessity be very small . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it has remained so in portions of the United States to the piescut day . And this fact leads to the recognition of the truth , that a state founded , as ours is , o* natural rights , and deriving its existence from the people , includes two controlling agencies , consisting on the one hand of a government instituted with forms and powers , and operating through organized legal and inilitaiy authority , and on the other hand in the devices and armaim geme tints adopted by the people , or growing up among them , for the preservation of the inherent good order of a well-disposed and intelligent community . In such a comnln4lity , nmorcuver , tim lattcr organization is // more essential and important than the former , as it is also the earlier in its exhibition . In European feudal politics the reverse is the case , what may be called the natural arrangements of men to preserve order in society being regarded as dependent oi the government for their support and efficiency . The tendency to centralization in European countries at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view of the relations of these two agencies in the state . In American politics , on the contrary , the opposite view prevails , fur the most part , both in theory and practice . The government is subordinate to the arrangements for preserving good order which can and do exist independently of it . It is made , supported , and changed by proceedings outside of its own limits , save in so far as the forms of those proceedings may be regulated by it ; and , instead of originating the good order of the community , itself originates from that good order . If this statement should appear extravagant , because in some degree the result of a novel analysis of the conditions of our society , its seeming extravagance may be removed by some further considerations . For it is , indeed , no merely vividly conceived , but unreal and Utopian , theory with which we are dealing , but a real fact , however as yet vaguely conceived , the nature of which is illustrated , not merely by historic proof and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole course of political action in America . Oar common notions of government and of the state are so much derived from the past , so much the offspring of a political philosophy drawn from the historic precedents of the Old World , or based upon fanciful speculations concerning the nature and origin of civil society , that it is difficult for us to understand the true conditions , relations , and meanings of American society and institutions . The governments of Europe are historic inheritances , with the moral supports of tradition , succession , and force . The government of the United States , on the contrary , is not an historic product , has not the sanction of transmitted auth6rity or inherited forms . It is severed from the past , is the product of the fresh efforts of men striving to do the best for themselves , unimpeded by traditionary forms and antliority . Cut off from historic succession , the ultimate source // of the authority that resides in it is , as we have said , in the people themselves , who establish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure what is expedient for it . And this community , this people , does not become , in establishing the government for itself , merely a part of the governmental organization , acting solely thereafter through legalized modes and forms , whether of popular election , of court of justice , of assemblies of legislation or other , but remains what it was before the government was established , an organization outside of , superior to , and potentially independent of it . It is the crowning and consummate merit of our system , indeed , that the government so admirably meets the wants which it was designed to supply , is so natural a product of our conditions and needs , that the fact of this double element in the state is very rarely recognized in actual experience . The governmental organization and the extra-governmental organization of the people work togeth*r generally with the most perfect harmony . And thus , though this extra-governmental organization is constantly in *action , it has failed to receive the attention it deserves as a most important and characteristic portion of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two main functions - one , the conservation of civil order in cases over which the authority of the regularly constituted government does not extend , or which it is incapable of dealing with by reason either of the absence or inefficiency of its ministers ; the other , the conservation of the government itself through agencies and expedients fitted to set it in motion and keep it in action . Vigilance committees and lynch courts , names of ill-regard because of the abuses to which they are liable , but in fact significative of the rude processes by which justice is administered , however imperfectly , in what may be called a border community , are perhaps time most striking instances of the first of these two functions . These courts and committees are emupowered by an authority which is no other than the moral sense of the community , and their work is to carry this moral sense or opinion into effect . The most obvious illustration of the second of these two functions - the conservation of the government itself - is afforded by primary meetings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the end of vigilance committees is to carry public opinion into effect , so the end of these meetings and conventions is to give form and direction to public opinion , is to combine that opinion so as to make it efficient and the basis of action . In all this work the government has no part ; it is wholly extra-governmental , or , so to speak , preliminary to government , a ixd is effected without interfering with , or , even in the most extreme cases , permanently impairing , such governmental authority as may have been truly instituted and established in the moral regard of the community . The difference between a mob and a vigilance committee is the difference between an assemblage for the purpose of overthrowing government and disturbing established order , and an assemblage for the purpose of supplying the need of government and of maintaining order . Where the government is fully established , the action of vigilance committees ceases ; but even where government is best and mo8t completely constituted , the extra-governmental organization of the community still exists , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain the regular procedures of the government . Like the government itself , the modes of its action are mere expedients , often clumsy and poor enough , but nevertheless it forms a most valuable part of our political system , as has been proved by many striking instances during the war , in which its operation has been constant , and in the highest degree important and beneficent . The constant interaction of the moral order of society and of the governmental order maintains our whole political system constantly ductile and pliable . It is thus enabled to fit itself to every new exigency , it is not averse to necessary change , it unites in itself the two elements of consistency and mutability . It is essentially a system of adaptation . No new condition arises which it has not the power to meet , and no progress is made in which it does not take part . A. government thus subject to change iii accordance with the needs and progress of the community , instead of being , as some political theorists have supposed , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly the reverse . A government founded on this idea is the most // favorable to the preservation of order , and , beyond all others , conservative alike of essential principles and of the institutions conformed to them . In devising better and better governmental expedients , the real object of the American is to bring the government into truer conformity to its principles . Ho never loses sight of the fact that government is only a device founded on expediency ; and he keeps in mind that it possesses no intrinsic rwht to exist , and that it is always subject to the arbitration of the popular right of revolution . The most vital fact of American politics , the great , and , historically considered , the new result that we have reached , is the establishment of a political system in which the government is subordinate to the moral order of a civilized community , - an order which rests on the acknowledgment of the rights of man , as expressed by the terms liberty , justice , and equality , and which is manifested and maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was because of their sense that these principles of moral order were called in question , and their predominance in our system enclangered , that the loyal portion of the American people was roused to the great efforts and sacrifices of the late war of the Rebellion . 1mm defence of these principles they fblt that no effort could be too great , no sacrifice could be extreme . Without them life was little worth having . 0mm their preservation depended all that was desirable or honorable iii our political system , all that had been gained by its establishment for the nation and for mankind . The war waged for their preservatiomi has giveim us a new sense of their worth , and a better understanding of the system of which they form the undisturbed amid enduring foundation . TIme excellence of that system , amid its adaptation to the wants of a progressive community , spring from the Ihet that the ideas which it embodies are primarily moral ideas , and as such incapable of being improved upomi , though capable of continually improved application in institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind in moral culture and intelligence . A moral idea never changes . It is time same yesterday , today , amid forever , and in every region of the providemmee of // God . The application of the moral idea changes with every new condition of human life . Political and social institutions founded upon moral ideas , so far as they are conformed to the ideal from which they spring , partake of its eternity ; they are human devices vivified by the Divine breath , human expedients drawing their strength from the principles on which the universe itself stands sure . In America politics are a nobler pursuit than elsewhere , because here alone is their moral origin so established , that the science of practical politics becomes the study of the application of ideal politics to human affairs . The investigation in which we have been engaged , though of an abstract nature , has a very direct bearing upon the questions in practical politics which are now before the country , - questions remaining after the sharp decisions of war , to try our virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own principles , with new tests . The conflict is not yet over . It can not be repeated too often , that this war was a war of ideas , and that , until one idea or the other has secured a settled triumph , there can be no real peace between the parties to the war . What the true American idea was , we have endeavored to show ; the opposite to this idea in every particular is that for which the South contended . And though the South has sullenly laid down its arms , beaten and dispirited , it has not laid down its hate . Its spirit is still set desperately against us . It still clings to and maintains the idea for which it fought so strenuously in the field . We have secured a territorial Union , we have secured a geographical unity of the States , but we have not secured as yet a moral Union , a civil unity ; we have the harder part of our task before us . Having faith in the American system , knowing that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advanced , - knowing it to be based upon moral principles of universal application , - we must not shrink from the conclusions to which our faith and knowledge lead us . In the struggle between this system and one vitally opposed to it at every point , we must use whatever means are necessary , not merely to subdue , but to destroy and utterly root out the hostile system . There is neither cruelty nor vindictiveness , neither malice nor passion , // 18G5 . American Political ideas . in this . It is not only the conclusion of the calm reason , but the dictate of conscience . It is the claim of humanity upon us . Future generations appeal to us , not to desert the cause which is theirs even mo ? e than ours . Let no weariness prevail with us , and no cry of magnanimity deceive us . There is no iieed to urge us to ma gnaniinity ; for in maintaining our cause , we are in truth consulting the interests of our enemies , and in winning its triumph we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoice . The North is civihzed , the South is uncivilized . One must take the likeness of the other . The interests of the strong civilized community must prevail ; and in this case the interests , being those of general moral order , carry a pre-eminent right with them . The community possesses the right over an individual , or over any number of individuals , to do whatever is necessary to protect or maintain its moral organization . The moral order of society , its general welfare , is the ol*ject of the Constitution of our government , and its inspirin* principle Principles , not forms , are the true guides of nations ; but happy it is when , as in our case , principles and forms are in liariiioixy with each other . Having power , we have also the right - and having the rio'ht , the duty lies upon us  --  to impose those conditions on the Southern people which are requisite for the preservation , continuance , and progress of the moral order of that community of which they and we form parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conditions of tyranny , but of liberty not of injustice , but of justice . We have to insist on the establishment of freedom , - freedom from servitude for the slaves , freedom of thought , conscience , speech , and the press for the whole community . We have to insist on justice under the law , on the controlled and regular processes of moral and legal organizations , omm the subjection of time passions of individuals , . on the steady admninistratiomi of equal laws . We have to insist on political equality for all men , on the removal of all arbitrary distinctions iii defining time political privileges of individuals , on a perfect equality of men in their relation to time community as members of its political organization . We have to insist on the right of every man to be equal to any other
