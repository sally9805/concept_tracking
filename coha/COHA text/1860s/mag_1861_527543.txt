txt THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE . THE modern world dimers from the world of antiquity in nothing more than in the existence of a brotherhood of nations , which was unknown to the ancients , who seem to have been incapable of understanding that it was impossible for either good or evil to be confined within certain limits . The attempts of the Persians to extend their dominion into Europe did for a time cause some faint approach to ideas and practicesthat are common to the moderns ; but , as a general rule , every monarchy or people had its own system , to which it adhered until it was worn out by internal decay , or was overthrown by foreign conquest . It was owing to this exclusiveness , and to the inability of ancient statesmen to work out an international system , that the Roinans were enabled to extend their dominion until it comprehended the best parts of the world . Had the rulers and peoples of Carthage , Macedonia , Greece , and Syr* in been capable of forming an alliance for // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been early checked , and her efforts have been necessarily confined to the North and the West . But no international system then existed , and the rude attempts at mutual assistance that were occasionally made , as the conquering race strode forward , were of no avail ; and the swords of thedegionaries reaped the whole field . It is singular that what is so well known to the moderns , and was known to them at times when they were far inferior to the best races of antiquity , should have remained unknown to the latter . The chief reason of this want of combining power in men who have never been surpassed in ability is to be found in the then prevailIng idea , that every stranger was an enemy . There was a total want of confidence in one another among the peoples of the ante-Christian period . Differences of race were augmented by differences in religion , and by the absence of strong business interests . Christianity had not been vouchsafed to man , and commerce ha&amp;very imperfectly done its work , while war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The modern world differs in this matter entirely from the ancient world ; and though the change is perfect only in Christendom , the effect of it is felt in countries where the Christian religion does not prevail , but into which Christian armies and Christian merchants have penetrated . Christendom is the leading portion of the world , and is fast givin law to lands in which Christianity is still hated . It is the policy of Christendom that orders the world . A Christian race rules over the whole of that immense country , or collection of countries , which is known as India . Another Christian race threatens to seize upon Persia . Christians from the extreme West of Europe have dictated the terms of treaties to the Tartar lords of China ; and Christians from America have led the way in breaking through the exclusive system of Japan . Christian soldiers have for a year past acted as the police of Syria , July , Christianity 's early home , but now held by the most bigoted and cruel of Mussulmans ; and it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spoil that prevents the five great powers of Europe - the representatives of the leading branches of the Christian religion-from partitioning the vast , but feeble Ottoman Empire . The Christian idea of man 's brotherhood , so powerful in itself , is supported by material forces so vast , and by ingenuity and industry so comprehensive and so various in themselves and their results , that it must supersede all others , and be accepted in every country where there are people capable of understanding it . From the time of the first Crusade there has been a steady tendency to the unity of Christian countries ; and notwithstanding all their conflicts with one another , and partly as one of the effects of those conflicts , they have " fraternized , " until now there exists a mighty Christian Commonwealth , the members of which ought to be able to govern the world in accordance with the principles of a religion that is in itself peace . Under the influence of these principles , the Christian nations , though not in equal degrees , have developed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has enlisted the material interests of men on the same side with the highest teachings of the purest religion . Selfishness and self-denial march under the same banner , and men are taught to do unto others as they would that others should do unto them , because the rule is as golden economically as it is morally . This teaching , however , it must be allowed , is very imperfectly done , and it encounters so many disturbing forces to its proper developmeat that an observer of the course of Christian nations might be pardoned , if lie were at times to suppose there is little of the spirit of Christianity in the ordering of the policy of Christendom , and also that the true nature of material interests is frequently misunderstood . Still , it is undeniable that there is a general bond of union in Christendom , and // that no part of that division of the world can be injured or improved without all the other parts of it being thereby affected . What is known as " the business world " exists everywhere , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in which its mightiest works are done It forms one community of mankind ; and what depresses or exalts one nation is felt by its effects in all nations . There can not be a Russian war , or a Sepoy mutiny , or an Anglo-French invasion of China , or an emancipation of the serfs of Russia , without the effect thereof being sensibly experienced on the shores of Superior or on the banks of the Sacramento ; and the civil war that is raging in the United States promises to produce permanent consequences to the inhabitants of Central India and of Central Africa . The wars , floods , plagues , and famines of the farthest East bear upon the people of the remotest West . The Oregon flows in sympathy with the Ganges ; and a very mild winter in New England might give additional value to the ice-crop of the Neva . So closely identified are all nations at this time , that the hope that there may be no scrious difficulties between the United States and the Western powers of Europe , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports of the Union , is based as much upon the prospect of the European food-crops being small this year as upon the sense of justice that may exist in the bosoms of the rulers of France and England . If those crops should prove to be of limited amount , peace could be counted upon ; if abundant , we might as well make ample preparation for a foreign war . Nations threatened with scarcity can not afford to begin war , though they may find themselves compelled to wage it . A cold season in Europe would be the best security that we could have that we shall not be vexed with European intervention in our troubles ; for then Europeans would desire to have the privilege of securing that portion of our food which should not be needed for homeconsumption . This is the fair side of the picture that is presented by the bond of nations . There is another side to the picture , which is far from being so agreeable to us , and which may be called the Cotton side ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of opinion that American cotton must be had , that our civil troubles threaten to bring upon us , if not a foreign war , at least grave disputes and difficulties with those European nations with which we are most desirous of remaining on the best of terms , and to secure the friendship of which all Americans are disposed to make every sacrifice that is compatible with the preservation of national honor . From the beginning of the troubles in this country that have led to civil war , the desire to know what course would be pursued by the principal nations of Europe toward the contending parties has been very strongly felt on both sides ; but the feeling has been greater on the side of the rebels than on that of the nation , because the rebellion has depended even for the merest chance of success upon the favorable view of European governments , and the nation has got beyond the point of caring much for the opinions or the actions of those governments . The Union 's existence depends not upon European friendship or enmity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Confederacy could not look for success , had it received twice the assistance it did from the Buchanan administration , and were it ormed of every Slaveholding State , with not a Union man in it to wound the susceptible minds of traitors by his presence . The belief among the friends of order was , that Europe would maintain a rigid neutrality , not so much from regard to this country as from disgust at the character of the Confederacy 's polity , and at the opinions avowed by its officers , its orators , and its journals , opinions which had been most forcibly illustrated in advance by acts of the grossest robbery . That any civilized nation should be willing to afford any countenance , and exclusively on grounds of interest , to a band of ruffians who avowed opinions that could // not now find open supporters in Bokhara or Barbary , was what the American people could not believe . Conscious that the Southern rebellion was utterly without provocation , and that it had been brought about by the arts of disappointed politicians , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rulers of every European state to whom their commissioners should apply either for recognition or for assistance . We knew the power of King Cotton was great , though much exaggerated in words by his servile subjects ; but we did not , because we could not , believe that he was able to control the policy of old empires , to subvert the principle of honor upon which aristocracies profess to rely as their chief support , and to turn whole nations from the roads in which they had been accustomed to travel . That Cotton has done this we do not assert ; but it has done not a little to show how feeble is the regard of certain classes in Europe for morality , when adherence to principle may possibly cause them some trouble , and perhaps lead to some loss . If the Southern plant has not become the tyrant of Europe , as for a long time it was of America , it has certainly done much in a brief time to unsettle Englifh opinion , and to convert the Abolitionists of Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire in the annual interest of one hundred million dollars in order that the slavery of the blacks in that empire might come to an end , into the supporters of American slavery , and of its extension over this continent , which might be made into a Cotton paradise , if the supply of negroes from Africa should not be interrupted ; and the logical conclusion from the position laid down by Lord John Russell is , that the slave-trade must be revived , as that is what his " belligerent " friends of the Southern Confederacy are contending for . The American people had lone , been taunted by the English with their subserviency to the slaveholding interest , and with their readiness to sacrifice the welfare of a weak and wronged race on the altars of Mainmon . Whether these taunts were well deserved by us , we shall not stop to inquire ; but it is the most melancholy of facts , that , no sooner have we given the best evidence which it is in our power to give of our determiiiation to confine slavery within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuse of our Government 's power by the slaveholders , than the Government of Great Britain , acting as the agent and representative of the British nation , places itself directly across our path , and prepares to tell us to stay our hand , and not dare to meddle with the institution of slavery , because from the success of that institution proceeds cotton , and upon the supply of cotton not being interfered with depend the welfare and the strength of the liberty-and-order loving and morality-and-religion worshipping race ! So far as they have dared to do it , the British ministers have placed their country on the side of those men who have revolted in America because they saw that they could no longer make use of slavery to misgovern the Union ; and we must wait to see bow far they are to be supported by the opinion of that country , before a distinction can be made between the ministers and the people . Left to themselves , and unbiased by any of those selfish motives that go to make up the sum of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in the proportion of ten to one , would decide in behalf of the supporters of freedom in this country ; but we are by no means so sure that the ministers would not be sustained , were they to plunge their country into a third American War , and sustained , too , in sending fleets to raise our blockade of the American coast of Africa , and armies to fight the battles of Slavery in Virginia and the Carolinas , where British officers stole negroes eighty years ago , and sent them to the West India markets , and found that that kind of commerce flourished well in war . A war for the maintenance of American slavery , and to secure for slaveholders the full and perfect enjoyment of all the " rights " of their " peculiar " property , would be no worse // than was the war which was waged against our ancestors of the Revolution , or than those wars which were carried on against Republican and Imperial France , ostensibly for the preservation of order , hut really for the restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologist on earth . There is often a wide distinction to he made between a nation and its government , as our own recent history hut too deplorably proves ; and the men who govern England may he enabled to do that now which has more than once been done by their predecessors , array their country in support of evil against that country 's sense and wishes . We should he prepared for this , and should look the evil that threatens us fairly in the face , as the first thing to be done to prevent it from getting beyond the threateningpoint . The words of Sir Boyle Roche , that the best way to avoid danger is to meet it plump , are strikingly applicable to our condition . If we would not have a foreign war on our hands before we shall have settled with the rebels , we should make it very clear to foreigners that to fight with ns would be a sort of husiness that would be sure not to pay . That war may follow from the course which England has elected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear a strange view of affairs to those who know something of the history of Great Britain and the United States in the early part of this century . That which the British Government is now doing bears strong resemblance to the course which the same Government , with different ministers , pursued toward the United States during the war with Napoleon I. , and which led to the contest of 1812 ,  --  a contest which Franklin had predicted , and which he said would be our War of Independence , as that of 1775-83 had been our War of Revolution . The same ignorance of America , an ( l the same disposition to insult , to annoy , and to injure Americans , that were so common under the ministries of Pitt , Portland , and Perceval , and which move both our mirth and our indignation when we read of them long after the tormentors and the tormented have gone to their last repose , are exhibited by the Palmerston Ministry ,  --  though it is but justice to Lord Palmerston to say , that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . England treats us as she would not dare to treat any European power , making an exception in our case to her general policy , which has been , since 1815 , to truckle before her contemporaries . She has crouched before France repeatedly , when she had much better ground for fighting her than she now has for taking preliminary steps to fight us . We are not entitled to the same treatment that she thinks is due to the nations of the continent of Europe . She can not rid herself of the feeling that we still are colonists , and that the rules which apply to her intercourse with old nations can not apply to her intercourse with us , the United States having been a portion of the British Empire within the recollection of persons yet living . No sooner , therefore , had a state of things arisen here that seemed to warrant a renewal of the insulting treatment that was a thing of course in 1807 , than we were made to see how hollow were those professions of friendship for America that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or twelve years that preceded the advent of Secession . So long as we were deemed powerful , we received assurances of " the most distinguished consideration " ; but we have at last ascertained that those assurances were as false as they are when they are appended to the letter of some diplomatist who is engaged in the work of cheating some one who is neither better nor worse than himself . It is positively mortifying to think how shockingly we have been taken in , and that the " cordial understanding " that had , apparently , been growing up between the two nations was a misunderstanding throughout , though we were sincere in desirin* , its existence . Perhaps , when the evidences of the strength that we possess , in spite of Secession , shall have all been placed before the rulers of // England , they will be found less ready to quarrel with the American people than they were a month ago . A nation that is capable of placing a quarter of a million of men in the field in sixty days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consistency and organization , is worth being conciliated after having been insulted . But would any amount of conciliation suffice to restore the feeling that existed here when the Prince of Wales was our guest ? We fear that it would not , and that for some years to come the sentiment in America toward Englaud will be as hostile as it was in the last generation , when it was in the power of any politician to make political capital by assailing the mother-land . The belief is created that England in her heart hates us as profoundly as ever she did , that the forty-six years ' peace has produced no change in her feeling with respect to us , and that she is watching ever for an opportunity to gratify the grudge of which we are the object . Practically it will matter very little whether this belief shall be well founded or not , so long as English ministers , whether from want of judgment or from any other cause , shall omit no occasion for the insulting and annoying of the United States . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful nation is in itself a fact of the first importance , no matter whether it be founded in truth or not ; and if the blundering of another powerful nation shall help to maintain that opinion , that nation would have no right to complain of any consequences that should follow from its inability to comprehend the condition of its neighbor . This country will not submit to the degradation which England would inflict upon it , and which no other European nation appears inclined to aid the insular empire in inflicting . Even Spain , proverbially foolish in her foreign policy , and seemingly unable to get within a hundred years of the present time , observes a decorum in the premises to which Great Britain is a stranger . The manner of proceeding on the part of the British Government , and the arguments which have been put forward in justification of its pro-slavery policy , are serious aggravations of its original offence . The first declaration of Lord John Russell , Secretary of State for Forei* , n Affairs , was to the effect that England would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lord Wodehouse , Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ) was even more emphatic than his chief in speaking to the same purpose . Suddenly , the Foreign Secretary turned about , with a facility and promptness for which men had not been prepared even by his rapid changes on the questions of the Russian War and Italian Nationality , and said that the Southern Confederacy would be recognized as a belligerent , which is , to all intents and purposes of a practical character , the same thing as acknowledging it to be a nation . l*That was the cause of this sudden change ? We have only to look at the dates of the events that followed the fall of Fort Sumter to find an answer . Lord John Russell believed that the capital of the United States had fallen into the hands of the rebels , and he was anxious to please the masters of the cotton-fields by showing them that he had not waited to hear of their victory to behold their virtues . There was some excuse for his belief that the raid upon Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was but too much reason for supposing that that city was in serious danger of becoming the prey of the Confederates , who might have taken it , if they had been half as forward in their preparations for war as they were supposed to have been by the chiefs of the British Government . But this belief that the rebels had delivered an effective blow at the Union only places the meanness of Lord John Russell and his associates in a worse light than we could view it in , if they had acted solely upon principle . Their political opinions had pledged them to oppose the principles of the Secessionists ; but they were in a hurry to give all the support they // could to those principles , because they had come to the conclusion that victory was to be with the Secessionists . They desircd to appropriate the merit of being the first of European statesmen to welcome the destroyers of the American Union into the family of nations . Had the event justified their expectations , they would have gained much by their action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been disposed to accord to the allies of American pirates . The Royal Proclamation of May 13th , in which the neutrality of England is peremptorily laid down , and all British subjects are forbidden to take any part in the war " between the Government of the United States of America and certain States calling themselves the Confederate States of America , " is a paper in many respects most offensive to the people of this country , though probably it was better in its intention than it is in its execution . That part of it which most concerns us is the recognition of " any blockade lawfully and actually established by or on behalf of either of the said contending parties . " It is important to us that the British Government has admitted our right to blockade the ports of the rebels , provided we shall do so in force ; and though Lord Derhy has exhibited his ignorance of our naval power by saying that we can not enforce the blockade we have declared and instituted , we shall show to the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are fully up to the work that is demanded of us , by having at least one hundred vessels , strongly armed and well manned , employed in watching every part of the Southern coast to which any foreign ship would think of going with a cargo or for the purpose of receiving one . The naval strength of the Union is as capable of vast and effective development as its military strength ; and there is no reason why we should not have afloat , and ready for action , by the beginning of autumn , fleets sufficient to close up the Confeder ate ports as thoroughly as the Allies closed those of Russia in 1854-6 , and the advanced guard of other fleets to be made ready to contend with the forces that insolent foreign nations may send into the waters of America for the purpose of fighting the battles of the slaveholders . With the single cxception of the admission of the right of blockade , the Royal Proclamation is unfriendly to the United States . It admits the right of the Confederacy 's Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American ships captured by cruisers of the rebels could be taken into English ports , and there sold , after having been condemned by prize courts sitting at any one of the places belonging to the Confederacy . This is no light aid to the pirates ; for there are English ports on every sea , and on almost every one of the ocean 's tributaries . Vessels belonging to America , and captured by the Confederacy 's privateers in the Mediterranean , could be taken into Gibraltar , into Valetta , and into Corfu , all of which are English ports . Those captured in the Mexican Gulf and the Caribbean could be sent into any one of the many ports that belong to England in the West Indies . If captured in the North Atlantic , or the Baltic , or any other of the waters of Northern Europe , they could be sent into the ports of England , Scotland , Wales , and Ireland . In the South Atlantic are St. Helena and Cape Town , which would afford shelter to Mr. Davis s privateers and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Aden to the last places wrested from the Chinese , and they would be all open to the enterprise of the Confederacy 's cruisers . In the Pacific are the English harbors on the Northwest Coast ; and in Australia there are British ports that ought , considering their origin , to be particularly friendly to men who should enter the navy of the Secessionists . England has in advance provided places for the transaction of all the business that shall be necessary to render privateering profitable to the " lawless brood " of the // whole world . Into all of her thousand seaports could the lucky Confederates go , and dispose of their captures , just as the old Buccaneers used to sell their prizes in the ports of the English colonies . Nor could all the efforts of all the navies of the world prevent privateers from preying upon our commerce , as they are to he commissioned in foreign countries , and will sail from the ports of those countries . The East Indian seas , the Levant , and the Caribbean are the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which England is disposed to afford to piracy , for the especial benefit of Slavery , the buccaneering business could not fail to flourish exceedingly . True , our Government would not allow privateers to be fitted out in our ports , during the Russian War , to prey upon the commerce of France and England ; but what of that ? One good turn does not deserve another , according to the public morality of nations so orderly and pious as are England and France . According to the Royal Proclamation , the blockade of any one of the Northern ports by one of the ships of the Secessionists would be as lawful an act as the blockade of Charleston by a dozen of the Union 's cruisers ; and England allows that a privateer from Pensacola could seize an English ship that should be engaged in bringing arms to New York or Philadelphia . Thus are the two " parties " to the war placed on the same footing by the decision of the English Government , though the one party is a nation having treaties with England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is only a band of conspirators , who have established their power through the institution of a system of terror , much after the fashion of Monsieur Robespierre and his associates , whose conduct was so offensive to all Britons seven-and-sixty **ears ago . But Montgomery is much farther from England than Paris , and the French had no cotton to tempt the British statesmen of 1793-4 to strike an account between manufacturing and morality . Distance and time appear to have united their powers to make things appear fair in the eyes of Russell that were inexpressibly horrible to those of " the monster Pitt . " The Royal Proclamation forbids Englishinen affording the Union assistance in any way . No British gunmaker can sell us a weapon , no English merchant can use one of his ships to send us the cannon and rifles we have purchased in his country , and no English subject of any degree can lawfully carry a despatch for our Government . Never was there a more forbidding state-paper put forth and the arid language of the Proclamation is rendered doubly disagreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are placed by its terms on the level of the men of Montgomery , who must be vastly pleased to see that they are held in as much esteem in England as are the constitutional authorities of the United States . If we were to seek for a contrast to this extraordinary document , we should find it in the proclamation put forth by our own Government at the time of the " Canadian Rebellion , " and in which it was not sought to convey the impression that we had the right to regard rebels and loyalists as men entitled to the same treatment at our hands . It is a source of pride to Americans , that nothing in their own history can be quoted in justification of the cold-blooded conduct of the British Government . It has been sought to defend the action of England by referring to precedents . We are reminded by Lord John Russell of the acknowledgment o , f the Greeks as belligerents by England ; and others have pointed to her acknowledgment of the Belgians , and of those Spanish - Americans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not go into an extended examination of these precedents , for the purpose of showing that they do not apply to the present case but we may say , and an examination into the facts will be found to justify our assertion , that England was in no such hurry to acknowledge the Greeks , the Bel // gians , and the Spanish-Americans as she has been to acknowledge the Secessionists . Years elapsed after the beginning of the struggle in Greece before the English Government professed to regard the parties to that memorable conflict even with in ( lifference . The British historian of the Greek Revolution , writing of the year 1821 , says ,  --  " Among the European Governments , England was probably , next to Austria , the one most hostile to Greece at that period , when her foreign policy was guided hy a spirit akin to that of Metternich ; the hired organs of Ministry were loud in defence of Islam , and gall dropped from their pens on the Christian cause . " And when , some years later , England did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was less to prevent the Greeks from falling into the hands of the Turks than to prevent the Turks from falling into the hands of the Russians . Another object she had in view was the suppression of that horrible piracy which then raged in the Hellenic seas . She was then as anxious to suppress piracy hecause it was injurious to her commerce , as , apparently , she is now anxious to promote it because its existence would be injurious to our commerce . The famous Treaty of ' London , made in 1827 , the parties to which were Russia , France , and England , was justified on the ground of " the necessity of putting an end to the sanguinary contest which , by delivering up the Greek provinces and the isles of the Archipelago to the disorders of anarchy , produces daily fresh impediments to the commerce of the European states , and gives occasion to piracies which not only expose the subjects of the contracting powers to considerable losses , but render necessary burdensome measures of suppression and protection . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council decreed that " the British ships in the Mediterranean should seize every vessel they saw under the Greek flag , or armed and fitted out at a Greek port , except such as were under the immediate orders of the Greek Government . " The object of this strong measure was the suppression of piracy . Thus England had to interfere to put down the Greek pirates ; and if she means to insist upon there being any resemblance between the case of the Greeks and that of the Secessionists , ( President Lincoln to appear as the Grand Turk , or Sultan Mahmoud II. , the destroyer of the Janizarics , ) we should not object , so far as relates to the finale of the piece , which is very likely , through her most injudicious action , to produce a large crop of Sehims and Abdallabs , by whom any amount of sea-roving will be done , but as much at Britain 's expense as at ours . The case of Belgium is not at all to the point , the Dutch being by no means anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holland and Belgium had been formally united , should be continued , though the House of Orange was averse to the loss of so much of its dominions . The disputes that followed the expulsion of the Dutch from Belgium were about details , and the whole matter was finally settled by the action of the Great Powers , and England was not then in a condition to decide it , had it been left for her decision . The makers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands destroyed their own work , after it had been found to be a bad job , and had had fifteen years and upward of fair trial . England had no choice in the matter , - especially as the effect of determined opposition on her part would have thrown Belgium into the arms of France , and have brought about a French war , which would have extended to the whole of Europe , with the revolutionists in every country for the allies of France . Louis Philippe either would have been overthrown very speedily after his elevation , or he would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bonnet rouge above it . That England recognized the SpanishAmericans is true but why did she recognize them ? Because she had to choose between doing that and allowing the holy Alliance to enter upon the reconquest of the . Spanish colonies . Mr. Canning declared that he had called a new world // into existence to redress the balance of the old , - and that , if France , as the tool of the Holy Alliance , should have Spain , it should not be " Spain with the Indies . " This was in 1823 , though it was not until 1826 that Mr. Canning made use of the language quoted ; and so serious was the matter , that our country was prepared to make common cause with England in resisting the interference of the Allies and their dependants in the affairs of Spanish-America . The question was one which did not relate to English interests alone , but concerned those of the whole world ; and it was not decided with reference to the interests of any one country , but after it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of Christendom . England had to choose between diplomatic resistance to the Continental Powers and the support of a policy which she could not adopt without degrading herself . Naturally she elected to resist , and she did so with success . The Spanish- American countries , however , w ere freed from the rule of Spain long before she recognized them , and Spain had not the means of subduing them . England , therefore , did not acknowledge them as against Spain , but as against France , and in opposition to the Holy Alliance , the decrees of which France was engaged in enforcing at the expense of the Spanish Constitutionalists , and which process of enforcement the French Government was prepared to extend to Peru and Mexico , and to the whole of that part of America which had belonged to the Spanish Bourbons . Mr. Canning 's conduct was statesmanlike , but it was also spiteful ; and had England been in the condition to send sixty thousand men to Spain , probably the recognition of the independence of SpanishAmerica would have been much long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a mighty enemy , and he delivered it skilfully at that enemy 's only exposed point , where it told at once , and where it is telling to this day . But his action affords no precedent to the present rulers of England for the treatment of our case , for he mov ed not until after the colonies had achieved their independence . iNow the British Government proclaims its purpose to acknowledge the Southern Confederacy in less than a month after the beginning of the attack on Fort Sumter , and in about a week after it had heard of the fall of that ill-used fortress ! Is there not some difference between the two cases ? England did not admit the Poles to the honors she has allowed to the American Secessionists , after their revolt from the Czar , in 1830-31 , though their cause was popular in that country , and they had achieved such successes over the Russian armies as the Secessionists have not won over the armies of the Union . Neither did she acknowledge the Hungarians , in 1849 , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved but for the intervention of Russia . It was not for her interest that Austria should be weakened . Is it for her interest that the United States should be weakened ? Is it the purpose of her Government to give our rebels encouragement , step by step , in order that the American nation may be thrown back to the place it held twenty years ago ? The Cottonocracy of England , and those who for reasons of political interest support them , proceed erroneously , we think , when they assume that American cotton is the chief necessary of English life , and that without a full supply of it there must ensue great suffering throughout the British Empire . That it would he better for England to receive her cotton without interruption may be admitted , without its following that she must be ruined if there should he a discontinuance of the American cotton-trade . Men are so accustomed to think that that which is must ever continue to be , or all will be lost , that it is not surprising that British manufacturers should suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite ready to innovate on the British Constitution , because in that way they hope to obtain political power , and to injure the landed aristocracy ; but the idea of change in modes of business strikes them with // Washington as a Camp . terror , and hence all their wonted sagacity is now at fault . Lancashire is to become a Sahara , because President Lincoln , in accordance with the demands of twenty million Americans , proclaims the ports of the rebels under blockade , and enforces that blockade with a fleet quite sufficient to satisfy even Lord John Russell 's notions as to effectiveness . We have never believed , and we do not now believe , that it is in the power of any part of America thus to control the condition of England . We would not have it so , if we could , as we are sure that the power would be abused . If America really possessed the ability to rule England that her cotton-manufacturers assert she possesses , all Englishmen should rejoice that events have occurred here that promise to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is not so , and England will survive the event of our conflict , no matter what that event may be . The nation that triumphed over the Continental System of Napoleon , and which was not injured by our Embargo Acts of fifty years ago , should be ashamed to lay so much stress upon the value of our cotton - crop , when it has its choice of the lands of the tropics from which to draw the raw material it requires . As to France , it would be most impolitic in her to seek our destruction , unless she wishes to see the restoration of England 's maritime supremacy . The French navy , great and powerful as it now is , can be regarded only as the result of a skilful and most costly forcing process , carried on by Bourbons , Orl*anists , Republicans , and Imperialists , during forty-six years of maritime peace . It could not be maintained against the attacks of England , which is a naval country by position and interest . We never could be the rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw our weight on her side in a maritime war ; and while our policy would never allow of our having a very large navy in time of peace , we have in abundance all the elements of naval power . Nor should England be indifferent to the aid which we could afford her , were she to be assailed by the principal nations of Continental Europe . Strike the American Union out of the list of the nations , or cause it to be sensibly weakened , or treat it so as to revive in force the old American hatred of England , and it is possible that the predictions of those who see in Napoleon III . only the Avenger of Napoleon I. may be justified by the event .
