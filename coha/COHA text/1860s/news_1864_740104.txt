txt I had a very pleasant and satisfactory trip , yesterday , to Aiken 's Landing , three or four miles above Deep Bottom . Dr. Amax . MCDONALD , the efficient head of the United States Sanitary Commission here , having heard that a large number of our naval officers and men , returned prisoners from the rebel prisons , were at the above-named landing , and in want of many comforts , both of food and clothing , at once determined to go to their relief , and was kind enough to let me accompany him . At 9:30 A. M. , within one hour of the intelligence first reaching him , the little boat Gov . Curtin , like an angel of mercy , was cleaving her swift way up the placid surface of the James , manned by a sufficient number of assistants , and loaded with blankets , shirts , drawers , stockings , shoes , wine , spirits , preserves , milk and every conceivable good thing , many of which some of the roor fellows had not tasted or used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we reached the spot , was one of the most soul-stirring 1 et er witnessed . There were some MO prisoners in all . As we came alongside of the vessel containing them , they mounted the upper deck , and loud and repeated cheers rent the air . Suddenly we saw the rigging of the adjoining gunboats being manned , like bees swarming about hives , and , one after another , the gallant bull-dogs rang out such lusty cheers of welcome to their comrades as have seldom wakened up the sleepy echoes of the James . As a sort of bass accompaniment to the glorious music of a thousand loyal throats , came booming , ever's. now and then . the deep majestic roar of some shell just shot from one or other of our boats further ilD the river , and sometimes bursting in the air in little ball ion-shaped puffs of white smoke . One of my first efforts , on getting among the gallant fellows over whose release we were rejoicing , was to use my limited time In getting as many names as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading among a large number of circles of families and friends . I did not succeed in getting as many as I wished , but such as I could obtain .1 have sent you . I also got another complete list of the names of the men of the Fifty-first New-York State Volunteers , who were captured on the 30th of September , and who are all now in the prisons of Richmond . I thought the publication of such a list might relieve many an anxious heart at home ; for , doubtless , menu may to this hour be looking upon loved ones as lost forever who are still living . The story I obtained from these prisoners , In general , was nothing but a repetition ? I ** and prieatione which have , Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . been so often published , to the disgust and indignation of every good and humane mind , no matter what its shade of political opinion . Even allowing that the rebel authorities are compelled , from lack of food and material for themselves , to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should command  --  a thing not easy to believe , when we see the stalwart fellows that come into our hands from their own ranks  --  what sort of excuse can be made for the too well-authenticated fact that the scoundrels devote to their own use the aid sent from borne to our suffering men 7 This damning fact has been repeated to me so often , in so many different shapes , and by gentlemen so evidently incapable of willfully falsifying , that it is quite impossible to discredit it . One of them , however . while descanting upon this and other shameful acts of the Confederate Janissaries , begged me to state , as a matter of justice , that the treatment awarded to our prisoners in Columbia , 8 . C .. is in marked contrast to the roughness and brutality practiced in other prisons of the Confederacy , I am glad to fulfill the request , in the hope that Columbia may shame some other places into an observance of a little of the rules of civilized warfare . As a bona fide proof of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which may be considered downright luxury in comparison with what they undergo elsewhere , here is a list of Libby rations which Lieut . S. W. PRESTON allowed me to copy from his pocket-book , and this , mind you , is the living of an officer : 1 ) g pounds corn meal per day , varied occasionally with as much flour , instead of the corn meal ; rice , 13e ounces per day ; salt , 36 ounce do . ; soap , le ounce every twenty days ; molasses , 134 gills ; tobacco , 6 ounces every ten days . N. B. ? The two last luxuries are administered when there is no damaged porK to be had . I saw in the hands of two or three a chunk of the corn-bread which they were taking home as a show . In quantity it was no more than a very young child might require to sustain life , and in quality , it was as heavy as clay , and seemed as if nothing but an ostrich could digest it . One man also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize-fighter 's fist , for which he paid a dollar , and which , I suppose , he is going to put in a glass case . It is certainly worth it . One thing I was extremely glad to hear from these gentlemen , and that is , that the miserable rascals known among us as " bounty-jumpers , " and who tempted by the wily promises of JEFF . Davis  --  desert from our armies , for the purpose of getting back into our lines again and reenlisting , to get more bounty money , have a pretty hard road to travel . As soon as they get into the dominions of King JEFF. , instead of finding him graciously sending them to where they can easily escape and get back among us , he puts them to hard labor in the trenches . Although this does not speak very well for JEFF 'S character , every good man will rejoice at his sticking , in this instance , to his doctrine of repudiation ; for if there is one man who demoralizes the army and deserves hanging more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch who enlists in the army merely for the purpose of obtaining the bounty , and then betrays his colors to go and repeat his rascality . I send you a copy of the Richmond Examiner , Sentinel and Dispatch , of yesterday . They have nothing of especial importance , but are full of interesting and amusing matter as usual , particularly in their onslaughts upon " Beast Butler , " and in their joyful comments upon the certainty of Mr. LiticoLN 's reelection . If any one in the North is still doubting the genuineness of Jsrr.Devite famous Macon speech , first published in the TIRES , these Dithers seem , at any rate , quite eatished about it . " The speech , " says the Examiner , " which President Davis , so unfortunately for the cause of the South , made at Macon , is giving the Yankees great comfort . " The Sentinel also says : " As might be expected , the Yankee Dress is universally occupied by President Darla ' regretable speech at Macon . They all republish it , and make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a long article calling upon the authorities to look after feeding the people of Richmond as well as the army , makes this remarkable confession : " Flour and corn are harder to be obtained here , in adequate quantities , than they are in many alpine towns , where the only approach is by a mule path . Hence , they command enormous prices ; and hence the news goes out that Richmond , which has for time immemorial set the markets of Virginia , values three or four hundred dollars as but the fair equivalent for a barrel of flour , and other things in proportion . Is it a wonder that our currency depreciates ? " should think not . I presume that our prisoners having been at last sent from Richer ond , the grand exchange will take place to-day . We have had our quid pro quo , the rebel prisoners , ready and waiting here for nearly a fortnight .
