txt ART . II . - Astronomical Observations made at the United States Naval Observatory , Washington , during the Years 1845 to 1852 , and 1861 to 1864. 10 vols. 4to . THE Naval Observatory at Washington , more generally known as the National Observatory , was founded by authority of an act of Congress passed in 1842 . In this act it was designated as " A Depot of Charts and Instruments for the Navy , " the name Astronomical Observatory being omitted , on account , it is said , of the repugnance of the dominant party to openly gratify the long-cherished desire of John Quincy Adams to see such an establishment . However , everybody knew that an astronomical observatory was meant , and measures were forthwith taken to found one of the first class . Lieutenant James // M. Gilliss was authorized to prepare plans for the building , and went to Europe to consult astronomers , and to purchase the necessary instruments . In 1844 he reported the building completed , the instruments mounted , and everything ready to begin work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder of the establishment being quietly set aside . Under Maury astronomical calculations were commenced in the beginning of 1845 . In reviewing our national astronomy , we shall confine ourselves to the Naval Observatory , because it is the only observatory in the country which has the means to make and publish a continuous series of astronomical observations , having for their object , not the immediate discovery of the unknown , but the development and application of the known . The former is , indeed , the more brilliant object , but an attempt to attaiii it by a government establishment with salaried officers would be pretty sure to cost more than the discoveries would be worth . But when a discovery is made anywhere in the , world , it has generally to be followed up and elaborated before it can be made useful to mankind . Here comes in the hard work which the world does not see , and here the great majority of our observatories fail . When an observatory is built , furnished with the largest telescope that can be procured , and placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its friends look upon the work as complete , and expect the machinery to run on without further attention . But two things are still necessary before the establishment will serve any purpose higher than the amusement of the publics They are ,  - -  First , the means of publishing the observations of the astronomer , and the researches to which they may give rise . Cautious and critical to the last degree , modern science has its laws of evidence as strict as those of a court of justice , and accepts of no conclusion without a rigorous examination of the data on which it rests . Hence , without the means to publish his observations , the results of the astronomer 's labor will be received with little respect . The other essential is the responsibility of the astronomer for the best use of the means put into his hands . In astron // omy it is very difficult to do really good work of any kind , but very easy to do poor work . Only a small part of the world can judge between the easiest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . Thus one great stimulus to excellence , that of knowing that one 's work is critically and correctly judged by those in whose favorable opinion he has a personal interest , is wanting . The state of society , therefore , does not admit of this requisite being fully satisfied . It can be partially satisfied by the supporters and patrons of each observatory taking an immediate personal interest in its current operations , and calling on the astronomers for the results of their labors . These needs have been so seldom supplied in our own , or , indeed , in any other country , that only a small fraction of the established observatories have ever made any important contributions to astronomy . Take out the Naval Observatory and that of Harvard College , and the entire work of all others in this country might be blotted out of existence without serious loss to astronomy . It is to establishments founded and maintained by enlightened governments that great advances in astronomical knowledge have been due in times past , and will be due in future . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those improvements in astronomical science which demand regular and continuous observation . For the first four or five years the Observatory did as well as could be expected under the circumstances . There were not more than one Or two astronomers by profession in the country . Outside of the navy there was little enthusiasm for astronomy . It was mainly through the exertions of enlightened officers of the navy that the establishment had been founded . One of its principal objects was the training of young officers , and it was to them that the country had to look to carry it on . It was therefore provided by law that the Superintendent should be a captain , commander , or lieutenant in the navy . Lieutenant Maury was by no means well fitted for the post . In native ability he had few superiors , but he lacked education and dignity of character . Of the contemporary state of astronomical science he knew almost nothing , and he had little of // the pure ambition of a man devoted to scientific investigation for the sake of the increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and executive energy were used with no higher motive than that of seeing his name in the morning papers , and receiving the applause of the multitude . When astronomy failed to serve these ends , he abandoned it , and exacted nothing of his astronomical corps except that they should not trouble him . That the Observatory did anything for science was due less to the Superintendent than to two of his assistants . These were Sears Cook Walker , the first practical astronomer in the country , whose position of Assistant Astronomer was the only civil office in the astronomical corps ; and Professor John II . C. Coffin of the navy , who had been the assistant of Gilliss in mounting the instruments . With these men , the observations were made with a precision exceeded nowhere in the world , except at Pulkowa . Nor was the activity of the astronomers confined to the routine of astronomical observation . The Observatory was first brought into prominence by Walker 's researches on the newly discovered great planet of be Verrier , and his proof that the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago as 1795 . The ambition of the Superintendent was not to be satisfied by any common achievement , so a very great work was soon planned . This was nothing less than assigning color , accurate position , and magnitude to every star in the heavens which could be seen with the instruments , - a noble work , and one which would have made the institution immortal had it been carried out . Unfortunately , a century would have been required to complete the work . So the entire plan ended in ignominious failure , and the credit has since been snatched by a Eiiiropean observatory , the Superintendent of which calculated beforehand what he could do with the means at his disposal . He found that by fifteen years ' labor he could determine the magnitude and approximate position of every star in the northern hemisphere as bright as the ninth magnitude , and he did it . Both Messrs . Walker and Coffin knew much more than Maury about practical astronomy . With some men this superiority in his assistants would have been a precious advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of the latter class , and so got rid of Walker at an early day . In 1851 Professor Coffiti was also obliged to leave on account of his eyes , which were permanently injured by his labors , and the Observatory practically ceased to have an astronomical head . Maury found a wider field for his ambition and a more fertile source of popular applause in his investigations of the winds and currents of the ocean , and astronomical observation ceased to be pursued with any definite end . Walker 's place was ultimately filled by Mr. James Ferguson , formerly assistant on the Coast Survey . Mr. Ferguson took charge of the Equatorial , and made a series of observations on asteroids and comets , the results of which , published from time to time in the Astronomical Journals of Gould and Schumacher , were almost the only indications the astronomical world saw of the continued existence of the Observatory . A valuable series of observations was made by Professor Yarnall with the Mural Circle , but none of them have yet been published . Indeed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maury took no interest in the astronomical work of the establishment . On this fortunate event , the Observatory fell once more into the hands of Gilliss , its original founder . The war for the Union now demanded the exertions of this as well as other government establishments , for its duties included the purchase , care , supervision , and distribution of all the charts , chronometers , spyglasses , compasses , and other nautical instruments used by the navy . These duties were greatly increased by the war , while the naval force of the Observatory was diminished by the same cause . To carry on both the scientific and military duties of the establishment , the Superintendent attached three more civil assistants , called " Aids , " to the astronomical staff . Under his energetic administration , the war , instead of impeding the scientific work of the establishment , was the means of renewing its activity . Still , a permanent organization and arrangement of the work of the establishment were not possible during the war . Before its close Gilliss died , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gilliss was succeeded by Rear-Admiral Charles H. Davis , // Chief of the Bureau of Navigation , who resigned that position to accept the officially subordinate one of Superintendent of the Observatory . The choice was a most happy one for the Observatory , as the new Superintendent knew how to avail himself to the best advantage of the practical skill of the astronomers attached to his staff . From his last Annual Report , he would seem to have put the work into a form nearer approaching permanency than ever before ; and if the investigations reported in progress are properly carried out , they will tend greatly to elevate the character of the establishment . The exigencies of the naval service brought the superintendence of Admiral Davis to a close early in the present year . He was ordered to command the Brazilian squadron , and Commodore B. F. Sands was appointed Superintendent of the Observatory . Commodore Sands was attached to the Observatory at an early period of its history , having accompanied Maury from the old Hydrographical Office when he was appointed to the new establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Observatory is , in its official relations with the government , under the immediate supervision of the Bureau of Navigation , of which Commodore Thornton A. Jenkins is chief . The laP ter has been well known as Secretary of the Light-House Board from its organization until 1860 . The personal and intellectual character of these officers leaves no doubt that good use will be made of the means at the disposal of the Observatory . The published Washington Observations are nearly all made with four large instruments , - the Transit Instrument , the Mural Circle , the Prime Vertical Transit , and the Equatorial . Each volume opens with a short description of the Observatory and instruments , and a very detailed explanation of the methods adopted foil making and reducing the observations . Astronomers of other countries and of future generations can thus reproduce all the results of the observations , and satisfy themselves of their correctness almost as easily as if they had made them themselves . The observations are then given in tabular arrangements , commencing with the Transit Instrument . With this instrument are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the most important element of their position . The observations of the Moon made with this instrument since 1861 exceed in number , regularity , and precision those made at any other observatory . The same remark may apply to some of the planetary observations . The Mural Circle gives declinations of the bodies observed . The right ascension and declination combined completely fix the apparent position of a body in the heavens . The Prime Vertical Transit is an instrument of peculiar construction , which gives with great precision the time of a star 's passage through the east and west points of its course , and thence its declination . Since 1862 this instrument has been employed on the bright star a Lyra3 , apparently with the view of determining its annual parallax . We regret that more use is not made of this exquisite instrument , as its results are of the highest order of precision . The Equatorial Telescope is principally used in determining the positions of asteroids and comets too faint to be observed with the meridian instruments . Next , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed , and the observed positions of the planets compared with the best tables , in order to furnish data for perfecting the latter . A catalogue of the positions of all the stars observed concludes the astronomical portion of the volume . It will be seen that pretty good use is made of the means at the disposal of the Observatory . Still , the establishment has not attained that pre-eminence which the intellectual character of our country should demand for a national scientific institution . To the highest departments of practical astronomy America has contributed almost nothing . For the most delicate determinations we are indebted almost entirely to Europeans . Yet it is on such measures that the great fabric of modern astronomy depends . The astronomer 's common unit of angular measure is the second of arc . Suppose two hundred small stars placed in a row , at a distance of one second from each other . The two hundred stars , though reaching over a space of two hundred seconds , would , to the naked eye , be but a single round star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet all that we know of the distance of the sun and the dimensions of the solar system depends on measures of twenty or thirty seconds . There is not a single star the parallax of which is known to equal a second , and but one for which it exceeds a small fraction of a second . Yet it is only by measuring the parallax of the stars that we know anything of their distance , and of the dimensions of that universe among whose suns and systems our sun with its attendant planets is lost in insignificance . The nutation of the earth 's axis , on which depends the mass of the moon , and the interior configuration of the earth itself , only amounts to nine seconds . The aberration of light , a joint effect of the progressive motion of light and of the motion of the earth in its orbit , only amounts to twenty seconds . The position of the planet Neptune , a globe two hundred times the size of our earth , was calculated by Le Verrier from deviations in the motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty seconds in the position of the moon as predicted in the Nautical Almanac would throw the navigator fifteen miles out of his reckoning . A uniform error , in the same direction , of one second , in the calculated positions of the stars , would throw a boundary line one hundred feet out of its true position . When the astronomer undertakes to measure these minute angles , he finds Nature warring against him with all her powers . In the air above she never ceases to mix currents of hot and cold air , and thus keeps the telescopic image of every star in unceasing agitation , - like the image of the sun in a running stream . Expanding his instrument by heat , and contracting it by cold , she disarranges its most delicate adjustments , changes its form , twists its supports , and moves its microscopes . She blows a grain of sand under his spirit-level , and his observation is worthless . She will not even allow the most solid foundation of his instrument to rest immovable , but , alternately causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drouth , keeps it in continual disturbance . And , not satisfied with external interference , she enters his brain and nerves , and will not allow his senses to give correct evidence with the required nicety . His personal defects must // therefore be a subject of investigation , as well as the defects ot his instrument . The success with which the astronomer can carry on his battle depends on his foresight in anticipating Nature 's attacks , and his ingenuity in devising means to thwart her . It is only by the most profound investigation of the atmosphere , the most ingenious devices to discover the errors of their instruments , and to allow for them or to eliminate their effect , the greatest pains to avoid irregular changes of temperature , and the continual repetition of observations under conditions as varied and as nearly opposite as possible , that astronomers have brought their science to its present approach to perfection . And , with all their efforts , there is not a result of the past which can be claimed as absolutely true , nor a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step toward that state of absolute perfection which all are seeking , but which none can hope quite to see . Here it is that American astronomers have failed . For researches of the highest delicacy , for any new determination of the distance of the sun , for the mass of the moon , or for the parallax of a fixed star , we seek in vain in the annals of American astronomy . We say this in no querulous tone . Considering that a generation has not passed away since there was not a permanent , active astronomical observatory on the American continent , that the successful astronomer must be a mathematician , chemist , physicist , and geologist , acquainted with the physical and molecular forces at play in the earth , the air , and the heavens , and possessed withal of that practical judgment without which genius will never be effectual , it is not wonderful that we are still behind Europe in practical astronomy . Still , in its instrumental means , our National Observatory , as it must be considered notwithstanding its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been . It was founded during a transition period , in which a new set of ideas respecting the construction , capacity , and use of astronomical instruments were making their way among astronomers . These ideas originated in Germany and Russia ; they had been embodied in the magnificent establishment of the Emperor Nicholas , at IPulkowa , - still the astronomical // capital of the world ; and they were slowly making their way westward . But they had not found acceptance in England , and English astronomers were principally consulted in founding the new Observatory . We consequently find the great Equatorial Telescope so small , that no college observatory in the country would now be satisfied with it ; we find the meridian instruments enclosed in massive brick walls , where the first condition of astronomical observations - equality of internal and external temperature - is unattainable ; and we find the exploded English Mural Circle introduced , notwithstanding that in Germany the Meridian Circle had been successfully used for twenty years . Not five years after the Mural Circle had been adopted , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astronomer Royal , - he himself commenced the construction of a great Meridian Circle , which entirely superseded the Mural in its own birthplace . The cast-off instrument of Greenwich remained for fifteen years longer the best one of Washington , where it has only now been superseded by a great Meridian Circle of dimensions similar to that of Greenwich . Of this new instrument , the only one , we believe , the Observatory has acquired since its foundation , we can not express a critical opinion , as no regular publication of its observations has yet appeared . Some partial publications of its asteroid observations have appeared in the Astronomische Nachrichten , and these show much better for the optical power of the instrument than for its precision . They are , indeed , not a fair test of the latter , owing to their extreme minuteness ; but it is a question whether the great dimensions of the instrument are not a drawback to the delicacy of its work . The larger an instrument , the more liable are its different parts to become of different temperatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also regret that this instrument should have been mounted in a brick room , thirty years after the superiority of thin wooden walls had been conclusively shown at Pulkowa . Our judgment of the past work of the Naval Observatory may be summed up thus . That of the first four years , and of the last four years , so far as published , is highly creditable to the country , and to the navy , all things considered . Among // the things to be taken into account are the want of educated astronomers in the beginning , and the inferior character of many of the instruments throughout the history of the Observatory . During the intervening years , the operations are creditable to no one but the one or two astronomers by whom all the observations of value were made . The probable future work of the Observatory we have few data for estimating . Admiral Davis , in his last Report , states that the employment of the new Transit Circle " constitutes a new era in its progress , and restores it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to this extent , - that the Naval Observatory may fairly take rank as at least the fourth in the world . The Royal Observatory at Greenwich has rather more improved instruments , with a much better organization of its labor , and a more definite field for its energies . Regularity and persistence in a uniform plan , if a good one , greatly enhance the value of astronomical observations , and these , at least , have been secured by the Greenwich system . Astronomers Royal have either been appointed when young , or have lived to a good old age , as only two have died within a century . Few opportunities , therefore , have occurred for a change of plan , and the incumbents of the office have been men of such good judgment that no great change has ever been necessary . The Imperial Observatory of Paris is presided over by Le Verrier . It is more liberally supported , and does more work , than any other in the world ; but in the art of observing , its astronomers appear behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disadvantages of an impure and cloudy atmosphere and a northern latitude . The unrivalled establishment at Pulkowa was the subject of an article in this Review some years ago . Everything then said of its pre-eminence is still true . The rank of our own Observatory being hardly that which will satisfy the American mind , we shall briefly indicate a few possible improvements . Let us premise by saying , that we do not suggest a more liberal annual expenditure , but improvements to be made but once for at least a lifetime . They are : - // 1 . A large telescope . We have already alluded to the deficiency of the present one . 2* Observing-rooms of wood or iron , instead of brick . 3 . Such a personal organization as shall secure the services of able astronomers . 4 . Residences for the principal observers at or near the Observatory . This we conceive to be , at present , one of the most urgent wants of the establishment . The words of the Emperor Nicholas , when he first contemplated founding the Pulkowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own country in carrying out these improvements : " Sa Yliajest6 Inip*riale daigna declarer du Jlinistre de l'Instruction Publique , Prince Lieven que l'honneur du pays Lui paraissait reciamer la foundation pros de la cap itale , d'un nouvel Observatoire astronomique ; conforms d la hauteur actuelle de la science et propre d contribuer d son avancement ulterieur.
