txt PRINTING PAPER FROM ABROAD. ? We COMmemo to-day the printing of the TIMES upon paper manufactured expressly for our use in Belgium , and imported for us through Mr. F. DIITSTERS , who is the largest importer of foreign paper in this City . One vessel , containing a consignment of this part to us , has already arrived , and several others are on the way . We have paid to the Government the sum of $4,500 for duties on the paper already received , under the amended tariff act of last session . This is a larger amount , we believe , than has ever before been received from all the publishers in the country for duties upon imported paper used for newspaper purposes . It will be more than quadrupled within the next few weeks . When this paper was ordered the Papermaker 's combination had succeeded in forcing paper to the enormous price of 22 to 24 cents per pound , on the plea that the scarcity of cotton rags rendered it utterly impossible to sell it lower , and the tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : we bought this paper in Belgium , ( where the dearth of cotton ought to have made itself felt if anywhere. ) for seven and seven and a half ecnts a pound . The effect of our sending the order , which soon became known , was to check the advance in prices , and they have been receding ever since . The combination has made one or two attempts since that time to get prices up again , but in every instance they have failed . Their latest dodge was to put their mills upon three-quarters time ; but some of die loading members of the combination bolted at this flagrant attempt at imposition , and we believe the attempt has been abandoned . The reduction of the duty on paper by Congress , at its late session , was far from being what the interests of the country required ; but it has been sufficient to check the attempts of the combination of Paper-makers to push prices to the enormously high figure they originally intended .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
