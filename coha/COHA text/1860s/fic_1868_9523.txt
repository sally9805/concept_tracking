One night he gave a party . I was refused admittance to his household because I dar 'd to love his daughter . That night my rival was there , the Count Coleslau . I lay off about the garden with a heart full ot jealousy , and when my rival came forth I struck him a blow , with the intent of taking his life , but whether I did or not , I can not tell . I made my escape  --  was pursued and brought back , when old Castiron took the law in his own hands and punished me most cruelly . They sent to Weehawken  --  catched a wild horse that had been a terror to the neighborhood for years  --  tied me to his back with strong bed cords  --  they lashed me firm , and started him over rivers , through fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched , torn and mangled day after day , when , to add still to this great horror , the horse took me across the river  --  bumpy bump went my head against the big cakes of ice , while every fibre of this body was ready to crack with the piercing colds . Headlong he dashed till I grew insensible of the rest , and I suppose he brought me to where I now am , and this poor body is so lacerated that I never , never can revive . That 's all I know of it . Abder Khan . Abder Khan This aged arm shall help to shield thee , and the horse that bore you to your home shall bear you to your triumph . Tomorrow 's dawn we will away ; our little force shall make the tyrant 's wall tremble . Aye , tremble . Satinette Satinette S hakes him by the hand . Bully for you , dad .
