ART . IV . - MADAME SWETCHINE , sa Vie et ses cEuvres . Par M. LE COMTE DE FALLOUX . Paris : Didier. 1860. 2vols . Svo . AMONG the remarkable women of our time there is perhaps none whose character and attainments have made her more worthy of notice than she the record of whose life is contained in the pages before us . A foreigner by birth , her sympathies and her long residence in France had made her almost a Frenchwoman ; the nobleness of her character , her cultivated mind , and her enlightened piety , caused her society to be sought by some of the most distinguished Roman Catholics of our time ; while her ardent charity and active benevolence endeared her no less to the poor and the unfortunate . In the midst of the bustle and gayety of Paris , she lived a life of holiness and good works , ever ready to give sympathy where it was needed , and losing no opportunity of stimulating the young of both sexes to exertion in the cause of truth and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her influence over others was great and lasting ; no life could be more useful in the sphere in which she moved , and no example more worthy of imitation can be offered to women of education , wealth , and leisure . Madame Swetchine was born in Russia , in 1782 . Her father , M. Soymonof , the private secretary of the Empress Catherine II. , was a man of serious and cultivated mind , and of noble face and bearing . His position at court did not prevent him from bestowing much time and pains on the education of Sophie , for many years his only child . She was taught music , dancing , and languages , for all of which she evinced considerable taste . At the age of sixteen , she became the maid of honor of the Empress Marie , a beautiful and virtuous princess , whose patience and gentleness won the hearts of all around her , and enabled her to obtain a salutary influence over the singular and violent prince to whom she was united . But even she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suffered in silence , Sophie Soymonof had thus an early opportunity of learning // the useful lesson , that neither rank nor greatness can suffice for happiness . Sophie was not what is commonly called handsome ; but her complexion was fine , her carriage graceful and easy , her blue eyes intelligent and gentle in expression , and her every word and action simple , natural , and lady-like . Her residence at court , and the part which the office she held compelled her to take in its frivolities , did not prevent her from continuing to improve her talents and cultivate her mind . She already spoke the Russian language , which many of the men and women of her country disdained to acquire , as suited only to the lower classes , as also French , English , and Italian , and had studied Latin , Greek , and Hebrew . Some of her drawings are still shown , which would do credit to any amateur . Her voice was full , flexible , and sonorous , and she read music with unusual ease . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine 's old servants , he might incur the displeasure of the Emperor , and be dismissed from office , was anxious that she should marry early , in order to secure to her a suitable home and a protector for life . His friend , General Swetchine , then forty-two years of age , a man of amiable disposition and excellent sense , as well as of pleasing personal appearance , offered Sophie his hand , and she , accustomed to consult every wish of her father , did not hesitate to accept his proposals . She had lost her mother several years previously , and was happy to think that , in forming this connection , she could continue to bestow on her little sister tbe same care that she had lavished on her since their mother 's death . M. Soymonof had been wise in thus anticipating his disgrace . Soon after his daughter 's marriage , he was ordered to leave St. Petersburg . He obeyed , and went to Moscow , but the consciousness of having been treated with injustice , the separation from his beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had relied in the hour of misfortune , were a blow so severe , that he soon sunk under its effects , and a stroke of apoplexy terminated the life which had no longer any charms for him . Until that moment , Madame Swetchine had never felt the power of religion . Naturally amiable and kind , it had cost // her no effort faithfully to discharge the various duties which devolved upon her ; she had attended regularly to the showy services of the Greek Church in the imperial chapel ; but she had never been taught to feel her dependence on a higher power , nor the duty and efficacy of daily prayer . The loss of the father whom she so tenderly loved was the turning-point in her life ; in so great an affliction , she resorted to the only true source of consolation , and devoted her leisure hours to the study and meditation of the highest truths . The society of St. Petersburg was at this time more brilliant than almost any other in Europe . The French IRevolution had caused many emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and the house of General Swetchine , the military commandant and afterward the governor of St. Petersburg , was always open to them . Among the frequent visitors of Madame Swetchine was the Chevalier d'Augard , who was named Sub-Director of the Imperial Libraries , and who from the grace of his conversation and the depth of his religious convictions may first have attracted her toward the Roman Catholic Church . Her friendship for the celebrated Count de Maistre afforded her an opportunity of hearing what so remarkable a man thought on the subject of his faith , and must have contributed to enlighten her , although his influence over her mind was probably not so great as it might have been , had not his extreme dogmatism repelled the natural independence of her character . Her conversion , which did not take place till several years afterward , was the result of deep investigation and of the workings of her own mind . The Emperor Paul , who had always been capricious and violent , was fast becoming still more so . He issued the most absurd ordinances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringement of etiquette was punished severely ; and even the princes and princesses of the imperial family were not exempted from this strict discipline . Officers were arrested at a moment 's warning , dragged before a council of war , and subjected to the severest punishments . General Swetchine , although a faithful subject and a brave officer , was suddenly deprived of his post as governor of the capital . But a conspiracy , which he had been in vain solicited to join , was 31* // even then formed for the purpose of dethroning the Emperor . Among the conspirators were , as is well known , some of the chief men of the Empire , who , humiliated by the position now held by Russia , displeased at the alliance which Paul had concluded with France , and exasperated by a tyranny which could at any moment deprive them of life and fortune , had determined to surround the Emperor 's palace , to demand his immediate abdication , and to place his son , Alexander , a prince of amiable disposition and fair promise , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conspiracy , but supposed that his father 's life would be safe , and that he would be treated with the respect due to his rank . History ought to have taught him that such good fortune rarely attends a dethroned monarch . The death of his grandfather , the husband of Catherine II. , had been sudden and terrible ; that of his father was not less so . On the 12th of March , 1801 , Paul had ceased to live , and Alexander , shocked at the catastrophe which at once deprived him of a parent and the empire of its head , was hurried by torchlight to the cathedral , there to be proclaimed Emperor in his turn . General Swetchine and his wife remained in St. Petersburg after the accession of Alexander , their estates being at so great a distance from the capital that to have forsaken it would have been to retire altogether from society ; but the General was not ambitious , and neither sought office nor obtained it . Madame Swetchine was no less indifferent to worldly honors , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court was her grateful affection for the Empress Marie . This excellent princess , on the death of her husband , retired to the palace of Paulowski , where a choice collection of books , medals , and drawings bore evidence to her elegant tastes , and served to occupy the hours which she did not devote to good works . She continued to direct several of the principal benevolent institutions of the capital , and on one occasion , when the superior of a convent , where orphan girls of noble family were educated , fell ill , she took the place of this lady , and discharged the duties of her office till she was able to resume them . Madame Swetchine did not fail to profit by the additional // leisure which her husband 's retirement into private life gave her , and , while bestowing more attention than ever on her young sister and on General Swetchine , - for the gratification of her own tastes was never the first object with her , - she continued to cultivate her mind in every possible way . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and copying those passages which particularly struck her . This habit , which she adopted at the age of nineteen , she never laid aside , and , considering the great delicacy of her health , it is surprising that she should have thus persevered in it . The volumes in her handwriting , and which were written solely for her own pleasure and improvement , are now in the possession of M. de Falloux , and amount in number to thirty-five . We can not but wish that this practice might be adopted by young persons in our own country , where the cheapness and the multiplicity of books occasion a careless habit of reading for mere amusement , and , as has been well said , " enjoying the luxury of letting new thoughts into their minds , without the trouble of weighing their truth and value . " Notwithstanding her love of study , she always found time to attend to the wants of the poor and to console the afflicted . A number of notQs addressed to her friend , M. Tourguenif , then employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espoused the cause of the unfortunate , without distinction of religious belief , of country , or of sex . She also adopted a little girl , named Nadine , on whom she bestowed a mother 's care ; and , her sister having married Prince Gagarin , she found new objects of affection in her little nephews and nieces . Her loving heart could never be void , and her life flowed smoothly and happily on till 1811 , when , a war between France and Russia having become imminent , General Swetchine deemed it his duty to return to active life . Madame Swetchine 's patriotism was aroused by the idea of the invasion of her native country , and her warm sympathies were all enlisted in behalf of its defenders , of whom her husband was one . Like most of her people , she entertained a strong feeling of admiration for Alexander , who owed this devotion to the graces of his person and manner , and to the contrast which he offered to his predecessors , more than to // great talents or statesmanship . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of a Moldavian nobleman who had left his country after the treaty of Jassy , in 1791 , in order to place himself and his family under the protection of a Christian power , and who was the lady of honor of Alexander 's wife , show the sincerity and warmth of her patriotic feelings , and are at the same time a valuable spontaneous evidence of the religions faith which governed all her actions and colored all her views of life . In one of these she says , after speaking of her ill health , which compelled her to pass many of her days in inaction , - days on which , to use her own expression , she could " neither sow nor reap , " - she adds - " After all , I do not complain of that or of anything else . I feel deeply the complete ignorance in which we are of that which is best for us ; I have seen so many hopes when realized cause bitter tears to flow , more bitter far than those drawn from the eyes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full power over my own destiny , I should not hesitate an instant to entreat that I might be delivered from it . It is well to depend on the Supreme Being only , and , if anything could make human beings more miserable than they are , it would be one more degree of independence . These sentiments are not new to me ; the first germ of them was conceived at a time when the air was balmy , and all around me sparkled with beauty and with freshness , and when my heart , although it had some sorrows , still felt all the charms of existence . " It must not be supposed from this extract , however , that Madame Swetchine 's religion rendered her in the least gloomy or ascetic ; on the contrary , she was always cheerful , entering with readiness into the plans and hopes of others , eager to give innocent gratification , and full of patience and sweetness toward the vicious , the ungrateful , and the worldly . The events of 1814 and 1815 are too well known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alexander showed himself the most magnanimous . French literature and history are so familiar to all polished Russians , and they are so prepossessed in favor of French manners and customs , that it was doubtless easier for him than for the monarchs who shared his triumphs to acknowledge gracefully // the merit and the talents of the men of whom France was justly proud . He had no sense of personal wrong or humiliation with which to struggle ; he had been successful in repelling the invader from the soil of Russia , while his fellowprinces had all suffered from invasion and conquest ; he could afford to be generous ; and , always greedy of popularity , he sought it as eagerly in Paris as in St. Petersburg , - more eagerly , perhaps , because less certain at first of obtaining it . Madame Swetchine , delighted with his successes , characteristically exclaims , " He is raised above other men now by his glory ; he will be so also by the influence of religion . " To a certain extent she was right . Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had always been accessible to religious impressions . He was naturally of a melancholy temperament , or , as some have imagined , the violent death of his father may have thrown a gloom over his life , and caused him to dwell on the transitory nature of human greatness , and the need of something beyond the grave to console us for the disappointments we endure here . Whatever the cause may have been , he was predisposed to listen willingly to the pious exhortations of the celebrated Madame de Krudner ; and , during the remaining part of his life , he showed that religion had acquired an unwonted power over his mind and actions . It has been thought that the contact of the Roman Catholics , among whom he passed the years 1813 , 1814 , and 1815 , and the virtues displayed by Pope Pius VII . in his misfortunes , may have inclined Alexander toward the Roman Catholic faith ; but in Russia , where every influence was opposed to it , it was impossible for him to acknowledge such a preference . Himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such by millions who clung with all the fervor of fanaticism to that Church , it would have been positive self-destruction for him to have forsaken it for any other . Despotic as is the rule of the Emperor of all the Russias , his power , like that of all despots , is of uncertain tenure ; the earth trembles beneath his throne , and more than any other monarch in Europe he has to consult the prejudices of his people . There is in Russia a constant struggle going on between the enlightened portion of the nobility and the old // Muscovite or national party ; and it requires great skill on the part of the monarch to meet the demands of the age , represented by the one , without utterly and irretrievably alienating the other . Alexander acted as most men would have done under the same circumstances . He yielded to the exigencies of his position ; stifled all leaning toward the Roman Catholic faith ; with the mobility peculiar to his character , was soon induced to listen to the representations of those who wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1816 he had already issued a ukase banishing them from St. Petersburg and Moscow . It was in vain that the Count de Maistre , then Ambassador of Sardinia at St. Petersburg , espoused their cause with his accustomed ardor ; the eloquent and famous letters addressed by him to Count iRazoumofski , the Minister of Public Instruction , only delayed their fate for a short time . In the course of that year , their schools were closed , their missions , which had given so much consolation to the exiles of Siberia , prohibited , and they themselves banished from the empire . As a proof that in this act Alexander yielded rather to the representations of others than to his own convictions , we may mention that every Jesuit received from the Emperor 's private purse a sum of money , and furs to protect him from the inclemency of that Northern climate during his journey . The destinies of individuals are sometimes curiously interwoven with the policy of states ; and the expulsion of the Jesuits became the eventful epoch of Madame Swetchine 's life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of whom , like the Princess de Tarente , were models of Christian heroism and virtue , had long before given her a strong bias in favor of the faith which could produce such fruits . In 1815 , she determined to examine for herself the comparative merits of the Roman and Greek Churches . For this purpose , she thought it necessary to retire for a time altogether from the world , in order to devote herself exclusively to the studies necessary to her purpose . She hired the house of Prince Bariatinski , which was near St. Petersburg , and pleasantly situated on the shores of the Gulf of Finland , and retired thither in June , 1815 , accompanied only by her adopted daughter . She had already satisfied herself that the // question between the Latin and the Greek Church was historical rather than dogmatical . She therefore read and carefully analyzed Fleury 's Ecclesiastical History , giving special attention to the acts of the principal *iEcumenical Conncils held in the East , and to all in these acts which seemed to prove the supremacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied convinced her and enlightened her so fully . She read Bossuet much , and thenceforward entertained so lively an admiration for that great genius , that it made her , as she herself said , unjust toward F6nelon . It is not possible , nor is it necessary , for us to ascertain the precise moment when all her doubts were removed . She always shrank from speaking of her religious experiences , or citing her own example . It is sufficient to know , that on her return to St. Petersbnrg , at the close of the year , she abjured her former faith , and made her first confession to a French priest , M. IRosaven . Owing to the odium in which the IRoman Catholics were held at that time at the court of St. Petersburg , Madame Swetchine considered that her duty to her family required that her conversion should remain a secret ; but when the edict against the Jesuits appeared , her strong sense of honor and justice would not suffer her to abandon those whose faith she shared , and , relinquishing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , to acknowledge herself a Catholic , and to do all in her power to soften the misfortunes of M. Rosaven and the ether proscribed men . Since his return to Russia , the Emperor Alexander had bestowed on Madame Swetchine so many marks of esteem and respect , that some of the courtiers , fearing the influence which such a woman might acquire over him , and unable to find a flaw in so pure and noble a character , determined , if possible , to injure General Swetchine . The hatred felt toward him by those who had in vain urged him to join in the conspiracy against Paul , could now be secretly gratified ; and the machinations employed against him were so successful , that the General , deeply wounded by them , determined to leave Russia . Alexander , pained by this determination , but unable or niiwilling to oppose it , showed his interest in Madame Swetchiiie by reqnesting her to write to him . She obeyed , and the corre // spondence was kept up till the time of his death . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteously forwarded to her her own letters ; but neither these , nor those of Alexander , which she was known to have preserved for many years , were found among her papers , and it is supposed that she must either have destroyed them during the Revolution of 1848 , or sent them to Russia , where they may , at some future time , appear in print . It may be imagined how much pleasure Madame Swetchine derived from her first visit to Paris . Her previous intimacy with so many French immigrants prevented her from feeling that she was in a strange land , and six months were passed by her in delightful intercourse with the most distinguished men and women of the Royalist , or , as would now be said , the Legitimist party . Of the diplomatic corps then in Paris , Baron William Humboldt  --  and the celebrated Pozzo di Borgo , then Russian Minister in France , were her most assiduous visitors . The interest she took in charitable institutions gave her an opportunity of frequently seeing Baron de G6rando , whose philanthropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deserved . At the end of the winter of 1816 - 17 , General Swetchine found it necessary to return to St. Petersburg , in order to defeat the machinations of his enemies by his presence . Madame Swetchine accompanied him , but their sojourn in St. Petersburg gave to neither of them the satisfaction they had . hoped to derive from it . Alexander , although - personally their friend , was under the influence of those who did not wish that justice should be done to them . Besides , Madame Swetchine 's sister was at Rome ; the Count de Maistre had returned to his own country ; other of her intimate friends were absent ; and Madame Swetchine rejoiced when , after making the necessary arrangements , she and her husband could return - to France for an indefinite period . At the end of the autumn of 1818 they left Russia , to which General Swetchine never returned , and which Madame Swetchine revisited but once , and that in order to obtain permission from the Emperor Nicholas to remain abroad permanently , - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that // we recollect seeing a Russian Countess who had nearly reached the age of seventy compelled to undertake the journey from Paris to St. Petersburg , in order to solicit in person the privilege of remaining abroad a year longer . From 1818 till 1823 Madame Swetchine remained in Paris , where the friendships she had previously formed continued to strengthen . Her excellent dispositioii , her superior understanding , and her ready sympathy made her society invaluable to her friends , and it was a source of great regret to them when they found that she had determined to spend two years in Italy . Her sister was then in that country , and the pleasure of seeing her and her children , her religious fervor , and her thirst for improvement , all combined to make her residence there delightful . With her various gifts , it is not surprising that Rome should have had an especial charm for her , nor that she should have felt intensely the unrivalled grandeur and beauty which have appealed so powerfully to the greatest writers and artists ofmodern times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that city are pleasing from the simplicity and truth with which they are expressed . As was her custom , she sought to profit by all she saw . She attended regularly the lectures of the celebrated Professor Visconti , carefully writing them out , and adding her own remarks . Her pleasure in the services and in the exquisite music at St. Peter 's was great , as may be imagined ; but , like all truly religious persons , she could not but be shocked at the want of reverence evinced by the crowd , who presumed to consider these solemnities as a mere show , and annoyed , as much as so amiable a being could be , by the levity and sarcasms of the Protestants who mingled with the sincere worshippers . In the spring of 1825 , Madame Swetchine and her husband returned to Paris , and established themselves in the Rue St. Dominique , in the quiet and aristocratic Faubourg St. Germain , inhabited chiefly by the representatives of the old nobility of France . As is the case with most of these ancient residences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rear , communicating with other gardens , so that from her windows she could enjoy the bright sunshine and the sight // of green grass and trees . She sent to St. Petersburg for some of the pictures and bronzes which her father had collected , and the sight of which recalled her happy childhood , and with these she tastefully ornamented her drawing-room , and a small room adjoining it , which she used as a library . She gave no evening parties and no ceremonious dinners ; but her friends were always welcome at her table . She required little sleep , and before eight in the morning had heard mass , and visited some of the numerous poor families in which she was interested . The forenoon she passed alone , unless interrupted by persons who sought her assistance or sympathy . From three to six she received visitors ; then came her dinner hour , and from nine till midnight visitors other than those of the afternoon kept her engaged in conversation . Although extremely simple in her attire , which varied little either in form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took pleasure in seeing the beautiful and elegant young women who often on their way to some magnificent fete passed an hour in her salon , which was always lighted by a profusion of wax tapers , the only luxury in which she indulged . The young always attracted her and excited her interest , and many were the useful lessons they received from her in an indirect way . It was characteristic of her that she never gave advice unasked ; but she had the rare gift of leading others to reflect , of encouraging their good resolutions , of soothing their troubled minds , and of inspiring them with patience under their trials . In all this she never thought of herself : charity , in its broadest sense , was at the root of all her actions ; to do good and to contribute to the happiness of others , the constant object of her life . Her time was always at the disposal of her friends . As soon as her adopted daughter became the wife of Count S6gur , she took under her care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose health required the milder climate of France . The position of Count Nesselrode , then Minister of Foreign Affairs , prevented his wife from leaving St. Petersburg , and this young girl , who was then only fourteen years of age , remained in Madame Swetchine 's family till her education was finished and her health restored . Nothing can be more // admirable than the letters constantly addressed to the anxious mother by Madame Swetchine , and it is a satisfaction to think that the unwearied attention bestowed on this young person 's moral and intellectual development should have been repaid , as it was , by her almost filial affection and respect . Although occupied in studies which might have taxed the powers of the most eminent men , there seems to have been not a particle of pedantry about Madame Swetchine ; her tastes , her manners , and her language were essentially feminine . Her political views were all moderate ; she thought a constitutional monarchy the best and safest government for France ; she sympathized with the Greeks in their effort to recover their national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom she had not known personally ; but the Republican party in France and elsewhere seemed to her , and not unnaturally , perhaps , considering the crimes committed during the Revolution of 1789 , synonymous with the party of irreligion and immorality . The Revolution of 1830 grieved her , ( although she had not been blind to the faults of those who governed France during the Restoration , ) because it placed the fate of the country she loved so well once more in uncertainty , and also because the blow fell heavily on many of her personal friends . But even then she was just toward the men who surrounded the new government , and felt , notwithstanding her respect for Charles X. , and for the Dauphiness , the unfortunate daughter of Louis XVI. , that , if the elder branch of Bourbons had failed to make the nation happy and prosperous , it was a duty to submit to the will of Providence , and patiently to await the course of events . The Revolution of July changed the religious as well as the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Charte of 1830 , " is , " not that of the state , but " that of the majority . " During the later years of the Restoration , the clergy had become odious , because they were supposed to direct , either openly or secretly , every act of the government . The want of a newspaper which would defend the interests of Catholicism , and free the Church from its dependence on the state , while it adhered to the representative government inaugurated by the Bourbons on their return // from exile , and to the general principles in vigor in modern society , was felt by all sincere Catholics . The journal L'Avefir was started for the purpose of supplying this want . The nature of the questions raised and discussed in it , and the noble character and distinguished talents of the writers engaged in it , all contributed to give it great influence , and will keep it in remembrance so long as one of the most momentous problems of human destiny , namely , the exact limits between church and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican Lacordaire , and Count Montalembert , then as now one of the most zealous and indefatigable defenders of the Catholic religion and the Papacy , as well as of the Polish cause , were the founders of this journal . All three were friends of Madame Swetchine , and were in the habit of discoursing freely with her on those vital questions which interested them all alike . Her truly Christian spirit induced her to exercise the influence she possessed over them to repress the tendency to ultra liberalism which has led so many of the promising young men of that period to utter unbelief . The journal L'Avenir had been in existence but one year when it awakened the displeasure both of the French government and of the court of Rome . More anxious to satisfy the latter than to make their peace with the former , MM . Lamennais , Lacordaire and Montalembert determined to continue the publication of L'Avenir till they had had an interview with the Pope . The result of this journey was made known to the world by the encyclical letter of Pope Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrated work of Lamennais , Affaires de Rome . Instead of submitting , like his colleagues , to the head of the Catholic Church , he broke off his allegiance to that Church , and , after writing his admirable " Essay on Religions Indifference , " himself became by slow degrees a sceptic . Lacordaire went into retirement to pursue those studies which made him the eloquent orator he was , and Montalembert resorted to Germany , where he first conceived the plan of his Life of St. Elizabeth . During his absence , Madame Swetchine 's interest in him never failed ; her letters to him are full of almost maternal // solicitude and affection , and the relations then established between them lasted as long as she lived . With M. Lacordaire she was also in the habit of corresponding , and the respect he entertained for her is shown by the fact of his sending to her the manuscript of a reply to M. de Lamennais 's Affaires de Rome , requesting her to read it before she sent it to the Archbishop of Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and who , in order not to reawaken discussion on the subject of which it treated , decided that it should remain unpublished . In 1834 , Madame Swetchine was painfully surprised by an order from the Emperor Nicholas to leave Paris , with her husband , and return to Russia , there to reside in an obscure town at a distance from Moscow and St. Petersburg . It was then mid-winter ; but Madame Swetchine did not hesitate as to the course she ought to take . She had always refused to listen to the advice of her friends , to dispose of all the property she possessed in Russia , and transfer her funds to France ; and she was unwilling to dissolve the last tie which bound her to her native country , or to abandon the peasants on her estate , which she intended to leave to her sister 's children . Besides , she dreaded confirming the Emperor 's prejudices against the Roman Catholic faith . She resolved to obey , although convinced that the change of climate , if not fatal , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . The intercessions of her friends obtained a reprieve of a few months , and it was not till August that she left Paris for St. Petersburg* Two months were spent there in obtaining permission to return to Paris to reside , and then an attack of severe illness prevented her from leaving St. Petersburg till February . The inclemency of the weather caused her much suffering during her journey , and on her return to the Rue St. Dominique she became so ill that for three months her recovery was doubtful . During the whole of this trying year she had exhibited wonderful fortitude and resignation , soothing General Swetchine , who felt deeply the indignity with which he had been treated , by kind words and attentions , concealing from her friends in Paris all the anxiety she suffered , and never allowing a murmur against the Russian gov-32* // eminent to escape her . Her submission , as she herself said in writing to a friend , had nothing servile in it ; it was freely given , and from a sense of duty only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two severe afflictions , - the death of the Countess S6gur , her adopted daughter , and of her brother-in-law , Prince Gagarin . As her sister from that time resided in Moscow altogether , the separation from her was added to these afflictions ; but every disappointment and trial led her thoughts upward , and increased the fervor of her piety ; and yet so free from all ostentation was the austerity of her religious practices that , among those who visited her frequently , few were aware of them . In the same way her charities were concealed as much as possible from all except those on whom they were bestowed ; but she visited the poor constantly , and was most ingenious in supplying their necessary wants , and at the same time in endeavoring to afford them innocent gratification , as by giving them flowers , books , or cheap prints . " No generous thought , " says her biographer , " ever entered her mind , without being translated into a generous action . " A servant who had lived thirty years with her says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am convinced that she shortened her days by wishing to make herself useful to her fellow-creatures in every class of society , by making herself the slave of all . " When she left Paris for the country , or for some wateringplace , her first thought was to become acquainted with the Sisters of Charity , and to hear from them of some poor family which she might assist . It was once said of her , that the more unhappy one was , the more she loved the sufferer . The rich came to her to unburden their domestic griefs , as the poor to tell their misery ; and she had the gift of saying something consoling to each one . She never lost sight of the peasants on her estates in Russia ; and the letters from her friends concerning them show how deeply she to whom they wrote entered into their wants , desired their comfort , and sought to further their moral improvement . No one who knew her can doubt how much pleasure she would have felt at the measures taken by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire . // The Revolution of 1848 did not take Madame Swetchine by surprise . She had foreseen that another change of government in France was probable , although she had not supposed that it would take place so soon . But now , as at every other period of her life , she was neither depressed nor elated unduly . She did justice to the authors of the Revolution , as well as to those who suffered from it . She had never been partial to Lamartine , and believed that his work on the Girondists had fostered evil passions and hastened the Revolution ; but she praised his firmness , his courage , and his humanity in the hour of trial , as much as his warmest friends , Her constant endeavor was to calm the political passions of those about her , instead of seeking to excite them , as some women possessed of her influence might have done . In the succeeding year , Madame Swetchine lost the friend of her youth , Mademoiselle Stourdza , the wife of Count Egdling , and another friend , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant correspondence with both , and had usually passed a few days every summer with the latter at some German watering-place . She felt their loss deeply , and had hardly had time to recover from it , when she was called upon to mourn the death of General Swetchine , who died of apoplexy at the age of ninety-two . He was a man of amiable disposition , delicate and generous in his feelings , and well informed . Although his deafness during the latter years of his life prevented him from enjoying general conversation , he always had a gracious welcome for his wife 's visitors , and showed a special regard for her particular friends , MM . Lacordaire and Ravignan , while he never relinquished his adherence to the Greek Church . His death was a severe blow to Madame Swetchine , who from that time retired more and more from the world , spending the months of November and December of each year in entire seclusion within the walls of some convent . It was during these last years of her life that she became acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distinguished man are given in the volume before us , as well as in his Life and Letters , recently republished here . Two such persons could not fail to appreciate each other . Tocqueville , as every one who has read his Life must perceive , // differed essentially from Madame Swetchine in one respect . The number of his friends was as small as that of hers was large . The refinement of his nature , his fastidious taste , and his somewhat melancholy temperament , prevented him from giving his heart or his approbation very readily , and perhaps there is , for this reason , no one whose opinion of Madame Swetchine is more valuable . His respect for her character and his admiration for her talents are warmly expressed in his letters , both to herself and to others . Madame Swetchine 's health had been undermined for years . Scarcely a day passed without her suffering physical distress ; but she resisted pain and sickness with wonderful firmness , and to the last was more thoughtful of others than of herself .

Moral improvement she considered a paramount duty ; and her biographer remarks , that he was much touched by reading the scattered notes , often written in pencil on scraps of paper or in her pocketbooks , in which she who was possessed of so many virtues speaks of the duty of overcoming certain faults , or bad habits , which a rigid self-examination enabled her to discern in herself . Her physicians having insisted on her passing the summer of 1857 in total retirement , she had gone to the Chateau de Fleury , at some distance from Paris , intending to remain there till late in the autumn , when she received letters from two of her nephews , informing her that they and their families were coming to France , and wished to be allowed to come to Fleury to see her . With characteristic unselfishness , she declared that she would not bring two young women and their children into solitude like hers , and wrote that she would meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dropsy from which she had long been a sufferer causing her limbs to swell , and her breathing to become at times very difficult ; but her faculties remained unimpaired , and she appeared to derive pleasure from the society of her nephews and nieces . M. de Falloux , having heard of her illness , had come to Paris on purpose to see her , and , on finding how critical was her situa // tion , determined not to return to the country while she lived . With the utmost composure , she dictated to him her wishes with regard to her burial , and the arrangements she wished to make for her servants , and for some poor persons in whom she was interested . She had already disposed of the bulk of her fortune in favor of her sister 's children . To M. de Falloux she confided the papers from which the work before us has been compiled , and from which , as we are glad to learn , he has just given two other volumes , containing her letters , to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , and which caused her great suffering , she was constantly serene and patient , ready to converse , whenever the effort was not too painful , with those intimate friends who surrounded her , and at all times full of faith and resignation . One evening , she requested to have her arm-chair moved near the window , and , after expressing her admiration of the beauty of the sky , the purity of the air , and the smiling aspect of the garden , she said , " If God should leave me here , I could still enjoy life ; but if he calls me hence , what other feeling could I have but gratitude ? " On the 8th of September she breathed her last , rewarded , even in this world , for a life of purity and good works , by " that which should accompany old age , As honor , love , obedience , troops of friends , " and leaving behind her an example of moral and intellectual worth such as has rarely been surpassed .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
