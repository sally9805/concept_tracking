Nullif cation and Sece&amp;*ion . NULLIFICATION AND SECESSION . WE publish the principal part of the speech of Hon. R. J. Walker , against nullification and secession , made at the great Union meeting at Natchez , Mississippi , on the first Monday of January , 1833 . We republish this speech from the Natchez Mississippi Journal of that date . Upon that speech , Mr. Walker became the Union candidate for Senator of the United States from Mississippi against Mr. Poindexter , a Calhoun nullifier and secessionist . After a three years ' contest of unexampled violence , Mr. Walker was elected on the 8th of January , 1836 . So distinct was the issue , that the Legislature of Mississippi declared nullification and secession to be treason . The contest was conducted by Mr. Walker by speeches in every county , with the banner of the Union waving over him , and to the music of our national airs . We republish this speech now because it preceded Mr. Webster 's great reply to Calhoun , and because its arguments are applicable to the present contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heretofore published , in favor of Mr. Walker ; and the speech received the cordial approval of ex-President Madison . By reference to the Washington city Globe of the 12th August , 1836 , it will be found that , in conversation with Mr. Ingersoll , Mr. Madison spoke very freely of nullification , which he alto-. gether condemned , remarking that Mr. Walker , of the Senate , in a speech he had made on some occasion , was the first person who had given to the public what he ( Mr. Madison ) considers the true view of Mr. Jefferson 's language on that subject . ' Mr. Webster gave the Whig arguments against nullification and secession , Mr. Walker the democratic ; but they both arrived at the same conclusions : Never , fellow citizens , did I rise to address you with such deep and abiding impressions of the awful character of that crisis which involves the existence of the American Union . No mortal eye can pierce the veil which covers the events of the next few months , but we do know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union in the one hand , anarchy or despotism in the other . Which shall preponderate , is the startling question to which we must all now answer . Already one bright , one kindred star is sinking from the banner of the American Union , the very fabric of our government is rocking on its foundations , one of its proudest pillars is now moving from beneath the glorious arch , and soon may we all stand amid the broken columns and upon the scattered fragments of the Constitution of our once united and happy country . Whilst then we may yet recede from the brink of that precipice on which we now stand , whilst we are once more convened as citizens of the American Union , and have still a common country , whilst we are yet fondly gazing , perhaps for the last time , upon that banner which floated over the army of Washington , and living beneath that Constitution which bears his sacred name , let us at least endeavor to transmit to posterity , unimpaired , that Union , cemented by the blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in opposition to the resolutions submitted for your consideration , tells us that he was nursed in the principles of 76 and 98-that these are the principles of Carolina , and that they ought to be maintained . Let me briefly answer , that the humble individual who now addresses you is the son of a soldier of the Revolution , and that from the dawning of manhood , // from his first vote to his last , at all times , and upon all occasions , he has supported and will support the principles of democracy , and the doctrines of 76 and 98 . But it was under the banner of the Union that the whigs of 76 and 98 achieved their glorious triumphs ; and is that the standard now unfurled by the advocates of nullification ? It is true , we find nullification declared in the Kentucky resolutions to be a rightful remedy  --  but nullification by whom ? by a single State ? no-by those sovereignties the several States , in the mode prescribed by the Constitution , by a declaratory amendment annulling the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remedy in fact ; for it would operate equally on all the States ; but can the same act of Congress be constitutional in one State , and unconstitutional in another ? South Carolina declares the Tariff **25;646;TOOLONG declares it valid ; is it nullified or not ? is it void or valid ? The South Carolina theory gives to each State , of itself ; the unlimited power to pronounce ultimate judgment against the validity of any act of Congress . If so , the Tariff must be valid in Kentucky , and void in South Carolina . Yet if the Carolina ordinance , nullifying the Tariff ; be valid in that State , it is valid in every other State , and Carolina may introduce foreign imports , once landed in her own State , into every other State , free of all duty ; for , by the Constitution , no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State . ' What then becomes of the ultimate judgment of Kentucky ? Nullified by a single State ; and that is the nullification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a member of the Union , repeal any act of Congress she may deem invalid , and prescribe her will for law throughout the limits of every other State . The Constitution of the Union would then be this : Be it enacted , that the American Congress shall possess such powers only as South Caro lina believes they may lawfully exercise ; and the whole American people be thus subjected to the government of the ordinances of a single State . Is this democracy ? The truth is , every act of Congress is intrinsically void or valid , from its repugnance to or consonance with the provisions of the American Constitution ; nor can the judgment of a State render void an act of Congress which is constitutional , or render valid an act of Congress which is unconstitutional . Would the judgment of a single State have rendered the alien  --  and sedition law constitutional , or the last war unconstitutional , or would the Supreme Court of the Union have been compelled to render opposite judgment in a case brought before them , declaring the citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support either of these laws , as their respective States had pronounced contradictory judgments upon them ? Suppose Massachusetts had not only declared the last war unconstitutional , but had passed an ordinaswe requiring her citizens to resist the war , to prostrate and oppose the armies of the Republic , and to aid a tyrant 's myrulidons in driving the steel deeper into the bosoms of our bleeding countrymen ; would the ordinance be constitutional , or would not the acts it required to be performed be treason against the Government of the Union ? It is said a State can not commit treason ; no , but its citizens may ; nor would they be rightfully acquitted because sustained by the judgment of a single State . If each State possesses an equal right to pass ultimate judgment upon any act of Congress , and two States enact ordinances directly contradictory to the same law , do they not , like the meeting of equal forces in mechanics , nullify each other ? or must the same law be enforced in one State and disregarded in the other ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounces the Tariff valid , and South Carolina declares it // void , and suits are instituted in each State on bonds given for the payment of duties on imports introduced into each , must the duties be collected in one State , but not in the other ? This would be to set at open defiance those clauses of the Constitution which declare that all imposts shall be uniform throughout the United States , ' and that no preference shall exist in the collection of revenue in the ports of one State over those of another . ' Upon an appeal from the decisions by the Federal district courts of New York and Carolina , in the suits on the bonds for these duties , how would the Supreme Court of the Union decide the question ? by enforcing the payment of the bonds given in Carolina ? No ; for that State had exercised the right of ultimate judgment , and pronounced the law invalid ; would the court decide against the validity of the bond given in New York ? No ; for that State , in exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law was valid . Or would they enforce the payments of the duties in New York and not in South Carolina ? This , we have seen , would violate both the clauses of the Constitution last quoted . The only remaining judgment would be , to disregard the edict of a single State , and to enforce the payment of the duties in both States , or in neither , as the act of Congress might or might not be repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution . If Kentucky and Virginia thought they possessed the power in regard to the alien and sedition laws now claimed by Carolina in regard to the TariW where is the ordinance nullifying those laws ? Or would they be nullified by resolutions expressing only the judgment and opinion of the Legislature in regard to the constitutionality of the law , as if the Legislature , one department only of the Government of a single State , could annul all the laws of the Union ? Even South Carolina does not urge a doctrine so monstrous , for she declares this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solemn convention . ' ' South Carolina finds , then , in the practice of Virginia and Kentucky , no warrant for the doctrine of nullification . She finds neither ordinance , nor test oaths , nor standing armies , nor packed juries , nor secession , or threats of secession , from the Union . They find Mr. Jefferson in that great emergency protesting against a scission of the Union , ' in any event ; and the ordinance of South Carolina would have received his unqualified abhorrence . But , if we are asked to surrender the principles which alone can preserve the Union , on the assumed authority of Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison , of Kentucky and of Virginia - why do not the advocates of nullification tell us that Mr. Jefferson , in 1821 , as appears by his printed memoirs , emphatically denied the right of a State to veto an act of Congress ; and Mr. Madison , a surviving founder of the Constitution , and framer of the Virginia resolutions , unequivocally denounces the doctrine of nullification ? And are they not safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former of whom wrote and published in 1521 , and the latter deliberately sanctioned , in a laudatory preface , a series of essays , denouncing this very doctrine of nullification as the climax of political heresies ' ? Why do not those who would look to Kentucky and Virginia as the only safe expositors of the Constitution inform us also , that the great and patriotic commonwealth of Kentucky is indignantly repelling the charge that nullification ever was sustained by her authority ? Why do they not point to the unanimous resolution of the Virginia Legislature in 1510 , declaring in the very case of a nullification , by a law of Pennsylvania , of a power of the General Government , that the Supreme Court of the Union is the tribunal , already provided by the Constitution of the United States , ' to decide disputes between the State and Federal ' authorities ? ( See Sup . // Rev. Code of Virginia , ' page 150 . ) These resolutions , directly affirming the supremacy of the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Union over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Virginia within a few months after the promulgation by that tribunal of its decree enforcing the authority of the Union against the nullifying edict of a sovereign State . Virginia did more : she not only affirmed the power of this tribunal , and sanctioned its decree , but spoke of it in terms of the highest eulogy , and scouted indignantly the proposition of Pennsylvania to vest the right of deciding questions of disputed power and sovereignty in some other tribunal than the Supreme Court of the Union . The same proposition was treated with the open or silent contempt of every State in the Union , South Carolina among the number ; and Pennsylvania receded , though she had passed a law coinmanding the Governor of the State to prevent by an armed force the execution of the process emanating under the authority of the Constitution of the Union-though she placed her act upon the same ground as Carolina that the power exercised in that case had never been granted by the Constitution to any department of the General Government . Thus ended nullification in the keystone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever sustained the Democracy of the South , in the election of Jefferson , of Madison , and Monroe , and the cheering voice of whose public meetings first called out as a candidate for the presidency the patriot Chief Magistrate who now . upholds the banner of the Union , submitted to the law of the Union . And is nullification constitutional in Carolina , but unconstitutional in Pennsylvania ? Is the one a sovereign and the other a subject State ? Shall the one submit to the laws of the Union , and not the other ? Why , sir , if the people of Pennsylvania could sustain a distinction so odious , the very shades of their ancestors would rise from the battlefields of the Revolution , from Paoli and Germantown , and call their children bondmen of Carolina , vassals and recreant slaves ! I speak not now of the whiskey insurrection , when , at the order of Washington , the militia of Virginia and of other States moved against the people of Western Pennsylvania , under the command of the Governor of Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak of the period , during the presidency of Mr. Jefferson , when the State of Pennsylvania passed a law nullifying the powers of the General Government , under her reserved right to construe the Constitution at her pleasure , when she was compelled to yield to the laws of the Union , and her armed force , assembled by her Govcrnor under an edict of the State , was ineffectual . Nullification was condemned by Jefferson and Madison , by Virginia and Carolina , and the people of the Union ; and must one State nullify and not another ? No , sir ; all or none of the States must submit to the supremacy of the Government of the Union ; and if Carolina can successfully resist that Government , will any other State submit to a power which is thus insulted , disgraced , defied , and overthrown by the edict of a single State , and which acts and exists only by its permission ? No , sir ; one successful example of practical nullification by a State destroys the Union ; for it demonstrates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its laws , or preserve its existence-that it is not a gosernmest , or that its powers are written in sand , to be swept away by the first angry surge of passion that beats over them . Such was the prediction of the despots of Europe , too soon to be fulfilled if the fatal ordinance of Carolina is sustained , and the flag of the Union struck down by the imperious mandate of a single State . Let us , then , now teach those despots , who , pointing with exultation to our dissensions , and anticipating our downfall , // proclaim that man is incapable of selfgovernment , that the Union can and shall be preserved , that we know that Union and Liberty are inseparable , ' that the name and privileges of American citizens are entwined with the very ligaments of our hearts , that they are our birthright , the glorious inheritance purchased by the blood of our forefathers , and never to be surrendered by their sons ; that we will all rally round the banner of our country and sustain it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in peace , against foreign or domestic enemies ; or , if it must fall , it will be upon the graves of Americans preferring death in its defence to life without it , when the iron chains of despotism would bind them as slaves to that soil which they would tread only as freemen . It is said that the Government of the Union is but a league formed by sovereign States . Did the States form it as governments ? if so , which or all of the departments of any State subscribed or ratified the compact ? or could the government of any State change the organic law , unless by a power given them by the Constitution , or surrender the sovereign attributes of power , and unite the people in a new government with other confederates ? No ; the government can not abolish or change its form or transfer its powers to another government : this highest act of sovereignty can only be performed by the people of a State ; and it was by the people of every State , acting in convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified and rendered binding upon the people of all the States ; and , in the language of Mr. Jefferson , the Government thus formed was authorized to act immediately on the people and by its own officers . ' Was it then a league only ? No , it was what its framers , the people , as we have seen , and not the governments of all the States , called it , a Constitution -a ' Government ; * and it is an overthrow of fundamental princi pIes to say that a constitution , ' a government , ' which is made the supreme law'in all the States , could be created by any power less than the people of the several States , but as the people of the States , and not in their aggregate capacity . Whatever may be the theories of the advocates of consolidation on the one hand , or nullification on the other , this is certainly a true history of the manner in which the Government of the Union was formed . The Constitution itself expressly declares that it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ; ' and this Constitution was expressly rendered the supreme law of the land , ' anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding , ' - as if the government of a State could reader their own constitution subordinate to another constitution . A return then having taken place , in forming the Constitution to the people of all the States , as the primary fountain of power , they might have vested all their sovereignty , or but a part of it ; in one government ; and they might have given , in either event , the same power which exists in ordinary governments of enforcing its laws when sustained as constitutional by all its departments , subject only to the natural rights of the people to revolutionize the government in case of intolerable oppression . Certain important powers and attributes of* sovereignty the people of the States gave to this new government . They made this government supreme'in the exercise of its powers in all the States . They gave this government the sole power to declare war . ' Did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with absolute power to judge if the object of the war was constitutional , and annul the declaration ? This new government had the sole power to lay and collect duties on imports ; ' did each State remain an absolute sovereignty in this respect , and with absolute powers to judge if the object of the duties was // constitutional , and annul the law ? The General Government was the only sovereign as regards these powers ; but a single State , having none of these powers , is made the absolute judge whether they can or can not be exercised : then no powers have yet been granted to the General Government by any State , if each possesses the right to interdict the exercise of any of these powers . But , could this General Government exist without the authority to give one uniform effect to the execution of its powers in all the States ? Created with all the organs of a government , legislative , judicial , and executive , may it enact , , but not expound , or enact and expound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each State , and ask what power it possesses , and act upon the contradictory responses of each State ? Must it possess one set of powers in one State , and another and wholly opposite set of powers in another State ? May it lay a tariff in one State , and not in another and yet this tariff required to be uniform in every State ? Is it one constitution , and susceptible of one only true construction , or twenty-four constitutions , with twenty-four various and contradictory constructions , and all right , because all pronounced by absolute sovereigns exercising the uncontrolled power of ultimatejudgmcnt ? Has it any powers , and what are they ? Will Mississipi submit this question*to Massachusetts or Carolina , or is a goVernment created whose powers can not be ascertained ? Must anarchy govern ? Can there he no decision , or is that of a single State , or of a small minority of the States , to sweep away the legislation of a majority , or two thirds of the States ? According to the new theory , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one fourth in the last resort , to judge what powers each State may exercise , and the other States must submit . Now , this is impossible , where the legislation of the two States is contradictory ; and , if possible , is not a mere negative , but a positive power . It is a government without limitation of power , in a single State , aided by one fourth of the States  --  a government by which the minority may control the majority in all cases whatsoever . Thus , Carolina frames any law or ordinance she thinks she may lawfully do in the exercise of her reserved rights . She gives clearances for vessels , for instance , to introduce all imports free of all duties . When once introduced into Carolina , she has , or claims and exercises the right under the Constitution of introducing these imports free of all duties into every other State in the Union . Two thirds of the States have passed an act of Congress imposing certain duties on foreign imports : as separate States they can pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the Union . Can Carolina compel them to receive all foreign imports free of all duties ? Yet she says this is one of her reserved rights , and she may forever constitutionally exercise it , in defiance of an act of Congress passed by two thirds of the States . Such a government would be an oligarchy of the most odious and detestable character . The right of the people of any State , or of any portion of them , to meet intolerable oppression by revolution is certain ; but , in Mr. Jefferson 's rough draught of the Kentucky resolutions ( now attempted to be substituted for his deliberate conclusions as contained in the resolutions themselves ) , does he advocate nullification by a single State as a constitutional remedy , by a State remaining in the Union and submitting only to such laws as it deemed valid . No ; it was not as a constitutional , but as a NATURAL right , ' that Mr. Jefferson spoke of nullification by the people of a State . I say the people , for Mr. Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nullify , as an artificial body politic , would be a contradiction in terms . This natural right ' is a personal , as contradistinguished from a State right ; it is inalienable-it // is neither given nor reserved by constitutional compacts-it exists in citizens of every State , the minority as well as the majority , and not in the government of any one State . But the exercise of this right is revolution-it is a declaration of independence-it is war , and appeals to the sword as its umpire . Let no State , then , claim to stand on the basis of the Constitution of the Union , while stripping it of its vital powers , or setting up its will for law . No , the ordinance of Carolina is not a peaceful , constitutional remedy : it is a nullification of the Government itself , sweeping away its revenues , its courts , and its officers ; it is a repeal of the Union ; it is despotic ; it is revolutionary ; it is belligerent ; it is a declaration of war or separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for , whether the Tariff be repealed or not , it asks to engraft the doctrine of nullification as a permanent feature of the Constitution , applicable in every case in which any State may deem any act of Congress unconstitutional . Then each one of the States may take up the volumes containing all the acts of Congress , and repeal them all by one sweeping edict of nullification ; for there is no limitation to the exercise of the power but her own will . It is said no State will abuse the power ; but if a majority of the States , by their representatives in Congress , may abuse delegated powers , is there no danger that one of these same States , by their representatives at home , may mistake the nature of their powers , and endanger the Union by a usurpation of power ? Or do the same people , and voting at the same period in any State , elect men to Congress who will violate , and to the councils of the State , who will uniformly preserve the Constitution ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war be nullified , or , by the new theory , suspended , till , by a slow and tedious process , its constitutionality be affirmed by three fourths of the States ? But , in the mean time , all hos tile operations must cease , our army be disbanded , our navy recalled , and no further supplies decreed of money , ammunition , or men . And when one State thus nullifies any act of Congress , she is not required to be sustained by the vote of any other State : the one fourth are only required to refuse to actto remain neutral-if they consider the act of Congress inexpedient , although they believe it constitutional . Suppose the New-England States , after the war was pronounced unconstitutional by a single State , had refused to call a convention to amend the Constitution , or , if called , to grant the disputed power ; then the war must have been abandoned , the minority must govern , and our country be disgraced , our seamen permitted to be pressed from the very decks of our vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established without even a struggle in defence of our liberties . Shall opposition to the Tariff betray us into the support of doctrines so utterly subversive of the Constitution , and inconsistent with the existence of any government of the Union ? Once this power was threatened to be assumed by Massachusetts , now by South Carolina , and how and by what State it will next be exercised , or what vital power it may next strike from the Constitution , it is impossible to predict ; but , if permitted in one State , it will be exercised by all , till not a vestige remains of the Constitution of the Union . Suppose the Tariff repealed by Congress , nullification may annul the repealing law . Louisiana may , in the exercise of her right of ultimate judgment , declare that the repealing law is unconstitutional , upon the pretext that it destroys rights vested by the first law and violates the plighted faith of the Government , insist on the collection of duties under the first law , pass her ordinance , array her State officers against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mississippi , and of all the Western States , or cornpel // the collection of the present duties . Or she may say that , if Congress possesses no power to lay duties which will operate an incidental protection , Louisiana possesses the reserved right of imposing duties for that purpose ; that each State possessed it before it became a member of the Union ; that duties for revenue only can be collected by the General Government , and that the residuary power to lay duties for protection is one of the powers of a sovereign State ; that she will exercise it , and impose protecting duties on imports , and thus we shall have various and conflicting State tariffs from Maine to Lousiana ( the very object which the Constitution was designed to prevent ) ; but if Louisiana alone adopt the measure , the commerce of the West is prostrate at her feet . It is in the name of liberty and to protect minorities , that nullification professes to act ; while in its first ordinance it swee s away the dearest rights of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom of conscience in adamantine chains . It deprives American citizens of that last and hitherto sacred refuge from oppression , a trial by an impartial jury , and requires the very judges upon the bench and jurors within the box to be sworn to condemn the unhappy man whose only crime was this : that he claimed the G6vemment of the Union as his birthright , and acknowledged the duty of obedience to its laws . Such are the opening scenes of nullification ; and , if not arrested , where or how will the drama close ? In all the horrors of civil war . Turn your eyes upon the scenes of the French Revolution , and behold them about to be reacted within the limits of a sister State . Already nullification calls upon its twelve thousand bayonets ; friend is rising against friend , and brother against brother , under the banner of Carolina on the one side , of the Union on the other ; the inflammable materials are ready , the spark approaches , the explosion may soon take place , and the genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carolina , spread her pinions , and wing her way forever from a world , on one side of whose waters despotism reigns triumphant , and , upon the other , anarchy , with one foot upon the scroll of the Declaration of American Independence , and with the other upon the broken tablet of the Constitution of the Union , shall wave that sceptre , whereon shall be inscribed the motto , never to be effaced : Man is incapable of self-government . ' Yes , this is the best , the brightest , the last experiment of self-government : universal freedom or universal bondage is staked on the result of the success or failure of the American Union ; and as it shall be maintained and perpetuated , or broken and dissolved , the light of liberty shall beam upon the hopes of mankind , or be forever extinguished , amid the scoffs of exulting tyrants and the groans of a world in bondage . Rising , then , above all minor considerations , and lifting our souls to the contemplation of that lofty eminence on which Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only guardians of the hopes and liberties of mankind , let us act as becomes the depositaries of that sacred fire which burns on the altars of the American Union , and resolve that this Union shall be preserved , all whole and inviolate , as we received it from the hands of our forefathers . But , if nullification is not a constitutional remedy , we are told that secession is ; and a few , who deny the one , admit the other ; and our venerable chief magistrate ( Jackson ) has been proclaimed as a Federalist , because he denies the right of secession ; and many of his supporters , although some may not concur in every argument by which he arrives at his conclusions , but concur in the conclusions themselves , are visited with a similar denunciation . Sir , the President is one of the fathers and founders of the Democratic party-one of its earliest and most steadfast supporters , // qwq they had formed a PERPETUAL Union . ' The original compact of Carolina with her sister States , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perpetual Union . ' In the thirteenth article of this confederacy , it is expressly declared that the Union shall be perpetual ; ' and in the ratification of this compact , South Carolina united with her sister States in declaring : And we do further solemnly plight and enga* e the faith of our respective constituents ' that the Union shall le perpetual ; ' and may she now withdraw this pledge without a violation of the compact ? By the old confederacy , then , the Union was perpetual ; and the declared object of the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union ' than that existing under the former confederacy . Now , would this Union be more perfect under the new than The old confederacy , if by the latter the Union was perpetual , but , under the former , limited in its duration at the will of a single State ? The advocates of secession claim the constitutional power for each State to annul , not only any law which the State may deem unconstitutional , but to abolish the Constitution itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , Carolina granted certain powers to the General Government : may she constitutionally alter or revoke the grant , in a manner repugnant to the provisions of that Constitution ? That instrument points out the mode in which it may be changed or abrogated , and by which the several States may assume all or any of the powers granted to the General Government , namely , by the conjoint action of three fourths of the States . What , then , are the powers reserved to the State ? The ninth article of the Constitution of the Union declares that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ' Then the powers delegated to the United States were not reserved to the States or to the people . What is the meaning of the clause or to the people , ' as contradistinguished from the States ' ? Does it mean that any of this mass of undefined powers , but embracing all not granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States in the aggregate ? Then there would exist , and does now exist , a consolidated despotism . No , it was to the people of each State the reservation was made . Then it follows , as a necessary consequence , that none of the powers granted to the General Government were reserved either to the States or the people of any State . That is , so far as the people of any one State had granted , by their own separate constitution , to the State government any powers not delegated to the General Government , the government of the State might exercise these powers , and so far as any of these undelegated powers were not granted to the State government , by the people of the State , they were reserved to the people of each State . Now , one of the powers reserved to the people of each State is to change their form of State government , and resume the powers granted by it . But we have seen that neither the government or people of a State could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was not one of the rights reserved to either . What ! I am asked , can not the people of a State abolish their form of government ? Yes , in two modes : one in accordance with the Constitution , and the other by a revolution . Could the people of Carolina or Mississippi change or abolish their State constitution , except in the mode prescribed by that instrument , unless by a revolution ? And the same power , the people of Carolina , that formed for them their State constitution , ratified and rendered obligatory upon them the Constitution of the Union ; and can the one and not the other he abolished , except by a revolution , in any other mode than that prescribed by the Constitution ? No ; // the people of Carolina , and of all the States , as distinct communities , in ratifying the Constitution of the Union , renderered it binding upon the people of every State , by the declaration that this Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land , and that the judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . ' Here we see the distinction between the State and the people of the State again recognized and confirmed , and the State , ' by its laws , ' and the people of the State , by the formation of a constitution , expressly prohibited from arresting the operation of the Constitution of the United States , as the supreme law of the land , ' in every State . ' If Carolina secede , she must form a constitution , by which she will assume the powers granted to the General Government , and vest them in the government of the State . Here she would be met by the former act of the people of Carolina , declaring that they had abandoned the power to form for themselves a constitution by which the Constitution of the Union would cease within their limits to be the supreme law of the land . ' Nor did the framers of the Constitution mean to say only that the then existing Constitutions of the States ratifying the compact should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , only the existing laws of any State were required to be subordinate to the Constitution of the Union ; but both are placed on the same basis . The power of a State to nullify by its laws , or secede by forming a new constitution , are both denied in the same clause and sentence of the American Constitution . The language is clear , that the Constitution of the Union shall be the supreme law of the land , ' and binding in every State , ' anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . ' The terms are shall be ; ' it is the language of command , it is prospective , it was binding when subscrib ed , now , and forever . Or , was Carolina never bound by this compact , and might she , the very day after it was ratified by her people , disregard it altogether , secede , and establish a constitution directly repugnant to the Constitution of the Union ? If so , written constitutions are worse than useless ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their violation ; obedience to then can not be enforced ; there is no govern ment but that of opinion , fluctuating and uncertain , undefined and undefinable , which is paramount to the fundamental law . This is what the despots of Europe call our government , and why they predict its downfall  --  a prediction now in the course of fulfilment , if these anarchic4l principles can be recognized as the doctrines of the Constitution . There is no difference between the doctrines or acts of Jefferson and Jackson on this subject . Both admit nullification or secession as a revolutionary measure ; and the new doctrine of suspending a law by a nullifying edict finds not the remotest support from Mr. Jefferson . In his celebrated draught of the Kentucky resolutions , so much relied on by Carolina , we have seen , he speaks of these powers of the people of any State as a natural right , ' and so is revolution ; and the cases to which he refers are such as render a revolution unavoidable , namely , if Congress pass an act so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration that the compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the General Government . ' Is there now such a case ? if there is , revolution is justifiable . Why then ask any other remedy than revolution for a case where revolution would be unavoidable ? And 5E0E5510N IS REvOLUTION . But did Mr. Jefferson mean to say that whenever any State should place its laws or Constitution , by nullification or secession , in opposition to the laws of the General Government , that the power of the General Government must not be exerted ? The very reverse . The act // of Congress of the 3d of March , 1807 , signed and approved by Mr. Jefferson as President , expressly authorizes the President of the United States to employ such part of the land and naval force of the United Statcs as may be necessary ' to execute the laws of the United States . ' Does this mean , as General Hayne tells us in his proclamation , to execute the laws against insurgents not sustained by any law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very time when Pennsylvania was proceeding , by virtue of a law of the State , to execute , by an armed force , the mandate of the State in opposition to the mandate of the Federal authorities ; and the officer of Pennsylvania , acting under the mandate of the Governor and a positive law of the State , was condemned for executing a law of the State opposed to the mandate of the General Government , and only escaped punishment by the pardon of President Madison : and thus falls the very basis of the doctrine of nullification . Here is a commentary by Messrs . Jefferson and Madison , demonstrating their entire concurrence with our present Chief Magistrate . And , if any further evidence of Mr. Jefferson 's views were wanting , it is to be found in his letters , already referred to , protesting against a separation of the Union , and denying the right of a State to veto ' an act of Congress ; and in many other letters to be found in his memoirs , insisting upon the power even of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the States . Compulsion , ' he says , was never so easy as in our case , where a single frigate would levy on the commerce of a State the deficiency of its contributions ; nor more safe than in the hands of ? on9'ress , which has always shown that it would wait , as it ought to do , to the last extremities , before it would exercise any of its powers which are disagreeable . ' Here , then , we find Mr. Jefferson most distinctly admitting the power of Congress under the old , as in 1807 he admitted under the present confederacy , to compel a State by FORCE to ohey the laws of the Union . Why , then , is General Jackson denounced as a tyrant , for doing that which his oath and the Constitution compel him to do ? Suppose any State , by its ordinance , should arrest the passage of the mail through their limits , upon the pretext that the law was unconstitutional : the acts of Congress place at the disposal of the President the militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land or naval force of the United States , ' to execute the w of the Union in every State , hy whomsoever resisted or opposed . The Constitution and his oath command him to execute the laws ; he must execute them , and the mail must pass on , though the edict of a single State should attempt to arrest it by nullification or secession . Such , too , was the opinion of Mr. Jefferson ; and that illustrious patriot would have laid his head on the block , and blessed the hand that severed it from his body , rather than sever the Union by the promulgation of the doctrines now ascribed to him . What are the consequences of this right of a State to secede from the Union ? - this right of revolution , without the power of the General Government to preserve the Union ? Any one State may arrest , to-morrow , the mail of the Union , and its passage from State to State , and refuse it a passage forever . Pennsylvania , a central State , may separate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country a republic divided and indefensible . Louisiana , purchased by taxes imposed upon the people of all the States , may secede and establish a separate and independent government , lay protective or prohibitory imposts on the imports and exports of this State and of the West , carried through her ports and the outlets of the Mississippi . She might say , I will protect my own cotton planters , by prohibitbry duties on the cotton of Mississippi or the West , or the imports designed to be // exchanged for it , shipped through my ports or through the outlet of the Mississippi : it is my interest to do so ; for thus I can deprive the cotton planters of Mississippi and the West of a market ; thus compel them to abandon the culture of that staple , and sell my own cotton at a higher price . Louisiana asserts no such doctrines ; but , if she did , could Mississippi , could the West admit them ? and , in the last resort would not the Government force a passage for our imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well might you take the heart from the human body and bid it live , as sever Louisiana from the States that border on the Mississippi , and bid these States to prosper . No ; Louisiana holds the outlet of that stream through which the life blood of their commerce and industry must forever flow ; and we never could admit her right to secede from the Union , and dictate the terms on which we should use the outlet of that stream , whose b&amp;nks were destined by heaven itself as the residence of a united people . Not only Louisiana , but State by State that borders on the Atlantic or the GuIg might secede , seclude the West from the ocean , and render them the tributaries of the seaboard States , by laying prohibitory duties on their imports and exports . Could we submit to this ? Not sc/die the West contained a gun to use , or a man to shoulder it . And may Carolina secede and establish an independent government ? Did she establish her own independence ? No , it was achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the banner of the Union floating over them . I know the valor of Carohina , that , man to man , she is invincible ; but , unaided and alone , she would have fislien in the Revolution . She would have fallen gloriously , her soil would have drunk the blood of her children ; but still she must have fallen in the unequal contest . When Carolina was made the battlefield of the Revolution , from the very rock of Plymouth and the heights of Bunker Hill , from Pennsylvania , from Yirginia , American citizens flew to her rescue . Side by side with Carolina 's sons they marched beneath the banner of the Union ; they fought , they conquered ; Carolina was redeemed front bondage , but upon her many and well-fought fields was mingled the blood and repose the ashes of our common ancestors , the pledges of our Union in victory and in death . Shades of these departed patriots ! arise , and say to the sons of Carolina , it was the Union that made you free . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slaves ; without it , the chains are now forging that will bind you to the thrones of despots . And could we stand with folded arms , and behold the Union dissolved ? Could we see the seventeen thousand freemen of Carolina , who cling with the grasp of death to the banner of the Union , deprived of their privileges as American citizens , proscribed , disfranchised , expelled from all offices , civil and military , driven by glittering bayonets from the bench and the jury box , tried and convicted by judges and jurors sworn to condemn , attainted as traitors , torn from the last embraces of wives and children , consigned to the scaffold or the block , or immured within the walls of a dungeon , where the light of heaven or liberty should never visit them , with no consolation but their patriotism , and no companions but their chains ? And , gracious Heaven , for what ? Oh ! Liberty , when was thy sacred temple profaned by deeds like this ? Thy martyrs suffered only for clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them torn from around that sacred banner , and move not to their rescue ? No ; the glow that beams on every countenance , the patriot 's answer that speaks from every throbbing breast , proclaims that , as in 76 our fathers marched to free their sires from tyrants ' power , so would their children go , to save from death or bondage Carolina 's friends of union-with them , // beneath the standard of our common country , to die or conquer . Citizens of Mississippi , to you the address of the nullifying convention of Carolina makes a special appeal . It asks , if Carolina secedes from the Union , Can it be believed that Georgia , Mississippi , Tennessee , and even Kentucky would continue to pay a tribute of fifty per cent . upon their consumption to the Northern States for the privilege of being united to them , when they could receive all their supplies through the ports of South Carolina , without . paying a single cent for tribute ? ' To this question , Georgia has already answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her firm resolve to adhere to the Union . Tennessee has made the same response . Kentucky , in a voice of thunder , answers , No , we will preserve the Union as it is . And will Mississippi receive the bribe thus offered to dissolve the Union ? What is it ? The privilege of exchanging our exports for imports free of duty , in the ports of Carolina ; and then would Carolina pay the taxes to raise and maintain an army , or a navy , and protect our commerce ? But if she could , nature pronounces the project impracticable . Our commerce must flow through the outlet of the Mississippi ; and how would our exports reach the ports of Carolina-how would our imports thence be received ? Through the outlet of the Mississippi ? No , that outlet and its ports would then be in the hands of Louisiana-in that event , to us a hostile foreign government from which we had severed ourselves . For let it not be forgotten that Louisiana is not even invited to join this new confederacy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adhere to the Union as it is . Then , through the outlet of the Mississippi our commerce could not be carried on with the ports of Carolina ; for Louisiana , as we have seen before , would meet and stop our exports and imports with prohibitory duties . Would we move up the Mississippi or Ohio to reach the ports of Carolina , or any other market ? There we would find the confederates from whom we had severed ; we would find a foreign government , and prohibitory duties would exclude our access to Carolins 's ports in that direction . How would we reach them ? The only other route , if Georgia and Alabama would grant the boon for Carolina 's benefit , would be to pass through those States by land to Charleston , with our cotton , and return by land with the imports received in exchange . A trip of one thousand miles by wagon road with cotton ! The entire value of the crop would not pay for its transportation . Is this the proposition of Carolina ? What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoning the culture of cotton upon our fertile lands , for the benefit of Carolina , and our planters all becoming drovers of horses , mules , and cattle , to exchange for her imports , and return with them , packed on the number unsold of our mules and horses . And are these the benefits for which we are asked to dissolve the Union , and place the channel of the Misissippi above and below , and its outlet , in the hands of a foreign government , denying a passage ascending or descending , to our imports or exports , and excluding us from the ocean altogether ? If Carolina 's scheme were practicable , Mississippi would not sell the Union for dollars and cents ; but though the scheme might be beneficial to Carolina , by stopping the culture of cotton on our fertile soil , to the people of this State it is ruin immediate and inevitable . The remedy Carolina proposes to us for the Tariff , is worse than the disease . The disease is not mortal-it is now in a course of cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dis8olutiom of the Union i8 political suicide . A Southern convention is proposed , of the States of North and South Carolina , Tennessee , Yirginia , Georgia , Alabama , // and Mississippi . If the object be a confederacy of these States , without Louisiana and the Western , Middle , and Northern State3 , if patriotism , or love for the Union were insufficient to restrain us from attempting this fatal measure , we have seen that it would blast forever the fortunes of the planters of Mississippi . But what States will unite in this convention ? Georgia has disavowed the act of the self-constituted , seW-elected minority convention that acted in her name . The history of Virginia speaks in the voice of indignant rebuke to all those States that assemble sectional conventions . North Carolina , unassuming , but steadfast in support of the Union , will enter into no such convention . Alabama , if her public meetings and journals a d her chief magistrate speak the voice of the State , will send no delegates . Tennessee , brave and patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war and in peace , meets the proposition with a decided refusal . I imagine , then , our delegates would return without finding this Southern convention . I am opposed to all sectional conventions . We have had one such convention , and , whatever the secret motives of its members may have been , the very fact that it was a sectional convention , that it was believed to b* convened to calculate the value of the Union , that it was supposed to have in view an Eastern confederacy , has sealed the doom of its members and projectors . And when the calm shall follow the storm , a similar fate awaits all who will go into this Southern convention . I trust there never will be another partial convention , Northern , Southern , Eastern , or Western ; for , whether assembeld at Hartford or Columbia , they are equally dangerous to the Union of the States . They create and inflame geographical parties . Could the North , assembled in convention , have that full knowledge of the situation and wants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and propose ultimatums to voL. ur.  - -  13 which the South must submit , or leave the Union ? Could the South possess that full knowledge of the situation and wants and interests of the people of all the other States , as to enable them to dictate the terms on which the Union should be governed or dissolved ? No ; it is only in a meeting of all the States , in Congress or convention , that that knowledge of the wants and interests of all , and that fesion of sentiment and opinion , and spirit of concession , can exist , in which the Constitution was framed , and all its powers should be exercised . If e hold Southern conventions , then will there be Northern , Eastern , and Western conventions , and they will overthrow the Union . Partial confederacies will first be formed , and then , as Mr. Jefferson most truly tells us , would speedily follow the formation of a separate and independent government by each State . What is it we are asked to abandon , and for what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gave birth to the Declaration of Independence ; which carried our armies victoriously through the storms of the Revolution and the last war , and now waves triumphantly in every sea , the kindred emblem of our country 's glory . It gave us Washington-it gave us liberty , and bears our name aloft among the nations of the earth . It is our only rampart in war-our only safeguard in peace , and under its auspices we declared , achieved , maintained , and can alone preserve our liberties . It is the only basis of our solid and substantial interests and the last star of hope to the oppressed of every clime . Shall we calculate its value ? No ! for we will not estimate the value of liberty  --  and liberty and union are inseparable . ' Dissolve this Union , and let each State become , as Mr. Jefferson truly tells us it would , a separate government , could we preserve our liberties ? Where would be the army and navy and seamen of the State of Mississippi ? how to be procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid ? Where would be her ambassadors and treaties , her commerce-and through what ports and by whose permission would she ship her exports or introduce her imports ? Who would respect her flag , who recognize her as a nation  --  and how would she punish aggressions upon her rights , on the ocean or the land ? No , fellow citizens ; the President truly tells us that separate independence ' is a dream '  --  a dream from which we would wake in bondage or in death . But , if disgraced abroad , what would be our situation at home , as separate bordering and hostile States  --  and how long could we remain in peace and concord ? The voice of history tells us  --  the bloodstained fields of our sister republics of America proclaim , that disunion would be the signal for wAn  --  a war of conquest , in which the weak would fall before the power of the strong ; and upon the ruins of this now happy Union might arise the darkest despotism that ever crushed the liberties of mankind , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bayonet . Perhaps , while yet the civil war should rage with doubtful issue , while exhausted and bleeding at every pore , that sanguinary alliance of despots , combined to crush the liberties of man , would send its armies to our shores . Under what standard would we rally to preserve our liberty ? There would be no Union-without it there would be no strength ; and those who , united , could defy the world in arms , divided would be weak and powerless . Such are the ultimate results of disunion . Let us take the first step , and all may be lost forever . That step is nullification by Carolina , then her secession-then , as she truly tells us in her address , the separation of South Carolina would inevitably produce a general dissolution of the Union . ' And shall Carolina dissolve the Union ? No ; the liberties of all the States are embarked together , and if one State withdraw her single plank , the national vessel must go down to rise no more , and shipwreck the hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the ties of our common country and common kindred - by the ruin and disgrace which civil war will bring upon the victors and vanquished-by the untried horrors of those scenes to which disunion must conduct , to repeal her ordinance , and not to force upon us that dread alternative , in which we must support the flag of our country , or surrender our Union and liberty without a struggle : that we can not , we will not , we dare not , surrender them ; and , if forced to draw the sword to defend our liberties , the motto will gleam on every blade : The Union shall be preserved . ' Por were it abandoned , life would not be a blessing , but a curse ; and happiest would those be whose eyes were closed in death ere they beheld the horrors of those scenes to which with viewless and rapid strides we seem to hasten .
