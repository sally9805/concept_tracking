Characters . LAWRENCE . CHARLES . HENRY . FRANK . PAUL . Main text A study . FRANK seated at a table , with an open book before him . Beside the book upon the table , are pen , paper , ink and a globe . FRANK , ( sighing. )  --  My head feels fairly dizzy over these problems , yet I am resolved to conquer them . It will be a disappointment to my dear father , if I do not take the prize at this examination , for I resolved to compensate him for last year 's disappointment , by being very studious . My history , geography , and grammar I have but little fear about , but mathematics are so hard for me , and Latin is terrible . Enter HENRY , PAUL , CHARLES , and LAWRENCE . HENRY .  --  Come , Frank , we are going up to Turtle Rock for a boat race , and want you ! FRANK , ( eagerly. )  --  A boat race ! What boats ? CHARLES .  --  The Undine and Serpent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LAWRENCE .  --  Yes , the best regatta of the season . Come , we are in a hurry ! FRANK , ( rising. )  --  I 'll be ready in five minutes . No ! Resumes his seat . I can not go . LAWRENCE .  --  Oh , nonsense ! You must go ! FRANK .  --  I can not , I have set myself a task to do first . CHARLES , ( looking at books. )  --  Conic sections ! Ugh ! LAWRENCE .  --  Oh , bother conic sections ! FRANK .  --  I wish I could , for they certainly bother me ! PAUL .  --  Must you stay , Frank ? FRANK .  --  Yes , Paul . Father wants me to try for the prize , this year . LAWRENCE .  --  You are ambitious , then ? Laughs sneeringly . FRANK .  --  Is that a crime , Larry ? LAWRENCE  --  That is a very nice question , Frank . HENRY .  --  We can spare a little time , and Frank evidently wants a rest from his conic sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I propose the question . Is ambition a vice or a virtue ? All take seats . LAWRENCE .  --  Were there no ambitions men , it appears to me that progress must be ended , science would come to a stand-still , and the world stagnate . What truly great man ever left the world a benefactor to his fellow-man , who was not spurred from height to height by ambition ? CHARLES .  --  Yet an ambitious man in history is considered a vicious man by many writers . We find the quality classed with pride and unscrupulous conduct , while Scripture condemns it , in more than one place . FRANK .  --  Ambition led Watt to the highest rounds of the ladder of science . PAUL .  --  Ambition caused Satan to be cast from heaven ! LAWRENCE .  --  Like every quality given to man , ambition may lead him either to perfection or ruin . True ambition appears to me the pure honest desire to excel in whatever we undertake , provided always that we do not suffer our selfish desire to rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or violating the commands of God . Every lawyer should enter the bar with the aim and hope of becoming a judge ; every poet should aspire to being a second Shakespeare ; every scientific scholar should hope to discover power as great as steam or magnetism ; every soldier should look forward to becoming a general ; and every schoolboy should aim at the head of his class , for only that desire and hope of rising , can make us aim at perfection in the condition of life we occupy at starting . The man who is content to plod along in the lowest ranks , will be found to be indolent , sluggish , and worthless . PAUL .  --  Yet Bacon says , " Ambition is like anger which makes men full of alacrity if it is not checked , but if it is checked in any manner , and not able to have its own way , it becomes malign and venomous . " Now if Bacon is right , we can scarcely consider ambition as a virtue , since it may lead to such disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a vice . FRANK .  --  Yet , without ambition , how much of man 's natural dignity would be lost , since it spurs to exertion all his highest intellectual powers ? Without it , man would be content to be a poor , debased creature , allowing the powers of his brain to rust for want of energy to cultivate and apply them ; he could never rise in his profession , having no ambition to reach its highest point . Like every other good gift it is the abuse and not the use of ambition 's fire , that leads to sin . Kept within proper bounds , is a noble quality , leading to perfection . CHARLES .  --  But the trouble is , how to limit it ! A good man looks upon content as a virtue ; yet an ambitious man never knows content ! However powerful he may be , his insatiable passion , ambition , spurs him forward to grasp higher powers , unheeding whom he may overthrow in his selfish progress , often letting desire usurp the place of justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heights life was not long enough to scale . LAWRENCE .  --  No one can deny that the grades of ambition vary with each nature , and that in some the passion becomes a dangerous and sinful striving for mere wordly advantage . Yet because ungoverned minds become weakened by their own unlimited desires , it does not follow that ambition itself becomes a vice . We might as well say that fire is an evil , because sometimes it destroys , instead of ministering to our own comfort . Ambition is the strongest incentive to perseverance , and difficulties will sink before it , where they had appeared mountain high . Take , for instance , our great travellers , explorers and discoverers , where could they have gained the energy that led them through heat and cold , exposure and danger , doubt and difficulty , had not ambition kept alive their hope and courage ? PAUL .  --  Yet inordinate ambition is but the sin of covetousness under another name , for what is coveting , save desiring that which does not belong to us ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth ; to tyranny , after power is gained ; to disappointment when the glittering bubble we pursue turns to tinsel in our grasp . FRANK .  --  Without ambition no great deed was ever accomplished . It is a guiding-star to the wise and good , only a snare to the vain and foolish . CHARLES .  --  Ambition caused Napoleon to deluge Europe with blood ! LAWRENCE .  --  Ambition led Benjamin Franklin to the most wonderful discoveries in Electricity . PAUL .  --  Ambition made Richard the Third a murderer . FRANK .  --  And Washington a father to his country . HENRY .  --  Very well argued on both sides . Frank , have you Lilly 's Midas ? FRANK .  --  Not here , HENRY .  --  Then I must trust to memory . He says , " Ambition hath but two steps ; the lowest Blood ; the highest envy . " while Crown on the other hand says : " Ambition is a spirit in the world , That causes all the ebbs and flows of nations , Keeps mankind sweet by action ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud . " So we close the debate by deciding that : Ambition ruled by Religion and Reason is a virtue : unchecked and maddened by Vanity and Covetousness it is a vice ! CHARLES .  --  It is time for us to be off now , boys . Frank , are you sure you can not join us ? FRANK .  --  I will work hard till I have conquered my appointed task , and then , if it is not too late , will come after you . LAWRENCE .  --  Good-bye , then , we will not detain you any longer from your work . ALL .  --  Good-bye ! All go out , except FRANK . FRANK .  --  I think I may trust my ambition , since its aim now is to gratify my father , and prove myself worthy another slate , and then to work again . Goes out .
