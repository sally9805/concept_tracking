SCENE I.  --  An Apartment in the Doctor 's House .  --  Table set , with supper for two .  --  Doctor Iodyne and Miss Penelope discovered at table . Doctor . Doctor Iodyne Sister ! sister ! sister ! you 'll drive me mad . I know that young scapegrace , Harry Rocket , is after my ward , and you wish to make me believe you are the object of his adoration . If I was n't so angry I could laugh at your folly . Pooh ! pooh ! pish ! Miss Penelope . Miss Penelope Iodyne Laugh at my folly ! Brother ! brother ! rather repine at your own want of penetration . I really am ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or the other , I will force you to confess yourself wrong . If , as you will persist in affirming , your plan of treating your ward , Miss Emily , as a child , has succeeded in convincing her she is one , and everybody else , how do you reconcile what you foolishly assert , that Mr. Rocket ( a young man of his experience , too ) has fallen in love with her , a perfect child ? How do you reconcile these contradictory opinions ? Doct . Doctor Iodyne Pooh ! pooh ! pish ! How do I reconcile these ideas ? How can any man reconcile impossibilities ? and yet does not this infernal thing they call love do it ? You know as well as myself , sister , that Emily is no longer a child , but will be to night eighteen years old , and by her father 's will is to be considered of age , and although my plan is an excellent one , and has so far succeeded to my wish ( for she has not the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her fortune ) , if this infernal Mr. Harry Rocket ( I wish he were a sky-rocket , and would go off ) had not been encouraged by you to visit here , I have no doubt I might keep her ignorant of her age , until my son , Washington , was old enough to marry her , and keep the fortune in the family . But now , although she denies it , I am convinced this young jackanapes has been making love to her , and this all comes through your folly . A woman of your age having danglers after you ! pooh ! pooh ! pish ! Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne I do not understand you , sir . A woman of my age , indeed ! My age ! Thank heaven , men of a certain age think differently . And as for danglers , as you vulgarly term the poor young men who can not help seeing with other eyes than yours , brother , and choose to tell me so , I shall encourage or discourage them , as I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Iodyne Right , sister , right ! I applaud you . Act according to the dictates of your maiden modesty . I 'm sure if age begets experience , and is capable of giving advice , your maiden modesty may well dictate ; for ' pon my soul it 's old enough . Pooh ! pooh ! pish ! Maiden modesty ! a maiden fiddlestick ! But do as you please , sister . I shall also act as my mature wisdom dictates , and prevent any of the sparks who wish to get the blind side of you , and whom you foolishly choose to encourage , from having any intercourse with my ward . Pooh ! pooh ! pish ! Do n't tell me . I know the world . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Bridling during his speech . And if you do know the world , brother , I am sorry you profit so little by your knowledge , as to use such language to the delicate and susceptible ears of a sensitive female . Get the blind side of me , indeed ! Believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use them in such a way as will relieve you of my presence , and keep them open to conduct an establishment of my own . Blind side of me , indeed . Exit , R. H. Doct . Doctor Iodyne Pooh ! pooh ! pish ! If you want to make a fool of yourself , go and make a fool of yourself . Who the devil hinders you ? But remember , an old fool is the worst kind of fool ! " The delicate and susceptible ears of a sensitive female ! " Curse me if I do n't believe she has been studying the dictionary for appropriate words for a young lady to use when first under the influence of the tender passion . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Whoever is foolhardy enough to marry you must have a pretty tough passion , and a strong imagination to think he passes a honeymoon ! Rings bell several times . Where the devil can that fellow , Hiram , be ? Rings . Curse the fellow ! Rings very loud . Enter Hiram , L. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctor Iodyne Am I to ring here all night ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , I reckon you are boss here , and can do just as you 're a mind to . Doct . Doctor Iodyne Pooh , pooh , pish ! I say am I to ring the bell fifty times for you ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Ring the bell fifty times for me ? If it 's my work I understand it . I want to know if you hired me to ring the bell ? Doct . Doctor Iodyne Hiram , do n't put me in a passion . I want to know how many times I am to ring the bell for you , before you attend to it ?  --  that 's plain , ai n't it ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , squire , I guess it wo n't want much cyphering , but I want to know what in all natur , I 'm to ring that bell for ? Doct . Doctor Iodyne Pooh , pooh , pish ! Hiram , yon have been recommended to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just suit my purpose , and I have no doubt you will . However , you do n't exactly comprehend me at present . It is customary when a bell is rung , to answer it immeadiately . Hir . Hiram Hireout Answer the bell ? Du tell ! Well , let the bell put a question to me  --  reckon I sha n't flummax , no how . Doct . Doctor Iodyne Aside . Now is this stupidity or impertinence ? Understand me  --  answering a bell , means to come to the person who rings it , and hear what that person has to say . Hir . Hiram Hireout Du tell ! Well , then , it means a darned sight more than it says  --  but I 'm on hand , squire . Doct . Doctor Iodyne I already told you partly what I wished you to do . Remember , no person must pass in or out of this house without your seeing them  --  any one that calls to see my sister  --  you know  --  Miss Penelope ? Hir . Hiram Hireout What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks like the last of pea-time on a pole ! Doct . Doctor Iodyne Ha , ha , ha ! Laughs aside. poetical , truly . Why , Hiram , I suppose you mean a lady , not very young or handsome  --  as I was saying , should any person call to see her , you must show them to her apartments , you understand ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Sartin . Doct . Doctor Iodyne If any one calls to see me , carry them to my study . Hir . Hiram Hireout Carry ' em into your study ? If they do n't heft more than 850 and they ai n't too constipatious . Doct . Doctor Iodyne Pooh , pooh , pish ! I do n't mean to carry them literally , but by figure of speech . Hir . Hiram Hireout Guess I left school afore I came to that figuring . Doct . Doctor Iodyne You comprehend me now  --  and in case you do not , this will probably tend to impress it on your mind . Going to give money . Hir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Iodyne I give you this as earnest of what I intend should you please me . Hir . Hiram Hireout You give it to me in earnest , do you , and I take it in earnest . Pockets it . That 's a fair trade , any how  --  I please you  --  you please me , by Judas ! Doct . Doctor Iodyne I am going out , should any one call and want me , say I shall be in very soon . Hir . Hiram Hireout Say you 're gone out , and you 'll be back when you come in . Doct . Doctor Iodyne Pooh , pooh , pish ! I shall be back in a short time . Aside . I must try this chap , but he ca n't impose on me . Exit . L. H. Hir . Hiram Hireout I have heerd of such things being in story books , as our sister Nance used to read out of on nights . Once upon a time , an old man had three sons , ( dad 's got nine ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  went to seek his fortune  --  and so on  --  and so on  --  and so forth . But what on airth is a comin now ? I hai'nt had chance to seek my fortin  --  fortin seeks me . Well , ' taint much wonder , as I heerd tell she was a woman . Enter Miss Penelope , R. H. Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Young man , are you the person the Doctor has engaged lately ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , should'nt wonder if I was . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne I like your countenance . Hir . Hiram Hireout Aside . She likes my countenance  --  she 's in love with me tu a certainty . If she makes love to me , I shall huckleberry right out ! Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne And I wish you to understand I may have it in my power to be of service to you . Hir . Hiram Hireout Aside . What 'll sister Nance say ? This beats all creation ! Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne I am aware I am placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Hir . Hiram Hireout Do n't du it  --  do n't ! Turns away . I shall split ! Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne To my brother 's ridicule . However , I think you will not betray me ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Looks around . I never betrayed a lady . This must be leap year , by matrimony  --  but I 'm o'er young to marry yet , as the Hungarian sings . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne The fact is there is a person I expeet will call  --  a young gentleman , to see me . He might possibly ask for Miss Emily . I wish you to show him up to my apartment . I would not wish him to see Miss Emily . She is too young to receive visits from young gentlemen , and  --  Hir . Hiram Hireout Aside . You 're too old to be afraid of ' em . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne And I do not approve of such very young ladies receiving visits from gentlemen . Hir . Hiram Hireout It 's bad for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she was only fifteen , and she died of the measles two weeks after . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne So you will please show him up to my apartments , that is if Mr. Rocket calls . Hir . Hiram Hireout Mr. Skyrocket ? Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne No , Mr. Harry Rocket . Hir . Hiram Hireout I 'll try if her head 's as soft as her heart . Aside . First cousins , I reckon ; I never knowed any of the family but Squire Congreve Rocket , and he left our place in a pesky huff , and nobody ha' n't seen anything of him since  --  Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne What caused him to leave in such a manner ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , ' twar n't much , anyhow . You see , ' t was fourth of July , and Josh Higgins , Seth Sprague , and Horseb , and Hemlock , and a hull lot o ' chaps , got on a kind o ' spree , down at Uncle Josh 's . Guess you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leetle the darndest , cutest critter you ever hearn tell on . May be you 've heern of Uncle Josh 's dog  --  got three of the greatest curiosities any canine ever had : his tail curls so tight his hind legs ca n't reach the ground ; fever and ague would n't hang to him  --  he was too lazy to shake ; and he 's so like Uncle Josh 's t' other dog , you ca n't tell t' other from which . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Most singular , indeed ! Hir . Hiram Hireout Quite odd it 's so singular , ai n't it ? Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne But to return to the subject of the sudden departure of Mr. Congreve Rocket ; I am interested by the name . Hir . Hiram Hireout Oh , yes ; to return to the subject , as the doctor said when he finished his cocktail , and cut off t' other leg . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Oh , shocking !  --  what a singular simile ! But go on . Hir . Hiram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that poked a stick in his eye ; " go on , " said he , then he chawed his head off . Well , ' t was last fourth of July , Uncle Josh comes down right early in his wagon , and calls a reg'lar meeting . Well , everybody knowed Uncle Josh 's notions were just about as big as Boston notions , and no town meetin ' ever was so chuck jam ( just as full as a gallon of cider with a pint of gin in it ) as that meetin ' tu hear what Uncle Josh had tu say . Well , Uncle Josh he gets up , and you never heard such a noise to get silence afore ; I guess they hollered more than a hull hour after they got silence ; Uncle Josh he sat down till they made out to holler silence the last time , when he gets up . Says he , " Gentlemen , " says he , " I never heerd so much silence afore ; and now , for fear this should be too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , I 'll take advantage of it . Well , " says he , " I reckon you all kind o ' expect I 've got suthin ' uncommon to tell you . " " Well , guess we do , " says all on them . " Well , you sha' n't be disappointed , " says he . " You 've all hearn about sich a thing as a balloon , ai n't ye ? " " Well , guess we have , " says all on ' em but Deacon Doubtful , and the Deacon gave a kind o ' grunt . Says Uncle Josh , " What in all creation do you mean by such hoggish behavior afore this ' ere meetin ' , on such a day as this ? " You see , Uncle Josh was a deacon himself , and kind o ' stuck up for their dignity . " Well , " says Deacon , " I mean if you ai n't got nothin ' else to tell us but what we have hearn on afore , and some on us do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move off . " " Deacon , " says Uncle Josh , lookin ' at him as hard as a stone wall , " Deacon , you ai n't got a right to a motion in this meetin ' , no how , and you know it ; so shet up , and hear me out . " Then Uncle Josh he looked round , and gently waved his hand  --  graceful like . " Well , " says he , " I hev brought down with me one of the lights of the age  --  one of that family as has riz higher in science "  --  now I 'm coming to the p'int . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Yes , yes , the family . Hir . Hiram Hireout " Riz higher in science , and throwed out more rays of light  --  " Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Yes . Hir . Hiram Hireout "  --  than any professor , lecturer , phrenologer , astrologer , or any other ologer of these or any other times . " " Where is he ? " says a hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Du tell ! " " Hold on , " says Uncle Josh , " all you 've got to du is to enjoy yourself reasonably , and do n't none on you get so sowed up that you ca n't see ; and at nine o'clock you must all on you come down to the four-acre piece each side of my barn , and I 'll introduce all on you to Squire Congreve Rocket , as I said afore , the greatest light of the age , and if he do n't go a little ahead of all your expectations , I 'll give up . He 'll show you an air railroad , and a new patent locomotive , and mount clear out of sight on his own hook , and Deacon Doubtful , you shall shake hands with the squire just afore he starts . " Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Wonderful ! Hir . Hiram Hireout War n't it ? Well , night come , and Uncle Josh 's four-acre piece land a pretty considerable scattering of heads with bodies tu ' em , I reckon , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agen the barn , where stood Uncle Josh with Squire Congreve Rocket , a ra'al tall , bunkum looking chap , dressed like a minister . " Well , " says Uncle Josh , " the squire is going to show you right off how he travels . He would make a speech to you , but he do n't speak our language . Come up here , Deacon Doubtful , and shake hands with the squire , and if he do n't astonish you , ' tai n't no matter . " So Deacon he gets up , pulls off his hat , and bows to Squire Rocket , and Uncle Josh he puts their hands together . " How de du , squire ? " says Deacon ; " glad to see you ; when do you start ? " The squire said nothin ' , but just then Uncle Josh clapped fire to his locomotive , and whiz , bang , let him drive , and away went the squire , with a tail of fire as long as a bean pole , and Deacon Doubtful lands about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shouts everybody , and that 's the last we see of Squire Congreve Rocket . It 's powerful astonishing how they du get steam so quick on these locomotives . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Bless me , you quite astonish me . Do you mean to say he ascended in the air ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Yes , right on eend . Why , these ere Rocket chaps are dreadful peert ; they 'd ascend on anything . They 're almighty fiery-tempered . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Yes , yes , but generous to a degree . Harry is full of the fire of chivalry . Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , I calculate they are all of ' em monstrous full of the fire of deviltry I should be most afeerd this Mr. Harry had a locomotive about him , and would go off some of these times . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Oh , you need not be alarmed , I assure you . He is a very gentlemanly young man . Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , guess he wo n't scare me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the day-time . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Why so ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Oh , I ai n't scared any , but it 's at night these rockets are kind o ' dangerous , and I feel scared on your account . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne I repeat , I know there is no danger at any hour . You are quite an entertaining , modest , well-behaved young person , and I hope you will accept this for my sake . Gives money . Mind , for my sake , and I again assure you there is no danger . I declare , quite a conversible person , and very considerate . Exit R. H. Hir . Hiram Hireout Bows Miss Penelope off with much ceremony .  --  looks at purse .  --  Pockets it . That ole woman 's soft enough to be peddled out for mush ! I shall watermellon ! ha , ha , ha ! Squire Congreve ! Well , goul darn it , if this do n't beat all natur ! Why , she must be a natral fool  --  nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . Hello ! Looking out . She 's a coming back  --  wants to buy another Yankee story , I reckon . Well , guess I can accommodate her at the same price . Goes up . Hannah . Hannah Not seeing him . What a life I do lead ! Heigho ! cooped up in that nursery , as it is called , from night till morning , and from morning till night . I declare it is too bad ! I shall entirely ruin my complexion , and not be fit to be seen . And really it is too ridculous  --  altogether too ridiculous to keep grown up people , I may say , like children all the days of their lives . Miss Emily , now , must be a matter of eighteen or nineteen years old  --  yes , that she must  --  she must be as old , or nearly as old as me , and I was twenty-one  --  last  --  let me see  --  last Hir . Hiram Hireout Last grass . Han . Hannah Let me see  --  Hir . Hiram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can see  --  them eyes war n't made for nothin . Han . Hannah Screams . Oh , lud , how you startled me ! Confined has made me quite nervis , I declare , and  --  Hir . Hiram Hireout Confinement made you narvos ? I should n't wonder if it did . Use Townsend 's Sarsaparills and a body brace , and you 'll get strong about the time the breth 's out of you . Han . Hannah Really , I  --  I Looks at him . Quite a decent figure . I suppose you are the young man as is just come ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Reckon I am just come in time to see you . Well , I swow , you are a little the prettiest critter ever was raised , if you ai n't I wish I may wear soap locks . Han . Hannah I declare he 's quite agreeable ! Curtseys . Hir . Hiram Hireout Aside . This ai n't bad tu take . Say you , I should like to be at a real huskin with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing improper . What 's a huskin ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Why  --  get out  --  why you  --  now you do n't  --  what 's a huskin ? Han . Hannah Yes , I want to know . Hir . Hiram Hireout Du tell  --  you want to know ? Why , where in Noah 's ark was you raised ? Han . Hannah Where was I raised ? Do you mean where was I born and brought up ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Should n't wonder if I did . Han . Hannah Why in England  --  in the old country . Hir . Hiram Hireout Oh , that accounts for it . How long have you been here ? Han . Hannah Only two months . Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , ' taint no wonder you do n't know what a huskin frolic is  --  some of your folks that write books , stay here more than two years , and do n't know what a Yankee is  --  they do n't know what to make on us . You see , we kind a like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make anything of us , anyhow  --  we can hang on our own hook , I reckon . Han . Hannah But what 's a huskin ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Wish to patience we was at one now . Well , ' taint no use tellin what a huskin is  --  but , I say you  --  what 's your name ? Han . Hannah Hannah ! Hir . Hiram Hireout Hannah ? Han . Hannah Yes . Hir . Hiram Hireout And mine 's Hiram  --  and , oh Cupid ! I say you , if you 'll go , I 'll carry you to a huskin ' next week ? Han . Hannah If there 's no harm . Hir . Hiram Hireout Harm ! No , I can show you the worst on it now , if you ai n't seared . Han . Hannah Oh , it 's something to see , is it ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Guess ' t is . Well , do you see at a huskin ' , if I 'm more spry than you are and husk my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same moment , enter , R. H. , riding a toy stick horse , Master Washington Jackson .  --  He runs against Hannah , and seeing her kiss Hiran , lets fali his horse and bursts out into a bellowing cry . Dressed in short trowsers , short-tailed coat , pinafore , &c.,; &c.; Washington . Washington Jackson Iodyne Crying . T  --  t  --  there , now , see if I do n't tell my pa ! Han . Hannah Dear me , I declare I 'm so narvis  --  I am all of a fluster  --  I do n't know what to do . There , now , Master Washington , do n't cry so  --  I did n't go to do it  --  I could n't help it . Looking at Hiram . Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne I know you did n't go to do it ; but you let him do it ; ah ! you ugly thing , you . Making faces at Hiram . Han . Hannah Why , master Washington , how could he do it ? He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse down . Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne Ah ! you think I do n't know , do you ? but I do though . Hir . Hiram Hireout Aside .

Washington Jackson Iodyne I sha n't and I wo n't ride any more , and I do n't care , and I 'll tell my pa , yes , and ever so much more besides that I know about you ; yes , I will ; if ever you let that man kiss you again , or if you let anybody kiss you , I will , that 's what I will , and I 'll kick his ugly legs , I will . Crosses to Hiram , and is going to lay hold of him . Hannah holds him  --  he struggles . Let me go ! let me go . She coaxes him . Hir . Hiram Hireout What in all creation is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an eend . What sort of a critter is that , any how ? I calculate natur 's been forward with him , tu ! Like our last year 's squash  --  outgrowed themselves  --  all outside  --  nothin ' in ' em ! Here , you Hannah ! Hannah stops , seems to pacify Washington , and comes down . Hir . Hiram Hireout If you 'll come down stairs to night , I cale'late I shall be round , and I 'll show you t' other part of the huskin ' ; it 's amazin ' sight better than the first . It 'll go down as slick as a gallon of rum at a temperance meeting . Mind  --  say , what do you call that critter there ? Han . Hannah That 's master Washington Jackson Iodyne ! Washington trips himself up , falls , and roars out crying . As Hannah turns to look at him , Hiram kisses her . Hir . Hiram Hireout Sweet as butterfly 's breath , by Cain . Exit L. H. Hannah runs to Washington , who sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Iodyne There  --  you done it  --  you did  --  you  --  I do n't like you any more . Han . Hannah I did it ? How did I throw you down ? Come  --  get up  --  now do ! Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne I sha n't , and you did throw me down . If you had'nt a gone to that feller , and played with me , this plaguey rope would'nt have thrown me down . Jumps up and throws down the skipping-rope and stamps upon it Han . Hannah Now come , do n't be vexed , there 's a dear . Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne I will be mad if I like  --  I 'm mad with you , I am . Han . Hannah Mad at me ? Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne Yes , and if you do n't let me do what I want to , I 'll tell pa about you , I will , see If I do n't . Han . Hannah Well , what do you want to do , pray ? Wash .

Well , there , never mind  --  I wo n't say anything about it though you are to be my husband . Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne Aside . But I wo n't , though ! Em . Emily Richly There , go now , go up stairs , and Hannah will be with you presently , and bring you something good . Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne Hannah , will you come soon ? Picks up his playthings . And what 'll you bring me ? Han . Hannah I 'll bring you a gingerbread wife  --  and then when you 're tired of her , you can eat hor up , you know . Wash . Washington Jackson Iodyne Yes , so I can ; let her be a good big ' un  --  I do n't like little wives . Mind what I told you , Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Exit L. H. , riding horse . Em . Emily Richly Why , Hannah , I declare you have got him into quite a good humor , and as for myself , I feel as if I could dance with joy . See , see here , Hannah ! Takes a colored note from her bosom . Oh ! the dear , sweet little letter , how it does smell ! So nice  --  only smell , Hannah . But that 's not the best of it  --  only look , see here  --  here 's pretty writing  --  and such nice , dear , dear , sweet words from my Harry ! Shall I read them ?  --  only listen . Reads . " My own dearest Emily : I have formed a scheme that will enable me to have an interview with you alone , to-night . If you come to the Doctor 's study this evening , by nine o'clock , I will be there ( do n't be alarmed ) in a sack . Hannah can come with you , and let me out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocket . " Kisses the letter and laughs Only think , Hannah , Harry in a sack ! Will you be afraid to go to Guardy 's study at night , Hannah ? Han . Hannah No , not if you go with me , and we carry a light . I do n't think I shall  --  that is , not very much afeard  --  perhaps a little narvis or so , but you know miss , I 'll do anything for you and Master Harry . Em . Emily Richly Heigho ! Very long sigh . Han . Hannah Why , bless us , and save , us , what is that doleful , deep drawn sigh for ? Em . Emily Richly I wish I was older . I feel ashamed at being in love so much already . Why only think , Hanuah , if I feel so much in love now , while I 'm only such a girl , how bad I shall feel when I am quite a woman ? Han . Hannah Quite a fiddlestick ! I do n't know how old you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to love a husband with all your heart , and you ca n't love much more than that , you know , miss , can you ? Em . Emily Richly No indeed , and I know I do love with all my heart . Oh ! how I do long for nine o'clock . I wish Harry may run away with me , that I do . Han . Hannah Well , I dare say he will . We must manage to keep the Doctor employed  --  out of the way  --  and Miss Penelope , too  --  if we can . Em . Emily Richly Yes indeed ! I shall scold Harry , now I think of it , very much , for stopping so long with Miss Penelope , when he was here before . If he had'nt been so long with her , the ugly old thing , Guardy would'nt have caught him with me . I was just going to scold him , when in pops Guardy . Gracious goodness ! how he did stare ! And , oh my , what a fib Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putting on an air of great offense , says : Mimicking . " Sir , what am I to understand by this intrusion ? " Then Harry , quite unconcerned , bowing , answers : " My dear sir , I beg you will not call my presence here an intrusion  --  but an accident  --  purely accidental , I assure you  --  purely a mistake . I only opened the wrong door . I was going into the apartments of your excellent sister , Doctor , and was about apologizing to this pretty little mise ( winking at me ) when you entered . Nothing more , my dear sir , nothing more , on my veracity , I assure you . " Then Guardy : " You opened the wrong door , I perceive sir , allow me sir , to open the right door , " opening my door , " and now , sir , you will particularly oblige me , by walking out of the door , and also out of my house  --  you will indeed , sir , upon my veracity ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he gave me a look as much as to say  --  never mind , I 'll contrive some means to see you , and that soon , too . Han . Hannah Bless us , and save us , Miss Emily , how you do run on . How in the name of patience , could Master Harry say all that , by one look ? Em . Emily Richly Oh ! very easily , when I catch the idea . But come Hannah , there 's a dear , and just help me to put up a few things , in case Harry should be very obstinate indeed , and insist on carrying me off , whether I will or no . Come ! Exit , R.

" It is an excellent idea , is'nt it , my most grave sage , and to be , reverend friend ? The idea of being carried to your soul 's adored , tied up in a sack , is original is'nt it , eh ? Damme ! why do n't you laugh ? Horatius . Horatius Rare The subject is too serious . Har . Harry Rocket The subject ? Yes , it would be devilish serious indeed , if I was to be made a real subject for the old Doctor ; but I promise you I shall be anything but a serious subject . All I 'm afraid of is , I shall spoil all by laughing outright in the cursed sack . Hor . Horatius Rare Your levity shocks , and surprises me . In the first place , I can not , for a moment , coincide with you , in thinking the means you use to continue your correspondence with Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Emily Richly  --  and what is more than her name  --  she is a devilish rich Miss Richly !

If you are determined to prosecute your suit and to carry off this young lady without the consent of her guardian in itself an outrage on  --  Har . Harry Rocket Horatius Rare , Esquire , that is the Reverend Horatius Rare , that is to be ! I most particularly solicit you will wait until that is to be , arrives , and then , perhaps , I may listen to a homily . But now you must excuse me . I have asked you to assist me in this adventure as a friend . Come , damn it ! cast off that hypocritical look , and say yes or no . Hor . Horatius Rare You wrong me . I have no hypocritical look to cast off , I had intended as a friend , to dissuade you from this undertaking , Aside . That I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you knew me better  --  dissuade me , indeed ! King never had a greater difficulty to contend with , and about as much chance of success , when he commanded the waves of the ocean to retire from his illustrious footstool during a spring tide . No , I am as determined as the waves , and will on , so  --  Enter Hiram , from house . Egad , here 's the old Doctor 's young man . I 'll see what 's to be made of him . A fine night , my friend ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Looking up . Yes , guess it is , pretty good , considerin ' . Har . Harry Rocket Considering what ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Considerin ' we ai n't got no almanacs this year . Har . Harry Rocket Aside . This is genius . I 'll humor him . How , no almanacs ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Why , you see last year the weather and the times were so allfired bad that the almanac makers , I heard , come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , and would n't make no almanacs ! Har . Harry Rocket Ha ! ha ! ha ! You 're an original . Hir . Hiram Hireout Should n't wonder if I was . I 'm first of three twins , and it ai n't every one that is quite as original , any how ! Har . Harry Rocket I concede the point , and now I wish to talk to you . Hir . Hiram Hireout Oh ! you do ! then this mess of gab you do n't call talkin ' ? Well , go ahead ; I 'm all eyes , ears , and attention . Har . Harry Rocket You belong to this house ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Do n't know ; dad used to say I belonged to him , but since I 've been a seekin ' my fortune , guess I belong to myself . Har . Harry Rocket Of course , but you are engaged to the owner , Dr. Iodyne ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Engaged to the Doctor ! what for , to be married ? Hor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hir . Hiram Hireout Amen ! where did you preach last ? Hor . Horatius Rare You must understand , he means you are engaged to serve the Doctor . Hir . Hiram Hireout Want to know ! Takes two on you to tell what one means ! Why , may I be teetotally doubly distilled into a double-breasted downright done-up ! Har . Harry Rocket Let me talk to this oddity alone for a few minutes . I 'll meet you at Taft 's , and there mature our plans . Har . Harry Rocket I will be there . Aside . Mature our plans . If I mistake not , yours is like an over-ripe fig  --  ' twill fall to pieces in the plucking ; mine is of another complexion . We shall see . Adieu . Exit , R. H. Har . Harry Rocket I perceive you are a very cute , discerning dog . Hir . Hiram Hireout Ca n't say ; guess I 've studied human natur ' some , but calculate I ai n't been a puppy long enough to be called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I mean , you are smart , and will suit my purpose . Hir . Hiram Hireout What , you wa n't to trade , do you ? Ai n't my purpose worth considerin ' ? There 's two on us to be suited this hitch , I guess , squire . Har . Harry Rocket I ca n't say I understand much about trade  --  but one thing I know , it ca n't be properly carried on without some capital ; so that 's to begin with . Gives him a purse . Hir . Hiram Hireout Pockets money . Fortune 's took a shine to me , by Judas ! Well , squire , you do understand what they call the fundamental principle . There 's only two branches of business that I ever heern on that do n't want any capital but brass , and that 's banking and diary writing , as they calls it ; most of ' em that sets up in the last line , like Captain Marryatt and them sort , ought to be called dairy writers . Har . Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're mostly a precious set of milksops . Would you believe it , one day when I was tu hum at dad 's down in Hopkinston , a-doing a mess of chores among the green sarce in the garden , I see one of these diary chaps a-comin ' , so I begins a-pullin ' up some of the beans , which in the course of natur ' always grows up with the bean atop , and plants t' other eend down . So Diary looks over the fence , and says he , " Young man , what are you employed about there so busily ? " " Well , " says I , " I calc'late I 'm plantin ' these here darned cantankerous beans right eend down . Do n't you see , every one of ' em has come up wrong eend first ? " With that Diary laughs , pulls out a pocket-book and pencil , and marks it down , " Yankees do n't know beans "  --  and this is the way such chaps gets the correct idee of Yankee characters and customs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yourn ? But you need n't waste any of your capital telling me , as I can guess  --  it 's love . Har . Harry Rocket Right in your guess . What do you mean by my wasting capital ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Git out , squire ! I 've done business myself in that line . What do I mean ? Why , you ca n't make love without words , can ye ? Making love begins with words , and sometime ends with words ; they are your capital , I reckon . You see I 've been there , squire ; I know natur 's natur ' . Har . Harry Rocket The fact is , I am at present in want of your assistance . I have made an appointment with a lady in that house this evening ; it is very necessary I should keep it , and not be seen by the Doctor , or , indeed , any other person in the family . As I did not anticipate finding so good a friend to assist me , meaning you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the right sort of capital  --  flummery  --  so make the wool fly . Har . Harry Rocket And you are the right sort of fellow . Well , to continue . Now I find you have promised to assist me  --  Hir . Hiram Hireout Hold on ! hold on ! I promised ? Har . Harry Rocket That is , as I see you intend to assist me.  --  Hir . Hiram Hireout That amendment is put in and carried , as Uncle Josh says at town meetin ' . I like you , squire , I do , by golly . Har . Harry Rocket I feel flattered , I assure you . You must know I have altered my plan . You saw that reverend-looking gentleman that just now left us  --  I 'm not quite sure that I ought to have trusted him with my plans  --  he 's a sly dog  --  therefore , I have determined to alter them , and instead of being carried in a sack , with your assistance I can walk in the usual way . Hir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezing , I reckon , as the old potato said to the young one that growed so fast he shoved him out of the ground . Enough said , squire . Takes out a key . Now look out . You know the house , do n't you ? Do n't go tumbling round and making a fuss ; and mind the old woman do n't catch you with the young ' un ; if she does , her back will be up , I tell you , so look out for squalls . Har . Harry Rocket As he goes in . You 're my guardian angel . A perfect Mercury ! Hir . Hiram Hireout I wish I may caterpillar right on the spot if this ai n't going the whole hog . The old woman calls me quite an entertaining , modest , wellbehaved young person ; the young ' un , Hannah , declared I was quite agreeable , and now the squire calls me his guardian angel . Guess I 'm the first in the family that ever was called angel before . A considerable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking about me . Taking purse out of each pocket and shaking them . Should n't wonder if there was . Go it , if you split your waistcoat ! Exit into house . SCENE III .  --  The Doctor 's Study . Set doors , R. and L. C.

Chairs . Couch on R. H. Hor . Horatius Rare So far , my plan succeeds ; I have gained an entrance into the house . Let me but have ten minutes ' conversation with Miss Emily alone , and from what her maid has told me , I have vanity enough to suppose I can overcome all her scruples to matrimony , and marry her immediately , before Harry arrives . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must trust to the sack . Now to find her maid , Hannah . Is going , R. H. , when Hiram enters suddenly . The devil ! Hir . Hiram Hireout The devil ? guess I am . But what do you want ? Two of a trade , you know , never agree . Hor . Horatius Rare How cursedly unfortunate ! I have it , my friend . Hir . Hiram Hireout The devil 's your friend , is he ? Well ; what is it ? Hor . Horatius Rare You see  --  you see  --  I am here to  --  to  --  Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , and I am here too . Squire , I guess you made a wrong entry . Pointing to window . Hor . Horatius Rare Not if you do n't betray me . Will you carry this note to Miss Emily ? I only wish a few moments ' conversation . Will you do it ? I shall be eternally indebted to you . Hir . Hiram Hireout I cal'clate this is a cash business . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , by Satan . Hor . Horatius Rare Curse his stupidity ! Gives him purse . There , now , I am sure you wo n't hesitate . Hir . Hiram Hireout Aside . Damn your assurance ! No , I wo n't hesitate . Pockets it . Now just keep quiet in that room , and I 'll bring the lady to you in less than no time . Hor . Horatius Rare Thanks ! thanks ! In here ? Pointing to L. H. D. Hir . Hiram Hireout Yes . Horatius goes in . Jubal looks down . Darned skunk ! I do n't half like him , anyhow , and may be I 'll fix him . He ca n't get out without I choose . Looks at note . I swan , if he ai n't forgot to address it . Hold on ; something strikes me on the head , as the man said when the brick fell on it . Signed R. H.  --  all right . Goes to door , opens it . I say , squire , I snickers  --  I du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know howish about this . You must promise me one thing . Hor . Horatius Rare At door . More money , I suppose . Aside . Well , what ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Have you got a parson all ready ? Hor . Horatius Rare I have ; he is waiting near here , at a friend 's . Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , then , you seem to be a generous , good sort of , openhearted , friendly , aside. deceitful skunk , and would n't like to get me into a scrape , or deceive a friend  --  as I partly promised to do a good turn for your friend , you know  --  you must promise to marry the lady in the dark , so that you can say you took her for somebody else , and I can bear witness to it . Hor . Horatius Rare I promise  --  only bring her here  --  I promise , upon my honor . Hir . Hiram Hireout Enough said . I 'll fix you straight up and down like a beanpole . Now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Locks door , and is going , R. H. Enter Hannah , R. H. , with lighted candles , which she puts on table . Lights up . Han . Hannah Bless us and save us ! I 'm glad I 've found you . Oh , dear me ! I 'm in such a fright ! I 'm so narvis ! Hir . Hiram Hireout Well , then , get out of the fright as soon as you can . What in all thunder is the matter ? Han . Hannah Oh dear , it 's dreadful ! The little villain ! You know , Master Harry has been trying to see Miss Emily , and so I thought I would keep Master Washington quiet a few minutes in my room , and I gave him a bottle of cherry brandy to taste , and what do you think ? Hir . Hiram Hireout Why , he drinked it . Han . Hannah Every drop ; and  --  Washington sings outside , R. H. Oh dear , here he comes ! Enter Washington , R. H. , tipsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling little nurse , I love you better than a hoop or a horse , and better  --  no , not better than this . Come here and kiss me .

Hiram Hireout Squat down , squat down where you are , and hold your yawp , or you 'll never have me for a husband . Han . Hannah What is the matter ? I 'm so narvis ! Hir . Hiram Hireout Shut up , and you 'll see . Blows out light , and Hannah hides behind couch . Dark stage . Han . Hannah Bless us and save us ! he 's put out the lights . Oh , my nerves ! Enter Miss Penelope , clocked and vailed , R. H.  --  the note Horatius gave Hiram in her hand . Miss P. Miss Penelope Iodyne Oh , how my heart palpitates !

It ca n't want more than twenty-five minutes to the time . Eh ! how 's this ? Surely my eyes deceive me ! Ten o'clock ! yes indeed it is . I must have made a mistake when I looked before .
