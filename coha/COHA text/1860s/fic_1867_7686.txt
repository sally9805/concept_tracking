Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : INVOCATION . from Poems ( 1867 ) Oh , Poesy ! exquisite gift , Thou art a magnet that shall lift My gold from out the drossy rift . Thou art my soul 's refulgent beam My guiding star to ever gleam A flaming pillar in my dream . Thou art my drifting-cloud by day Whose bright pavilion-courts alway Allure me with their fair display . Thou art a Hebe that presents A chalice to my lips , and thence I drain the charmd , rich contents . Delicious , bubbling nectars twine Their trickling tendrils as a vine Through all my being ; steept in wine And numb to any thought of earth I wrestle with my spirit 's mirth In travail with a poem 's birth . When chasing cares are wearying With all my life to thee I cling  --  Believing I was born to sing . Lo ! thou hast taught me where to fly Escaping every ill ; for I , Transfigured by thy witchery , As Daphne in the laurel park Seem wholly shut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervd pulse that never cowers ; The turgid stream of sap hath powers That shall beget a thousand flowers . I quiver from my very root , I strive to doff my leafy suit And load my boughs with perfect fruit  --  And lift my gnarled limbs to thee  --  I writhe and struggle to be free Endowed with thy divinity . Thou art my fast and feast ; and true Thou art my sweetest twilight-dew , That grants me purer life anew . And as the flower unto the moon Returns its hoarded sweets full soon , I yield thee all , in verse and tune . Of Nature . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE GUTTER  --  A CITY IDYL. from Poems ( 1867 ) You are welcome , dusky cloud , With your bosom swelling ; And your tears  --  their patter cheers All my dusty dwelling : And the gutter sudden wakes In a thousand voices ; O , the song that rings along Where the rill rejoices ! I am happy for the sight , Joining your carouses , Brook and I go laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the noise , And our haste and flurry ? We must fly , for soon we die , That is why we hurry . I am here because I like Just this sort of weather ; Brook takes me for company  --  Down we go together . Ha ! this life 's a merry one , Though a thoughtless scorner Cries , " The tomb is full of gloom , Down upon the corner . " What if all its life is brief  --  Born of such a shower  --  Running through a block or two , Dying in an hour ? There is something still beyond  --  Death is nothing surer  --  Brook will flow , and ever grow Softer , sweeter , purer , Till the sun doth draw it hence , T'wards its quenchless taper ; It will rise into the skies As a silver vapor . As it floateth in the air  --  Merciful its slumber  --  Then again is born the rain Of that cloud of umber . But the brook is growing still  --  Is the rain abating ! In a breath will sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it now For its faintest mutter  --  A shriveled tongue that laps among The cobbles in the gutter . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : VESPERS. from Poems ( 1867 ) The poppies nod their sleepy brows , And reel adown the opiate air ; The somber lilies slowly rouse , And fold transparent hands in prayer . The climbing roses whisper soft Sweet messages ; the four-o'clocks Are drowsy now  --  but far aloft I see the watchmen-hollyhocks . The Moslem-lilacs seem to call On " Allah " through the red sunset ; They rise upon the turret-wall Of every leafy minaret . The stately tulips at this hour Forget their pride . With good intent The haughty dahlias yield their dower  --  The dusky peony-queens relent . A thousand lights are swung in view From heaven 's dome . I leave the fair Meek violets kneeling in the dew ; It is the evening hour of prayer . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : DUSK . from Poems ( 1867 ) Smoldering in heat Beyond the blue hill , His mission complete , At the Deity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun , prone and lowly , At Angelus kneeling ; But partly revealing , Yet not hiding wholly A shrine and Christ crucified , Borne aloft tenderly , With lovers side by side Telling a rosary . In the violet East , All dripping with dew , Above the long , high , Purple mountains , that lie By the vail of the night And the valley of dreams , Half dark and half light , With a flood of bright beams , The moon steals in view . The murmur has ceased In the field and the forest ; The bee and the bird No longer are heard ; The flocks are not bleating ; My cares that were sorest  --  My pains that were fleeting , Are gone , or at rest ; As blessings entreating , I linger repeating My " Ave Maria "  --  so happy , so blest , With cross on my forehead and cross on my breast . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE BUTTERFLY . from Poems ( 1867 ) Thou little beauty , wafted by Upon the summer 's gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A sunbeam wandering from the sky , That earthward found its way ? A gorgeous flower , too rudely blown ? A beautiful bright birdling , flown From some enchanted coast  --  A winged mosaic , that hath known More art than man can boast ? Spring 's sudden flying brought to view Thy form , among the moss that grew Along the garden wall ; I saw thee as thou didst renew The fleeces of thy pall . And from the homely commonplace Of thy crude life I now can trace Thy fair and wondrous powers ; I learn the secret of the grace That brightens my dull hours . When folded in the noiseless gloom  --  Lo ! the shut portals of thy room At last were opened wide  --  Sunlight had cleft the seald tomb Where beauty did abide . May not the homely thought we find Among the rudest of our kind Yet serve an end complete , If chance it be but choicely lined , As was thy winding sheet ? For so a poem will forsake Its little hiding cell , to wake In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall break The chrysalis of the brain . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : IN THE DESERT . from Poems ( 1867 ) I. BEDOUIN IN AMBUSH . Seven hawks , in dismal disarray , Across a sky of slaty gray , Now dusking with the dusking day . The sun low down , and almost hid Beneath a vapory , dull lid , Over against a pyramid . One cluster of incessant green , Three slender palms that tower and lean  --  A crouching sentinel between . No hissing breath upon the lip  --  No stir in poised knee and hip  --  No quiver from the finger tip ; But , pointing from the fatal lair , The lithe wrist glued about the bare , Dull-gleaming rifle 's livid glare . And slow , with wearisome slow limb , A caravan approaching him With fringe of shadows long and slim . II . BEDOUIN ABROAD . A sky of glimmering , cool steel , But barely serving to reveal The desert where the camels kneel . An awkward buzzard on the wing ; Above one star in filmy ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spiced flesh ; Abundant fruits in silken mesh ; And jars of oil , and olives fresh ; And costly vestments of the Kahn , Despoiled with bloody mare and man  --  The remnants of a caravan . Against the sky-rim , silvery , One motionless , tall cocoa-tree ; The pyramids in angles three . And yonder , where the morning lowers , The fleet-winged flying-horseman scours T'ward Ghizeh and her shining towers . Idyllic and Legendary . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : SUMMER EXODUS . from Poems ( 1867 ) Turns Summer hence her queenly feet , That early spring the daffodils To kiss , and martial grasses greet , While every flower a tear distills . I cross the stubble fields , all sweet With shining stalks ; a longing fills My heart , to warble and repeat The robin in his liquid trills . I am , too , happy when I meet The meadow , where the mountain spills , So lithe and musical and fleet , Its limpid tress of brawling rills ; But stay my solitary beat  --  And start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropic heat  --  Lo ! Autumn on her brazen hills . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : AT ANCHOR . from Poems ( 1867 ) A sailor by the green home shore , When seas are ebbing from his view , Doth all his early joys renew : He sings the songs he sang of yore ; He spies his little cot , he smiles With a full joy ne'er felt before  --  He holds that one bare prospect more Than all the summer of the isles . The quiet home is his ; the trees Sprang from the seeds his grandsires laid Among the mold ; within the glade The myrtles rustle in the breeze . Above a treasured little grave , His early lost , his first deep woe ! Not any land that he may know Beyond the purple of the wave Hath such a jewel in its breast . He loves each rock and stream and dell ; ' T is only here he cares to dwell , ' T is ever here he longs to rest . This is his home of joy and ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy dusks that gloom The groves of spice beyond the seas . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : SINGING SHELLS . from Poems ( 1867 ) Long ago ! long ago ! ' T was Orpheus caught a pale-pink shell , With deep , dim chambers neatly twined , And pearly lined , and pearly lined , And blew the wind In music through its hollow halls , Till all the Echoes of the shore Cried out with joy , and sought a shell , And caught the faintly lingering tones Of Orpheus ' music  --  low as moans  --  And drew them in each tiny cell , While rosy walls of all the halls Grew merry then ; and quickly fell A murmurous song from every shell . Long ago ! long ago ! ' T was Orpheus tuned the shells to voices ; And all along the pebbled shore Was music , where was none before , And now each little one rejoices ; And every shell a tale doth tell How music came with them to dwell ; And all along the pearled shore , Though winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the land , He guards them well , each little shell , Who holds the waters in His hand . So , all along the pearled shore , ' Mid sighing waves , or ocean 's roar , They sing , and sing , forevermore . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE TWO CLEOPATRAS. from Poems ( 1867 ) Night is the shadow of that Ethiop queen , With brow as dark as Night , as richly jeweled In barbarous ravishment of luxury ; The enchantress of the Cydnus , in her toils Seeking new pleasures , slaying joys with sighs , And drowning mirth with her full tide of tears . Night is the shadow of that Ethiop queen , In rapturous witchery of beatitude ; Who drank a hundred pearls , immaculate In their white gloom of glory , and of rare And fabulous richness . Lo ! the haughty queen Heaped the all-immeasurable wealth Of treasures rare within a vessel , where , Breathing a mist of filmy radiance  --  A seeming vapor woven of gemmy rays , That lurked in nebulous folds about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel  --  The copious fund , the teeming store of treasure Was straight dissolved and lost in the crisp bubbling And all-devouring properties of acids . Then , after this accomplished , did she mingle With added juices , spice , and redolence Of various tinctures , a most savory draught . Her folded fingers held the jeweled verge Of the clear goblet , from pure ether hewn , Or some most lucent crystal , delicate , And laid the gleaming halo of the goblet Against the amorous volume of her lips , Where broke the violent fever of her love In turgid crimsoning , deepening the ripe tint O ' the silky curtains hung about the proud , Voluptuous tower of her enticing feature . So , staying the hot current of her blood In the drowsy syrup , clotted here and there , And crusted in pearl-ices , glittering pastes , And frosty miracles of rich congealment About the invisible limits of the vessel ; Drank she the all incalculable value Of crystalizing dregs , and hurled the cup At a dumb serving slave , a fawning eunuch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The swelling curvature of her fair barge Heading the vast armada , as it lay Becalmed among the silver of the Cyndus . The dense aroma of their several freights Had quite embalmed the zephyr , and they lay Beating the silver bosom of the Cyndus ,  --  Like prisoned birds , with fretful throb of wings , Beating the bosom of the silver Cyndus , Close upon Tarsus , where reveled Anthony . Night is the shadow of that Ethiop queen : She strews the seas with stars innumerable  --  The bubbly sea with stars which are as pearls ; And when the wave is like to stiffen , or burst Its dusky rind for too great store of rare And gleaming treasure , Night ! lo , haughty Night , The very shadow of that Ethiop queen Dips at the borders of the teeming sea And drinks the richness of the winy flood , Leaving the world as empty of the dark And cloudy turbulence of Muscadine As was the crystal chalice that was drained By the proud daring of old Egypt 's queen . Stoddard , Charles Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1867 ) I knew a cumbrous hill , From whose green breast did daintily distill A throbbing rill . This is the artery , And further on the crystal heart must be , Thought said to me . All other I forsook , To follow every twist and curious nook Of this wild brook . Among deep mosses set , I found the glimmering fount that did beget The rivulet . No other eye had known Its secret , nor ear heard , for it made moan Always alone . I quaffed its waters clear : Its limpid music babbled to mine ear With voice sincere . Then such a silence fell Upon me , mantling me , as where a spell Is wont to dwell . Yet fled I from the place At a rude rustling : and fear gave me chase In my disgrace . ' T was a slim water-snake Slipt like an arrow through the shivering brake , And left no wake . But cleft the placid spring And waved its flaming sword , its forked sting , In a charmed ring . ..... So was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  My trust was foiled . Of the Heart . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : MADRIGAL . from Poems ( 1867 ) A maid is sitting by a brook , The sweetest of sweet creatures : I pass that way with my good book Yet can not read , nor cease to look Upon her winsome features . Amid the blushes on her cheek Her small , white hand reposes : I am a shepherd , for I seek That wilful lamb , with fleece so sleek , Feeding among the roses ! Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : MY LITTLE LOVE . from Poems ( 1867 ) When my little love at purple dusk , Trips out upon the lawn among the flowers , The blushing roses quiver in their musk , Love-smitten through : the feathery , fragrant showers Of snow-white blossoms drift upon the grass , Kissing her whispering footsteps as they pass . When my little love at evening 's hush , Goes dancing down the dell with laugh and song , The slumbering echoes waken , and a gush Of silvery voices greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines In music mingles , murmurs , and repines . When my little love hath sought her cot To dream of angels , as the stars grow clear I homeward plod  --  alas ! unhappy lot  --  Yet turn again  --  I 'd long to tarry near  --  Till slowly wandering , thinking of her still , I meet the blue night coming o'er the hill . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : SWEETHEART . from Poems ( 1867 ) O ! this love of mine ! Never artist 's dream Was as fair as she : Jetty locks , that seem Glossy as can be  --  Night before the day Hath streaked it through with gray . O ! this love of mine ! Brow as white as sands On a tropic shore ; Eyes as deep as seas And darker than before Dawn hath turned them blue ; Cheeks of richest hue , Pink as pinkest shell That ever mermaid bore From enchanted lands Home where she did dwell . Sometimes , if I please That she blossom more , Her beauty is so fine  --  Rosy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouth a ripened fruit , If the maid is mute , Tempting me to sin In delicious greed ; If a smile I win , Then with charming speed It is cleft indeed , Showing pearly seed . O ! this love of mine ! Such a witching curl , Such a cunning chin , Like a single pearl With a dimple in ; Parian carvd throat All of curvd lines Such as Psyche shows , When she sad reclines In some isle remote Mourning Cupid 's boat Fading out of view ; Is the picture true ? Then her bosom 's snow In twin drifts , but hush !  --  All that I have shown Could not bid her blush : If you are a maid , Since never was a pair , Quite too much is said Unless you are as fair ; If you are a man , Mate her if you can ! Of Fancy and Imagination . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : CHERRIES AND GRAPES . from Poems ( 1867 ) Not the cherries ' nerveless flesh , However fair , however fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satin skin . Their luster rich and deep their dye ; Yet under all their splendors lie  --  That which I can not tribute grant  --  Their hateful hearts of adamant . I love the amber globes that hold That dead-delicious wine of gold ; A thousand torrid suns distill Such liquors as these flagons fill . Yet tropic gales with souls of musk Should steep my grapes in steams of dusk : And orient Eden nothing lacks To spice their purple silken sacks . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE WOODPECKER. from Poems ( 1867 ) A busy woodpecker ! What would you call This monk of a fellow , tapping a tree With little cells like a catacombed hall , To bury his acorns in  --  what would you call Such a curious monk as he ? Tucking his acorns away in their tomb To feed upon , by and by , at his will  --  Does he ever think of the hidden bloom In the acorn 's heart ? Though shut in a tomb There is life cherished there still . Time is a woodpecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ; But there ' s a bud of life that swells In the oak tree 's might and it shatters the cells As the soul when the life has fled . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : NIGHT SONG . from Poems ( 1867 ) Was it a corse embalmed in state ? Was it a princess pale in death , White in her bridal vail ? All of the roses held their breath And the dews fell very early and late , I thought that they never would fail  --  While the night went out and the morn came in , And the drowsy world awoke with a din , And the fading stars fled with a wail . Never a corse in its bleachen shroud , Never the daughter of a queen Under sarcophagus bars ; But the fairest face that ever was seen , Hid i ' the misty hem of a cloud  --  Softly the night wind jars The nebulous texture asunder , and soon The angel of midnight bore the moon Over a flood of stars . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the water ; He is marching down from the sky  --  Great Mars with his golden helmet And the golden flame in his eye . The sea is still , for the ripples Are hushed at the god 's slow tread ; And a line of light is trailing The wave like a burning thread . Sad Mars ! he is wearied with marching , And wandering off is he , While he nods his yellow helmet And thrusts his lance in the sea . Faltering Mars ! with his marching Wearied he seems to be ; While he tips his helmet and merges His golden lance in the sea . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE COMET . from Poems ( 1867 ) Was it a star , Or was it a pearl , Loosed with a jar From its setting I ' the coronet moon , And begetting , As it fell with a whirl  --  Whirling far  --  A splendor that faded too soon ? Was it a dream Of some splendid star born , That glowed with a gleam And a quiver That startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morn It did seem , In its luminous , lustrous light . Was it a gem Transfixed with a ray From the burning , bright hem Of the wondrous , Terrible sun , or the moon ? Over us , under us , Nor night , no , nor day Hath its equal , bright gem Fair feather of light , flown too soon . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE ANGEL , THE WINE , AND PEARLS . AN ALLEGORY OF THE YEAR . from Poems ( 1867 ) I. I saw a tiny flask of wine An Angel held , ' t was rare and fine . A little golden round of light , With every dainty picture dight . Upon its sculptured sides I found Both joy and woe , close linked around . I wondered at the goblet fine , The gleaming gold , the little wine . The Angel said ; " This flask I hold Is more to man than simple gold , " Or rosy nectar ; here are found  --  Within its fair and golden round  --  " Great drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Nor lacks it woe at times ; and here Are stored the secrets of a year . II . " These pearls "  --  the Angel 's delicate hand A dozen radiant pearls it spanned  --  " Are months , that will the goblet load Until the rim is overflowed : " The crimson flood is crowded up Until the year 's end fills the cup . " And having said , the Angel spilled A single pearl , the inner gild Was deeper buried in the hue Of crimson . Said the Angel : " View ! " A pearl is dropped , a time has flown , The secret of a month is known . " Then fell another ; others still Close followed this , and this , until The crimson flood rose bubbling up  --  Each pearl-drop deeper filled the cup  --  And rosily just brimmed the top . But one more pearl was left to drop . III . I looked . Her fingers loosed , it falls  --  The round of golden-gleaming walls Are sunk below the crimson line  --  The buried pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside ; I asked : " Why this ? " and quick replied The radiant spirit , reaching up To clasp another ready cup : " Each pearl-month i ' the goblet falls , The life-blood climbs the golden walls " Until the rim is reached , and here Is broke the bubble of the year . " The gems have run the goblet o'er , The wine is richer for the store : " The pearls are spilled , the months have flown , The secrets of a year are known . " Of Aspiration and Desire . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : FAME . from Poems ( 1867 ) She charmed him with her charming eye ; To know its luster was to die , Or feed forever on its light . She bore him to her mountain height ; With wine-sweet lips she kissed to rest The thousand longings in his breast . She ringed him with her glittering coils ; Her flattering words were soft as oils , All swam before his drunken sight ; He felt his beauty and his might , And cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not know her treachery ; But thought her tightened grasp to be The clasp of love  --  O ! heavy fate ! She thrust him in the face of hate With all the venom in her born , And slew him with her tongue of scorn . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : DESIRE . from Poems ( 1867 ) I would the Fates were busier A shaping out my name and story . It seems not like a haggard Fate To hesitate , and hesitate ; But they 'll demur if they prefer , And far away is fame and glory . Perhaps delay is profiting , And disappointments shape a moral ; But age cares not for sweet applause , For age is wise with " says and saws . " With merry spring I love to sing And with my youth I seek my laurel . I can not choose experience To lead me faltering and jaded , While all the blossom of my life Is wasting in the fretful strife , Till reaching hence that height intense I find the myrtle plucked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor all endeavor Finds any mark of royalty However rich the trophy be . Now I would rise and seize the prize , Then rest forever and forever . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : COMPENSATION . from Poems ( 1867 ) What if my tender roots may haply coil In a deep mellow soil , Wherein is found no weed That killeth all things with its harmful greed , But only there is nourished mine own reed  --  To rear its slender crest In every hue of richest blossom dressed ? If in the sunny mazes of my leaves The crafty spider weaves  --  Or in my fairest bloom Some worm hath stole , where in delicious gloom It lies and fattens in its honeyed tomb  --  What shall it profit me , The outward show so fair , the prize I seem to be ? Still , I may ' scape the worm , the spider 's net ; No cursed blight may set Its dangerous touch anew Upon my frailest buds , in vile mildew ; My faded flowers the Autumn winds may strew ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fruit , or seed , what use was life ? Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : UNREST . from Poems ( 1867 ) O ! vestal lilies , white and still , Thy golden cressets newly trim ; O ! wine-tipt tulip globes now spill Thy orient oils upon the flame ; My heavy woe I may not name , But woe were less if thou wouldst fill Each golden cresset 's rim  --  For I may burn within the fire All bitterness , but what is true Endures the ordeal of the pyre , And swathes itself in gossamer dew . O ! summer wind return again And sing my little ills to rest ; Distill thy balm , delightful rain , Through various currents of the air ; The cross is heavy that I bear ; But thou mayest lull the vexing pain And breathe a quiet in my breast . Peace , weary heart ! O ! tongue be mute ! Voluptuous goddess , prithee , weep Thy golden tears , and soft salute Yon star , my soul desireth sleep . Stoddard , Charles Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1867 ) If life be as a flame that death doth kill ; Burn little candle lit for me , With a pure spark , that I may rightly see To word my song and utterly God 's plan fulfill . If life be as a flower that blooms and dies ; Forbid the cunning frost that slays With Judas-kiss , and trusting love betrays : Forever may my song of praise Untainted rise . If life be as a voyage , or foul , or fair : O ! bid me not my banners furl For adverse gale , or wave in angry whirl , Till I have found the gates of pearl And anchored there . Of Meditation . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : SEED-TIME. from Poems ( 1867 ) Grief is a rain , to fall Upon us , one and all , Like needful showers that make the dry earth mellow ; For autumn days will come  --  The root of love is numb , Its sweetest blossoms all are sear and yellow . And then a quick regret Will harshly seem to whet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel way ; And glossy locks grow gray And lusterless beside the new-turned furrows . Old Time comes on amain  --  A farmer with his grain , Experience he sifts between his fingers , As up and down he goes . Search , Time , along the rows ; Lest in thy path a weed of evil lingers ! His cunning skill is such He seeks with careful touch The seeded groves with softest soil to cover ; Yet , Time , thou hast not art , But in some bruisd heart Long traces of thy husbandry will hover ! O , busy husbandman , How perfect is thy plan ! Behold the harvest ! for thy careful flinging Of little curious seed Shall come a crop indeed ; Lo ! peace , and trust , and every virtue springing ! Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : PENSEROSA. from Poems ( 1867 ) Is it sin to deal with sorrow ? Looking upward through our tears , All the breadth of sky is clearer , And twice beautiful ; and dearer Seems the coming of the morrow As we wrestle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the woe may come again ? For our little life is brief ; And though never joy shall light it , Truly not our tears shall blight it ; For the Christ once suffered pain , And He was acquaint with grief  --  He , the blessed Christ , did deign Himself to weep . What matter whether Smile or sigh ? The fairest bow , Where the sun the spray hath kissed , There it blossoms in the mist Till it withers in fair weather . Beautiful is grief ! I know Peace and tears may dwell together . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : AT POLLOCK 'S GRAVE . from Poems ( 1867 ) One seared leaf quivering down From the green choir that wails thy brief renown : This is the poet 's crown ! Where is thy skillful lute , That could provoke the birds to sweet dispute ? Alas ! forever mute ! The hand that drew the balm Of ravishing music from tuned strings is calm ; The worm feeds on thy palm . Not the majestic sweep Of subtle melodies thy nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-rays dart Through silken grasses , searching for thy heart , Of perfect gold a part . The frail vine mantling Thy undeserved nakedness doth cling About thee , perishing . Though no cut altar-stone Is set to tell these ashes are thine own , Thou art not all unknown . Nor dost thou , voiceless , wait ; A thousand whispering tongues shall penetrate The Heaven 's pearly gate : Singing thine unsung songs , Chanting thy praises out of tuneful throngs , And righting all thy wrongs . ..... I would some song dispense , But falter in my homely utterance , For music is flown hence . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : " DROWNED ! DROWNED ! " from Poems ( 1867 ) ' T is said when drowning , snatched from life and light  --  When drowning in sad waters deep and wide  --  When drowning , that the waters and the wave Do moan most musically , and singing , sigh In tenderest tones , and witching wild refrains , That enter at the ear and fill the brain With music , quieting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged to leave Its transient habitation i ' the clay , And seek that far-beyond , we know not of .

Then the tides recede And leave the body , pale , and lank , and cold , All in the silence of night , upon the strand  --  Sad waters moaning for the still , dead form , The soulless body sleeping on the strand . And after A bleachen skull , outstaring the bold sun  --  The mystery of birth , and age , and name  --  The secret of the soul 's flight , and the blank And wordless story of a shattered life ! The rattling reeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow autumn wind Tossing among the rushes  --  and one star Dropping pearl shadows in the empty bowls That held the eyes once in this withered skull ! Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : THE SOUTHERN CROSS . from Poems ( 1867 ) Whene'er those southern seas I sail , I find my eyes instinctive turning Where , pure and marvelously pale , Four sacred stars are brightly burning . A star is set above the thorns ; Two mark the bleeding palms extended ; And one the wounded feet adorns  --  In four the potent cross is blended . One only hand had power to place The symbol there , and that immortal ; Those fair , celestial fires may grace And beautify the heavenly portal . Whatever danger I may meet Upon the wild , disastrous ocean , Still turn my trusting eyes to greet That flaming cross with true devotion . Nor cease , my willing heart , to give Thy prayers , and every just endeavor ; For only by the cross I live , And by the cross I live forever . Stoddard , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1867 ) ( LYMAN R. GOODMAN . ) You sang too early in the spring Of our uncheerful year of song ; You felt the bitter chill of wrong , And on a sudden ceased to sing . And on a sudden sang no more In skillful measure to our needs ; But there is One who ever heeds Your numbers on the farther shore . I picture you as one who lies Among the palms , with harp and crown . A silver , quivering thread , let down From crystal walls of Paradise , Is the sweet echo of your voice That thrills me . In your vineyard 's throng I taste your purple grapes of song , And in their honey-blood rejoice . Stoddard , Charles Warren , 1843-1909 : IN MEMORIAM . L. C. B. from Poems ( 1867 ) OB .

Death the ashes did inter With the odor and the balm , Nourished in the long increase Of the Christ-man 's perfect calm , And his soul 's eternal peace . Faith and Hope sit at the gate Of the sepulcher , and wait For the dawning judgment day ; At the portal while I weep . At the portal while I pray , Kneeling at the silent tomb  --  Who will break the awful gloom ? Who shall wake him from his sleep ? Who can roll the stone away ? Slumber on and take thy rest ; Peace forever will abide With thy memory at my side , Dove-like ; and upon my breast Falls thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortal clay , Cold and breathless utterly . Naught may wake him ; not a kiss ; Not a kiss or prayer for aye Shall recall him out of bliss ! Only here the chrysalis , With the spirit flown away !
