Longfellow , Henry Wadsworth , 1807-1882 : THE TWO SHARPSHOOTERS . BATTLE OF HUTTONSVILLE , W. VA. , JANUARY 4TH , ' 62. from The two sharpshooters ( 1864 ) Two men went out from the fire-lit camp In the autumn midnight gray ; Over the quaking , croaking swamp To the edge of the woodland still and damp , With rifle and spade went they . A hunting owl wailed out to its young , And the picket stood as still In the meadow below as the shadows flung By the beaded tent-lights thickly strung On the silver-threaded rill . ' T was long ere the picket moved away , And there was no time to lose ; The pits must be dug by dawn of day : Said one , " We are digging graves , I say ; " And the other whispered , " Whose ? " With the morning light a column of steel Moved upward along the hill Toward the hidden pits , but a double peal Close in the front made the column reel A moment , and then stand still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morrow the dead were laid Head to foot in a trench of clay ; But two apart in the front that lay Were buried without a spade .
