These several characters should dress in costume becoming their callings . When well rendered , the scene is very humorous . Characters . SQUIRE DRAWL . SWIPES , a brewer . FRANK MILLINGTON . CURRIE , a saddler . Main text ( Enter SWIPES and CURRIE . ) SWIPES.  --  A sober occasion this , brother Currie ! Who would have thought the old lady was so near her end ? CURRIE.  --  Ah ! we must all die , brother Swipes . Those who live longest outlive the most . SWIPES.  --  True , true ; but since we must die and leave our earthly possession , it is well that the law takes such good care of us . Had the old lady her senses when she departed ? CURRIE.  --  Perfectly , perfectly . Squire Drawl told me she read every word of her last will and testament aloud , and never signed her name better . SWIPES.  --  Had you any hint from the squire what disposition she made of her property ? CURRIE.  --  Not a whisper ! the squire is as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses hinted to me that she had cut off her graceless nephew with a shilling . SWIPES.  --  Has she ? Good soul ! Has she ? You know I come in , then , in right of my wife . CURRIE.  --  And I in my own right , and this is no doubt , the reason why we have been called to hear the reading of the will . Squire Drawl knows how things should be done , if he is as air-tight as one of your own beer barrels , brother Swipes . But here comes the young reprobate . He must be present , as a matter of course , you know . ( Enter FRANK MILLINGTON . ) Your servant , young gentleman . So , your benefactress has left you , at last ! SWIPES.  --  It is a painful thing to part with old and good friends , Mr. Millington . FRANK .  --  It is so , sir ; but I could bear her loss better , had I not so often been ungrateful for her kindness . She was my only friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is too late to repent , Master Millington . You will now have a chance to earn your own bread . SWIPES.  --  Ay , ay , by the sweat of your brow , as better people are obliged to do . You would make a fine brewer 's boy , if you were not too old . CURRIE.  --  Ay , or a saddler 's lackey , if held with a tight rein . FRANK .  --  Gentlemen , your remarks imply that my aunt has treated me as I deserved . I am above your insults , and only hope you will bear your fortune as modestly , as I shall mine , submissively . I shall retire . ( As he is going , enters SQUIRE DRAWL . ) SQUIRE .  --  Stop , stop , young man ! We must have your presence . Good morning , gentlemen ; you are early on the ground . CURRIE.  --  I hope the Squire is well to-day . SQUIRE .  --  Pretty comfortable for an invalid . SWIPES.  --  I trust the damp air has not affected your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know I never hurry , Slow and sure is my maxim . Well , since the heirs-at-law are all convened , I shall proceed to open the last will and testament of your deceased relative , according to law . SWIPES.  --  ( While the SQUIRE is breaking the seal . ) It is a trying scene to leave all one 's possessions , Squire , in this manner ! CURRIE.  --  It really makes me feel melancholy when I look round and see every thing but the venerable owner of these goods . Well did the preacher say , " All is vanity ! " SQUIRE .  --  Please to be seated , gentlemen . ( All sit . The SQUIRE puts on his spectacles , and reads slowly . ) " Imprimis : Whereas my nephew , Francis Millington , by his disobedience and ungrateful conduct , has shown himself unworthy of my bounty , and incapable of managing my large estate , I do hereby give and bequeath all my houses , farms , stocks , bonds , moneys , and property , both personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brewer , and Christopher Currie , saddler . " SQUIRE takes off his spectacles to wipe them . SWIPES.  --  ( Dreadfully overcome . ) Generous creature ! kind soul ! I always loved her . CURRIE.  --  She was good , she was kind ! She was in her right mind . Brother Swipes , when we divide , I think I will take the mansion house . SWIPES.  --  Not so fast , if you please , Mr. Currie ! My wife has long had her eye upon that , and must have it . Both rise . CURRIE.  --  There will be two words to that bargain , Mr Swipes ! And , besides , I ought to have the first choice . Did not I lend her a new carriage every time she wished to ride ? And who knows what influence  --  SWIPES.  --  Am I not named first in her will ! And did I not furnish her with my best small beer for more than six months ? And who knows what influence  --  FRANK .  --  Gentlemen I must leave you . Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on . ) Pray gentlemen , keep your seats . I have not done yet . ( All sit . ) Let me see ; where was I ?  --  Ay ,  --  " All my property , both personal and real , to my dear cousin , Samuel Swipes , brewer  --  SWIPES.  --  Yes ! SQUIRE .  --  " And Christopher Currie , saddler  --  " CURRIE.  --  Yes ! SQUIRE .  --  " To have and to hold , IN TRUST , for the sole and exclusive benefit of my nephew , Francis Millington , until he shall have attained the age of twenty-one years ; by which time I hope he will so far have reformed his evil habits , as that he may safely be intrusted with the large fortune which I hereby bequeath to him . " SWIPES.  --  What 's all this ? You do n't mean that we are humbugged ? In trust !  --  how does that appear ? Where is it ? SQUIRE .  --  ( Pointing to the parchment . ) There ! In two words of as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , too , Mr. Squire , if we must be sent for to be made laughing-stocks of ! She shall pay for every ride she had out of my chaise , I promise you ! SWIPES.  --  And for every drop of my beer . Fine times , if two sober , hard-working citizins are to be brought here to be made the sport of a graceless profligate ! But we will manage his property for him , Mr. Currie ! We will make him feel that trustees are not to be trifled with ! CURRIE.  --  That will we ! SQUIRE .  --  Not so fast , gentlemen ; for the instrument is dated three years ago , and the young gentleman must already be of age and able to take care of himself . Is it not so , Francis ? FRANK .  --  It is . Exit , laughing . SQUIRE .  --  Then , gentlemen , having attended to the breaking of this seal according to law , you are released from any further trouble in the premises . Exeunt in anger , SQUIRE laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
