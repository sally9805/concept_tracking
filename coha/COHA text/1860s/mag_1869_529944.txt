PARLOR SINGING . THERE is no good reason why musical criticism should be almost wholly restricted to the opera and public concerts , and so little should be devoted to the music of the parlor . Parlor music is certainly of more importance than any other to our domestic and social enjoyments , and no less worthy of rational criticism . But there are so many bad singers and so few good ones in the world , that many persons condemn parlor music as a " nuisance , " unless it be entirely instrumental . Instruments , they say , admit of being well played by coarse and stupid persons , because they do not generally express the character of the performer ; but nearly all vocalists are disagreeable . I admit the reasonableness of this fault-finding , and will confess that I belong to that class of listeners who agree in sentiment with the popular ballad entitled " The Musical Wife . " Indeed I have always felt particularly satisfied with my own wife because she had omitted to add to her other accomplishments that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of probabilities , that she would not by this additional talent have given me more annoyance than pleasure . I have not , in the course of my life , heard more than two or three female singers who afforded me any considerable pleasure in solos . Ballad-singers , with a few exceptions , may be divided into two classes , - first , those who sing like children , with a bald and unmeaning simplicity , without any graces of expression and modulation ; second , those who mix with their graces so much silliness or affectation as to spoil their performance . There is something entirely wrong in the musical training of young female singers ; or there must be a very general incapacity among them for good singing . I have known some young persons whose performances were quite acceptable before they had been placed under a teacher and had learned to " vocalize . " After this they were intolerable . But though it is rare to meet with a young lady who can sing a good solo without spoiling it by her own airs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the general harmony of voices conceals the defects of individual performers . I am sure that out of one hundred good choir-singers not more than two or three would be satisfactory in the performance of ballads . It can not be denied that most of those who perform only in domestic circles make music a mere imitative art . They address themselves only to the ear , not to the sensibility . It is unfortunate for their excellence that they copy the style of operatic singers , which is as unfit for the parlor as the manner of a tragedian upon the stage is unfit for common conversation . There are some men of distinguished ability who deny that musical power has any other than a very temote connection with intellect . They say that the most feeble-minded are often excellent in the art , and that many who are nearly idiotic possess a perfect musical ear . Blind Tom is given as an example ; and they bring the additional proof that birds can learn to sing tunes , and sing them with accuracy . If we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their opinion ; but , if we speak of it as the art of expressing the passions and sentiments by an original combination of sounds , their estimate is far from just . Music , in its highest meaning , is the language of emotion , and most of our emotions are intellectual . Hence a composer who is able to arrange certain sounds in suc*h melodic movements as to . call up at will any emotion , passion , or sentiment , either with or without the aid of words , or a performer who can enter into the spirit // of a good composition so as to perfect or improve the design of the author , is possessed of an intellectual gift that , intensified , would deserve the name of genius . But the simple power of learning to sing tunes , or to perform them with aa instrument , as they are set , is only an exercise of the semi-intellectual faculty of imitation , and a fool may possess it . As words are used to communicate V certain definite thoughts , in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental emotion which can not be so forcibly expressed by words . Language conveys ideas , exact images , and forms of thought to the mind : music addresses itself to the mind through the sensibility . It is , therefore , in its highest exercise , an intellectual art , occupying the third place in the mental scale , and standing next to poetry , as poetry stands next to philosophy . Joy is commonly expressed in harmonic movements , by thirds , fifths , and octaves , such as are performed by a simple hunting-horn : it deals but sparingly in semitones and chromatic notes . Sorrow is expressed in strains that move , in great degree , by semitones and whole tones confined within a narrow compass . Take , , for example , Rousseau 's celebrated " Air Written upon Three Notes . " Increase a plaintive melody contained within the compass of a major third or fourth , to strains embracing a whole octave , and progressing chiefly by harmonic intervals , and the effect is proportionally lively and exhilarating . I state only a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these transitions so as to make a seeming exception to this law , as in " Pleyel 's Hymn . " There are , however , no true exceptions to any law of nature : there are exceptions only to our imperfect statement or understanding of it . It would be absurd to deny that one who has a knowledge of all this Ian*guage of emotion , and who is able to use it effectively as a composer of music , is possessed of extraordinary intellectual power . But it is a popular error to consider this peculiar faculty , which may be called musical genius , to be the same thing as a good musical ear . They are entirely different , - the latter being a faculty of sense , the former of intellect . It is not denied , however , that a good ear is needful for the manifestation of musical genius , as a good eye is needful for the manifestation of the genius of a painter or a sculptor . I ought to allude in this place to the custom of judging female singers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the remarkable fact that many persons can not endure any but male vocalists in solos . Nobody would say that the voices of men are intrinsically as musical and agreeable as those of women . But we listen to a woman s voice as we look upon her face and observe her manners : a defect in either is more easily perceived* and is more disagreeable , than in the rougher sex . We prepare ourselves to hear a greater purity of tone - as we look for greater purity of character - in women ; so that our severity of judgment is compli* mentary to the sex , though it may bear hard upon individuals . It can not be denied that in a woman*s voice all those slight intonations by which we detect shades of character are not only more perceptible , but affect us more deeply , on account of her sex . I must confess that I have seldom listened to female stage-singers with pleasure , because it is disagreeable to witness in a woman such masculine power of lungs as their success requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chance of pleasing by her performance depends greatly on the character of her hearers . A vulgar audience would be delighted with any exhibition that is calculated to excite either their laughter or their astonishment . Men who have not romantic ideas of the female character , and who would not readily perceive the psychological expressions of the voice , and all those persons , among the common herd // 412 of musical practitioners , who can not appreciate anything except mechanical skill , would not be affected by peculiarities in a singer that seem to a man of taste and sensibility positive faults . It may be remarked of singing , as of eloquence , that the less of intellectual culture there is among an audience , the less of any good quality except physical power is required to please . Coleridge , in his " Lines Cornposed in a Concert-room , " expresses his abhorrence of the " gaudy throng , " who listen with admiration as the singer " Heaves her distended breast In intricacies of laborious song . These feel not music* a genuine power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when the long-breathed singer 's up-trilled strain Bursts in a squall , they gape with wonderment . " But my present purpose is not to criticise the concert or the opera . I leave that task to those who are qualified for it by a finished musical education . I treat only of the music of the parlor , which ought always to be of a simple but tasteful character , and which is spoiled when it either sinks into vulgarity , or attempts to accomplish feats that are within the power of those only who have given their life to the art and have been trained for public performance . I must not omit to say a few more words upon what may be termed the psychoiogical exj5ression of the voice , to which I have already alluded . The voice of every singer , in a greater or less degree , conveys to us , according to the accuracy of our perceptions , an idea of the singer 's moral and mental qualities . And this expression enters , more than any one would believe who had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocalists , especially those of the female sex . Hence it may be explained why we can not endure certain voices , however admirable in execution , unless their disagreeable psychological qualities are concealed by well - ordered instrumental accompaniments ; as the strong flavor of certain kinds of game is hidden by sweet herbs and sauces . October7 The character of the voice also depends greatly on the physical organization ; but this has been more generally observed . It is modified by the size and shape of the mouth as well as the manner of using it . If a woman 's mouth be small , and her lungs weak , her singing-voice will sound like cooj*cr if her mouth be small and her 5- ' lungs powerful , her voice will resemble hooting , m*ing a hollow sound like that produced by blowing into the narrow neck of a large bottle ; if her mouth and throat are both very large , her voice will have a twang like that of a negress , and approaching a masculine tenor . It may not have been generally observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civilized , the difference in the physical power of the two sexes is widened . The male and fei*aale of the African race are more nearly equal in corporeal streBgth than the white man and woman . I have heard a negro man and a negro woman singing together , and , as I did not see them , I could not determine whether the duet was performed by two of the same sex or otherwise . The voice of a negro of either sex , however , has in all cases a twang peculiar to that race . It might be imitated by singing through a widely-flaring tin funnel . The length and size of the neck produce important modifications of the voice . Soprano singers , for the most part , have short necks and high shoulders . Women with very long necks and sloping shoulders have contralto voices , almost without exception . Hence we may explain a fact which often excites surprise , - that many small and slender women have a low and deep - toned voice , which should be distinguished , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neck and shoulders produces the mezzo-soprano , or middle voice , which is the most agreeable . All these different conformations of the mouth and frame give the voice its physiological character , which is also very considerably modified by temperament . I would also call the reader 's atten* // tion , before I proceed further , to the fact that in all departments of art there is a certain kind of genius that is not generally appreciated . The truth of this proposition can be best illustrated by examples from the performance of music . A singularly nice discernment is necessary to distinguish that sort of merit which consists chiefly in expression and modulation . The great mass of people , including the mass of critics and connoisseurs , can fully appreciate only two important qualities of a good singer , and have very little capacity for understanding those of a higher character . The two qualities of " execution " and " power " are easily comprehended , and obtain the plaudits of all ; while grace , feeling , and expression are considered secondary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of genius . It must be remembered that " execution , " used as a musical term , is applied almost exclusively to the faculty of rapidly enunciating the quick and difficult passages of a musical composition . " Power , " in the popular musical vocabulary , is understood to mean physical or mechanical force . It is true that a singer , who , without superior compass or strength of voice , should be able to perform with exquisite grace and expression , possesses 75ower , in a very importar*t sense . But this is the power of genius , and is not included in the popular meaning of the word , which expresses only a capacity for great loudness and compass . It is applied to singers as to instruments , in the sense in which a bugle is more powerful than a flute . The physical and mechanical powers are qualities that everybody understands , and , when extraordinary , admires ; but genius is simply felt : it affects the heart and sensibility , but is not sufficiently palpable to be admired . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects every department of the art . I read in a " History of Music ' * written by a Mr. Fergus , and printed a hundred years ago : " A great deal of the music of the present day is calculated more to astonisk than to *5lease . Expression and simplicity are sacrificed to execution . " " Mara and Billington often astonish the listening world by executing such rapid passages as were never but by them attempted ; but , in these moments of surprising exertion , they sacrifice their judgment and wonderful abilities to the corrupt taste of the times . " " Owing to the insatiable appetite of the multitude , composers of the first abilities are frequently obliged to rain down torrents of indigested compositions , which have nothing but novelty to recommend them . " We might inform Mr. Fergus , if he could point out any medium of communication between us , that he has written a very good sketch of the taste of the present age in this description of the taste of his own . Admiration is the passion of vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the exhibition of great " power . " Noise is preferred to melody , as evinced by the universal custom of performing on the piano with the pedals down and the lid open . All writers have been prone to make a distinction between genius and talent , but no two have a6reed in naming the qualities that distinguish them . Talent is generally admitted to be something that resembles skill and tact , corresponding with a quick and correct ear in the musical art . Genius , on the other hand , is supposed to be an original and extraordinary manifestation of intellectual power , and in the popular judgment is considered* as relating to art , rather than learning or science . Great intellectual power in any shape , however , notwithstanding the various distinctions drawn by critics , will always be recognized as genius . A definition of the word can not be made with such limitations as would please the majority of our sophists , without excluding some of the most wonderful persons who have lived . It is well , however , to note this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men of science and learning , intellectual power alone is con- // qwq has made me understand cer$ain principles which I should not have learned from any other source ; and by studying her likes and dislikes , which were perfectly systematic and consistent , I have corrected many of my early prejudices , and obtained some new views of musical criticism . One summer afternoon , in the year 1862 , when recovering from a protracted illness , I sat reading alone at my chamber window , and , as it grew late , I put aside my book and looked out upon the landscape . The evening was very mild and clear , and the weather so calm that I could detect any stirring of the wind only by the gentle flutter of the leaves of an aspen that stood near my window . The sun had so far declined as to impart to the whole prospect a bright golden hue mingled ith a rosy tint , and the thin , gauzy clouds that floated over the heavens were luminous with beauty . My thoughts were all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had given myself up entirely to the enjoyments of sense and imagination . At this moment I heard the voice of a young female singer , - one who was unknown to me and whom I had never seen , - from the open windows of the house adjoining mine . She was singing a simple ballad , commencing with the words , " The sun was clear on the open lea . " I had not heard many verses when I was affected as I had never been before by a human voice or by an instrument . There was something in her tones that seemed to be the very soul of melody , and a peculiar grace in the modulation of them that could not be described . When she paused , my first thought was , that I must have been hearing a performance by some prima donna , who might be the guest of my neighbor . But when she began anew , I soon perceived a simplicity and naive/6 about her manner that proved her to be no stage-singer . Her voice was unlike any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintive that it seemed as if nothing on earth could equal it . Some of Milton 's descriptions of heavenly song flashed upon my memory ; and I thought of the veery , - the little bird whose vesper notes " With liquid warbling close the eye of Day . " I remembered my former disappointments , but this voice realized all imagined delight . The invisible singer gave in succession many simple ballads without the accompaniment of any instrument or of any other voice . As her plaintive notes fell softly upon my ear , and then melted into silence , I felt that this was the ideal voice , which I had so long desired to hear . I soon learned that the sweet singer was a very young lady , who had just arrived as a visitor in my neighbor 's family . But what must be the delicacy and the firmness of her organization , that should cause her tones to be so sweet and so animated What must be the depth of pathos in that young heart , enabling her to imbue with so much plaintiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed her with the power to awaken such intense emotions in a lis-tener ! The reader will naturally suppose that I desired to see the face of one who had so deeply affected me by her singing . Such a voice , I thought , could not belong to one who had a dull and insipid countenance . If not beautiful in feature , she must have something of that look which is superior to ordinary beauty . Day after day came and went , and I heard her from time to time pouring forth with the same clear voice those brilliant and plaintive notes , " most musical , most melancholy " ; but still I had not seen her , and I thought at last , with a deep feeling of sadness , that there must be some divinity about her , and fate had determined that I was not worthy to behold her . Meanwhile , I imagined she must have a very thoughtful face , on account of her plaintive style of singing . When , therefore , I met her at last in broad daylight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant and // joyous faces I had ever seen ! She linesdeleted // have always observed that voices of great compass are deficient in what Dr. Burney calls " flavor . " I have introduced the subject of these remarks , without her consent or knowledge ; partly to illustrate that kind of genius which is more deeply felt than admired , but still more to avail myself of the opportunity of weaving into this essay certain ideas in musical criticism , derived from her example and conversation , that seem to me both original and just . Her manner in performing , and her ideas of music , I considered particularly worthy of study , because from her earliest years she had been so entirely self-reliant in the formation of her taste and style . I thought I could perceive in her genius a purer transcript of nature than in one of equal gifts modified to a greater extent by musical education and practice in concert . Even her peculiarities had their foundation , not in caprice , like the whims of most young persons , but in her intuitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very perplexing to my philosophy , when I considered her plaintive style of performance , to learn that she held in detestation almost all songs and airs in the minor mode . With some rare exceptions , the only cases in which she could endure the minor key were single strains introduced to vary a somewhat lengthened melody in the major mode . I was also disappointed when she mentioned her dislike , amounting almost to contempt , of all genuine Scottish melodies , which I had always admired . She was pleased with many of the new Scottish ballads , by modern composers , which are of an entirely different character ; but ncthing could persuade her to sing any one of the legitimate Scottish airs , such as " Highland Mary , " " John Anderson , " and the like , unless to burlesque them . She was also averse to psalmody in general , though some of her favorite songs were of a religious character . She admired " Flee as a Bird to your Moifntain , " though it is partly in a minor key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a monotonous air , she sang with a charming expression . I discovered also that many other songs , which were favorites with the public , were disagreeable to her . Knowing from her temper of mind ( for , though unconsciously a little eccentric , she possessed no odd or satirical humor ) that she did not spurn them on account of their popularity , I concluded that they must have certain qualities in common , which differed from those of her favorites . With her aid , therefore , I made a list of both classes of songs , in order that , by comparing the two , we might discover the qualities in their composition that distinguished them . By this comparison it appeared that the tunes which excited her aversion were extremely rhythmical in their movement , while her favorites were of an opposite character . All music has something of this quality , which is a part of its nature ; but many tunes have a singsong regularity in their measure , that soon becomes tiresome to a keen and practised ear . The rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular ballads of " Bonnie Doon , " Long Ago , " and " The Troubadour , than in the songs , " By the sad Sea Waves " and " When the Swallows homeward fly . " Most of these rhythmical tunes are very expressive : I mean that the sentiment they convey is easily perceived . They also strike the general ear as the sweetest music ; and , as they require no extraordinary skill or genius in the performer to bring out their expression , they are very popular , and are sung oftener and by a greater number of persons than any*other tunes . Miss - prefers that music in which the rhythm is partially concealed by a certain irregularity of movement , which requires a keener perception to understand its expression , and more vocal skill to make it apparent to others . There are platitudes in music as well as in eloquence and poetry , and she is very sensitive to the depressing effect of all such passages . Hence her decided aversion to some of the most popular songs . Parlor Singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss - most of my favorite songs were of a class that she disliked , and her favorites were songs in which I had not previously detected any peculiar merit . I had a particular fancy for the old Scottish ballads which she despised , and many of the German airs , which she admired above all others , seemed to me to contain no meaning . I could not avoid the conclusion , therefore , until I discovered the reasons for correcting my judgment , that she was deficient in taste . After I had become familiar with her favorite music and her manner of performing it , I was convinced that my philosophy had failed to discover what was perfectly clear to her genius . According to the principles on which her taste was founded , our popular ballads may be arranged under the following heads - First . All those tunes which , according to the ancient division of music , would be included in the enharmonic scale , as distinguished from those in the diatonic scale , which is our major mode . These songs are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , like some of the old Scottish melodies , soon pall upon a sensitive ear . Second . Songs with a very measured cadence , - singsong airs in which the rhythm , or . swing of the movement , is not sufficiently varied to conceal its uniformity . This sort of music may have considerable sweetness ; it is easily performed ; and can not be much improved by a superior style of execution . The popular ballad of " Long Ago 's is a good example of this class . Third . Songs by ordinary composers , which are neither intrinsically melodious , nor capable of being rendered so by a superior vocalist . The songs under this head are full of musical platitudes and plagiarisms . The world is flooded with them , and they are often very popular for a season on account of the sensational character , and sometimes the real merit , of the words attached to them . October , Fourth . Tunes in which the rhythm is not formal or very apparent , and which do not at first , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or expressive , but which are extraordinary in their effects when their character is brought out by a superior performer . Most of the favorite songs of Miss - were included under this fourth . head . It might be supposed from her extremely fastidious taste , that not many songs would find place among her favorites . But we should bear in mind that it would occupy any man 's attention several days to read the titles alone of all the songs that have been published with English words during the present century . This multitude , even if only one in a hundred be worthy of preservation , affords us an opportunity to select a considerable number of good ones . Although the ballads with which Miss - was familiar were hardly to be counted , there were about a hundred which she acknowledged as her favorites . These I copied into a book for her use , and with her assistance arranged them under twelve different heads , classifying them according to the sentiment conveyed by the words of the song . While , therefore , the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the classification is of a literary rather than a musical character - m . Songs of Cheerful Humor : containing an animated sentiment or an account of some comic or happy incident ; as " The Herdsman 's Mountain Home , " " The Musical Wife . " 2 . Songs of Home : conveying a direct appeal to our love of home and to its domestic scenes ; as " Home , sweet Home , " " Far away . " 3 . Songs of Pathos : founded onsome pathetic incident , or awakening sorrowful images in the mind ; as " The Captive Knight . " 4 . Songs of Domestic Lor*'e : involving a sentiment allied to that of home , but having particular reference to persons ; as " The Bride 's FarewelL " * 5 . Songs of Local AttacMnent : re* // ferring to places or scenes remembered with a passionate interest ; as " Ingle Side , " " The Meeting of the Waters . " 6 . Elegiac Smgs : celebrating our sorrows for the dead ; as " Long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : inspired by the sentiment of love , and which may be either plaintive or lively ; as " Juanita , " " Sweet Afton. " 8 . Songs of Memory : intended to revive the remembrance of the past , - usually plaintive ; as " Oft in the Stilly Night . 9 . Songs of Fancy : in which the interest turns on some imaginary incident ; as " Araby 's Daughter , " " The Lake of the Dismal Swamp . " 10 . Eelz*rious Songs : based upon religious feeling , but not including psalmody or songs of praise ; as " Flee as a Bird to your Mountain . " ii . Ethical Songs : inculcating a moral ; as " Love not . " Very many stupid songs fall under this head , and a few very good ones . 12 . Songr of Absence : songs of regret on account of the separation of friends or lovers ; as " When the Swallows homeward fly , " " The Carrier Dove. ** I could not obtain from Miss - any commendation of the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them would she admit into her collection . The heading of Patriotic Songs , which would have added a thirteenth number to the list , was therefore omitted . Some of the other American songs were among her favorites ; but she thought the German popular songs superior to those of any other nation , so far as her acquaintance with them extended . Although entireiy self-taught in music , it is remarkable that she preferred the styTe of the best composers . She was very fond of the opera and of operatic music , though she did not imitate the stage-singers in her own style of execution . In the course of my experience in making selections of music for private use , no fact has struck me so forcibly as the low and inferior character of the 419 popular music of bygone days . No man of taste would be a very devout admirer of the mass of popular songs of the present day ; but the meanest of these surpasses the average of those which were popular in England , Scotland , and on the Continent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if we trace to their origin those that possess genuine merit , we shall discover that they were taken from some opera or other . Indeed the best of the popular music of the present day is plagiarized or taken outright from the same source . It is the opera that must guide public taste to save it from running into the most ridiculous extravagance ; and , so far as this rule is reversed , - so far as the opera and operatic compositions are adjusted to suit the taste of the millions , - in the same ratio does the opera degrade itself and become frivolous or bombastic . One difficulty in the way of making a good selection of parlor songs is the unavoidable habit of identifying the words with the music . Some very poor tunes have been admired on account of their poetical words , as may be said of many of Thomas Moore 's songs ; and in other instances very ordinary verses have obtained higher credit than they deserved because of the good music that accompanied them . In making a selection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices , in order to form a correct judgment of the music . The music of the parlor would be much improved if it were more generally made the subject of refined criticism . But it has been left to the judgment of ignorant publishers to make selections for the family circle , and they have been governed by the vulgar taste for quartettes , quintettes , and choruses , so that genuine solo singing has been greatly neglected . Hardly a song has been composed or arranged lately , without that miserable appendage of a chorus , in which a multitude of harsh voices join to spoil the effect of the song , as surely as it is well performeck There are certain songs , es* // 420 pecially of a comic sort , in which the chorus is an important part ; but after a serious or plaintive ballad it is in most cases absurd and offensive . Many a time , when the chorus has been introeluced after a song by an agreeable performer , I have thought what might be the effect if all the beasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightingale should make . Sacred music is liable to similar criticism , and , being less under the guidance of men of finished musical education than the opera , it runs into noise and an excessive amount of harmony , which in the opera is always subordinate to the theme . " Harmony , " says Rousseau , " recrulates the tones , confirms their propriety , and renders the modulation more distinct : it adds force to the expression and grace to the air . But from melody alone proceeds that invincible power of pathetic accents over the soul . Let there be performed the most judicious selection of chords without the addition of melody , and you would be tired in less than ten minutes ; while , on the contrary , a single voice without the assistance of harmony will continue to please for a considerable time . Again , be it ever so simple , if there be anything of true pathos in the composition , it becomes immediately interesting ; but , on the contrary , melody without expression will have no effect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion , I would ask , what more interesting accomplishment can a young girl possess than that of performing in an agreeable manner any music for a single voice ? The most eloquent talkers must give place to one who has this gift in perfection . The fame that awaits even a charming author is not attended with so much personal admiration . A fine ballad-singer who , with a tuneful voice , delivers her tones with the grace and simplicity of genius , if endowed with even moderate personal charms , enjoys a sort of deification . Beauty seems commonplace in the pi*esence of her divinity . Wit can not divert from her that attention , nor grace and loveliness that worship , which all hearts pay to her .
