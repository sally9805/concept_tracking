txt It is said that one is compelled to go from home to hear the news , but the Cincinnati morning dailies bring it to our doors . The intelligence in one of the journals of Friday morning was rich and rare . Gen. ROSECRANS was highly delighted with it . He had " killed fifteen hundred rebels , " which was some source of gratification , but was deeply pained at the loss of " five hundred- National troops . " His grief . however , was somewhat softened by learning the fact that he had in quiet possession as prisoners of war ; Gov . WISE and all his rebel companions , who escaped the sanguinary battle-field alive . Gf course he felt gratified that he had personally accomplished all this , while at least a hundred miles . from the scene of the reported action . He is obliged to the Cincinnati Pi ess for the " metropolitan " way in which they captured Visa and thrust him into his arms . The General intended to take him in a brief period if he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap was about ready , when the job was taken off his hands by the newspapers , andWiss was bagged ! Of Course , the General , who is a business man , can now turn his attention to some other quarter , and , from certain indications , that other quarter may be an important one . - A FLAG.OF TRUCE FROM ' A. REBEL GENERAL . For some days back , rumors have been afloat that the rebel General LEE was advancing upon Western Virginia , with a strong force , to cooperate with WISE , o'r to assume command of the forces , and endeavor to drive the National troops from the State . There were no foot-prints , however , which specially indicated his presence anywhere in - Western Virginia , until two or three days ago , when a flag of truce was sent to Gen. REYNOLDS , of the First Brigade , who is in command of the forces at Cheat River Gap . The proposition , as I understand it , was an exchange of prisoners . ' The real object , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of taking observations in regard to numbers and preparations for an attack . The design failed , however , as the bearer of the flag was compelled to halt at least two miles from where.our men were . in camp . Where the bearer of the flag came Tioni , or what distancei. -. was unknown . But the proposition came from Gen. LEE , or purported to  --  and if from him . of course rumor must for once be correct in Weste.rn Virginia . If he is here he is undoubtedly advancing by Cheat River pass , with the expectation of falling upon our forces this side of the mountains , and whip them before they are fairly aware of his presence . We have , however , some four thousand men in the immediate locality , and a larger number within a march of forty-eight hours . If Gen. LEE is in Virginia , it is not probable that he would go over the same ground that WISE has so recently laid waste , but-would hope to catch our men sleeping upon their victories won at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fancied security . He may , perhaps , catch Gen. ROSECRANS asleep , but wheithe does , Gen. LEE will find no difficulty in spreading himself miscellaneously through Western Virginia . No doubt , if he shoula come in strong force he would be enabled to make good progress until our Army could be concentrated , as , from very necessity , they are now scattered over a line of nearly three hundred miles . But the position of affairs is changed from what they were previous to the rout at Rich Mountain , Laurel Hill and Corrack 's Ford . We are now on the defensive , occupy the strongholds . and guard the passes . The advance must be made by the rebels , and not by the Union forces , if they propose to regain the positions which they have lost in the contest thus far . A CHANGE OF HEAD-QUARTERS . The report of the advance of an enemy has not yet assumed sufficient definiteness as to warrant its being given as a positive fact , with details of localities , strength , &c.,; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can state potitively that Gen. ROSECRANS will remove his headquarteis from Clarksburgh within the next 48 hours , unless circumstances should require further delay . What particular section he is bound for , is not known beyond his " militaryfamily , " but my own opinion is , that he will make his headquarters for the present at Buckhannon or Beverly , the former 28 miles from Clarksburgh , and the latter some 15 or 20 miles from Cheat Mountain Pass . If he is going in that direction , put this and that together , viz : the reported advance of the rebel forces , the flag of truce , and the movement of Gen. RossenAxs . It all looks as though there might yet be a lithe sharp work in this section of Western Virginia . Besides the indications to which I have alluded , the forces which have been on the move , have had their " forward march " in the direction of Buuckhtannon and Beverly .                   @ @
