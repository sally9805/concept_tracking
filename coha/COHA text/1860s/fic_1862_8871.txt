" Aux plus dshrits le plus d'amour . " Still hold them in thy tender fostering while The cool air of a wider world they brave , These household growths that rose beneath thy smile To be the earliest offering at thy grave . Nor fail me where , upon the steepening slope , Viewing my future lonely road I stand , With earnest purpose , though with humble hope : Be my strength still , true heart and faithful hand ! PERSONS REPRESENTED . Herbert . Emma . Agatha , formerly called Perdita . Alice . Hermann . Leslie . Woodford . SLAVES . Helen . Hecate . Dorcas. also known as Pamela . Theresa . Ezekiel . Melas . Flora . Boaz . Chloe . Milo . Roxana . Pyrrhus . Daffy . Main text SENTENCE . SCENE I. Belrespiro.  --  Lawn behind the house . Groups of slaves conversing with earnest face and gesture . In the foreground are Melas , Flora , Boaz , Roxana , Pyrrhus , Daffy , and others . MILO Milo enters . He 's come ! he 's come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course he 's come . We knew it before you . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus And I the first ! ' T was I that brought you word . Well , tell on , Milo , let 's know what you 've heard . MILO . Milo Not if you all break in upon me so . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Tell away ! Where did Mr. Herbert go ? MILO . Milo Straight to the dining-room . BOAZ . Boaz And Chole there ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Well , what it must have been to hear him swear ! MILO . Milo No , still and stern . BOAZ . Boaz He only thought the more . But what did Chloe ? MILO . Milo Slipped behind the door ,  --  And whisked off spryly when he turned away . BOAZ , Boaz aside . Why could n't she have had the wit to stay ? To Milo . And you saw  --  MILO . Milo Nothing . BOAZ . Boaz Nothing heard ? MILO . Milo As well . BOAZ . Boaz And nothing 's all you are come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something what he did not do . And what he did not find is something , too . When I took Folly 's rein , he had n't thought To say we never groomed her as we ought ; Nor ever bade us , with his natural frown , Cover her well , and walk her up and down .  --  There stands the creature , dripping , quivering , heaving ! Pyrrhus , it is a sight beyond believing !  --  He entered , calling upon no one 's name ; No one ran down to meet him , when he came . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Where is Miss Helen all the time ? ROXANA . Roxana Alone In the oak room . BOAZ . Boaz So her fine friend is flown ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Friend ? has she one ? FLORA . Flora A hundred at her call ! MILO . Milo Friends of her like and ours !  --  no friends at all ! FLORA . Flora That 's to be proved . BOAZ . Boaz I think it is ! FLORA . Flora We 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask is , whose will all this be ? ROXANA . Roxana Of course Miss Emma 's . BOAZ . Boaz May be ,  --  may be not . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Some say that all is going to Miss  --  what ? ROXANA . Roxana Miss Agatha . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Well , there 's a name ! ROXANA . Roxana And , oh , How strangely , Boaz , Boaz , things do go ! That Perdita ! who ever thought that she Could come to be as much made of as we ? And now just look at her ! How fast and far She 's mounted up above where we all are ! MILO , Milo mimicking Dorcas Perdy ! Perdy ! I hear old Dorcas call ! ROXANA . Roxana And how she used to shake her , too , and all ! MILO . Milo It wo n't do now for us to say the rest . BOAZ . Boaz No ,  --  rule the unruly evil . CHLOE , Chloe entering . That is best . BOAZ . Boaz I saw she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pyrrhus I thought she rather carried her head high . BOAZ . Boaz Why , not exactly . But she had a way  --  Chloe 'll remember that she heard me say  --  CHLOE . Chloe Well , now I think , I seem to recollect  --  BOAZ . Boaz I told you once the skilful could detect Signs of distinction even in the low . CHLOE . Chloe And you meant Perdita ? Yes , that was so . BOAZ . Boaz It is a comfort , friends , to call to mind That , even among the greatest of mankind , The world has seen such instances before : My namesake Boaz lay on a barn-floor ; Moses was put in bulrushes to sleep ; The royal David once looked after sheep ; One Scripture king was brought to such a pass That seven years long he had to live on grass ! ROXANA . Roxana Miss Agatha was never in that case ! PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Nor no one else upon our master 's place ! ROXANA . Roxana It often chanced me speak her a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Milo I 've heard That memory 's sharper set on bane than boon . BOAZ . Boaz The slap you hit her that hot afternoon , Coming from meeting  --  MILO . Milo Somewhat out of tune . Yes , that she wo n't forget so very soon ! ROXANA , Roxana to Boaz . You need n't cast it up to me ! What one Has ever snubbed that girl as you have done ? BOAZ . Boaz I have admonished only . MILO . Milo Let that run ! You ca n't unslap her nor unsnub her now : All you can do is curtsy down and bow . Curtsying and bowing , as he speaks , in mimicry of Roxana and Boaz . MELAS . Melas There 's one was never bad to her : Flora , you . FLORA . Flora I never did much for her . ROXANA . Roxana That is true ! You ca n't make claim ! FLORA . Flora I 've enough else to do . CHLOE . Chloe You do n't expect , then , that you 'll keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her astonished face ! FLORA . Flora Not keep it ! ROXANA . Roxana Well , I 'm glad you 've found your voice . Would n't one think she had it in her choice ? The place , we mean , of our young lady 's maid ,  --  Miss Agatha 's , in fact . I am afraid , My pretty little Flora , you will find Nodding at Chloe . The mistress has another in her mind . BOAZ . Boaz If you want favor , Flora , and not blame , Do n't be too much with folks that I could name . DAFFY . Daffy You mean Miss Helen ! BOAZ . Boaz Silence , boy ! You dare Give my words meaning that they will not bear ? PYRRHUS , Pyrrhus glancing at the upper windows of the house , and nodding towards it . Why , what do you suppose , now , will be done With  --  BOAZ . Boaz That unhappy lady and her son ? Pyrrhus nods . Least said is soonest mended . And the less You say of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAFFY . Daffy What ! do you think they 'll punish her so bad ? BOAZ . Boaz A question not for you to ask , my lad ! ROXANA . Roxana You do n't think , surely , that they 'll let her stay ? BOAZ . Boaz Whatever I may think , I can not say . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus You do n't suppose that she 'll be sent away ? BOAZ . Boaz I do n't suppose . But what you 'll see , you 'll see . And when you see it  --  you may think of me . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus And now the boy ? Where do you think he 'll go ? They 'll send him straight off , wo n't they ? BOAZ . Boaz Pyrrhus , no ! He 'll stay about here for a season yet ; Then pass from hand to hand in their own set , Till he gets far enough to be forgot And take his portion with the common lot . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus That 's the way , is it ? MILO . Milo Boaz knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's neither deaf nor blind . MILO . Milo Where is that Hecate ? No one seems to ask . BOAZ . Boaz She hides her face since she has dropped her mask . ROXANA . Roxana So great a person once , and now forgot ! BOAZ . Boaz But as brush crackling underneath a pot Is the short pleasure of the wicked 's day ! Waste no more thought on Hecate ! Let her stay Where she has hid herself . MILO . Milo Yet I must say The thought of her amuses me . Such art ! Let none of you rest boast yourselves ! How smart That creature was whom we all called moonstruck ! And then to think upon her daughter 's luck ! To take and hold for twenty years the seat Of the young mistress ! Oh , it was complete ! Then Mr. Herbert senior ! to cheat him ! Carry his son off ! Oh , that was n't slim ! Believe , I 'm not the only one will laugh To hear that old bird has been caught with chaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MILO . Milo You wo n't repeat ! You know , if you began that game , you 'd meet Your more than master at it ! Be discreet ! BOAZ . Boaz Roxy is right . What ! young man , do you jest , When your own mistress is so sore distressed ? Think of her daughter ! think how she was dressed ! Sackcloth and ashes we might call her best , Compared with what that angel should have worn ! You must remember her all soiled and torn ? And then the buffetings that she has borne ! You can laugh , Milo , at what makes us mourn ? Clasping his hands . And when we think how that sweet saint was barred From her own mother 's love ! Oh , that was hard ! Shut out , too , twenty years from all she had ! Nothing was ever heard of half so bad ! FLORA . Flora Worse might have been . CHLOE . Chloe Worse ? ROXANA . Roxana What worse , pray ? FLORA . Flora Why , think if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been the wrong one set up there , And poor Miss Helen cheated of her share . PYRRHUS . Pyrrhus Well , to be sure ! ROXANA , Roxana indignantly . What ! MELAS , Melas aside to Flora . Flora , do take care ! CHLOE . Chloe They say you wait upon Miss Helen still . FLORA . Flora Whom should I wait on ? CHLOE . Chloe Well , do n't take it ill . I did n't blame you for't , I only said . ROXANA . Roxana And some think she might do without a maid . FLORA . Flora If you 're of them , do n't think your thoughts to me ! She has a maid while I live . BOAZ . Boaz Thought is free . CHLOE . Chloe So it is , Boaz . We ca n't hold our own , And might as well let other folks ' alone . FLORA . Flora If you could see her ! Though your hearts were stone They 'd soften into human flesh again , Brought into presence with that silent pain ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this stir .  --  You 're out , no doubt , upon some job for her ? ROXANA . Roxana She sends on errands , then ? Keeps up her state ? BOAZ . Boaz The force of habit , Roxy . CHLOE . Chloe Yes , that 's great . BOAZ , Boaz to Flora . You 're a good girl . If I could save you now Some steps or trouble ! Do but tell me how ! FLORA . Flora I came out only just to take the air . But if you really should have time to spare , And would do something for me  --  MELAS . Melas Here am I ! FLORA . Flora I see you , Melas . Your turn by-and-by . Boaz was first to offer . MELAS , Melas to himself . That 's the way ! Just what my heart is full of others say ! FLORA , Flora to Boaz . Oh , Boaz , how considerate you are ! You 'll have to go you do n't know yet how far . But you will tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid man . BOAZ . Boaz I 'm known as such . How can I help her ? FLORA . Flora Her ? Oh , now I see It is a her you want to help , not me ! BOAZ . Boaz ' T is for yourself ? Oh , test my zeal and try ! For others I could walk ,  --  for you I fly ! MELAS , Melas aside . How wrong in Flora , when she knows so well !  --  Poor Chloe 's face ! I noticed how it fell !  --  Oh , women , women ! What ! and Flora , too , Is pleased with flattery , no matter who May bring it to her ! takes it as here due !  --  I could forgive her for not liking me ; But put before me such a one as he ! Boaz , while talking with Flora , gradually withdraws from the group , Flora following , until they stand quite apart from the rest . Chloe watches them anxiously ; Melas looks another way . BOAZ . Boaz Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I really am almost ashamed to tell . To such a man as you a thing so small Might seem to be beneath him . BOAZ . Boaz Not at all . The day of small things must not be despised . Let my humility be exercised ! FLORA . Flora Oh , then , if you get something by it too  --  You know Ezekiel ? BOAZ . Boaz I suppose I do . Most people know him . Aside . Has he humbugged you ? Aloud . If I do n't see him as the many see  --  FLORA . Flora It 's not Ezekiel that I want ,  --  not he ! But in his garden , Boaz , oh , there grow Such strawberries ! If you would like to go  --  BOAZ . Boaz Berries ! how would you have me bring them back ? I misbecome a basket or a pack . FLORA . Flora Do n't bring them back at all . You 'll only say " The season 's forward , " and then come away . BOAZ . Boaz What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he promised me That I should have those strawberries . BOAZ . Boaz Promised ! He ! FLORA . Flora And he 's quick-witted ; there 's no need to dint Things into his brain : he can take a hint . BOAZ . Boaz But creature comforts are not in his line . FLORA . Flora No , not in his , but very much in mine . And what are strawberries raised for ? Can you tell ? BOAZ . Boaz What are they raised for ? Why , they 're raised to sell . And , to be just to him , I never knew Him sending gifts to such young things as you . FLORA . Flora Well , Boaz , now I 'll tell you the true truth . That poor old Hitabel ! without a tooth , And flat in bed besides ! Do only think ! For three long years mainly to live on drink ! You may imagine how some tender food , To mump away upon , must do her good ! The berries were to be for her , poor thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But to a poor old woman  --  BOAZ , Boaz with candor . Well , he might . FLORA . Flora I should n't want to ask for them outright ,  --  ' T would not be delicate ,  --  but you might glance Upon the strawberry-patch , as if by chance , And , falling into an admiring gaze ,  --  " These must be those I have heard Flora praise . " You are so natural ! You can turn it so ! BOAZ . Boaz Jael herself could not have said you no ! Yes , I , if any , am the one to go . You know , perhaps , it is not every face Finds welcome upon Colonel Winter 's place ? FLORA . Flora Oh , yes , indeed ! I know the Colonel wrote To our good master gone a saucy note , Saying our folks had too much leave to roam , And begging him to make them stay at home . Our master flamed up , it was good to see !  --  Oh , where to find another such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because you 're known For a judicious man , that you alone I chose to ask to go . Why , no one dreads Your putting uppish thoughts in people 's heads . BOAZ . Boaz It tickles me now that the Colonel should Keep that Ezekiel there , from whom no good Is to be looked for , mark me , yet should fear The harmless simpletons that go from here ! FLORA . Flora Ah , but we 're apt to boast our feed and fare : So different from what they get down there ! BOAZ . Boaz What then ? They could n't get it , if they tried . He has his will . What does he want beside ? FLORA . Flora ' T is pleasanter to have folks satisfied . BOAZ . Boaz His never would be , Flora ! I declare , That , if his place were hanging in the air , And not a neighbor sould to visit there , And prick fault-finding into them , yet they Would break out with it in the natural way ! FLORA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deep : A hypocrite that works while others sleep ! That fellow is a great deal more than sly : He 's one that looks his master in the eye ! And yet the Colonel , a hard man to please , And one not fond of leaving folks their ease , Gives that Ezekiel his will and way , Letting him go and come by night or day ! FLORA . Flora He trusts Ezekiel , and they say he must , Because he has no other he can trust . BOAZ . Boaz Well , what old Peter said once is too just ! FLORA . Flora What was it , Boaz ? BOAZ . Boaz Why , the old man said , In his experience , people are afraid Of what wo n't hurt'em , and hold out their arms To give an open welcome to their harms . My mind deceives me , if Ezekiel 's not Making his heart like to an oven hot . What if the Colonel , caught some morning , learned That he , like Ephraim , was a cake not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Ezekiel 's bad . You 'll not tell him you think so ? BOAZ . Boaz Am I mad ? I 'll flatter up his berries . FLORA . Flora I'am so glad ! " The season 's forward " ' s all you need to add ; And we shall have the best that can be had . BOAZ . Boaz You 'll get them how ? FLORA . Flora He 'll come himself , be sure . Ezekiel is no sayer , but a doer . BOAZ , Boaz aside . Is that a hit ? Aloud . I hope I am the same . FLORA . Flora I hope so , too . CHLOE , Chloe coming up . With all you have that name . MELAS Melas seeing Chloe join them , comes up too . What ! are you going , Flora ? Have you found  --  FLORA . Flora Nothing for you quite yet . But  --  you be round ! Flora goes . Melas returns to the other group , and begins talking to Pyrrhus . Milo , Roxana , and Daffy soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benignity , but a little embarrassed . Ah , Chloe ! CHLOE , Chloe taking up the corner of her apron . Boaz ! BOAZ . Boaz Well , what is it , dear ? Why , bless my soul !  --  it ca n't be !  --  what ! a tear ? CHLOE , Chloe sobbing . I did n't mean to interrupt  --  disturb  --  BOAZ . Boaz You came in good time , my dear child , to curb That poor girl 's  --  madness , I might almost say . CHLOE , Chloesobbing . But Flora  --  looks  --  so well  --  for her  --  to-day ! BOAZ . Boaz Sosoish ! I was thinking all the while , Dear Chloe , she could never have your smile . CHLOE , Chloe smiling . Boaz , oh , if I only could believe  --  BOAZ . Boaz What motive , Chloe , have I to deceive ? Assuredly , you must have marked how she Insisted on a private talk with me ? CHLOE . Chloe You can not wonder that I take it ill You bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And think you that it is for her , my girl , I do her nonsense errand to that churl ? CHLOE . Chloe What for , then ? BOAZ . Boaz Chloe , let not woman pry Into man 's matters . They are quite too high For your discernment . And you ought to know From Scripture history what that comes to . In curiosity was always woe . From Eve to Matty Meddlesome ' t was so . Women get scalded fingers , when they try To have one of them in man 's apple-pie . CHLOE . Chloe And Flora ? Has n't she put one in yours ? BOAZ . Boaz Well , Flora has no secret that insures Her from the common lot . There is no charm That can keep female impudence from harm . CHLOE . Chloe You let her into your high matters , though ? BOAZ , Boaz aside . It 's cruel in me to distress her so . Aloud . No , my poor foolish little Chloe , no ! She knows no more than you what I design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To men who plan great things is often sent , To help themselves with , some mean instrument . Flora , perhaps , may furnish me some aid ,  --  But not so much as you , my pretty maid ! I know who 's kind and diligent and true : The one who has my confidence is  --  you ! CHLOE . Chloe You really mean it ? BOAZ . Boaz Well , are you content ? CHLOE . Chloe I have your confidence ? BOAZ . Boaz To some extent . I could not promise , and you would not ask That I should set before myself the task Of teaching you the workings of my mind . Such studies are not fit for womankind . Knowledge of what we want , not what we do , Nor what we think of , is the thing for you . " What can we do to help ? " helps meet inquire , And , having done it , silently retire . " What can I do to help ? " my girl would say . Ask me , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHLOE . Chloe What can I do to help ? BOAZ . Boaz That 's sweetly said . Much , very much .  --  Flora 's Miss Helen 's maid ? CHLOE . Chloe She calls herself so , and she has the face To say she always means to keep her place . BOAZ . Boaz And she may make her word good yet . CHLOE . Chloe Oh , how ? BOAZ . Boaz It does n't look so , certainly , just now . But listen , Chloe . Know it has been found , By the old fathers , that the world goes round . What 's down to-day may be upside next turn . We must be careful , therefore , what we spurn . Wait till you 're sure which way the wind will set , And do n't be holding your head too high yet . CHLOE . Chloe You are a perfect Christian ! To the weak And fallen you can be so kind and meek ! BOAZ . Boaz As preacher ' t is my duty , and as man . CHLOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what woman can . BOAZ . Boaz And this she can : can lend her pretty ear To gather up what Boaz wants to hear . This can she : she can let her pretty eyes Wander for Boaz , be his little spies . Chloe , I 'll trust you farther than I meant . Things in this household give me discontent . Wherever I may look , I plainly trace A certain something upon every face . CHLOE . Chloe Boaz ! you do n't ! what can that something be ? BOAZ . Boaz Enough ' t is something that is kept from me . Chloe , my Chloe , we must find it out . A most uncomfortable thing is doubt ! CHLOE . Chloe Oh , Boaz , nobody could mean you ill ! Or is it me , you think ? BOAZ . Boaz Poor child , be still ! None mean you evil . Humbleness protects , And I am one whom no ill-will affects . It is not that ; but duty and desire , Both working in me , prick me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But make the mistress ' interests my own ; So , seeing certain signs of secrecy , My cogitations much have troubled me ; For it has been a maxim with me long , That , where there 's mystery , there 's always wrong . Now , Chloe , do not miss the smallest thing : A nod a hem , a beck , a whispering ,  --  All may have meaning that you can not see : Treasure all up and bring them safe to me . Keep a sharp eye on Flora : she 's the heart Of every mischief ; but we 'll balk her art ! Especially if she put on an air , In doing things , as if she did n't care . Who saw or heard , oh , Chloe , then beware ! For that 's the semblance that the wicked bear . If you should come within Miss Helen 's door , You must be spry and watchful all the more . On that impostor my suspicions fall : I have an inkling she 's the root of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's my first word and last : we never know What may be going to happen here below . Set all in memory down as in a book ; And keep your honest simpleness of look . Oh , Chloe , in this world so false and base , How precious to me is that artless face ! What so distrustful Thomas could descry A double meaning in that single eye ? If you could still seem shallow , yet be deep ,  --  Still prattle idly , yet my counsel keep ,  --  Still wear your own do-nothing sort of way , Yet have your senses all the time in play ,  --  Be humble still , yet , when I bid you , bold ,  --  Oh , Chloe , you would be a mine of gold ! And now , when I come home , what shall I bring Back to my little charmer ? what good thing ? CHLOE . Chloe Only yourself ! BOAZ . Boaz An answer kind and just . Myself I 'll bring you , full of love ' and trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know to give is better than receive . To tend and serve is woman 's richest treat . Tenderly . And could you manage something nice to eat ? There 's little chance of getting dinner there : Ezekiel 's provender is rather spare . Chloe nods joyfully and goes . BOAZ . Boaz turning to go , sees Melas , whom Pyrrhus has just left . Ah , Melas , my good boy , you 're still on hand ! If you should have a moment at command , And meet that little Flora , would you say That she shall see me with the close of day ? MELAS Melas looks fiercely after Boaz  --  who goes away slowly  --  and then falls into a dejected attitude . Flora enters and passes near him . He does not lift his eyes , nor appear to notice her , but , after she has gone out , gazes earnestly in the direction where she disappeared . After remaining a few moments absorbed , he sings . They tell us Truth is dearer Than Fancy , and more fair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her harsh and bare . Far lovelier is seeming ! How mournfully gave way My happy moonlit dreaming To this forsaken day ! Love stood , all gay and shining , And held forth , full of glee , Sweet wreaths that he was twining : I thought they were for me ! Love ! mock not my believing ! It was not worth thy art To compass the deceiving Of such a simple heart ! Flora Flora enters , passes Melas again , hesitates a moment , and then returns . You can sing , Melas ! MELAS . Melas I have that left yet . FLORA . Flora Oh , Melas , with your heart , you can forget ! MELAS , Melas as if going . He who 's forgotten , Flora , surely may . FLORA . Flora Forgotten ? You ? O foolish Melas , stay ! We must not quarrel till a happier day . I want to answer back : you know I 'm not A tardy payer in that kind of scot . You know I 've spirit , and you know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've the heart  --  to chide . Now think that I have cried all , and all said , And that your doubts of me are fully paid We can so easily put off our cares ! Oh , Melas , there are those that must keep theirs ! MELAS . Melas You know me , Flora : you know if I could  --  FLORA . Flora Yes , indeed , Melas , I was sure you would ! It was n't I that had a doubt of you . MELAS . Melas I thought that we were not to quarrel . FLORA . Flora True ! MELAS , Melas laughing . First take the beam out , as the Scripture saith . FLORA . Flora But I have got to draw upon your faith . It is because of that I called to mind Your little failing , not to be unkind . MELAS . Melas So be it , Flora ! only set my task ! FLORA . Flora You must do blindly everything I ask ; Must come and go , as I say go and come ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb ; You must not even look curious at me , nor A single once must say to me , " What for ? " MELAS . Melas Hard ,  --  little Flora ! but , if it must be , I could for you  --  FLORA . Flora No , Melas , not for me ; But for Christ 's sake , and for dear charity . Not on my own part could I thus entreat ; Not for my own good could I use deceit , Nor try you , open-hearted boy , to win To artifice that almost seems a sin ! More distant griefs are knocking at your heart ; Dangers we need not share in claim our art . My bosom aches beneath another 's cares ; My temples bleed with thorns that are not theirs . But could you see the head bent humbly down That owns the pressure of the torture crown ! MELAS . Melas Her sorrows pierce me by your look and word ; I hear her voice in yours ; my heart is stirred To its last corner . Flora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I should shrink From danger or from labor ? Tell me all ! FLORA . Flora All that I can I 've told . MELAS . Melas But you let fall Something of danger . FLORA . Flora Certainly . What then ? MELAS . Melas Only this : danger is the part of men . FLORA . Flora Of women , when they 're called to it . MELAS . Melas Not when A man is by who has the right and will To stand between the tender one and ill . Speak , then ! What is the purpose , and the plan ? I can do more to aid than Flora can . FLORA . Flora I know not yet what the design may be ; Nor do I know what part is set for me . I 've done my little duty for to-day , Plotting those wide ears and quick eyes away , And , through an unsuspected messenger , Sending a hint that is to profit her . But I give blind obedience , as you must . MELAS . Melas Flora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flora Yes , in a better head , a stronger heart Than all of us have , and a deeper art . Projects that head grows have a steadfast root ; Plans that heart fosters can not fail of fruit . MELAS . Melas Fruit ?  --  bitter fruit it may be , to our taste ! Do not rush , Flora , with too generous haste Upon your own undoing . You may waste Yourself upon a useless work . I can Even risk this chance , because I am a man . I , at your bidding , or at hers , would face Not deadly danger only , but disgrace . But how can woman venture far , when blame Brings her not only misery , but shame ? FLORA . Flora Melas , we shall succeed ! We shall succeed ! MELAS . Melas It may be : still our humble hearts may bleed , While higher ones with satisfaction beat At the well-working of their clever feat . I know not all , and yet I can divine What the end is , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll show some sense Of our deserts . Perhaps they will go hence , Contented with the issue of the deed , But thoughtless of protection or of meed For those who wrought it . This , if we succeed ,  --  If we succeed ! But , Flora , if we fail ! What would that bring us to ? To stripes , to jail ! And beyond these , to endless banishment ! No loving word will follow where we 're sent . In vain we turn the eager ear ! in vain The thirsting sight to its last limit strain ! No breath from home , no presence ! The hard earth Reproves the exile with his distant birth ; The very lights of heaven overhead Reluctant rays upon his pathway shed ; The palest spectres of joys perished fill The loneliness in which he walks , until The weary-hearted turns his sickening eyes To death and darkness from the foreign skies . A man might brace himself to meet this fate ; But woman doomed to die so desolate ! What man that was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FLORA . Flora Not death and darkness , but new birth and light ! Have we not learned that on the heavenly height , Which lies beyond this valley deep and dim , We find the life that we have lost for Him ? Better on earth to droop and die alone Than be of those whom Jesus will disown ! They only truly count among the dead , Who , in His own , Him have not comforted .  --  Melas , it would not be like you to try To have a better place in heaven than I ! In heaven ? perhaps they would not let me there ; But send me down to Satan and despair ! Could you be happy , in your robes of light , While I was shivering with pain and fright ? They perish who have ignorantly erred ; How , then , with me , who 've threat and promise heard ? " Sick and in prison , " was the Saviour 's word : Sick and in prison is Miss Helen 's lot ; And who is kin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling ! who could ever be A little one of Jesus , if not he ? A wonder , Melas ! What if , when we die , And stand up there together , you and I , Waiting upon Messiah 's last decrees , We hear ,  --  " Ye did it unto one of these ! " She gives her hand to Melas . And if not ?  --  Let us work for Jesus ' love , Although they take no note of it above . We will not lend the Lord , but freely give ; And , as His will is , let us die or live ! MELAS , Melas pressing her hand to his heart . It is agreed , then ! We will all things share : Let Melas suffer everything you bear , And , where he ventures , you have leave to dare . Lead the way , Flora ! Tell me what to do ! I hear the Master speak tome through you ! They go out . SENTENCE . SCENE II . A room in the house at Belrespiro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a table in the middle of the room are books , a work-basket , a child 's little velvet cap , and a letter . HERBERT , Herbert enters abruptly . Not here ! Some moments yet for thought !  --  Oh , Helen , Is my heart freer that I do not find you ,  --  You , who could lighten once the heaviest hour ? He walks hurriedly up and down the room , then stops near the table . She does not seek me . Is it pride or fear ?  --  Sees the letter and takes it up . For me ! My father 's hand ! Throws it down . I will not read it ! I know it all as well as if I did : Full to the brim with pious consolation ! As if I were not crazed and desperate Enough already , on the top of all I must be dinned with piety and wisdom !  --  And yet he has  --  I must allow it  --  insight Into this world 's affairs . And I 'm bewildered ; I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look before me or behind ; The world seems shattering into wreek about me . Let me know where I stand and what I am !  --  Seizes the letter and tears it open ; reads . " My son , the tidings of your great misfortune Have filled your mother and myself with grief . I write to you at once , that such support As a fond father 's counsels , sympathy , Can give a child , you may receive from me.  --  And first , my son , forget not in your sorrow By whom this blow is struck . Bow reverently Before that Higher Will which prostrates ours . Oh , who shall say , my son , that this reverse Has fallen upon us wholly undeserved ? Our pride in our great wealth , our ancient name , Was it unmarked of Heaven ? Oh , my Herbert , A haughty spirit goes before a fall ! We should have thought of this . But , since we have not , What now remains is to conform ourselves To the decrees of Heaven ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And first , we must consider what to do With this poor child whom we supposed our own . It is not to be thought of that a child Who has your features and has borne your name Should take his place among the other servants . "  --  Herbert , interrupting himself . The other servants ! God ! the other servants ! Oh , Hecate ! Hellcat ! were you but my slave !  --  Reads . " Still less could he continue in your house , Being what he is , as your acknowledged child . What I have thought of is : Your mother 's sister Married  --  it was a sorrow at the time  --  A Northern man of no account . She died . But she left children . They 're not too well off . The second son  --  now , it appears , a poet  --  Was tutor once to Richard Stanley 's son . "  --  As if I did not know it ! What of him ?  --  " It was before you were engaged to Helen . You may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clergyman . One of them would perhaps receive the child , And , for a moderate remuneration , Superintend his bringing up .  --  Of course The boy is not to know his history . "  --  Breaking off . I am not prone to hate ,  --  but if there lives A man whom I could hate , ' t is this James Leslie . Did he not dare to raise his eyes to Helen ? I saw it well , though Helen did not see it ,  --  I think she did not ,  --  but my eyes were sharpened By love and  --  no , not jealousy ; poor devil , He was not worth it . But his mad presumption Awoke contemptuous anger , as it should . I read him through : this man who taught for money Not only dared admire my future bride , But even to think I was not worthy of her . His grave politeness did not take me in . I felt his thoughts . Of late I 've often seen His trumpery books lying on Helen 's table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Was ever man so tortured and perplexed ?  --  Reads . " It will be safe to trust him to the Leslies , Paying each year a regular allowance For his support , and leaving to themselves The choice of trade , or business , or profession That he shall be brought up to . They 're good people . Something Quixotic in them ,  --  like their mother : But that 's the reason that I think of them For this commission . They 'll do better by him Than if he were the heir of name and wealth . "  --  Do better by him ! Yes , I well believe it !  --  Of name and wealth indeed ! He 's Helen 's child !  --  A compensation ? They will not receive it , And I 'm to be beholden for a favor !  --  James Leslie guardian to my Helen 's child ! What do I say ? father to Helen 's child ! The child is not to know his birth ; this Leslie Will take the place , if not the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge Of her child 's fate ? Even if I concealed it , Some one would tell her . These things will leak out . Too many confidants in all these matters . Leslie himself would leave no stone unturned To bring it to her knowledge . ' T were as well At once to let her know as try to hide it . And then  --  then there would be a tie between them ! None binds her now to me  --  except her love : I think she loves me . Yes , her sweet submission To all my whims , her anxious care to please me , Her gentle patience ,  --  these are evidence She loves me . Yes , I can be sure of that . She loves me now ; I have this hold upon her . But if she make demands upon my love More than I ought to grant ?  --  I half foresee She may expect what is impossible :  --  Will not her love then cool ? No duty binds her . She is no more my wife ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere another day . No one as yet has called my right in question , ' T is true ;  --  but then if she herself should do it ? Hecate was made free by her master 's will , And Perdita ,  --  the daughter now and heiress . But Helen  --  what is she  --  and whose ?  --  My father Regards me still as master of her fate . And so I am , of course , in any case . Who would dispute my claim ? Absurd ! absurd !  --  This will be soon arranged .  --  Well , what 's the rest ? I left off here . Yes .  --  Reads . " They 'll do better by him Than if he were the heir of name and wealth . So put your mind at ease . I 'll write to-day And have the matter settled . Then dismiss it Forever from your thoughts . " " Beside the child , There is the wretched mother to be thought of . We must not , even in this first bitter moment , Commit injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this crime Which has involved our families in gloom ; Nor that she sought , by frank and full confession , To make atonement for the long imposture . These thingst considered , let us do by her As justice , prudence , Christian charity Require of us . I am convinced , my son , You will not for a single moment think Of keeping this unhappy woman near you . "  --  Not think of it ? I think of nothing else !  --  " Though , in some points of view , the case might seem To call for more excuse than do the most Of these unhallowed unions , yet in others It would be still more reprehensible . The facts have been so public , she herself Is so well known , has held such a position , ' T would make much talk . All circumstances tend To give the matter notoriety . "  --  Well , that 's true , too . I must think out some plan .  --  " I will not dwell on this . You are the last To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , to be sure ,  --  it is not very pleasant To be the fable of society .  --  Reads . " I 've thought of several plans myself . One is , To let her , too , be taken to the North . "  --  Never !  --  whatever else I do , that never !  --  " With her accomplishments , she could perhaps Maintain herself with very little aid . But to this plan there are some grave objections . "  --  I should have found them out , if you had not .  --  " First , she would not be parted from her child . He would then know his history , and later This might give rise to inconveniences . Then her appearance and her manners and all Would mark her out : she could not live obscurely . The story would be bruited everywhere ; ' T would have no chance to die away ; and thus This frightful scandal would invest our name , Wherever it was heard . Still other reasons Suggest themselves to me ,  --  but these the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder question , How to dispose of her , than of the child . The plan I 've thought of for the present moment Is , to convey her quietly at once To the plantation of your Aunt Elise . On this retired estate she will be safe From prying eyes , malicious observations , From all the miseries she must undergo , If she continued in the neighborhood Of what she once considered as her home . There in retirement she can school herself To bear this blow , and , in your good aunt 's charge , Will by degrees become habituated To a new mode of life . We can decide Hereafter on some permanent arrangement . "  --  What does he think of me ? Have I no heart ? No natural feeling ? Shall I send this woman , This lovely , gentle , tender , feeling woman , A woman who has been two years my wife , Shall I , then , send her to wear out her days In worse than solitude ,  --  in base dependence On that close-handed , psalm-singing old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , she should have A better lot than that ; but , as it is , I can not lose her , can not part from her Even for a time . Now first I know how strong , How deep my love for her . Now first I learn How priceless in herself this lovely creature . The wealth and rank that seemed a part of her Are stripped away , but she has nothing lost . They took from her more lustre than they lent . No ,  --  come what will , I do not give her up . Thus far I will respect my father 's wishes : I will not be the cause of open scandal ; I will find out some way to reconcile My love with what I owe my reputation .  --  Reads . " Trust all to me . I will consult and act . Fear nothing . I shall soon work out some plan Which will secure her comfort and your peace . "  --  I will provide for both . Trust all to me Rather , my father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be so arranged that she will never Be seen or heard of in our world again . For you , my son , I know this separation Will be one trial more . Let sense of duty , Let manly honor , strengthen you to bear it . Remember what you owe yourself , your name ; Nor let a weak affection make you falter . As soon as you are calm enough to hear me , I wish to have a serious talk with you . The surest way to throw the matter off And bring the whole thing to oblivion Will be , when all this has been duly settled , To form a new connection . With your fortune , With your advantages of every sort , You can command as excellent a match As we thought this was at the time you made it . Your mother has already in her eye  --  But this is premature . "  --  Indeed , I think so ! Another marriage ?  --  now ?  --  oh , monstrous thought ! Yet ' t is my father 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my son , God have you in His keeping ! That He may give you strength to bear this blow , And to act under it as virtue bids , Is the devout petition of Your father . "  --  Herbert stands musing with the letter in his hand , then : Who can it be , though , that my mother thought of ? Perhaps  --  No , hardly probable ; she is not Quite rich enough to satisfy my mother . Or  --  No , they know I would not think of her . Then  --  Ah , I have it ! now I know their choice ! Yes , she was but a child when I was married ; But now sixteen , a beauty and an heiress , And our near neighbor : yes , I see it all . They might as well have told me . Yes , I see . If I were free , it would not be so bad !  --  Am I not free ?  --  Good God ! where go my thoughts ? Could Helen see them ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wound her ; no , I will not !  --  Yet if , hereafter , many years hereafter , When all that now is new and terrible Has taken its place among the things that are , When equally our sorrow and our love Have learned to hold themselves within the channel Of every-day emotions ,  --  what if then I should fulfil my duty to my parents And to society , and  --  Checking himself abruptly . Wait till then ! Down , down , intrusive thoughts ! You make me feel  --  Me , who am known the soul of truth and honor  --  As if my bosom harbored hidden treasons.  --  Treason to whom ? To one who at this moment Plots , perhaps , how she may resist my claims ! If so , if she have cherished even a doubt Whether she still be solely , wholly mine , Then was her heart the first to be unfaithful , Then she herself has broken the spirit-bond Which only holds her now .  --  Whence this distrust ? Have I not always known her fond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than love ? Could she who was so gentle , so compliant , In her bright days , grow hard and positive Now in her poverty and helplessness ? Impossible ! And yet some inward instinct Refutes my reasons and suggests a doubt .  --  I can not live thus . This unsettled state Is worse to bear than any certainty . This interview , so dreaded , so decisive ,  --  It must take place ; already , this delay , What thoughts may it have waked in Helen 's mind !  --  Am I prepared ? Do I myself yet know What I can promise , what I must refuse ? My mind is still in chaos . In her presence What hope to find the calmness that now fails me ? Let me at least be clear in my own thoughts .  --  Is it of thee I speak , my own sweet Helen ? Is it thy gentle presence that I fear ? To answer thee I would prepare myself ? I am prepared for all , except to lose thee ! Goes out hastily . SENTENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Helen and Alice sat together in the Second Act of the Tragedy of Errors . The flowers are still where Alice placed them , but neglected and withered . Helen seated on a low chair , near a large sofa , on which lies a sleeping child ; she looks towards the door , as if listening for some one 's approach . HELEN . Helen An hour ago I heard his horse 's feet . He does not come . What feeling keeps him from me ?  --  A letter from his father waited for him . He stays to read . Would he have stayed to read it A week ago ?  --  Perhaps the load of anguish He 's borne about with him for three long days Has weighed him down at length . His last strength fails ! Perhaps he lies , while I conjecture here , Helpless in fever ! Oh , he calls my name ! She starts up . And I stay here ? I hesitate to seek him ?  --  She sinks down again . Ah , even in the forming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls me not ! But , sunk in reverie , listless and dejected , He broods upon the sorrows I have caused him . He has not strength to come and face my anguish ; He has not strength to look upon our boy . His ruined life he sees spread out before him ,  --  The past a mockery , the future blank ; Hope , memory , henceforth alike forbidden !  --  Rising . He suffers , and I live and am not there !  --  Moves forward , but checks herself again . Unbidden ?  --  ' T is my grief he fears to meet . When he shall see me strong and calm and patient , Ready to bear whatever must be borne , He will be strong . We will consult together How this misfortune may be best supported , How its effects made lighter to our child .  --  And yet I go not ! What spell holds me here ? Oh , what new feebleness is this ? My mind Has lost its equipoise . I know no longer How to distinguish my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . Where lies the right ?  --  Seek strength and light in prayer !  --  Oh , in this ruin is my faith , too , shipwrecked ? No , no ! my faith in God is firm !  --  In man ?  --  She covers her eyes with her hand for a moment , then : My soul , oh , own not even to thyself What fearful doubt stands between thee and him ! Let me save these , at least ,  --  my love , my trust ! Oh , I will rescue them by force of prayer !  --  And yet , when He , the Great , the Holy One , In that dread night whose morrow was to find Him Alone on earth , instinct with earth 's affections ,  --  His life divided from the common life , His human heart from human sympathies ,  --  When even He , turning for help to Heaven , Prayed that the cup might pass from Him , it passed not . O God , the strength that we may ask of Thee Is strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart its fears , its faintness , Father and God ! Behold thy child , thy servant ! Aid me to say , to feel , Thy will be done ! Fervently . Thy will be done ! A door is heard to close violently . A few moments after , footsteps are heard approaching along the corridor . And yet  --  yet if it might be , Oh , let the cup yet pass from me , my Father ! Herbert enters hastily ; stops a moment near the door . Helen rises as he enters , advances a few steps , and then remains standing . Herbert comes suddenly forward and clasps her in his arms . Herbert , holding her from him , and gazing at her with tenderness and admiration . My Helen !  --  Aside . And I thought of parting from her !  --  Aloud . You do not speak ! You have no welcome for me ? No smile ? Has one week made a change like this ? HELEN . Helen A week has made great changes . HERBERT . Herbert And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride , my Helen ? HELEN , Helen aside . Oh , noble heart ! Did I  --  I could not doubt him ! HERBERT . Herbert I see that sweet smile dawning . My own treasure , You could not for an instant doubt my love ? HELEN , Helen aside . What shame is mine , that I could dare to doubt ! Oh , would I could forget that moment 's treason !  --  Aloud . Oh , Herbert , tell me that your love is left me ! With that , and with my child , I have lost nothing .  --  Yet , if  --  dear Herbert , if  --  But it is not so ! Yet , if it had been ,  --  if you had been changed , I should not still have had the right to blame you . Great is my gratitude to you and Heaven That this last trial was not laid on me !  --  After a pause , in a low , tremulous voice . But , if the blight that rests upon my name , Invading all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look had I reproached thee . Silent or blessing thee , I would have passed Forth from my Eden , from my golden time , To the cold rigors of the iron world . Too well I know the costly sacrifice Fidelity to me must ask of thee !  --  Oh , Herbert , and thy love has strength for all ? HERBERT . Herbert My love ? Oh , were I but secure of thine ! HELEN , Helen looking at him anxiously . Herbert , consider well . It is not question Of courage to resolve a generous deed , But of that patient strength which day by day Supports the oppressive burden . Hast thou this ? Where'er we go , our story goes with us.  --  I have thought over all .  --  Canst thou support The averted look , the smile , the curious glance ? Canst thou look forward to the lifelong exile That must divide thee from thy friends , thy parents ? The sojourn in another , ruder clime , Amid new scenes and uncongenial manners ? All this must be resolved upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me unbroken . In every other land I am thy wife ,  --  Only not here . Hast thou considered this ? Hast thou bethought thee that thy childhood 's home , That home so loved , the birthplace of thy fathers , Must pass to foreign hands when thou art gone ? Thou hast a son , but hast henceforth no heir . Herbert turns away his eyes . Hast thou  --  No , thou hast not considered this . Thou didst but feel that all was light to love . I bless thee for thy generous thoughtlessness . Thou hast been true ; thou hast been self-forgetting . My trust in thee is safe . All other loss I can encounter with courageous heart . Herbert is about to interrupt her . She stops him by a gesture , and goes on in a low , but firm voice . Hear me , my Herbert ! Other is my duty Than thine : not to forget , but to remember , Belongs to me . Thou hast fulfilled thy part ; I will not fail in mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard thy happiness , Thy parents ' peace , from thy rash self-devotion . Before thou cam'st , I was prepared for this ; I had considered , had decided all . But when I knew thee near me , my heart faltered . When I beheld thee , when I heard thy voice , A momentary dream involved my soul ,  --  A dream sweet , deadly , like betraying visions That court the wayfarer on Alpine heights From the steep path , to fatal , soft repose . Thy truth , thy courage , give me back my own . Herbert , we part ! for this life 's term we part !  --  Hear me with calm !  --  Not ours the bitter parting Of souls disjoined ,  --  the parting without hope ; But , loving and respecting each the other , We take our separate paths to one same goal , The home of consolation and reunion . HERBERT . Herbert Part ?  --  and in this cold tone to talk of parting ? HELEN . Helen Not cold , but firm . My duty calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow . Lighter to me the pain of the decision Than to thee , Herbert . I must be the exile ; I must go forth orphaned of home and kindred . Hardly couldst thou have passed on me this sentence ; And yet it must be passed . I call it on me , Nor wait the second thought of thy cool judgment . HERBERT . Herbert I pass on thee the doom of separation That thy lips coldly thus pronounce on me ? Little thou know'st my heart ! My own sweet Helen ! Thou hast no common courage , and for thee I could brave much ,  --  brave all : my friends ' displeasure , The world 's reproach ,  --  I can submit to these , Let me but keep thee ; and I know thy love , Though calm and gentle , is profound and strong . Thou couldst bear much for me , and thy clear mind Looks down on vulgar prejudice . A name Is not a spell for thee , my noble Helen ! HELEN , Helen aside . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Herbert , controlling her emotion with difficulty . Two path lie open to us . A far land Might offer us the home our own denies ; But this demands a sacrifice too great For thee to give , too great for me to ask : We have considered , have rejected this . The other course remains : I with our child Will seek the foreign home . I have no fear But God will give me aid to guide him up To be a noble man . This for my life Is work enough , is happiness enough . HERBERT . Herbert For thine ? And what for mine ? Does no third course Offer , that reconciles my happiness With thine and his ? Canst thou not trust my love To make thy home secure and blest even here ? HELEN . Helen Herbert , be just ! Unwilling have I wronged thee . Common our grief , in common let us bear . Thou wouldst not leave me all ? No , thou wilt take Thy part . Forego my company on earth : Where'er I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thee through out eternity ,  --  To thee and to our child . No human love Other than these shall share my heart with God . HERBERT . Herbert Yes , Helen , thou art still in heart my wife . Why shouldst thou leave me ? Only human law Denies a name that before God is thine . Thou wilt be still my own ? Helen ! HELEN . Helen Thy own , Though seas and worlds divided , though the grave ! Only not thine , if thou thyself divorce . Our souls unsundered , vain are space and time To part us ; but these severed  --  With a sudden burst of entreaty . Oh , set not A passless gulf between thy soul and mine !  --  Herbert averts his eyes . Helen observes his countenance and turns away despondingly . Aside . Oh , weakness harder to be met than force ! He has not strength ! Did I not know it ? Shall I Demand of him what Nature has denied ? He has fine gifts , only not strength , not courage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer ? I will forgive . I will forgive and sue . HERBERT , Herbert seeing her softened expression . You are relenting to me ? HELEN . Helen Hear me , Herbert ! I have been called your wife , have borne the name Of mother to the child you thought your heir . Oh , by those ties that no deceit of mine Has bound you in , I pray you hear me now ! Give me my freedom ! give my child his freedom ! HERBERT . Herbert Freedom ? what freedom do you ask , my Helen ? Freedom to leave me ? freedom to take from me All that I have in life ? Oh , think of me ! Think what I suffer ! Think what I have lost In losing thee ! How have . I gazed on thee , Seeing thee do the honors of my house With such a majesty and winning grace Might suit an empress : pride and graciousness In thy high bearing so exactly mingled That all must love , yet with such reverent love As a saint wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure look of a benignant angel Might wake in hearts that felt themselves less pure ! How did I glory in the look of homage That Herbert 's wife won both from fop and sage ! How did I smile to see the ill-cloaked envy With which men wished me joy of my good-fortune ! " So beautiful ! so gifted ! such an heiress ! " Thus ran the word . And now to find myself  --  HELEN , Helen aside . O God ! O God ! upon what treacherous sands Has my hope built ! HERBERT , Herbert seeing her look of anguish . Oh , but forgive me , Helen ! I meant thee no unkindness . Thou art dearer , Far dearer now , in thy humility , Thy touching sadness , and thy downbent brow , Than in thy former majesty of mien . Then , when I looked upon thy noble beauty , Even I , thy husband , felt a secret awe That damped my love , that my man 's pride resented . Thy altered state hath equalled thee with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  Not as the wife whose proud alliance brought me , Beside herself , an ample dower of lands : It shall be mine to lavish gifts on thee . Oh , Helen , thus to own thee , thus to love thee , Thus claim thy love , this is the only thought That holds me from despair ! Oh , turn not from me ! Look not so pale , so stony ! Cruel Helen ! Is not thy Herbert 's anguish more than thine ? Thou art still rich in all that Nature made thee ; He poor indeed , if wholly robbed of thee !  --  Pause . No answer yet ? Still the same icy paleness ! What shall I say to move thee ? HELEN . Helen Say no more ,  --  Lest I go forth too desolate ! HERBERT . Herbert Go forth ? This thy last word ?  --  Such is the love of woman ! My happiness , my love , are nothing to her ! Her pride is all ! HELEN . Helen Had God demanded of me A life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed me to expiate The wrong done to the ruined Agatha By lifelong service , I had rendered her A sister 's tenderness , a servant 's duty , Nor felt myself degraded . But to thee I can not be a slave . Thou , my child 's father , Must be what thou hast been to me , or nothing . HERBERT , Herbert aside . What a stern look ! She never spoke to me In this high way . Instead of being humbler , From gentle and modest she is growing haughty . She lays me down the law as if  --  HELEN , Helen gravely . Events Have traced my course for me , nor left me choice . The highest duty God has laid on mortals Is that of parent . Her voice fails . Softly and imploringly . Thou hast shared with me Till now this office . We have watched together , Rejoiced together , trembled , hoped together : Dost thou renounce the sacred partnership ? She approaches the couch on which the child lies . Oh , canst thou give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps to guilt ? Not the rude storm that swept our home and scattered Our earthly vows has left him fatherless , If thou rend not the spiritual bonds . HERBERT . Herbert Thou fearest for the child ? He shall not suffer . He will not be a slave . At seven years old , Or sooner still , he shall be sent elsewhere , And brought up as thyself shalt indicate . And other children , if there should be more , Shall in like manner be provided for As shall befit thy merits and my love , Not their supposed condition . Lay aside These idle fears ! Let no false sense of duty Divide thee from thy home and from my love , Which shall but be more tender , more  --  He approaches her tenderly . HELEN . Helen Desist To urge a plea that is already judged . She takes up the sleeping child and folds him in her arms . Henceforth I am the guardian of this orphan , And know no other tie ! She goes towards the door . HERBERT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not God ! With Him I leave my cause . Goes . APPEAL . SCENE I. In front of the house at Belrespiro . Hermann enters . Just before reaching the steps , he stops . HERMANN . Hermann Ah , I 'm quite out of breath ! I 've come too fast !  --  I wonder no one thought of me before . I , her old tutor , I , her second father , What man so fit as I to be her guardian ? And ' t will be hard , if , in this growing country , Where every man wants more or less instruction , What I 've to offer does not find a market .  --  And I shall have a family to work for ! A daughter and a grandchild of my own ! How the thought thrills my heart ! My own ! my own !  --  He goes on ; when he reaches the steps , he pauses again . So here I am ! Now comes the fit of chill !  --  Herbert ,  --  I never liked him ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disdain my offer ?  --  Ah , cowardice has always been your bane ! You have good thoughts , but want the resolution To carry out . Come on , then , Hermann ! Courage ! Leave yourself no retreat ! Once entered there , You 've passed the Rubicon , and all must dare ! Goes hastily up the steps and enters the house . APPEAL . SCENE II . A room in the house at Belrespiro . Herbert alone . HERBERT . Herbert What can he want , this tiresome German pedant ? I will be bound he comes to speak of Helen ! He has no tact , the boor , no delicacy ! How dare he interlope in my affairs ? Why do I see him ? My absurd good-nature ! I might have sent him word  --  But here he is !  --  Enter Hermann . Good morning , Sir . I hear you 've business with me . Forgive me , if I ask you to be brief .

I know that you , with all our other friends , Feel for us in these family afflictions . But I am sure you will not be surprised That I prefer to bear my part of them In solitude and silence . Therefore , Doctor , Unless you have some special business with me  --  HERMANN , Hermann with resolution . Most special , Sir ! I had not else intruded . The lady who was daughter of this house , What dispositions will be made for her ? HERBERT . Herbert Sir , you forget to whom you speak ,  --  of whom . HERMANN , Hermann as before . No , I remember both . You had a claim Upon this lady , which is now extinct . She is left guardianless . To other hands Must pass the trust that you have just laid down . What hands more fit than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in embarrassment . I can deliver you . I will adopt her ,  --  Will take her with me to some Northern State . She shall assume my name ; shall be the wife Of some dead son of mine ; her child , my grandson . Thus she will pass from sight , from memory . You will be free to frame a new existence . For us , we shall be simply foreigners . No one will scan our former history , Or doubt that we are other than we seem . When time has softened her regrets to calm , My daughter will be happy . Her strong heart Will bear up bravely against this reverse . She is not one of those who sink and faint , But will take up the burden God appoints With a courageous will . More gently . And , credit me , The tenderest father could not be more watchful , More careful , more assiduous , more foreseeing , Than I will be for her . Accept my offer ! All will be reconciled : your peace of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERBERT , Herbert aside . Rose ever impudence to such a pitch ? Helen his daughter ! My own son his grandson !  --  What do I say ? O God , I have no son ! And Helen  --  I have not even now her love ! This vile old German has more claim than I ! He speaks the truth : she is more his than mine . HERMANN . Hermann Accept ! accept !  --  Aside . How shall I read his silence ? Is he ashamed to tell me he forsakes her ? HERBERT , Herbert aside . And even for this she never shall be his . HERMANN , Hermann aside . Or is it rage at my audacity ? Observing Herbert . How will it turn ? Ah , ill for you , my Helen ! HERBERT , Herbert aside . Happy ! he promise me she shall be happy ! Happy apart from me ! hate me and happy !  --  And there he stands , the meddlesome old pedant ! How shall I answer him ? how put him off ? HERMANN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! All will be over in two days . Your mind Will be at ease , your conscience satisfied .  --  Aside . I 'll press him close . Sudden resolves are easiest . HERBERT , Herbert aside . Hear him ! as if it were the simplest thing For me to part from this unequalled creature Who was till now the essence of my life ! How should he feel for me , the musty bookworm ?  --  Aloud . Have you so misinterpreted my silence ? Think not that I was pondering your advice ; I only sought how I might say politely That which , however said , may sound but harsh . I have no need of counsel or of aid ; I will myself be my own conscience-keeper ; I will myself guard my own ease of mind . Your well-meant offer I decline , and beg That my affairs may not detain you here . HERMANN . Hermann My own affairs detain me here . My pupil Is in this house . You were till now her husband . Had you retained your rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here my charge begins . The husband 's claim being null , the rights of friendship Resume their force . Two courses were before you : Or to resign your wife and send her from you , Never to meet with you again on earth , Or to be true to her and share her exile . It seems you could not make a sacrifice . HERBERT . Herbert Yes ,  --  every sacrifice but that of honor ! HERMANN . Hermann Honor ? How shall I understand you ? Honor ? HERBERT , Herbert impatient and embarrassed . I can not give the name of wife to one , However lovely and however pure , Whose birth is tainted . Exile I could bear , Loss of wealth even I could bear for her . Recovering his self-possession . But honor ,  --  duty ,  --  here I have no choice . Could I myself resolve to bear the weight Of a dishonored name , have I the right To inflict it on my children , or to bring My father 's head in sorrow to the grave ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But God or Destiny arranged it thus . I am not master of her fate or mine ; I do but take what 's sent me . If I bear And keep my reason , ' t is the most I can .  --  Good morning , Sir . HERMANN . Hermann I understand you now : You have not courage to be true to her , Nor generosity to give her up .  --  Aside . And yet he can not  --  HERBERT . Herbert Phrase it as you will . Doctor , I do not want to quarrel with you ; But , if we are to keep on friendly terms , This must end here . ' T has gone too far already . HERMANN . Hermann Sir , I have done . I have fulfilled my duty In seeking you . Now I shall go to those Who have the power , and I doubt not the will , To adjust this matter righteously and kindly .

I have already spoken ; But I will put it out of doubt .  --  Not mine ? Absurd ! impossible !  --  And others have Over her fate the right I have no more ? Even she herself had never thought of this . It was to me she pleaded , not to them .  --  They must not see her , though . Weak , both of them . They would give way before her strong appeal , If pity won them not before she spoke . They shall not hear her .  --  The old Doctor 's plans Will pass for what they are , a dotard 's ravings .

I have grave business , Miss . I ask your pardon . Attempts to pass . ALICE . Alice I have grave business . HERMANN . Hermann And with me ? ALICE . Alice With you . HERMANN . Hermann I were most flattered at another hour ; But now time presses . I may be too late . ALICE . Alice You are too late . HERMANN . Hermann For what ? ALICE . Alice For what you purpose . HERMANN . Hermann You can not know . Excuse me . Tries to pass . ALICE . Alice I do know . You wish to rescue Helen . But the way Is not the way you think of . I must show you . HERMANN . Hermann You ? ALICE . Alice You look doubtfully . You do not trust me . You must . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose in my face ? HERMANN , Hermann aside . Her air , Her look is altered . ALICE . Alice I am frivolous And vain and selfish . All you think of me I 'll tell you of myself . At least I am No hypocrite ,  --  if that be any merit , When openness is only self-content And carelessness of blame . I 'm frankly selfish . But when I love , I love . I do love Helen . HERMANN . Hermann It sounds like truth . ALICE . Alice It is truth . You must trust me . We must be friends ,  --  and more , must be allies . You seek her who was once our Helen 's mother . It is in vain . She has bestowed full powers On Richard Stanely . He will act for her And the poor girl that he must own his niece . HERMANN . Hermann And her whom he was proud to call so once ! He can not hate her ! ALICE . Alice He will show his kindness By giving her to Herbert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERMANN . Hermann What way is there  --  ALICE . Alice There is but one way ,  --  flight . HERMANN . Hermann A desperate method ! ALICE . Alice Not so desperate For who have friends and money . She has both . HERMANN . Hermann She has still friends left ? ALICE . Alice I foresaw all this From the beginning , and reserved myself . I have not been to Helen ,  --  have not asked After her fate ,  --  have shown no interest In any way . This seemed quite natural For one so careless and so cold as I am . But I have not been idle . I have written To one who 'll not be slothful in this cause . Do you your part ! The answer that I wait for Will be addressed to you .  --  Some accident Might throw my letters into Herbert 's hands .  --  When you receive it , come to me at once . It will trace out to us our course . HERMANN . Hermann And this My unknown correspondent is  --  ALICE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former tutor ? A good man , And worthy to be trusted . ALICE . Alice He is more : A generous , noble man . And in this case He will have zeal greater than even compassion Would wake in him ,  --  though that would be enough To lead him to face danger and reproach . HERMANN , Hermann aside . She can admire devotion . She is better Than I supposed . I think that I may trust her .  --  Aloud . There will be danger for this man ? ALICE . Alice Of course . There will be danger for us all . You shrink ? HERMANN . Hermann You wrong me . But I ask myself , Have we A right to involve a stranger in our troubles ? Would Helen herself permit it , did she know it ? ALICE . Alice No doubt , not . But she will not know it . We Must act for her , the prisoner and helpless . We must dare all ,  --  must give all . HERMANN . Hermann All our own ,  --  But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right to suffer for her . He  --  ALICE , Alice with emphasis . Has the same right as we . HERMANN , Hermannmusingly . And he loved Helen ? ALICE . Alice Loved her , and loves . Such hearts as his change not . HERMANN . Hermann Did Helen know it ? ALICE . Alice No !  --  I had my reasons For being clear-sighted.  --  No ! HERMANN . Hermann Can you intrust her  --  ALICE . Alice As to a brother . Not the selfish love Of common men is that he feels for her . He knows himself as much divided from her As ever , now . He loves without a hope , Without a wish that he may find return ,  --  Since that return even must unshrine his idol . He loves as  --  I love him . There , take my secret ! Now trust me ! I can risk for her what most I prize on earth ! HERMANN . Hermann I trusted you already . ALICE , Alice in her ordinary tone . That 's settled , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , when the letter comes , To act at once . I have the money here : That is the first thing . A disguise is ready : That is the second . You prepare yourself For a long journey . You may not be wanted ; But get all ready . Not too secretly . You 're not to go with her . She will be safer Without your escort . But it may be useful To lead the searchers off on a false scent . HERMANN . Hermann But how shall Helen , prisoner as she is , Learn what we plan for her ? ALICE . Alice I 've cared for that . I have my messengers , discreet and faithful . HERMANN . Hermann You think she will accept the part we give her ? ALICE . Alice At once . HERMANN . Hermann And yet it is a fearful thing For a young woman to go forth alone  --  ALICE , Alice bitterly . It is a fearful thing to be alone On this harsh earth ; and she must be alone , Where'er she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : alone but for her child , The unconscious sharer of her isolation . HERMANN . Hermann You will be left to her . ALICE . Alice Not even I. One short embrace and we have lost each other . HERMANN . Hermann Why should this be ? Are you not rich and free ? ALICE . Alice Free ? Is a woman ever so ? Yes , free To waste away her life in selfish folly ! But let her have a generous hope , an aim Beyond the multitude , her prison-walls Close round her pitiless . The captured bird , Springing from crushingly caressing hands , Seeks the blue height through the deceitful pane ;  --  He is our emblem ;  --  ruthless beats him back The cold , transparent , adamantine wall . HERMANN . Hermann None are quite free but one alone as I am . ALICE . Alice I am an orphan . None have rights o'er me . Were I a man now , one year more would give me The power to follow her , the power to aid : Nay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an ample fortune . My own money Is not my own , and will not be , or only To endow a husband ,  --  never to enjoy it . For trifling alms , for trinkets , silks , and laces , I can have money ; but for some good object That I could put my soul in , never , never ! Only by false pretences , yes , by lying , I 've gained the means of rescuing my friend ; And so on , to the end . Think you my husband , The husband they will choose for me , will let me Own my best friend in a poor wandering outcast ? You only , dear old man , are left to her . And you are poor . Your poverty divides you From her , as me my riches . Yet through you I may , perhaps , find means to send her aid . Heaven grants me this resource . HERMANN . Hermann No , not through me , If gained by art , a woman 's means ! ALICE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with , senseless To reason , to compassion , and to right ! Bid me appeal to justice , to compassion ; Let me address the reason ; and what then ? I 've put them on their guard , and lost the power To serve my friend . She starves upon my candor Who might have lived upon a generous falsehood . A woman 's means indeed ! A human means , Opposed to brutal ! Is it in our choice ? Think you I choose it ? I am frank and bold , Yet can wind , if I must . But what sane man Is bold where boldness would be desperation ? Does the most brave , most proud , disdain to cheat His overpowerful enemy , the lion ? No ; where superiority of strength Is on one side , that of intelligence Upon the other , each will use his weapon . HERMANN . Hermann Most dangerous sophistry ! ALICE . Alice Well , read your lessons To generals of armies and to hunters ! Or keep them for our lawyers and our statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do but speak out what the others practise .  --  But to our business . This can wait . You will not Aid by a ruse the chance of her escape ? HERMANN . Hermann I do not say that . I see no objection . A ruse-de-guerre , a lawful stratagem . Yes , I will undertake it , if it 's found Expedient , when the moment comes . I am At war now with this Herbert . ALICE . Alice For this time , Then , we can work together . In the future , If you continue in a state of warfare , You will , perhaps , find it in rule to have A correspondent in the hostile camp ? HERMANN . Hermann I see your drift ; but there 's a difference . ALICE . Alice Great ! You 're a man , and I 'm a woman : all 's said You are a law unto yourself , and I Must live by other people 's consciences . HERMANN . Hermann But what is this that you are saying now About continuing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends ? Did you not even now confide to me A choice already made , and by yourself ? ALICE . Alice My heart and my imagination chose An object for their worship . Still and hidden The little shrine will stand within my heart , A sanctuary for my hunted soul When strifes and follies leave no other rest . I do not think to make this fane a kitchen , And use the holy fire to boil and bake . HERMANN . Hermann To use the holy fire to warm and cheer A human heart is not a desecration . What after God is most divine is man . That faculty which is the evidence Of things unseen has not been given us For solitary , seldom flights to heaven , But to inform and elevate our lives . Be truer to yourself . Guard not a shrine For secret worship . So dispose your life That what is purest , noblest in your heart May rise to heaven from the household altar . ALICE . Alice Almost you move me . But I know myself Too well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thank you warmly . But I am of this earth . These rare ascensions That you condemn are all the intercourse I hold with higher spheres . Permit me these , Nor let me grovel wholly . For the rest , He whom I chose has chosen for his ideal , The shrouded idol of his inmost heart , Another object . Were it otherwise , I hardly would expose his love and mine To the rude wear and tear of daily life . I know I am no worthy wife for him . I 'm capable of sudden acts of virtue ; But of consistent , patient goodness , no . HERMANN . Hermann You wrong yourself , and you will wrong another , If , having this affection in your heart , You falsely promise love and faith elsewhere . ALICE . Alice I am no hypocrite . The man I marry Will live in no illusions more than I. Plain common sense will regulate our contract . Our fortunes are harmonious . That 's enough To satisfy my friends and him . For me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HERMANN . Hermann Why marry , though ? ALICE . Alice Because what little share Of independence ever is a woman 's Is gained by marriage . I must wait ten years To have the smallest share of freedom single . Do n't talk of me : I do not merit it : Only through Helen can I interest you . HERMANN . Hermann No ,  --  for yourself now . Hold me for your friend . And grant me a friend 's right to counsel you . Do nothing rashly . You are young enough To take your time . ALICE . Alice At least there is no danger The present moment . I am full of Helen , And have no room for me.  --  Each to our part ! HERMANN . Hermann Farewell , my new-found pupil ! ALICE . Alice Farewell , friend ! Friend of an hour , but for a life , I hope ! Whatever I am , whatever I do , my friend ? You must be pledged to this , if pledged to me . I am too wild , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends ,  --  too constant To risk the pain of losing an affection Once mine . Then those who love must love me only Because they will , and because I will have them . And now are we two friends ? HERMANN . Hermann On any terms . The faults of youth are all too pardonable In the eyes of age ; its confidence too charming ; The right to offer even neglected counsel Too dear . He extends his hand ; she gives hers . Your friend , poor orphan girl , through all ! They part , and go out in different directions . APPEAL . SCENE IV . Room , of which the windows open on a long portico shaded with vines . Emma seated on a sofa ; near her Agatha ( formerly Perdita ) stands in a timid attitude . EMMA . Emma Come sit by me , my pretty Agatha , My little sister ,  --  no , I mean my daughter . At last I have a daughter ! Oh , my child , Why did I never see how sweet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Agatha seats herself on a footstool close to Emma . How were you hidden by that ugly dress ! Could a dress hide a daughter from her mother ? But here at last ! Embracing her . What pretty , silk-soft hair ! How like to hers ! You have her eyes exactly , Only more soft ,  --  perhaps not quite so bright . How should they be ? Oh , my poor injured child ! Hers would have dimmed in such a life as yours . AGATHA . Agatha Whose , mistress ? EMMA , Emma checking her . Mother ! AGATHA , Agatha timidly . Oh , I dare not ,  --  mother ! I have a mother ! Oh , how great is God ! I prayed to Him that day that Dorcas told me The hour would come . I prayed , " Oh , let it hasten ! " And that same night  --  oh , cruel night and dear !  --  Whom am I like ? Whose eyes have I ? Whose hair ? EMMA . Emma Hers ,  --  my sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agatha And I am Agatha . There is another ? EMMA . Emma Not now , my treasure ,  --  but there was another . It is for her dear sake you bear that name . And I can talk to you of her , my child ! You can not tell what grief it is to hold Your fondest thoughts imprisoned in your heart And never give them voice . AGATHA . Agatha And you have known it ? I thought this grief was but for such as I. EMMA . Emma My innocent child ! Your heart has pined like mine For a fond heart wherein to pour itself . Now we shall be the world to one another ! You shall tell all your griefs : I will not tire Of pitying you , nor you of asking pity . And you will like to listen , when I talk Of my young days and of my Agatha ? AGATHA . Agatha I like to listen to your tender voice . EMMA . Emma You have had all the sorrows of your life In your first years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me now  --  in mine . I will divide my early joys with you , And you shall halve with me your happy future . So , I from memory , and you from hope , Will weave a life without a cloud or shadow . AGATHA . Agatha Oh , rather tell me of your sorrows , mother ! Too blinding bright were such a life for me To pass to from my darkness . Griefs like yours , Tender and pure , will be to me like joys . Oh , speak them ! let me soothe them ! EMMA . Emma They are soothed . Since I have held the living Agatha , The memory of the dead one has grown fainter . AGATHA . Agatha I would not wrong the dead . Love her and me ! Your heart , like mine , can have one love on earth And one in heaven ? For she must be in heaven , Your other Agatha ? EMMA . Emma She is in heaven , With her dear mother . AGATHA , Agatha drawing close to Emma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will love my child ? will take it to them ? EMMA , Emma shrinking . Your child ? Oh , Agatha , speak not of that ! AGATHA . Agatha I must not speak of it ?  --  not even to you ? EMMA , with anguish , pressing Agatha 's head to her bosom , and folding her arms over it , as if to conceal it . Oh , my poor ruined child ! where shall I hide you ? A happy life for me ? Oh , cruel dream !  --  My child , we have a home ! we have a refuge ! They call it here the South . But , oh , dear daughter , There is a South , and I will bear you thither ! AGATHA , Agatha alarmed . Whither ? EMMA . Emma Oh , far from here ,  --  to happy Cuba ! AGATHA , Agatha to herself .

Agatha The curse was not for me ! EMMA , Emma anxiously What curse ? AGATHA . Agatha The curse she spoke , thinking me Hecate 's child ,  --  The child of her who once had wronged her daughter . And yet it all comes true . EMMA . Emma Comes true ? AGATHA . Agatha She said I should go forth an exile , like her daughter ; My child should sleep uncared for , like her daughter 's . EMMA . Emma She has no daughter ,  --  never had a daughter . What know I of her daughter ? daughter 's child ? Exile ? and is it exile , then , to pass From lone bereavement to a mother 's love ? Exile , to leave this poor monotonous country For that rich land ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its clustering flowers , Whose brilliant hues thank the joy-giving sun That blessed them into life : when you have known  --  AGATHA . Agatha Oh , mother , let me stay ! That joyful sunshine Warms not his grave , those bright flowers deck it not ; That soft air never murmured with his tones ; That sky was never mirrored in his eyes ! If I were dead , and you were left alone , Would you not better love the earth that held me , Though it were drear and rude , than summer lands That had no voice to speak to you of me ? And yet , oh , mother ! yet I am not lovely . The grave I fill will not be holy ground . But he  --  he was so dear and beautiful ! He went from me in his first innocence ! Oh , let me stay !

Forgive !  --  And will she go with us , your other daughter ? EMMA . Emma My other daughter ? AGATHA . Agatha She who was your daughter . EMMA . Emma She goes not with us . AGATHA . Agatha Nor her child ? EMMA . Emma Nor he . AGATHA . Agatha But is she not  --  but is she not my sister ? EMMA . Emma Your sister ? No ! Oh , do not break my heart ! AGATHA .

Speak of her no more ! AGATHA , Agatha imploringly . Oh , mother dear , till you were given back , The only one that ever showed me kindness ! EMMA . Emma Oh , call not up that sweet , deceitful image ! How was I mocked , how was I doubly mocked , When in my arms I held that living lie ! Oh , let the past pass from me utterly ! AGATHA . Agatha Only one little word ! Where is she now ? EMMA . Emma Her fate is in the hands of one who loves her . Her husband  --  he who was her husband  --  asked Me to renounce my claims . I gladly yielded . I would not have her future weigh on me . Let her be happy , and let me forget her ! AGATHA . Agatha You had a sister once .

Your love ! the love I hardly dare look up to , It is so high above and I so humble ! Oh , mother , do not hurt me with such words ! You speak in sport ? Oh , do not jest with me ! I am too dull to comprehend a jest ,  --  Too slow to answer fittingly . Speak plain . And chide me openly , if you would chide , Lest I but feel the pain and miss the meaning . EMMA . Emma I can not chide ,  --  I am too weak to chide . And even for that , my child , you must not wound me . Your mother is too feeble for resentment . You must deal tenderly with her . AGATHA . Agatha Forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will speak , Be silent , as you will ; will love but you ; Will let no other love me . But this once , Oh , let me speak one word that might displease you ! EMMA . Emma That might displease me ? Do not speak it ! AGATHA . Agatha Mother ! That name of mother is so dear and sacred , That it has power , even when falsely borne , To cast a spell on me I can not break . Tell me of her who has been called my mother . EMMA . Emma Oh , ask me not to speak that dreadful name ! AGATHA . Agatha But tell me where she is ? She does not suffer ? EMMA . Emma Suffer ! How should she not , if God is Just ? AGATHA . Agatha And you will leave her to His justice ? Man 's Revenge shall not pursue her ? EMMA . Emma Have I room For thought of her ?

If crimes like hers Admit of pardon  --  AGATHA . Agatha It was for her daughter ! EMMA . Emma I have forgiven the dead . I will forgive her . AGATHA . Agatha You will protect her from the wrath of others ? EMMA . Emma I will take order , that , when I am gone , No harm shall reach her . AGATHA , Agatha rising and taking her mother 's hand .

Hecate , wrapt in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if in the act of listening . HECATE . Hecate I dare not follow ! My ill-boding step Would guide misfortune to her track !  --  I dare not ! She is already far . Could my strong arm Uphold her tender frame ! Could my firm voice Speak courage , when the loneliness and darkness Press on her soul ! Why am I not with her ? There is no other place for me on earth ! Alone ! alone ! her hesitating step Shrinks before fancied dangers , seeks the real ! Were I but there ! How quick my sharpened eye To seize the tokens on our winding route ! How prompt my ear to catch the sound of danger ! Oh , stay thy step ! ' T is not a harmless branch Thy heedless foot would press ! Oh , were I there thy foes ' ally : it cheats to sleep That will deliver thee to death or them ! Hast thou forgot the landmarks ? Yonder , see ! Is the black stump whose sole remaining arm Points downward to the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bog ! Further , the treacherous flood ! how flat and still It stretches out its tideless , waveless sea ! The giant growth that lifts from those dead waters Its black luxuriance shrouds with moveless shade Their slimy depths , accomplice of their guile ! About the margin of that stagnant ocean Are set decoying vines , whose lusty stems And wiry tendrils , hid in rank-grown leaves , Far o'er the surface spread a tremulous bridge . Her ignorant foot essays it ! Hold thee back ! Oh , the next step is death ! Fly ! fly ! heed not Whether thy pathway lie through fen or flood ! Fly , fly , poor loiterer ! Hear'st thou not the tread , Stealthy and swift , that follows on thy track ? It gains upon thee ! Fly ! the clutching hands Are stretched to seize ! almost they touch thee now ! Lost ! lost ! She covers her face with her hands and shrinks down . Then , withdrawing her hands and rising slowly . For all these years I have not prayed ! Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more triumphant in my fraud ! May I not now ask Heaven 's blessing on her , On her the friendless , shelterless ? The wretched , Are they not Heaven 's charge ?  --  Oh , by that title Even I might lift these miserable hands And call for mercy !  --  Not for me ! Too late ! But , if I did not fear to bring down wrath Instead of promise , from these guilty lips Should rise a prayer for her the innocent . Oh , child , thou pay'st the forfeit of my crime !  --  Was it a crime ? Oh , who could look on her And say that there she stood not in her place ? It was her right ! I will not ask for pardon ! Oh , in a heart that was not framed for guilt How cruel are these struggles ! Wrong endured And wrong committed claiming to be heard , And each asserting mastery in its turn ! Oh , I am helpless ! If I look not there , What succor anywhere ? Raising her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She is not mine ! This desecrated heart Resigns a mother 's claim ! Dissolve the ties That bind Thy seraph to a fallen spirit ! Her part is with Thy own ! It needs a victim To expiate the heaped-up wrong ? Behold one ! O God , I offer up my soul to torture ! Count nothing all my ruined years ! count nothing This mortal heartbreak ! For each hour of life , Of happy life , that Thou accord'st to her , Give me a century of fiery pain ! FLIGHT . SCENE II . Morning twilight . A cleared space in the forest . Paths opening from it on the right and left . Theresa enters from the right . She looks anxiously about her . THERESA . Theresa He is not here . Oh , let not morning find me Ere I find him ! He said , " Before the sun . "  --  Night draws around her , as she glides away , Her wide gray mantle , leaving me all bare .  --  Fail me not , thou !

Oh , art thou there to tell my heart how vain Is loving aid when Heaven 's bolt hath stricken ?  --  She listens . A step ! but not the sturdy one I wait for . She conceals herself behind some trees . Enter Melas , carrying a basket in his hand . MELAS . Melas She is not far . The way of fugitives Is her way now . The world they leave is bitter , But is their own . With many a backward turning And many a pause , she seeks the foreign safety . Strange ground is slow to tread , strange air breathes hard . Thy will is feeble now as ours , poor lady ! Thou art more ignorant than one of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It loves me . It faints for want of food ! I hear a rustling ! Does she lurk near ? Does her ear strain to catch A friendly sound ? Listens . Again ! Push forward , Melas ! If you can aid , it must be ere the light , That now is stealing onward like a spy , Bursts on us with the broad , triumphant glare Of the denouncer . He discovers Theresa . What ! you here , Theresa ? THERESA , Theresa in an agitated manner . Go home , good Melas ! it is time ; you 're wanted . MELAS . Melas No , it is early . It is here so fresh ! And nothing 's regular . I 'd not be missed , If I should stay too long . But I shall not . THERESA , Theresa aside . What brings him here ? It is the hour already ! He is no spy . What if I have to trust him ?  --  Alound . Oh , Melas , go ! You have no purpose here . MELAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freest place ; Why not come here to spend it ? THERESA , Theresa impatiently . Melas , go ! MELAS , Melas aside . She has a purpose , and she hardly hides it . What if her purpose were akin to mine ? She is not wicked ; she is only mad . If I should try her ? Yes , I will .  --  Theresa ! Theresa listens with an alarmed expression . This forest stretches far . You know its haunts Hold dens and nests for things that creep and fly . This is the hour when man is least abroad And all that shuns his presence wakes and stirs . See by that trunk the peeping reptile-head ! And that shy bird ! I watch for such rare game . THERESA . Theresa You would not be more savage than the wild , More black than night , to rob of this drear safety What has no portion in free air and sunlight ? MELAS , Melas aside . She has grown human from the stone she was !  --  Aloud . Listen , Theresa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to man . If such come forth in search of food or comfort , They meet no traitor eye ? THERESA , Theresa smiling mournfully . In meeting mine ? MELAS . Melas Theresa , will you sing a hymn of signal ? THERESA . Theresa Take voice , O Music , that this dreaming heart Has toned so long in silence : soundless signal Feigned for a senseless ear ! To reach the living Take voice , no longer listless of an answer ! THERESA , Theresa sings . A shelter , men , a shelter ! Oh , give him where to hide ! Give him what to the foxes , the birds , is not denied ! MELAS , Melas sings . Give him where to lay his head , the unprotected ! THERESA . Theresa O Christ ! O King of Glory ! thus homeless didst Thou go ! Thou wast not too high for sorrow , as we are not too low ! MELAS . Melas Earth had no heritage for Heaven 's Elected ! THERESA . Theresa But Thou wast born of woman ! Didst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing of Thy mother 's feeble heart ? MELAS . Melas When haters hunted , and when trusted ones rejected ! THERESA . Theresa Oh , look on those who follow the path that once was Thine , Their earthly hearts imploring as then did the divine ! MELAS . Melas Cast out , pursued , as Thou wast , but , oh , more faint , more lonely ! THERESA . Theresa Thou , faithful and reproachless , couldst seek the Father 's face ! We , full of sin and doubting , have no refuge but Thy grace ! MELAS . Melas We claim Thee , O Redeemer , by our bonds and sorrows only ! They stop suddenly , and look round in an attitude of listening . THERESA . Theresa Listen ! MELAS , Melas looking into the wood . Who comes ? No trembling fugitive ! THERESA . Theresa Melas , it is that fearful woman , Dorcas ! MELAS . Melas She comes in rage ; hear how the branches crack ! THERESA . Theresa If she have heard us ! If she have divined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapping boughs And her own muttered curses . Hide yourself , If you have reason . Off , behind these trees ! I have no cause to fear , nor she to hurt me THERESA , Theresa going , turns back . But , as you go , lift up a song of warning ; Lest the friends ' call should prove the foes ' decoy . MELAS , Melas sings . The hunt goes out at morning ! On the merry meeting-ground Be ready bright and early , let none be lagging found ! We will stir up all that the silent forest covers ! My work is in the furrow that the sober plough has broke ; No beasts will I follow but those patient of the yoke . I will leave at rest all that the peaceful forest covers . You will not hunt the hidden ? Are you brother to the bear ? Of the cubs are you tender in the old fox 's lair ? For are not these all that the dusky forest covers ? Whatever takes man 's bounty may fall beneath his blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tameless go . And may God care for all that the sheltering forest covers ! Melas disappears by one of the side-paths through the wood . Dorcas issues from the wood near the place where Melas and Theresa separated . She comes forward , and raises her clenced hands above her head . DORCAS . Dorcas Gone , passed from me , and I not dead , my vengeance ! She baffled even me !  --  O Father Satan ! Thou giv'st us only so much knowledge as We need to serve thee , and keep'st back the rest To mock us with when we have done thy work ! But I will not be mocked ! I have been mocked ! For twenty years I 've lived upon a dream ! Have I not thought I held her in my power , The offspring of my enemy ? I trod her Under my feet ; made her a slave of slaves . She spied my mood , she shrank before my frown , Soothed me with false caresses , taught her form The servile cringe , her tongue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered myself Upon her misery , upon her debasement , There was she throning it ! Oh , twenty years ! For twenty years to have been fooled with thus ! It is a new account !  --  But patience ! patience ! This poor old brain is not used up . And Fate , And the Black Powers , and even Heaven itself Are here upon my side : the fiends of vengeance The messengers of justice , armed for me ! They tracked her out , the silent , sleepless ones ! She was struck down ! But she must fall still lower ! She wanders outcast , but she wanders free ; The brand of bondage has not reached her soul . But I am here ! O you who work with me , Give to my hand the instrument it craves ! Ezekiel enters by a path on the right . Dorcas perceives him , and stands awaiting his approach . When he comes near , she extends her arm , as if to arrest him . DORCAS . Dorcas You have been sent ! EZEKIEL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errand . DORCAS . Dorcas Your errand is to me ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Pass on , poor woman ! I can do nothing for you . DORCAS . Dorcas I ask nothing . I have to give . I do not beg of others . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Now I bethink me , are you not the woman Who came here with that fallen lady 's mother ? DORCAS . Dorcas I came with Hecate hither . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel The same thought Is now , perhaps , in both our hearts . DORCAS . Dorcas Perhaps . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel She has escaped ,  --  I know it . She has trusted Her secret to her mother 's friend ,  --  to you . You may confide in me . I will not fail you . Not for the first time shall I track the forest , Seeking the lair of the spent fugitive . I know each bower , each cave , each grassy ridge , Each turfy islet in the sea of swamp . DORCAS , Dorcas eagerly . You know them all ?  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scent of dogs ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel I would so . Fear not . Trust me . Without guide The fugitive will find the pathless forest An enemy as pitiless as man . Time has been lost already . Look at me ! Am I of those that traffic their own blood ? DORCAS . Dorcas What blood is she of yours ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel What ! is she not Of our own people ? DORCAS . Dorcas Do you see it on her ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Not on her face . But in her gentle heart , Even while she shared the fortune of the haughty , Her kindred with the humble was confessed . We know it now ; we know that inborn pity For all that suffers ,  --  no miraculous gift , As once it seemed . She drew it with the blood That flowed to hers from an afflicted heart . She is of us ; high-nurtured as she is , She is of us ; we must be prompt to succor . DORCAS . Dorcas And if she were not ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What if their faugs Are sharpened now for a related breast ? Would you mislead them ? Would you call them off ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel I would snatch any victim from the power Of the unjust . This is not now the question . We know that she is one of us . As such Is she now orphan , homeless , friendless . Hasten ! Give me the clue ! Before to-morrow 's dawn I will have led her to a place of safety . DORCAS . Dorcas You ? you , Ezekiel ? She is in the forest , As you suppose . I know it not from her ; Enough I know it . You shall track her out , As you have promised . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Went she out alone ? DORCAS . Dorcas Alone or worse : incumbered with her child . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel She entered on which side ? DORCAS . Dorcas I can not tell you . EZEKIEL , Ezekiel going . I will soon know . DORCAS , Dorcas retaining him . Not yet ! Ezekiel stay ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EZEKIEL , Ezekiel with strong emotion . Who calls me by that name ? DORCAS . Dorcas One who has known you other than you are ,  --  Not in name only . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel You have known me ? DORCAS . Dorcas Yes . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel And in that time  --  DORCAS . Dorcas When she you loved yet lived . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Lived , and for me ! And now she lives , but only Not now for me !  --  And you have known her , Dorcas ? DORCAS , her face losing its expression of bitter defiance ; her shrill tone changed to one deep and solemn . Yes . She is dead ; and thou shalt see her grave . Hast thou the courage ? Speak ! EZEKIEL , Ezekiel with anguish . Her grave is far . Oh , mock me not ! I shall not look on it . DORCAS . Dorcas Thou shalt and soon , hast thou indeed the courage . What grave hast thou imagined for the gay one ? A laughing grave , that the kind Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever-varying tribute Of brilliant cluster , tender-twining wreath ? A peaceful grave , where the descending sunbeams , The waving leaf , the softly bending grass , In the deep quietness alone are restless ? Hast thou imagined for the one thou lov'dst A grave like this ? By such a resting-place The heart might lay its griefs down , its regrets , Its vengeance even . Not to such a grave Shall I bring thee , Fernando ! Art thou firm To follow where I lead thee ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel If to her . DORCAS . Dorcas Hear , then !  --  But first , art thou indeed Fernando ? Art thou that wronged Fernando , he who once In helplessness appealed from man to Heaven ,  --  Who , kneeling in the presence of the sun , Gave God in charge to execute his vengeance ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel I was that impious man . DORCAS . Dorcas Not thus He judged , The Being thy despair invoked . The vengeance Thou askedst at His hand His hand has wrought : The winds and waves have ministered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they , Have , even as they , been made thy instruments ; The traitor 's greed has worked thy will , not his ; All that the heaven commands of most resistless , All that the earth contains most unsubjected , Has bent itself to carry out thy curse ! And when at last its force seemed spent , when one Of its doomed victims baffled for a time The slackened chase , ah , see , it steals on her , Makes of her nearest , of herself , its tool , The child and mother giving mutual ruin ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel What wouldst thou tell me , woman ? DORCAS . Dorcas Thou perceiv'st not ? Hear it again ! This woman thou wouldst save Is thy own victim . Thou hast cast her down From her high place . For thee she bears the brand Of slave , of outcast . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Wretched man ! for me ?  --  The truth is in thy words . I feel it , though Their perfect sense escapes me . By what tie Is her fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate . When on that day , her last of happiness , Some strange attraction lured thee to her presence , Thee , who shunn'st happiness , who shunn'st the happy , And thou stood'st face to face with her a moment , Did then the glance of those joy-lighted eyes Bring from the past no eyes as dark , as bright , Though wrath , not pleasure , kindled them for thee ? In the clear ring of that imperial voice Did no dead tones revive upon thy ear ?  --  She looks at him fixedly , for a few moments . Blinded as I was ! With my eyes I saw , With my ears heard , with my mind 's senses not .  --  Blind as thou wast , unconscious as thou wast , That moment was her fate . Fernando 's shadow Passed then between her and the sun ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel My presence Is , then , so blighting ? DORCAS . Dorcas To the race of him Who was thy blight . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel And she is of his race ? DORCAS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ezekiel starting . Of hers ? DORCAS . Dorcas Wouldst thou , then , hate her ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel I would rescue her . DORCAS . Dorcas No , no ! The cherished , the triumphant wife Was mother to that miserable Hecate Who baffled me ,  --  but did not baffle Fate ! EZEKIEL , Ezekiel with amazement . How here , and thus ? DORCAS . Dorcas Fernando , through thy curse ! The thunderbolt of heaven reached thy foe Upon the sea . The vessel wrecked for him Bore on its shattered fragments to the shore A wretched few : among these few a widow , Two little children , and their faithful nurse : With these a man whom thou hast known : the agent , For evil and for good , of him who perished , Until Fate made him thine ,  --  thine and Pamela 's . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Oh , spare that name ! DORCAS . Dorcas Thou must endure to hear it . Through Fate he was thy agent and Pamela 's . Hast thou yet comprehended me ? EZEKIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking up . Oh , life and strength but to undo this work ! Pamela ! let me swear it by thy grave , If thou hadst part in this most hideous treason , I will atone it ! Thy repentant spirit Shall see the evil that it wrought made good , And pass to peace !  --  To Dorcas Lead me , as thou hast promised , Unto her grave . DORCAS , Dorcas standing erect and throwing out her arms . Behold , thou stand'st before it ! What sepulchre a crumbling human ruin May furnish to a dead and damnd soul , That sepulchre is Dorcas to Pamela ! She stands silent a moment , while he gazes in horror . Here offer up thy vows ! here brteathe forgiveness ! Here receive peace and give it ! Ezekiel , recovering from his stupor , attempts to turn away . Turn not hence ! Thou wouldst refuse belief that yet thou giv'st ! Ezekiel remains with his eyes fixed on her , as if unable to withdraw them . Gaze on ! My look has fascination yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but horror . Look in these eyes , whose baleful gleam recalls The ghastly glitter flicering round decay ! These are the eyes that danced with joy and love Once at thy step . Behold these grisly fingers , That seem the talons of a bird of prey ! These are the fairy hands that hid themselves In thy broad grasp . Gaze ! gaze ! this face , this all , This was Pamela ! this was thy Pamela ! EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Oh , only not that name ! He stands as if struggling with himself , then lifting his eyes and hands to heaven . Thou wilt take from me All , even to memory ! Clasping his hands in anguish . Last and sharpest trial , Shall I sustain thee ? DORCAS . Dorcas Would I were more hideous , More loathsome still , if more were possible , That I might shriek to thee more maddening ,  --  " This is what he has left thee of Pamela ! " EZEKIEL , Ezekiel solemnly , looking upward . Send me the strength , O God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low voice , frequently interrupted . O thou in whom I would not see the lost , Yet must ! O thou , that , robbed from me , took'st with thee My youth , my sunlight ,  --  rendered to me , bring'st A second ruin deeper than the first ! Oh , in what language shall I speak to thee ? Compassionately . How can I blame thee that thy slender bark Was wrecked , when even this strong hulk was shattered ? Dorcas ! Pamela ! We have suffered , both ; Both we have sinned . Let us redeem together What yet is to redeem . DORCAS . Dorcas I have not sinned : I have done justice . But revile me , wreak On me the vengeance that thou lack'st the heart To visit on its proper heirs ! ' T is well I waited not for thee ! ' T is well this hand , This brain , sufficed to my revenge without thee ! What is there to redeem ? Canst thou redeem Thy youth and mine ,  --  thy innocent love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , withered on this earth , May yet retake its bloom beyond the stars  --  DORCAS . Dorcas Well didst thou say ,  --  " Not even memory ! " He did not wrong thee half : thy foe took from thee What not eternity can give thee back . I will not lie to thee . Pamela 's life Broke not like thine with breaking of those ties .  --  That lordly look ! that voice whose lightest tones Had more command in them than others ' threats ! Oh , he was born that I should call him master ! I loved him . I forgot you .  --  Then she came . I fell from queen to nothing .  --  Not enough ! The memory of my day must pass with me . My thought must die . No shadow from my night Must cross her sunshine . And they tore from me All that was left to me of mine and his . They tore from me my child ! They left me there To live unloved , and live without my child ! EZEKIEL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorcas The act was his ; The guilt was hers . I never hated him For it , but her .  --  Canst thou redeem me this ? Canst thou redeem me this ? Canst thou give back The childhood of my daughter ,  --  those sweet years Of her young life of which my life was robbed ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Oh , thou most wronged , most suffering ! believe not Reproach of mine shall add its bitterness To thy full cup ! For me , the last is borne . Heaven has left for me no greater trial . It will soon call me home . The little space I have to work in would I give to thee . Oh , might I but atone for thee , with thee ! DORCAS . Dorcas Thou speak'st to stone ! Art thou divine , almighty ? Canst thou create a heart in this void breast ? Work thy first miracle ! the rest were light . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel Let it suffice that he who wronged thee fell By Heaven 's judgment . Let the innocent  --  DORCAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didst thou word thy curse . EZEKIEL . Ezekiel 390 I will revoke it ! I will make amends ! DORCAS . Dorcas Thou hast no power . Then , when thou mad'st appeal To the Avenger , when thou laid'st thy cause In His untrembling hands , thou left'st no room For the relentings of a faltering mortal . EZEKIEL , Ezekiel going . Thou wilt not aid me ? Then , if not with thee , Without thee , it must be .  --  And yet  --  once more  --  DORCAS . Dorcas Go , work thy fate out , miserable man ! Leave me to mine ! But think not , thou that thrust'st Thy daring hand in the eternal scales , That thou shalt make them swerve . The doomed is doomed . Thou canst but scatter round thee wider ruin , And add new victims to those marked already . He goes ; she follows him with her voice . Thou that wouldst be more just than God , beware !  --  Dorcas follows the retreating figure of Ezekiel with her eyes , and sees him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the trees . His errand was to her ! They plot together . But I will circumvent them !  --  She sees Boaz , who enters from the path on the right . Boaz , you ! The famous preacher has just passed along ,  --  Ezekiel : you know him ? BOAZ . Boaz Famous preacher ! DORCAS . Dorcas They call him so . He 's strong , but wants the doctrine . Not so ? BOAZ . Boaz You have more wit than many wiser . DORCAS . Dorcas Ah , I can make distinctions . But what brings him Here , think you , now ? BOAZ . Boaz No good . DORCAS . Dorcas Why , that is certain . But what ? It were worth something now to bring That knowledge to its market . Ah , I know Your talents , Boaz . The persuading tongue Is not the sole or first . The hearing ear Has done good service to yourself and others . BOAZ . Boaz You know ? DORCAS . Dorcas There is not much I do not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such occasion shown itself to you For winning praise and gain . You know that woman Who lorded it so long here ,  --  Hecate 's daughter ? One of ourselves ;  --  and she must rule it here ! And she must play the gracious ! grant us favors , Send us good things , inquire about our ailments ! So condescending ! Oh , the insolent minx ! I could go mad , were I not mad already ! BOAZ . Boaz What would you have ? Is she not down ? Her pride Has proved the pride that goes before destruction . DORCAS . Dorcas Her like are never half-destroyed ; scotched , trampled , They struggle out again to life and luck . BOAZ . Boaz I do not hate her . She has never harmed me . DORCAS . Dorcas Nor ever helped you . In her power and riches What did she do for you ? Her misery Can profit you far more than her abundance . BOAZ . Boaz Can profit me ? DORCAS . Dorcas If you yourself but will . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORCAS . Dorcas Certain ! Is that a thing to be allowed , Think you ? And what reward will be for him Who brings the audacious one to penitence ? BOAZ . Boaz What reward , then ? Suppose . DORCAS . Dorcas The very least Will be to pass his lifetime without work . And then the presents and the privileges ! BOAZ . Boaz How should one willing have a chance at these ? DORCAS . Dorcas He shall track out this plot . He shall discover The path she took at first ; he shall betray Her resting-places , her disguises . BOAZ . Boaz How Shall I betray where I have not been trusted ? DORCAS . Dorcas This was not done without accomplices . BOAZ . Boaz All who surrounded her would die for her . DORCAS , Dorcas with meaning . All ? Are there none who have another duty , Another love , than to their fallen mistress ? BOAZ , Boaz aside . She knows even that ! She knows that Chloe  --  DORCAS . Dorcas Go ! Go to your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your trade . You 're no beginner at it . But first : you saw those dark , escaping figures ? To the discretion of the silent forest They trust their trembling secret . They shall learn That even the trees turn traitors , when I will it . Upon their track ! Glide like the noiseless serpent , Wind like the subtle air , and bear away Their words as lightly and as unsuspected . When you need counsel , come to me . BOAZ . Boaz I go . Boaz goes . DORCAS . Dorcas And that Theresa ! There is in her look Something in league with my possessing demon . When her dim , unregarding eye turns on me , The storm begins to brew within . O Master , Thou find'st thy agents where thou wilt ! A tree-trunk Sending the shadow of its blasted form Across my path ; a dance of withered leaves To the shrill autumn blast ; a lonely crag , From which , with roots uptorn , a fair young birch Hung slowly withering : all these have been Thy messengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but not like me possessing A higher sense in payment of the lost ,  --  This girl , how often has she , all unconscious , Brought me thy promptings ! When my age-cooled blood Has slugged and thickened , and almost my will Had let itself be lulled , her wandering look , Or even from afar her half-seen form , Has sent a quick thrill through my stiffening veins And braced me to my work . And it is she Who , at this moment , dares to cross my path , And set her feeble madness against mine ! With a gesture of menace , she goes out . FLIGHT . SCENE IV . A highway through a desolate region . On either side the road , blackened stumps of trees . A large uprooted pine beside the road . Helen enters , carrying her child . HELEN . Helen I will take rest . This fallen pine-tree offers Its friendly trunk . My strength is unexhausted , But it is prudent to forestall fatigue .  --  Looking at her child . He sleeps .

How oft , sweet sleeper , in my days of ease , When I have carried thee a little hour Through the smooth walks of what was then my garden , My wearied arms have asked for aid !  --  and now All night I walk the rugged , dreary road , And in the daytime , crouching in some hollow , Or hidden in a thicket 's tangled depths , I hold thee still , and hardly dare to catch An hour of troubled sleep , lest I should wake To find thee no more there ,  --  yet , unfatigued And strong of heart , I still hold on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , from Thee this strength is sent !

The faults of those to whom I owe existence Demand atonement . Let me offer it ! Let want and care , let ceaseless toil and hardship Become my portion ! or , if so Thou deemest , Let me at once complete the sacrifice , And lay me down in an uncared-for grave ! But , oh , protect for me this innocent head ! Let the imputed guilt expire with me , The curse die out before it reaches him !

Take him as Thine ! With faith I yield him up . His way be bright or clouded at Thy pleasure , Let but the path he follows lead to Thee !  --  The sound of a carriage is heard . The sound of carriage-wheels ! Hark ! Nearer ! nearer ! At this late hour , upon this lonely road , What travellers are these , and what their errand ? The moon shines clear ,  --  no tree , no hiding-place ! I must walk firmly on and brave the danger . Does my fate seek me with these coming wheels ?  --  The carriage stops ; some one descends and follows .  --  O God , look down on us ! we have but Thee ! Helen walks on . Leslie , who has descended from the carriage , enters and follows her . LESLIE . Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not betray . HELEN , Helen stopping . You know me ? LESLIE . Leslie Yes : you have forgotten me ? HELEN . Helen Your name I have forgotten ; pardon me . LESLIE . Leslie James Leslie , tutor to your father 's nephew . Four years have passed . My face is strange to you . The time is short for explanations . Trust me Upon the faith of your own noble soul . I see that you confide in me . Then hasten ! With morning 's dawn you shall be placed in safety . HELEN . Helen Till morning dawn you will remain in danger . LESLIE . Leslie I am commissioned by your friend . HELEN . Helen What friend Did me this wrong , to set another life On the same cast with mine ? Return ! return ! Nor lay the burden of another grief Upon a heart too heavy-laden ! LESLIE . Leslie Hear me ! Not rashly , not presumptuously , I offer An unasked aid . Your earliest , truest friend Consigned to me this charge . I have assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not lay it down . I share your danger , Though you permit me not to aid your safety . I have not come alone : a trusty guide , Whose life may answer for this deed , conducts me . A woman , who , through love of you , has dared The guilt of flight , the danger of recapture , Awaits her fate in yours . Reward their truth : Let them be saved with you . Or , if we fail , Let them enjoy at least the martyr 's solace , The suffering in a noble cause ,  --  not waste Their lives on a despised , rejected service . Theresa enters ; she takes the child silently from the arms of the mother and clasps it to her bosom . HELEN . Helen Have I no choice ? Oh , spare me , generous man ! Leave , then , these two , whose fate is bound with mine . Let us pursue our way together . You , Who risk no danger when apart from us , Leave us . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here upon my faith . You will not ask me To fly the danger I myself prepared ? HELEN . Helen I have no choice !  --  To Theresa . My poor Theresa , come ! Is , then , thy love so true ?  --  Theresa seizes the hand of Helen and presses it to her lips . At a signal from Leslie , a man approaches , in whom Helen recognizes Ezekiel . It is the preacher ! Why is he here ? EZEKIEL . Ezekiel This work was given me . Delay not , for my time is short . Behold , The night is near , wherein no man can work ! They all go out in the direction of the carriage . PURSUIT . SCENE I. Room in the house at Belrespiro . Hermann . Herbert , who holds a paper in his hand . They are seated at a table on which lie papers . HERBERT . Herbert I 'm glad to have my own convictions strengthened By your opinion . See , the proofs he brings me Agree in every point with memoranda Found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the entreaty of his daughter , A diligent investigation into Poor Hecate 's antecedents . HERMANN Hermann Yes , it was so . I was consulted , and knew every step . Pointing to some of the papers on the table . These memoranda are in my handwriting . Taking up others . These papers are in Helen 's . They contain Poor Hecate 's narrative . The leading facts Agree with his confessions . Of the shipwreck She made no mention . HERBERT . Herbert Could she have forgotten ? HERMANN . Hermann Improbable . She yielded to the longing To make her story known ,  --  her claim to freedom ; But shrank from wholly lifting up the veil That hid her origin . She gave no aid To our endeavors . When our pressing questions Led her to apprehend a serious purpose To look into her statements , she was silent . And now !  --  HERBERT . Herbert If you made one more trial ? HERMANN . Hermann Fruitless ! Her brain has borne the last . It could escape From suffering only by laying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And , with a quiet smile , gives like assent To every question . HERBERT . Herbert A new grief for Helen ! HERMANN . Hermann But to the wretched sufferer herself This calm oblivion comes like Heaven 's pardon . HERBERT . Herbert You think there is no hope of cure ? HERMANN . Hermann No hope . On her numbed brain the deadening weight will rest During her earthly years , her years of penance . Death will release her first . Her sleeping soul , Its expiation past , will wake to peace .  --  Hermann remains silent a few moments ; then extends his hand for the paper which Herbert holds , takes it and examines it . I always hoped , that , soon or late , the clue To guide us in our further search would offer . We got three stages on the road , no more .  --  Examining the papers . Yes , here 's the name of that slave-trader ; here That of the man he had them from ; and here  --  Yes , here 's the third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . The same . This man , this Woodford , Beginning at the other end , arrives At the same point where our researches failed ; Thence tracing backwards the same road we followed , Here comes upon the objects of his search . He held the first link , as we had the last ; And now , between us , see the chain completed ! HERBERT . Herbert There is no moral doubt . The legal proofs  --  HERMANN . Hermann We shall complete them . This man 's deposition Has all been taken down and duly witnessed . I have had care of that .  --  And now for Dorcas . Her testimony has no legal worth , But her confession of complicity Would bring strong confirmation to our minds . She is still obstinate . ' T is hard to find A way to work on her perverted will . HERBERT . Herbert Persuasions , promises , are lost on her . Threats  --  HERMANN . Hermann Worse than useless . We must try to find Her master motive : with that key we open The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To try to force an entrance , or to win one By indirect expedients . We must have The veritable clue , or waste our efforts . Woodford said something of an injury She thinks herself to have received . In this May be the key to her mysterious conduct : For no advantage to herself has come , It seems , from all her crimes . Let her be sent for . We will confront her with this man once more . Leave me to question her . If once we touch Upon the burning spot , the hidden pain Will quick reveal its presence . HERBERT . Herbert We can try . HERMANN . Hermann The springs of action in barbarian natures Are very simple . In the cultured races , The moral structure , mental apparatus , Become more complex . The expanded brain , Whose delicate fibres vibrate ceaselessly , Thrilled by a myriad shifting influences , Is subject to surprises and to failures Which the strong , rugged engine of the will And plans of the barbarian does not know . We can not boast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-control Which mark the savage ; but he oftener Becomes the victim of a master passion That rules him and betrays him at its will .  --  But Dorcas is not all barbarian . She Has a large share of cultivated blood . We have a sharp intelligence to combat ,  --  Only made sharper by the trace of madness That lurks in it . We must move warily .  --  Woodford has been already summoned ? HERBERT . Herbert Yes . And here he is . Woodford is ushered in by a servant . He is pale and emaciated ; his manner depressed and humble . Herbert regards him with scorn ; Hermann with compassion . HERBERT , Herbert to the servant . Send Dorcas here at once !  --  To Woodford . And you persist in this strange tale you tell ? WOODFORD . Woodford ' T would not avail me to retract it now . HERBERT . Herbert But have you talked with Dorcas ? Have you made her Confess her guilt yet ? WOODFORD . Woodford I have done my best To draw her on to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am mad , or does not answer . She never will be brought to a confession . HERBERT . Herbert But we must have it . You must get it from her . WOODFORD . Woodford I would undo a portion of the ill That I have done , before I seek the grave That waits for me . My days , I know , are numbered . What lies in me I 've done . This woman 's madness Or obduracy is beyond my force . HERMANN . Hermann 117 We will have one more trial . To Herbert . You 'll allow me To act inquisitor ? HERBERT . Herbert I trust your skill . Dorcas enters , and curtsies profoundly . HERMANN , Hermann aside . Her countenance is not encouraging . HERBERT . Herbert Come near and answer all the Doctor 's questions . Straight , mind ! No dodging ! Look him in the face . HERMANN , Hermann to Dorcas . Dorcas , you know this man ? DORCAS . Dorcas I 've seen him . HERMANN . Hermann Where ? DORCAS . Dorcas Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DORCAS . Dorcas Perhaps . I have seen many people in my days . He 's not so marked that I should keep his likeness . HERBERT .

Hermann Weak for late things ,  --  but those passed long ago , Are they not graven deeper ? DORCAS . Dorcas To my sorrow ! HERMANN . Hermann Search , then , and find the image of this man . DORCAS . Dorcas He is not there . He is not worth it . HERBERT , Herbert to Woodford . Are you Sure that this is the very woman ? WOODFORD . Woodford Yes . She is much changed ; but she revealed herself , And left no doubt of her identity . She spoke of things known but to her and me . HERBERT . Herbert This woman was your sole accomplice , then ?

This man absolves them . HERMANN . Hermann We will collect it with all due precautions , Not to alarm them . We shall have it . Now  --  HERBERT , Herbert to Woodford . Then in that crime most heinous , sacrilegious , Of giving up to misery and debasement Those precious lives that fiends might have respected , You had no other tool , associate , Than Dorcas here ? WOODFORD . Woodford No other . HERBERT , Herbert aside to Hermann . She alone Can tell us all we want to know . HERMANN . Hermann Have patience . Let me interrogate . Do not alarm her . You only drive her into sullen silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of her . WOODFORD . Woodford She was a favorite slave , and much indulged . She had some talents , danced and sang well . HERBERT . Herbert Dorcas ? WOODFORD . Woodford Pamela she was called then . You could not , Seeing her now , dream what that creature was Some forty years ago . So gay and graceful , So soft and winning , when she would ! They called her The little fairy , for her grace and lightness . Ah , that was long ago ! HERMANN . Hermann Has she left children In Cuba ? WOODFORD . Woodford No ,  --  I think she had no children , Except a daughter , given to Miss Emma ,  --  Miss Emma Fortescue , now Mrs. Stanley .  --  She must have found her daughter here again , If she be living .

Hermann It is that Theresa , Who at this moment  --  DORCAS , Dorcas with sudden illumination . Yes ! it is Theresa ! Theresa is my child ! Oh , save her ! save her ! HERBERT , Herbert to Woodford .

DORCAS , Dorcas still on her knees . Oh , master ! HERBERT . Herbert Peace ! DORCAS , Dorcas in extremity of anguish . There are more hounds upon their track than yours .

Hermann Now ! HERBERT . Herbert Agreed ! I will prepare the necessary papers .  --  Of these new matters not a word , you know , Out of this room , till we have all in order . I am convinced ; but to convince the world More is required . HERMANN . Hermann I 'll choose the horse myself That is to carry me ; I am no horseman , And yours perhaps would scorn my awkward hand .

Her birth is stained ,  --  Not with that deep , abominable taint ,  --  But stained . How shall I hide it from myself ? How from the world ? We must invent some story , And it must be accepted .

And then  --  Oh , everything wears out in time !  --  What will my father say ? Oh , bitter fate ! Oh , were I what I was two weeks ago ! Have I done right in yielding to this German ? Yes , it was well . He will conduct her hither . Here is her place ,  --  in any case , her place . Poor homeless dove , thy resting-place is here ! What is the world to me ? My angel wife ! We will defy it , will forget it ! come !  --  The Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing-materials towards him and writes . PURSUIT . SCENE II . In front of the house . Hermann walks up and down , making gestures of impatience . HERMANN . Hermann Not ready yet ! Well , I must wait their pleasure . They 'll take their time . No use in fretting at them . Patience , then ! patience !  --  Now I think of it , Who 's to go with me ? Ah , well thought of ! who ? Boaz ? No , no ! Melas ? Yes . Milo ? Yes . Philip ? No . Pyrrhus ? Yes . No.  --  Two will do Better than more . The tender-hearted Melas , The sturdy Milo .  --  To a servant who passes . Boy , go call me Melas And Milo quickly . Bid them dress themselves To attend me on a journey for the master . Tell them they go on horseback ,  --  that the horses Are almost ready ,  --  they must make despatch .  --  Servant goes . Patience , now ! patience ! If I took a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I cannot.  --  Looks at his watch . After all , not twenty minutes . It must have stopped .  --  Puts his watch to his ear . No . Sit down quietly .  --  He seats himself on a rustic bench , takes off his hat and places it beside him , leans back , and falls into a fit of musing . This Dorcas is for me a curious study . Her mother was a native African , A princess ,  --  so she says , and I believe it . Her father was a Spanish nobleman . She tells no lie in that . The most worn-out Of worn-out castes is this noblesse of Spain . She is the product of an undeveloped And of an effete race . Yes , that is it . The moral faculties , the last to reach Their full perfection in the rising race , Are also first to show deterioration In a declining one . The intellect Seems for a season to rest unimpaired , Or is but rendered more acute and prompt By the enfeebling of the hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong passions of a rising race With the keen intellectual subtilty Of a degenerate one . From both her parents , The savage princess and the Spanish noble , She has her blind , unreasoning arrogance , And that intolerance of subjection found In families in which the use of power Has been hereditary ,  --  that impatience Of all restraint that sends the unlawful scions Of noble or royal houses on adventure Glorious or criminal , and which compels , When other outlet from compulsion fails , To deep dissimulation , or the refuge Of death self-given . Well , what more ingredients Go to make up this strange , fantastic whole ? Or with her African or Spanish blood  --  For either lineage might promise it  --  She has received the ecstatic temperament Which lets her claim , perhaps endows her with A subtile sense , a preternatural insight , Through which she reads and rules the minds of others : Power , to its owners even , obscure and awful , Working unbid , absent when most entreated . This Woodford says that in her youth she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Fitful and wayward , but yet full of charm . I can conceive it , startling as it seems . Yes , just these light , capricious , graceful natures , In their youth so enchanting , and that guard  --  When all most happy circumstances meet  --  Even to old age sometimes their fascination , Are those that , the required conditions given , Develop the most dark depravity . I saw a picture once in Italy Of a fair girl whose fresh , arch , dimpled face Was turned towards a mirror that gave back , Not the young loveliness which sought its image , But that same countenance when years had written The history of a lifetime in its lines : A care-ploughed forehead mocked that smooth young brow ; A gleam of guile replaced the coquetry That flickered from those gay , defiant eyes ; Malevolent scorn replied to innocent archness ; Effrontery answered sweet audacity . Oh , what a tragedy was written there ! Even such a tragedy that creature 's life ! And such surround us , if we could but see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements are met in her ? Her mother , By her account , which Woodford has confirmed , A sweet and gentle lady . The affection Her feeble younger sister felt for her Would seem to show her strong as well as tender ; For the weak love not weakness . Hecate 's father ? By all that we can learn of him from Woodford , And from the facts that have transpired , it seems He must have been a man of energy And of refinement , but imperious , Unscrupulous , and passionate . In Hecate We see the father 's ardent , resolute nature , His love of power , his pride , his rashness , tempered By the poor mother 's truth and tenderness . Here the barbarian element is absent . Not here the absorption of all faculties In one idea , that single-minded hate That feasted slowly on its victim 's ruin With the long patience of a safe revenge . Her act was prompted more by love than vengeance : She sought to save her child . The hapless being Who exchanged lots with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she refused to the defrauded one The name of child , withheld the tenderness That might have softened her hard lot , ' t was not From cruelty : her loyal nature shrank From winning love of one whom she had wronged . Poor Hecate ! in the abject Perdita You saw your punishment , and not your triumph ; Hated in her the victim of your crime More than your rival 's daughter . Thou poor heart , That shouldst have been the home of noble thoughts , What hard decree of the unpitying Fates Made thee the covert of remorse and shame ? Dorcas was silent ; in her desert heart She held her secret , and her hateful joys , Content to live apart from sympathy . But Hecate found , in that blank solitude Her misery and her pride had spread about her , A bitter penance . To the only being She had a right to love she opened glimpses Of her past life and inward world , thus risking Discoveries that more than death she dreaded . By every means she sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and song she poured it , Winning compassion for imagined griefs That she might feign it yielded to her own . Oh , blest Oblivion , shroud her senses still ! To wake to feeling were to wake to pain . Oh , shroud them still in thy compassionate darkness , Until with thine the mortal veil is rent !  --  A movement yonder , and the tramp of horses ! At last ! at last ! Now I rejoin you , Helen ! Now I escort you freely , openly , To a safe home ! But you are there already . That wretched woman overrates her mischief : She could not know our plans , has not betrayed them . Ah , will the face of your old friend be pleasant ? Goes out . RESCUE . SCENE I. A prison , partly underground , lighted by a small window near the ceiling . Helen is seated on the ground in a corner of the cell , her head supported against the wall . She looks faint and exhausted . Her child lies asleep on her lap . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some straw . HELEN . Helen Theresa ! THERESA . Theresa I am here . What wouldst thou , mistress ? HELEN . Helen Only to hear thy voice . THERESA , Theresa sitting up . Thou feel'st this silence ? These cruel walls ! Only the ceaseless dropping Of the foul water that but mocks our fever ! Could but a groan or sigh come through to us ! HELEN . Helen My poor Theresa ! This is not thy place . For thee the sunshine and the warm spring air . Thy soul has need of healing , not of penance . Why must thou share my lot ? THERESA , Theresa rising . Oh , let me share it ! The elder griefs find soothing in the new . These cooling tears , through which my frozen brain Thawed into life , were given to thy sorrows . Dear mistress , all there is of sense and will In this awakening heart belongs to thee . I have no soul but thine , no life but thine .  --  Pause . Oh , were I but alone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking near .  --  Leans her head against the wall , as if listening . This thirst that wastes us , oh , how doubly parching It lies upon the hot lips of the wounded ! Oh , mistress dear , you that were once so high , You have no power now greater than the humblest ! These walls , these bolts , stand firm before your word , Feeble as my poor tears . HELEN . Helen If God had willed , My feeble word , thy helpless tears , had been Stronger than walls and bars . THERESA . Theresa How calm thou art ! Is this peace real ? Or does it storm within ? HELEN . Helen Peace is at hand , most real . Not human wrath , But His calm will conducts me to my fate . I feel His hand . I yield me to its guidance . The path is short . For thee , my poor Theresa , Whose earthly journey ends not here , for thee , And for the faithful guide , the noble friend , My heart is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fate , has ordered theirs . I will trust them to Him , as I have trusted This life so twined with mine that its soft tendrils Hold back the flitting soul whose ties to earth Are severed all but these . Not long ! not long ! The upward force prevails ; the tender bonds Slowly detach themselves . THERESA . Theresa How white ! how still ! Oh , let me take the child ! HELEN , Helen faintly . No , let him rest Upon this heart while life yet stirs in it . When it is silent , warm him upon thine . THERESA . Theresa Thou wast so strong ! The hardships of the road , The fasts , the watchings had no power o'er thee , While our road lay to freedom . With thy hope Thy life sank , too . Oh , stay with me , my mistress ! Thou art my hope ! What am I without thee ?  --  What region is it here ? How far is it To where our home was ? Have they heard of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have pity ? HELEN . Helen They know not yet . The road is long and rude . Before they learn , between us and their anger Will stand the reconciler . This cold form , Impassive then to love and hate , will win With mute entreaty pardon for the love Thou gav'st the fugitive .  --  Oh , might it speak To that poor heart the pardon of its harshness ! He will stand near me when these senseless ears Are closed to his regrets , these frozen lips Powerless to frame the accents of forgiveness ! Raising her head and her clasped hands . Then soften Thou the anguish of that hour , O Thou All-Merciful ! forgive ! forgive ! Her head sinks forward . THERESA , Theresa kneeling beside her . Oh , lean thy weary head on me !  --  Theresa puts her arm round Helen to draw her towards herself , but suddenly utters a sharp cry . She remains in the same posture for a few moments , then gently withdraws the child from the lap of its mother . She folds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SCENE II . Room in the house at Belrespiro .

Herbert Where did you get all this ? BOAZ . Boaz Turpin brought word .  --  I was upon the watch Out on the road . I saw him , got his news , And , by a shorter path , ran here before him .  --  That Northern man that could n't stay at home Has got a taste of Southern lead . HERBERT . Herbert What man ? BOAZ .

Herbert The carriage , quick !  --  Boaz goes . What if they should arrive Like captured runaways ! Impossible ! They could not dare !  --  Oh , what could they not dare , Seeing her thus escaping and pursued ?  --  But she is mine again ! Even if I would , I could not break the ties that bind me to her . Poor Helen ! Oh , why could she not have waited But a few days ? Oh , fatal obstinacy ! And yet I bless it . Now she is my wife , I love the pride that almost made me hate her .  --  I can not bear this waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the carriage follow . Goes out . RESCUE . SCENE III . The avenue at Belrespiro . Herbert alone . From the spot where he stands a more distant part of the winding avenue is visible through an opening between the trees . A number of persons are seen moving along . As Herbert watches them , they disappear behind the trees . HERBERT . Herbert What means this moving mass ? It comes demurely , With measured tread . ' T is not a random throng , And yet a motley . Men and women walk , Holding the hands of little children . Sounds Of voices raised in song are borne to me . What can this mean , this strange audacity ? Can they be bringing back the lost in triumph ? This is the Doctor 's work . He has exceeded The powers I gave him . I enjoined on him The strictest secrecy ; and yet , if they Have not learned Helen 's story , could they dare To make a demonstration such as this ?  --  It must be so .  --  Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The train is lost Behind the trees . I will await it here . Or rather , shall I not return , receive her Within the house ? I dread this public meeting . Yet our first interview , in any case , Will be constrained . Perhaps the crowd about us , Which justifies reserve , will rather aid To make away with these first awkward moments . In public she must be at least polite . The ice once broken , I shall find the means To justify myself . I will lay all Upon my ardent love . She will relent . How should she not ? Her heart is placable . He who is loved is readily forgiven . The songs have ceased . Only the laggard trampling Of dilatory feet . No joyful errand Ever sent forth such tardy messengers . What ominous dread comes over me ? The air Has a strange chill . This crowding of events On one another has so shocked my nerves That every breath has power to startle me . I shall be seeing signs and wonders next , Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout , no cry , no song ! A deathlike stillness , As if the earth had opened and received them ! I will go on , that the reality May clear my brain of these uneasy phantoms . Goes . RESCUE . SCENE IV . Another part of the avenue . A bier supported by four men , of whom the two in front are Melas and Milo . They have stopped near the old tree mentioned in the First Part , round which the avenue widens . Hermann stands near the bier , his head sunk on his breast . Flora is taking Helen 's child from the arms of Theresa , who looks pale and faint , but resigns it reluctantly . A throng of people , who have been following in procession , stand silent , their eyes strained towards the bier , or turned on each other with looks of mute inquiry and sympathy . MELAS . Melas Let us rest here . They set down the bier . ' T was underneath this tree She stopped , the last time she came home . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he waits , Not in the shadow of the dancing leaves , But the chill shelter of the silent stone . There will she join him next ! Melas sinks down on his knees and raises his hands silently , in the attitude of prayer . All follow his example , except Hermann , who places himself under the great tree , and stands , his arms folded and his head sunk . MILO , Milo rises suddenly from his knees . But see who comes ! Dorcas enters ; all rise . THERESA . Theresa Does she profane this moment and this presence ? DORCAS . Dorcas Where is she ? Oh , Alondra ! Oh , my child ! Theresa looks round wildly , then turns away . Oh , look at me ! I am not wholly hateful . These eyes thou shunn'st have beamed down love on thee . The voice thou shrink'st from lulled thee softly once . Thou dost not know me , dear ? THERESA . Theresa Take hence this woman ! She is the cause of all . DORCAS . Dorcas My grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clasping her hands in supplication . Little daughter dear , look on me ! Theresa covers her face with her hands . Am I so hideous ? Oh , I was not once ! Look on me only , and I am Pamela ! Look on me only , and I have no sinned ! If I am lost , it is through loss of thee ! Be mine again , and give me to myself ! HERMANN . Hermann Be merciful , Theresa ! THERESA . Theresa Let her be so , And cease to call me child . Tell her who lies Extended there . I can not speak to her . DORCAS . Dorcas They have no need to tell me . THERESA . Theresa If her eyes Meet mine but once , if my voice answer hers , I am undone ; her spell has fallen on me ; My life is given to crime , my soul to hell ! DORCAS , Dorcas in a tone of despair . Accursed ! accursed ! She approaches the bier . O victim ! thou hast triumphed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side-path which opens into the avenue near the great tree . She goes to Hermann and takes his hand in silence . At this moment , a movement and murmur among the crowd . HERBERT is seen approaching . He advances with a slow and uncertain step , looking anxiously about him . Seeing Hermann , he hastens up to him . HERBERT . Herbert You have come back ! HERMANN . Hermann I have come back alone . HERBERT , Herbert hesitating and agitated . What is it you would tell me ? With vehemence , pointing to the bier . What is here ? HERMANN . Hermann The empty casket that once held our jewel . Herbert stands motionless for a few moments , then goes towards the bier . Alice intercepts him and draws him back gently . HERBERT . Herbert Alice ! Oh , sister , speak to me ! You loved her ! Oh , tell me I am not her murderer ! ALICE . Alice Brother , dear brother , in her name I speak : Forgive yourself ! HERBERT . Herbert Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ! A Higher Will than yours Ordained her fate . A Higher Will than yours Composed the strife between your love and pride . That sentence you could neither shun nor bear , When human will or human law pronounced it , Is now irrevocably passed . In vain Your tenderness or your regrets assail it . Bow to it , then . You have not strength to wrestle With the fierce angel of remorse . Submit . Receive into your heart , through Heaven 's favor , The peace you can not win through victory . God requires not where He has not bestowed . HERBERT . Herbert Alice , my sister , oh , what bitter soothing ! ALICE . Alice Not so , my brother . In this solemn presence I can not meet thee with consoling words That truth disowns . I can not speak thee guiltless . Thy own heart would repel the false remission . But I can bring to thee her gentle pardon , Can tell thee there is care for thee in heaven , Can pray thee to accept the love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive thyself , for thou hast been forgiven !

He whom I loved , not with an earthly love , But with the silent reverential worship That mortals offer to translated saints , He , through thy weakness , through thy fault , has met The outlaw 's death ,  --  he fills the felon 's grave . My brother ,  --  yet I can not see thee suffer . Thou wast not made for it . Lay down thy pride . Tempt not a struggle , where thy soul must sink . For thee is but submission or despair ! HERBERT , Herbert in a voiceless whisper . Despair ! HERMANN , Hermann to himself , looking at Herbert . Despair ! Weakness and passion meeting ,  --  Unuse in suffering , unconceding pride ! Soon the rash hand will end the abortive strife ! Herbert goes out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there yet remains a part on earth . Approaches the bier .

Thou wouldst work with love ,  --  But I with love and hate ! I bring both forces ! Thou couldst forgive , thou consecrated martyr ! For thou didst walk unharmed amid the fires , Protected by thy pure , celestial raiment ! But I , whose lower nature bore no charm Against their scorching , I , within whose heart , From its first beats , the tyrant 's passions nestled , Leaving their deadly trail , how can I pardon ?

Not thy crushed victim lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty heart : Thy pampered minion deals the avenging stroke ! For thy false smiles I give thee stern defiance ! Pay thee with scorn thy treacherous caresses ! By all these scars I wear upon my soul I vow to thee uncompromising war ! Put from thee now thy robes of gold and crimson , Ungem thy hands , undiadem thy brow ! Thy hour of mourning comes , thy hour of shame ! I bear the spear of truth ! Before its touch Thy roses wither , thy false graces fall , Leaving thee in thy lonely loathliness ! For even thy sycophants shall shrink from thee , When the world knows thee as thy victims know ! Slavery , thy day is past ! Nor think to fall Crowned by thy doom , as fall more happy martyrs ! Thou shalt lie down to thy eternal sleep In ignominy ! Gentle hand of pity Shall never strew thy bier , nor song and legend Twine their bright wreaths round thy unseemly grave ! Turning away from thy reproach , thy nearest Shall ask for thee the mercy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
