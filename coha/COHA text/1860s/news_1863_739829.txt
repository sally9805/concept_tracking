txt Irving Hall was literally jammed last night upon the occasion of the above match , by the principal professors of oilliarcs in the United Slates , as well as others of less note , and a host of amateurs and other lovers of the game . The ex-champion , Mr. Phelan , presided , and upon the appearance of Kavanagh in the arena he was received with great applause by his admirers ; and little less applause attended the appearance of Seereiter . Mr. Fox acted as umpire for Seereiter ; Mr. ** for Ka% anagh , and Mr. Steil- as referee . Bets ran high , Mr. Morrissey bet 80 to 100 on Seereiter seven times , and then came 1 uut with a bold offer of 600 to 1,000 , which was not taken .

The game was commenced by Kavanagh , at about o'clock , and was concluded by him at 12 ) , o'clock . with a fine run of 60 , when he played the balls within the string , and left but one to go ; Seereiter not counting , Kavanagh made the winning shot . amid the greatest cheering . Seereiter only made 715 points , and , although he played well at times , was remarkably out of practice or out of luck , as he showed a large amount of very poor play . Kavanagh , on the contrary , Played with great brilliancy throughout , making very few mistakes . Ills principal runs were 9 , 42 , 9 , 37 , 46 , 7 , 131 , 12 , 18 , 31 , 46 , 79 , 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 21. 151 , 8 , 74 , 20 , 11 , 26 , 12 , 82 , 119 , 10 , 19 , 11 , 77 , 27 , 31 , 9 , 9 , 60 .
