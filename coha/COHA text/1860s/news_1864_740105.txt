txt The Taeping rebellion in China is virtually at an end . Nankin , its capital , and the ancient capital of China , has been taken by the Imperialists , the rebel King has committed suicide , the bravest of the rebel chiefs have been slain or made prisoners , the remains of the rebel forces are no longer an army , but a fugitive , panic-stricken mob , without leaders capable of reorganizing them , and without spirit to renew the conflict . Such is the pith of the intelligence received by the last mail from China , touching the finale of an insurrection that , for almost twenty years , has laid waste the " FloWery Land " with fire and sword . The counsel of GORDON , who bad paid a visit to the besiegers ' camp , and reports of the wretched state of the garrison , roused the Imperialists to action , and encouraged them to attempt storming the city . On the morning of the 18th of July a mine was exploded near the east gate , which made a breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assault commenced both by land and sea . The land forces were commanded by TRANKwo-Taurr , brother of the viceroy ; and the naval forces placed themselves under the conduct of Capt . ROWSE , of the steamer Confucius , a Yankee tar who chanced to be lying off Nankin at the time , and who rendered material aid to the Imperialists by engaging and silencing two batteries which the rebels had erected facing the river , and on which the besiegers ' gunboats could make no impression . Meanwhile the attack on the land side was carried on with so much vigor , that ere noon the rebels had been driven from every part of the outer wall , and had to seek refuge within the inner fortifications . Here the Taeping soldiers made a desperate defence , but they were too weak to withstand long the superior numbers of the Imperialists , who , on the following day , became undisputed masters of their original metropolis . But the glory of Nankin had departed under rebel rule . It had shrunk to less than half its former size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished , its people had perished of hunger or lied away for safety , and the victors found no loot there , save the enormous gold seal of the Taeping Emperor . The recapture of Nankin , the suppression of the rebellion , and the restoration of peace , will tend to promote the interests alike of native and foreigner . The affrighted inhabitants will return to their old abodes , the ruined cities and villages will be rebuilt , the peasant will resume the cultivation of the soil ; the merchant and mechanic will reopen the shops , and agriculture , industry and commerce will once more shower their blessings on old China . This is , certainly , a very pleasing prospect to contemplate . Nor is there any danger of its beauty being marred , save from one source  --  the arrogance of the Celestials . All the advantages obtained by the Europeans over the Chinese , and all the concessions exacted from the latter by the former , have been obtained and exacted , in great part , since the outbreak of the civil war , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , though it was , the Pekin Government defended itself with obstinacy against the attacks of the outside barbarians , and yielded up to them the privileges which they claimed with unmistakable re1 pugnance . But the rebellion being now suppressed , the whole military force of the country available for another conflict with the intruders , and the native soldiery no longer ignorant of European mode Lof lighting , would it be at all surprising were the " Brother of the Sun and Moon , " elated as he is by recent victories , to conceive the idea of attempting to expel the strangers from ? his dominions , and to strip them of those immunities which they wrung from him in the hour of his adversity ? There exists an apprehension among European residents out there that sooner or later a general onslaught will be made on them , and that the overthrow of the Taepings will ultimately bring the calamities of war , instead of the blessings of peace , to the foreign traders . This alarming anticipation certainly detracts somewhat from the charms of the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
