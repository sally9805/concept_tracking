7. - Sherman and his Campaigns : a Military Biography . By COL . S. M. BOWMAN and LT. - CoL . R. B. IRWIN . New York : Charles B. Richardson . 1865 . WE have read every page and every line of ' this book , and all of it with satisfaction . It is a large volume of more than five hundred pages , and the only fault to be found with it is its weight and size . The superior attractiveness of small , light volumes is so generally recognized in these days , that it is matter of regret when a valuable book like this is published in a form which makes it heavy and hard to hold . The paper and print are good , and the proofs have been well read . The maps are excellent , and they are introduced as maps ought to be , and as they too seldom are . They are furnished or prepared by General Poe , Chief Engineer on the staff of General Sherman , and are carefally reduced so that each map is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such an improvement upon the old method of binding in large maps , that space may well be spared for assuring publishers that there is hardly any one they can adopt that will be more appreciated by the majority of readers . When the large mnps are unfolded , they make the volumes to which they are attached almost unmanageable , unless they are laid upon a table , and comparatively few people like to read in that way . Moreover , it is a delicate matter to unfold and fold them , and . they are constantly tearing , much to the annoyance of the reader . The book is the joint production of Colonel Bowman and LieutenantColonel Irwin . The former was a lawyer before the war , and entered the service as First Major of a regiment of volunteer cavalry , and served with distinction in that and other capacities until he was assigned to the command of a department composed of Delaware and a portion of Maryland . The latter was a clerk in the Adjutant-General 's Department at Washington before the war . He served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and was then transferred to the Department of the GuW where he served for a long time as AdjutantGeneral of that Department . They seem to have labored in perfect harmony . The style and spirit of the book are the same throughout , and scarcely an indication of divided authorship has attracted our attentiQn . It does not appear what proportion of the book is the contribution of each . But for the announcement on the title-page , the reader would take it for the work of a single hand . The only exception that we notice is in the want of correspondence between the modest opinion expressed on page 475 , that " the country and the world will probably agree in according him // Sherman military genius of a high order , " and the warmer declaration on page 479 , that " his written orders are luminous of the inspiration of his own matchless genius . " The style of the book is good throughout . It is simple , clear , straightforward , and manly . The authors have had free access to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman 's order and letter books , embracing copics of all orders made and letters written by him since the winter of 1861-62 ; and they have made faithful use of the means at their command . The result is the production of a very interesting and very valuable booJ* . It is precisely what it purports to be , a Military Biography ; not a philosophic and not a scientific military history . There is little said in it of tactics and strategy and logistics ,  - -  little about plans of campaign . We learn from it where General Sherman was born and when , who were his parents and his ancestors , and what he has been doing from his birth up to the time when he bade farewell to " Sherman 's army . " When we consider that this book was published within a year from the time when Grant saw his lieutenants carry the heights of Lookout Mountain and Mission Ridge , we feel that its authors must have worked hard and well , and that it is not strange that such errors and inaccuracies have crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so good that it can afford a little friendly criticism . In the first place , though the proof-reader has done his work well , he has notb done it perfectly well . The worst errors that we have noted are the following ; - sufficient for insufficient page 234 any for " my " 235 loose for " lose " 34* Nelson " Wilson , three times on " 415 impotence " indolence " 446 enumerated " enunciated " 452 Defects of style are not very uncommon , though not common . Sometimes they are plainly the result of haste , but sometimes , we fear , of an indulgence of a taste for fine writing , though this is generally strongly restrained . Thus we read on page 24 , that " the Southern brain took fire as well as the Southern heart . Events took the bit in their teeth . " With the Southern brain and the Southern heart on fire , and events with teeth , and with " the bit " in those teeth , it is no wonder that there was trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every article of subsistence , &amp;c. " in his desolate track . " Sometimes there is a misuse of a preposition , of which the phrase already quoted , " luminous of inspiration , " is an example . Sometimes there is a meaningless tautology , as " an absence of coherence or cohesion , " " respect imposing reticence // or silence . " Not unfrequently there is an awkward ellipsis , as where we read that Sherman 's efficiency confirmed certain persons " in the correctness of their choice " of him , ( page 22 , ) when the meaning is that his efficiency confirmed them in their belief of the correctness of their choice . A more common fault is the occurrence of certain sentences which we feel are all wrong , although they convey the author 's idea with a fair amount of distinctness . The following quotations will illustrate our meaning : " Surface opinions change with the wind , but it is useless to argue against fundamental beliefs , and such was the character of Sherman 's attachment to the Union . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is , that the result of any movement , by either side , was left to chance . " ( Page 27 . ) The curiously confused definitic*i of the word guerrilla , on page 76 , is another illustration . These inartificial sentences are sometimes only blemishes , but sometimes they are a serious evil , from the fact that their use tends to obscure the meaning . A fault of which there are too many instances consists in an incorreet use of the participle , by which the idea is sometimes made difficult to catch , and sometimes the wrong idea is given . Thus we read , on p. lOi , " On the morning of the 22d , after removing about forty of the felled trees , the enemy appeared in large force in rear of the gunboats* and opened fire , " &amp;c . One would suppose that this must mean , after the enemy had removed certain felled trees , they appeared . But the truth is that it was our forces who removed the trees . Again , on p. 108 : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the enemy did not attempt to destroy , and forming the troops in similar order beyond the bridge , only that Monro 's brigade , " &amp;c. ; and so the sentence wanders on for three or four lines , till the paragraph ends without even a verb to form the predicate for the noun or pronoun to which forming must be supposed to belong . Sometimes there is a sudden and confusing transition from a participial phrase to the use of a participle agreeing with the subject of a sentence , as on p. 112 : " The three corps being in position , and Vicksburg as completely invested as our strength admitted , and , relying upon the demoralization of the enemy , General Grant ordered , " &amp;c . Some sentences are obscure , simply from haste and carelessness , as it would appear . Thus ( p. 85 ) : " Sherman 's design was .... to break the . centre near Chickasaw Creek , at the head of a bayou of the same name , and , once in position , to turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sometimes , though very rarely , a statement is made as a military proposition which seems not to have been properly considered . // Thus , in the account of the battle of Bull Run , after stating that the Rebel army was to act upon the defensive at that battle , ours upon the offensive , the book proceeds : " The advantage of ground would be with the enemy , the advantage of surprise , and the great advantage of cohesion at the moment of attack . " The second of these statements is a novel and startling military proposition . That troops in position would have the advantage of surprise over troops advaacing for the express purpose of carrying or turning a position , is hard to understand or believe . Such mistakes as left for right , west for east , March for May , occur , but they are found here and there in almost all military books . The attentive reader easily detects such errors , without being misled by them . The statement on p. 259 , that General Howard , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with his corps at the second battle of Bull Run , and on the retreat from Centreville he commanded the rearguard , " is , we think , incorrect . Our impression is very strong that General Couch commanded the rear-guard on that retreat , and that General Howard reported for duty at Cloud 's Mills , behind AlexanAria , after the return of the army from Centreville . So weak a statement as " General Sherman seems to comprehend the value of time in war , " ( p. 483 , ) should not find a place in so excellent a.book . We have pointed out errors and defects with some freedom , but the book deserves great praise . It is so short a time since the war ended , that there is no reason for expecting exhaustive , philosophic histories of it * yet . What is wanted now jg the publioittion of our*t* , straightforward , soldierly statements of matters of fact , and this book is such a statement in an eminent degree . It is remarkably accurate and remarkably clear . Its tone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality is inculcated in manly language . We may cite as an instance the remarks in regard to the relations between commerce and war , on page 73 . Where the progress of the history leads the authors to touch upon delicate matters , involving the conduct and personal relations of men in eminent positions , their language is outspoken without being vehement , and the positions they assume are decided without being extreme . We have read many of the books already published about the late war , some of them purely military , some of them altogether popular . We have found in them much that had merit , and also much inaccuracy , ignorance , exaggeration , and vehemence . This book is neither purely popular nor purely military , but for a com* *bination of these two characteristics , for accuracy , good sense , excellence // of tone , and candor , we think it , on the whole , though somewhat wanting in color , the most desirable book on the military history of the war , for the general reader , that has thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of what we learn from it . General Sherman 's family is of English descenL His ancestor came to Massachusetts in 1634 ; and the family , after a long residence in Connecticut , moved to Ohio in 1815 . General Sherman was born in that State in 1820 . He entered the Academy at West Point in 1836 , and graduated creditably in 1840 . He served in the artillery in the South for the next six years , and in California during the Mexican War . He devoted much of his leisure at this early period to the study of geography , and to such legal studies as he thought might prove useful to him in his profession of arms . In 1853 , he resigned his commission , and became the manager of a banking-house in San Francisco . In 1860 he was offered , and accepted , the position of Superintendent of the Louisiana State Military Academy . The ability which he displayed in that position caused the political leaders in Louisiana to feel extremely anxious to gain him to their side , but all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest extent in favor of the Union ; but when he saw that secession was determined upon , he decided at once upon his own course , and made known his decision to the Governor of Louisiana in a letter dated January 18 , 1861 , from which we copy some characteristic sentences - " SIR , - As I occupy a quasi-military position under this State , I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted such position when Louisiana was a State in the Union , and when the motto of the seminary , inserted in marble over the main door , was : By the liberality of the General Government of the United States : The Union - Esto Perpetua . ' " Recent events foreshadow a great change , and it becomes all men to choose . If Louisiana withdraws from the Federal Union , I prefer to maintain my allegiance to the old Constitution as long as a fragment of it survives " I beg you to take immediate steps to relieve me as Superintendent the moment the State determines to secede ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or think any thought , hostile to , or in defiance of , the old government of the United States . " It is curious to remember that it was the man who wrote this letter , - and who wrote it in the far South , at a time when the hearts of so many men failed them for fear , and wrote it to resign a position which gave competence and influence at the moment , and was a sure stepping-stone to rapid military preferment , - who was suspected last spring by many , after rendering the most brilliant services to the cause of the Union , of being disloyal to the North , and treacherously friendly to the South . // His resignation was accepted at once . He did all he could to impress upon every one with whom he talked , from the President down , his conviction that war was inevitable , and that it would be long and bitter , but he tried in vain . He refused to have anything to do with such a " trifling expedient " as raising three-months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was commissioned Colonel of the Thirteenth Infantry , and was presently assigned to the command of a brigade in Tyler 's division of the army commanded by General McDowell . It seems strange to us , with our familiar knowledge of General Sherman 's brilliant successes in the later years of the war , to read that he took part with his brigade in the battle of Bull Run . His loss was nearly a fourth of that of the entire army . He acted with vigor in the battle , and did good service afterwards in restoring order and discipline among the demoralized troops ; but he seems to have sent his troops into action in n way which he would not have approved after he had acquired a little more experience . He was soon after appointed a Brigadier-General of Volunteers , and ordered to report , as second in command , to General Anderson , commanding the Department of Kentucky . This was in September , 1861 . In the following month , when General Anderson was relieved at his own request , he assumed command of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his answer to the question of the Secretary of War , how many troops he would require in his department . His reply was : " Sixty thousand to drive the enemy out of Kentucky ; two hundred thousand to finish the war in this section . " When this answer was made public , it excited astonishment and indignation in the popular mind . A writer for one of the newspapers declared that he was crazy . The charge was very generally accepted as well founded . He was relieved by General Buell in the following month , and ordered to report to General Halleck , commanding the Department of the West . The sequel has proved that Sherman 's estimate was not extravagant ; for , as our authors say , many more than two hundred thousand men have been required permanently to hold Kentucky and Tennessee . General Sherman worked hard , hut occupied no prominent position , till March , 1862 , when he took command of the Fifth Division of the Army of the Tennessee . At the great battle of Shiloh or Pittsburg Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed plainly what manner of man he was . He so conducted himself that General Halleck , in recommending that he should be made a Major-General of Volunteers , used the following language , in a letter written from the battle-field : " It is the unanimous opinion here that Brigadier-General // W. T. Sherman saved the fortunes of the day on the 6th , and contributed largely to the glorious victory of the 7th . " General Grant , writing to the War Department three months after , and urging Gencral Sherman 's promotion as a Brigadier-General in the regular army , and referring to the battle of Shiloh , declared , " To his individual efforts I am indebted for the success of that battle . " We must pass very rapidly over the next seventy pages , which contain an interesting history of the events of the war in the West , so far as Sherman was connected with them , from April , 1862 , when the battle of Shiloh was fought , to September , 1863 , when the great concentration about Chattanooga began . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Yicksburg , the capture of Arkansas Post , and the siege and fall of Vicksburg . The oftenrepeated charge , that General Sherman formally protested against General Grant 's plan of operations against Vicksburg , is contradicted on page 129 ; and the explanation of the manner in which the charge arose , and the statements in refutation , seem to us to dispose of it altogether , especially when to them is added the emphatic language of General Sherman , quoted on page 471 : " It is said I protested against it . It is folly . I never protested in my life , - never . " General Sherman was ordered , about the close of September , to move eastward toward Chattanooga . On the 25th of October , at Iuka , he learned that he was assigned to the command of the Department of the Tennessee . This had been done at the recommendatioa of General Grant , who , on the 18th of the same month , had assumed command of the Military Division of the Mississippi , comprising the Departments of the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once published , for the guidance of the officers and soldiers of his command , instructions that were full of vigor and wisdom . Commanders of corps and of posts were directed to assume the highest military powers allowed by the laws of war and of the United States . Trade was to be left to those who had no connection with the army . Every officer and soldier was to be at his post or with his colors , and none were to engage in any business save their sworn duty to the government . Citizens who assisted the troops in vindicating the national authority were to be assisted in turn by them , but there were to be no favors for those who failed to do so . All the property of such men that was useful in war might be freely taken , but must be accounted for as public property . To correspond or trade with the enemy constituted the individual a spy . On the 27th of October a messenger floated down the Tennessee , over the Muscle Shoals , bearing this short message from Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad east of Bear Creek . Put your command towards Bridgeport till you meet orders . " On the morning of November 15 , Sherman rode into Chattanooga , in advance of his troops . The state of affairs was then substantially as follows . The armies of Grant and Bragg lay confronting each other , but our position had been materially improved by the movement of General Hooker , who , on the 28th of October , crossed the Tennessee on a pontoon bridge skilfully and rapidly laid during the preceding night by General W. F. Smith , and took up a position upon and in front of the heights on the left bank of Lookout Creek , and thus gave new lines of supply to our army , which was before in danger of starvation . Thus the movements had commenced by an advance of our right , for a special purpose ; and it seems to have been Grant 's plan , that , as soon as Sherman 's troops arrived , they should form the left of our line , and turn the right of the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus endanger his communications with his depot at Chickamauga , while Thomas , the Jupiter Stator of the battle of Chickamauga , advanced against and pierced his centre , and another part of the command demonstrated against his left on Lookout Mountain . Sherman crossed the Tennessee above Chattanooga , and secured an advantageous position near the extreme right of the enemy , on the last heights of Mission Ridge . The sun rose brightly on the morning of November 25 , and Sherman 's bugles sounded the advance as it rose . He fought a stubborn fight till three , is . M. , when " a white line of musketry fire in front of Orchard Knoll , extending further right and left and front , and a faint echo of sound , satisfied him that Thomas was moving on the centre . The attack on the left had drawn vast masses of the enemy to that flank , so that the result on the centre was comparatively assured . " When the sun set , Sherman learned that Thomas had swept across Mission Ridge . The victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , Sherman knew that the enemy had " abandoned the valley of Chickamauga and the State of Tennessee , and was descending the southern slopes , whose waters flow to the Atlantic and the Gulf . " The account of this great battle would be more satisfactory if it included some description of Hooker 's doings at Lookout Mountain , and some further details of Sherman 's battle . There is no account of the cessation of the enemy 's resistance to him . Two of his brigades fall back in disorder , - when surprised by an attack on the right and rear . The enemy make a show of pursuit , are themselves checked by a flank fire , and seek cover behind a hill ; and we are told nothing more about Sherman 's troops till they commence the pursuit . // The next three chapters contain the story of Sherman 's relief of Knoxville , of the Meridian Raid , of the disastrous Red River expedition ; some interesting letters from Sherman about the treatment of inhabitants of conquered territory , the treatment of slaves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sherman and Grant when the latter was made Lieutenant-General ; an account of the organization of the great army of the centre under Sherman as commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi ; and interesting sketches of the career of Schofield , McPherson , and Thomas , the commanders respectively of the Armies of the Ohio , of the Cumberland , and of the Tennessee ; and , in one striking paragraph , a statement of the contrasted qualities and acquirements of these three accomplished soldiers . On the 10th of April , 1864 , Sherman received his final instructions from the Lieutenant-General . His command consisted of about one hundred thousand men of all arms , and two hundred and fifty-four guns . This was the force which was to become so famous under the name of " Sherman 's army . " At this early period , he made known to the Commander-in-Chief his intention and confident expectation of sub*isting his numerous army on the enemy 's country , so far as their interruption of his communications might make it necessary . The next chapter commences the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how his army , beginning to move on the 7th of May , turns Johnston 's left , and causes him to abandon Dalton , then drives him from Resaca , then turns Allatoona Pass , and how Sherman improved the last advantage by establishing at the Pass a secondary base . By the aid of the excellent maps , we can follow these and all the following movements step by step . In the next chapter , we read of the continuation of Sherman 's advance , including the operations about Pine and Lost Mountains and Kenesaw , - upon the last of which Sherman made two unsuccessful assaults , though they were in his judgment productive of good fruits , - the operations about Marietta , the passage of the Chattahoochee , and the advance of the army to a position in front of Atlanta , and the combats which took place there . These combats were brought on by General Hood , whom the fatuity of Jefferson Davis , or his personal hostility to Johnston , had preferred to the command of the Confederate Army of . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with important results in the gain or loss of positions , and chiefly memorable for the death of McPherson , the accomplished and beloved young commander of the Army of the Tennessee . The interest of this book has led us into too much detail in telling . // what the first half of it contains ; and now we must compress , as we arrive at the most interesting part of the volume . Fortunately , the movements of Sherman and his army after the fall of Atlanta are much more generally known than their movements before that great success was gained . The efforts of that army were at last rewarded . The long and anxious waiting of the country came to an end . On the morning of the 2d of September , 1864 , Slocum with the Twentieth Corps marched into and took possession of Atlanta . The colors of the Second Massachusetts Regiment , torn by the shot of Cedar Mountain , of the Antietam , and of Gettysburg , were planted in the Gate City of the South . There was a brief period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point had been gained , but much remained to do . Sherman , " Nil actuin reputans dum quid superesset agendum , " was laying his plans deeply , and making minute preparations for their accomplishment . As a necessary preliminary , he determined to make Atlanta exclusively a military post . He issued his famous order for its abandonment on the 4th of September . The book tells us how the order was obeyed , and gives us , among other correspondence of the time , the striking letter which Hood 's protest elicited from Sherman . Jefferson Davis had made the fatal mistake of ordering an invasion of Tennessee . Sherman was not the man to be lured out of Georgia by such a movement . He despatched Thomas to Nashville , on the 28th of September , to take personal command of the rear , and when Hood began his disastrous march to the North , on the 1st of October , he followed him just far enough to be sure that he would pursue his plan of invasion , and then , having detached enough troops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear , and was once more descending the Atlantic slope . His preparations for his great march were complete ; Atlanta and R6me were destroyed , save their mere dwelling-houses and churches . On the 12th of November the last despatch was sent to Washington ; the army stood detached and cut off from all communication with the rear , and " the colors pointed to the South . " His great plan , one of the most masterly , in our judgment , ever formed by a general , was successfully carried out . The book tells us the details of the grand story of which we all know the principal features . It tells us how the " lost army " marched to the sea , with its cavalry and skirmishers holding back the enemy on all sides , so that the main army marched as unseen of them as a god of , Greek story wrapped in mist , till they grasped Savannah , and offered it as a Christmas gift to the nation ; and how , meanwhile , Thomas fell back , concentrating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicting // a bloody check on the enemy at Franklin , then how he stood at bay at Nashville , while the country watched with almost breathless interest , in fear lest he should be crushed in his lines , till , on a morning dark with fog , he issued from them , more grandly than Wellington from the lines of Torres Vedras against Massena , and fell on Hood , and so dealt with him and his invading army that it ceased to exist , save as a disheartened rabble of half-armed and barefooted men , and as an organized force disappeared from history . There are some interesting episodes in the history of these great events . The most so , to our thinking , is Gorse 's defence of Allatoona . There is something most impressive and affecting in the thought of the great captain , watching from the heights of Kenesaw the smoke that told of the danger of his beleaguered lieutenant , eighteen miles away , and waving to him with the little signal flags the few and simple , but sufficient , words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events with which it deals are those with which we are more and more familiar . It records the long-deferred punishment which at last fell upon South Carolina ; the masterly movements in North Carolina , with the capture of Fort Fisher and Wilmington , and the battle of Bentonville ; the surrender of the army of Johnston , the march to Washington , and the Grand Review . The book asserts that it was owing to Sherman that the army moved northward by land . At Savannah , he was met by instructions from Grant to embark his army , and hasten to the James River by water . Upon his earnest representations that it was better on every account , easier and quicker and healthier for him , and far more damaging to the enemy , to go by land than by water , he was permitted to do so , and the details were left to him . His army set its foot heavily upon the haughtiest district in the South ; and the pillar of smoke by day and the pillar of fire by night accompanied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book are taken up to a great extent by an account of the truce with Johnston , by the correspondence that went on during the truce , an account of the " Rejected Agreement , " and a statement and discussion of all that was said and done by those in high position , particularly Mr. Stanton , General Halleck , and General Sherman , at and about that time . This discussion is conducted with candor , manliness , and ability , and adds much to the value of the book . It is plain that the authors have studied to exhibit the acts of General Sherman , as they were performed , and by the light of the existing circumstances . All through the book , he is allowed to speak for himself . His correspondence and his orders are very freely quoted . The book is from friendly hands , but not the hands of blind partisans We believe it to have been written in the interest of truth . // In the last fifty page.s , there is a collection of miscellaneous matter , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Sherman are there published , of which the more noteworthy are those he wrote upon the subject of banishing newspaper correspondents from his lines , and adhering to that sentence as a necessary one , though Mr. Lincoln inclined to think otherwise ; upon the method to be followed for checking the circulation in his army of discouraging and disloyal newspapers ; his amusing letter to the Rebel chaplain , who complained of the loss of his horse ; the letter full of cordiality and affectionate confidence , yet of a wise man 's doubts , which he wrote to General Howard , on receiving the friendly letter in which he informed him that he had accepted the appointment of Chief of the Freedmen 's Bureau ; and the touching letter which he wrote to the commanding officer of the battalion of the Thirteenth Infantry , to thank him and them for their behavior to his child , whom they had made an honorary sergeant at nine years of age , and whose remains they had escorted to the grave . Information is also given in this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railways in war , and of the manner in which he succeeded in so marvellously developing their capacity ; as to his treatment of the question of furnishing rations to the poor citizens of the districts he entered , while his army were in want of provisions and forage ; as to his views of the manliness of the Northern States in seeking to fill their quotas by enlisting blacks in the South to do the work of shirking Northern whites , &amp;c . There are also to be found some most interesting speeches of General Sherman , full of information and full of his striking peculiarities of style . The book contains excellent portraits of eight of the most prominent officers of " Sherman 's army , " including Sherman himself . We would gladly say more , especially about Sherman 's singular magnanimity , as shown on several important occasions , but want of space forbids ; and we believe that enough has been said to satisfy any one who is fond of reading about the late war and its heroes , that this is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
