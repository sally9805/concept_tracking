ART . V. - Jllemoirs , Letters , and Speeches of ANTHONY ASHLEY COOPER , first EARL OF SHAFTESBURY , Lord Chancellor , with other Papers illustrating his Life . From his Birth to the Restoration . Edited by WILLIAM IDOUGAL CHRISTIE , ESQ. , her Majesty 's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Brazil . London : John Murray . 1859. 8vo. pp. lxii. and 224 . WHILE Lord Shaftesbury was a prisoner in the Tower , on a charge of high treason , his character was drawn by Dryden with all the bitterness of invective which partisan malice and theological rancor can inspire . The sketch had , however , a sharpness of outline and a brilliancy of coloring which have preserved it from the usual fate of party libels ; and the general fidelity of its portraiture has been recognized by subsequent writers . Indeed , in our own time , and not many years ago , a much greater man than Dryden , the late Lord Macaulay , drew a scarcely less memorable portrait of the false Achitophel , describing him in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in " talents , address , and influence , " while " his life was such that every part of it reflects infamy on every other . " But occasionally some intrepid biographer has sought to rebuild Shaftesbury 's shattered reputation , and to present him to other hero-worshippers , if not as a fit object for admiration , yet as one whose character was not quite so black as it has been commonly represented . Such is avowedly the design of Mr. Christie . He had early formed the purpose of writing a new Life of Shaftesbury , and had made some progress in the collection of materials , when the present Earl gave him access to the family papers at St. Giles , with permission to make use of them in any way which he might think desirable . He does not appear to have found there anything of importance , though his collection comprises some interesting papers which have been closely guarded for several generations . A portion of these documents are printed in the volume before us , and in his Preface Mr. Christie expresses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at // no very distant time ; but his Life of Shaftesbury must be regarded as indefinitely postponed . The principal paper brought to light by Mr. Christie 's researches is an autobiographical account of Shaftesbury 's early life , extending from his birth to 1639 , and containing , among other interesting matters , the racy sketch of an English squire which was first printed in " The Connoisseur , " about the middle of the last century . Following this are a shorter autobiographical sketch , extending from Shaftesbury 's birth to 1646 , and a diary coming down to July , 1650 ; but neither of these contains anything of much interest or importance , and the diary is noticeable only for the extreme brevity of the entries , and for the entire omission of any reference to political topics . The other papers in the volume are two extracts relating to the events of 1640 , reprinted from Lord King 's Life of Locke ; some suppressed passages of Ludlow 's Memoirs , from the Locke Papers ; Shaftesbury 's speeches in the second session of Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Richard Cromwell , reprinted , with a single exception , from Burton 's Diary ; and a few letters and papers relating to the events between 1643 and 1645 , and between 1657 and 1660 . To them Mr. Christie has prefixed a minute examination of the first chapter of Lord Campbell 's Life of Shaftesbury , in which some striking errors are detected , though it must be conceded that most of the criticism is mere word-picking ; and he has also added a copious body of illustrative notes , containing some curious details and much abuse of Martyn 's Life of Shaftesbury . Mr. Christie 's materials are certainly very meagre , and for the most part of very little importance ; but he has corrected some errors of preceding writers ; and he has evidently bestowed much labor on the attempt to throw new light on Shaftesbury 's life and character . It is not his fault that Shaftesbury 's reputation is not likely to be much benefited by his researches . Anthony Ashley Cooper , created by Charles H. first Earl of Shaftesbury , was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22d of July , 1621 , and was the eldest child then living of Sir John Cooper , Baronet . His mother was the only daughter of Sir Anthony Ashley , Baronet , a man of considera // ble wealth and influence , and of an ancient and distinguished family , which had been settled in iDorsetshire for nearly two centuries . At the age of seven his mother died , leaving two children younger than Anthony , and before he was ten years old his father also died . The boy was thus thrown on the world without parental care at one of the most critical periods of childhood , while his property became the prey , in part of a rapacious kinsman , and in part of his father 's creditors , who stripped him of a considerable portion of his inheritance . He was early involved in lawsuits , and some of the animosities thus kindled were never extinguished . But he was not wholly friendless , and his guardians bestowed proper care on his education . He had several private tutors , and at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here he appears to have made himself very popular , by his agreeable manners , and by his spirit in resisting an attempt to weaken the college beer and in putting an end to a barbarous practice of the Seniors toward the Freshmen ; but of his rank as a scholar we know nothing . In 1638 , and before leaving college , he was entered a student of Lincoln 's Inn . He did not , however , pay much attention to the study of the law , though he was at a subsequent period very assiduous in the discharge of his duties as a county magistrate . Shortly afterward he determined to marry , and , after considering several propositions that were made to him , he resolved to pay his addresses to Margaret , one of Lord Keeper Coventry 's daughters . " And notwithstanding I was very young and unexperienced in love affairs , " he says in the Autobiographical Fragment , " yet the prudence and affection of the lady I addressed to overlooked that , and made a judgment what I was like to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good love speeches I then made ; for I did that very ill , was very talkative , and good company to her sisters , hut my love to her gave me that desire to seem excellent that I could say nothing , insomuch that her mother and they suspected that I was more inclined to one of them ; hut that being cleared , all matters went successfully on , and we were married . " his marriage took place on the 25th of February , 1689 , before he was eighteen years old ; and until the death of his // father-in-law , in the following Jaiiuary , he lived for the greater part of the time with his wife 's family . Here , as Lord Campbell humorously suggests , he probably acquired the very limited knowledge of the law which was all that he ever possessed . While a member of his father-in-law 's family , and for a year or two afterward , he spent a considerable time in travelling in the north and west of England . In these excursions he neglected no opportunity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the principal inhabitants of the places which he visited . Tewkesbury was one of those places , and while there he attended a dinner given by the bailiffs , at which he contrived to ingratiate himself in theli ' favor to such an extent , that at the next election he was chosen a member of the House of Commons . Though he was not of age , he took his seat in the Short Parliament which met in April , 1640 , and he is said to have been very regular in his attendance ; but the Parliamentary History contains no evidence that he participated in the debates . For some unknown reason , he was not elected by his constituents to the Long Parliament ; and he also failed to obtain a seat for Dowuton , where he offered himself as a candidate . A double return was made , and , though he used every exertion to procure admission , he was unsuccessful ; nor was it until the Commonwealth was destroyed , and the Rump was restored , that he became a member of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not idle . A man of his energetic and restless spirit could scarcely fail to act a conspicuous part at all times . But the part which he took during the Civil War , and under the Commonwealth , is chiefly noticeable as illustrating his versatility and his unscrupulousness , and need not detain us long . It is true , indeed , that lie was always wise above his years ; but it was not until a later period that he began to show the wonderful prescience which constituted one of the chief sources of his power , and which bore him triumphantly through the thickest perils . Added to this he was still young , without fixed principles , out of Parliament , and in no position of marked influence . It was as a partisan leader in some enterprises of minor importance , and as a county magistrate , and not in the department of political intrigue , that he made himself felt . // At this time he was an ardent supporter of Charles , and we know from his own record that he was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both in public and in private he advocated the King 's cause , and assailed the acts of the Parliament ; and so persuasive was his eloquence , that he even induced the town of Weymouth to expel the Parliamentary garrison , and to accept him as royal governor . But having been superseded , he determined to forsake the King 's party , and to look elsewhere for th. means of gratifying his ambition , though Mr. Christie stoutly denies that the change was thus sudden and radical . The evidence , however , on which the charge rests is too strong to be overthrown , and it is certain that Sir Anthony Cooper , either from wounded vanity or from a belief that the royal cause was the weaker of the two , suddenly changed sides at this time , and joined the Parliamentarians . He was cordially received by his new friends , and in August , 1644 , he was made a member of the committee for governing the army in the west of England . In this capacity he continued only a short time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises . After his withdrawal from military life he does not appear to have engaged actively in public affairs , though Whitelocke represents him as being in " great favor and trust with the Parliament . " In the trial of the King he took no part , and we are ignorant whether he approved of the execution , - the only reference to the subject in his diary being a simple entry that on that day he went to Bagshot . Subsequently he was made a member of the Commission for the Reform of the Law ; but in this capacity he used his tongue so freely that he fell under suspicion , and was consequently arrested as a delinquent . The evidence against him was insufficient to prove any serious charge , and after a short time the House of Commons resolved that he " should be pardoned of all delinquency . " After Cromwell 's expulsion of the Parliament , he intrigued without success for the appointment of Keeper of the Great Seal ; but he was more fortunate in procuring a seat in Cromwell 's first Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the principal speakers in support of the celebrated motion , " That the sitting of the Parliament any longer would 33 * // not be for the good of the Commonwealth . " He also secured an election to Cromwell 's second Parliament as one of the members for Wilts . When this Parliament met , in September , 1654 , he rose at once to the rank of a leader , and was a zealous supporter of the motion for an inquiry into the validity of the Instrument of Government . Finding the Parliament thus disposed to call in question the authority from which they derived their own existence , and likely to prove troublesome in various ways , Cromwell determined to try the effect of excluding the more contumacious members . Accordingly he summoned the Cornmons to the Painted Chamber at Whitehall , where lie read them a long and dreary lecture , telling them that , though he had said they were a free Parliament , he thought it was understood that he was the Protector and the authority that called them , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right from God and men . " In conclusion , he informed them that they must give some public recognition of his authority . On their return to Westminster , the members found a declaration awaiting their signature , by which they promised to be faithful to the Lord Protector , and not to propose , or consent to , any alteration of the government as then established in one person and a Parliament . The declaration was signed by many members , while it was rejected by others . Among the latter , Cooper was one of the most conspicuous . The document did not , however , produce the effect which Cromwell designed , and he was soon compelled to dissolve the Parliament , even before the expiration of the five months designated by the Instrument of Government as the shortest period for its continuance . Cooper was likewise chosen one of the members for Wilts in Cromwell 's third Parliament , which was held in the latter part of 1656 ; but he was refused admission in consequence of his failure to obtain a certificate of approbation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule he passed in private life , but more or less actively engaged in intrigues against the government . On the accession of Richard Cromwell , he was again returned to Parliament by his old friends in Wilts , and he exhibited no // hesitation about taking the oaths to support the new Protector , though he began at once a violent opposition to the measures of the government . He was a frequent and effective speaker , and we have numerous reports of his speeches , for which we are chiefly indebted to the assiduity of Thomas Burton , also a member of that Parliament ; but only one of them is deserving of much notice . This was a brilliant , pointed , and very bitter harangue on the question whether the Commons should recognize the other House , composed of Oliver Cromwell 's peers . This recognition he opposed in a speech of considerable length , which must be counted among the best extant specimens of the oratory of that age . " This day 's debate is but too clear a proof , " he said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable and mutable , like the air we live in ; for , sir , if that were not our temper , we should not now be disputing whether , after all those hazards we have run , that blood we have spilt , that treasure we have exhausted , we should not now sit down just where we did begin , and of our own accords submit ourselves to that slavery which we have not only ventured our estates and lives , but , I wish I could not say , our souls and consciences , to throw offi " He then proceeded to assail the memory of the late Protector with great virulence , as one " who called monarchy Antichristian in another , and , indeed , made it so in himself , - who voted a House of Lords dangerous and unnecessary , and too truly made it so in his partisans , - who with fraud and force deprived you of your liberty when living , and entailed slavery on you at his death " ; to ridicule the character and constitution of the other House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbler Lordships , without one foot of land but what the blood of Englishmen has been the price of " ; and to speak in equally disparaging terms of their qualifications as legislators . " To judge according to the dictates of reason , " he says , " one would imagine some small faculties and endowments to be necessary for discharging such a calling ; and those such as are not usually acquired in shops and warehouses , nor found by following the plough ; and what other academies most of their Lordships have been bred in but their shops , what other arts they have been versed in but those which more // required good arms aud good shoulders than good heads , I think we are yet to be informed . Sir , we commit not the education of our children to ignorant and illiterate masters ; nay , we trust not our very horses to unskilful grooms . I beseech you , let us think it belongs to us to have some care into whose hands we commit the management of the commonwealth ; and if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rulers , to whose quality we would willingly submit , I beseech you , sir , for our credit and safety 's sake , let us seek men at least of parts and education , to whose abilities we may have some reason to give way . " Notwithstanding this vigorous assault , however , the other House was recognized by a large majority as an integral part of the government ; but the blow was severely felt . After his failure to prevent the recognition of the new peers , Cooper began to intrigue with characteristic energy and adroitness for the restoration of the Stuarts ; and so great a distrust of him was felt by the Council of State , that he was arrested and subjected to a rigorous examination . But lie had not committed any overt act , and on the 12th of September the Council voted , - " That it be humbly reported to the Parliament , that upon the examination taken before the Council or otherwise , in the business of Sir A. A. Cooper , referred to the examination of the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that there is any just ground of jealousy or imputation upon him . " Two days afterward Parliament passed a similar vote , and he was released , but only to resume his intrigues . After setting on foot various schemes to prepare the way for the return of Charles II. , he managed to procure from the restored Rump a favorable decision on his claim to sit in the House of Commons as member for IDownton , in virtue of the original election in 1640 . Having gained this point , he became one of the principal leaders of the Stuart party in Parliament ; and it was not long afterward that the conversation with Colonel Hutchinson occurred , which is recorded by Mrs. Hutchinson in the Life of her husband . According to the account given by that admirable woman and unimpeachable witness , he had insinuated himself into a particular friendship with her husband , whom he " caressed with such embraces as none but a traitor as vile as himself could have suspected . " Alarmed at the threatening aspect of affairs , and relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monk* s intentions , in order that he and others might provide for their personal safety . The result is well described by Mrs. Hutchinson . " Cooper denied to the death any intentions besides a Commonwealth ; but , ' said he , with the greatest semblance of reality that could be put on , if the violence of the people should bring the King upon us , let me be damned , body and soul , if ever I see a hair of any man 's head touched , or a penny of any man 's estate , upon this quarrel . ' This he backed with so many and such deep protestations of that kind , as made the Colonel , after his treachery was apparent , detest him of all mankind , and think himself obliged , if ever he had opportunity , to procure exemplary justice on him who was so vile a wretch as to sit himself and sentence some of those that died . And although this man joined with those who labored for the Colonel 's particular deliverance , yet the Colonel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held him to be a more execrable traitor than Monk himself . " Nevertheless Cooper had been among those who invited Monk up to London , and now acted as one of his principal advisers ; he instigated many of Monk 's movements , and , regard*. less of his own oaths and protestations , he zealously promoted every measure designed to hasten the King 's return . In the election for members of the Convention Parliament , in the early part of 1660 , he was chosen to the House of Commons for the last time , and again took his seat as one of the members for Wilts . The recall of the Stuarts had been rendered inevitable by the treachery of Monk and his adherents ; and the chief business of the Parliament was to perfect the arrangements . In this work Cooper was among the foremost . When the King 's letter was received , in the following May , he was appointed a member of the committee to prepare an answer ; and a few days afterward he was chosen one of the commissioners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament , " that his Majesty would be pleased to return and take the government of the kingdom into his hands . " On the 8th , Charles II . was solemnly proclaimed ; and the Restoration was accomplished . It was not , however , until the 29th , that the restored monarch made his public entry into London , with a degree of pomp and magnifi // cence long unknown in England . " I stood in the Strand , " says Evelyn , " and beheld it , and blessed God " ; and as he saw the magnificent array pass before him , he compared it with the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity , and thought that so joyful and bright a day had never before been seen in England . Meanwhile Cooper prosecuted his journey to Holland , which , apart from its political importance , is memorable also in his history for a personal injury occasioned by the upsetting of his carriage . At the time the injury did not seem serious , but it afterward gave him much trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important result , however , was his intimacy with John Locke . This intimacy appears to have commenced at Oxford , in 1666 , when Locke was a student of Christ-Church College . In that year Lord Ashley was in Oxford , and while there he was confined to his room by an abscess occasioned by the injury received six years before , in Holland , and , in the absence of other physicians , Locke waited on him . Locke was the younger by eleven years ; but notwithstanding this disparity in age , the politician and the philosopher were mutually attracted ; and the friendship which thus commenced continued unimpaired through life , and was of inestimable value to Lord Ashley . Like Colonel Hutchinson , Locke was deceived by the persuasive lips of the great intriguer . He failed to form a just estimate of that complex and inscrutable character , was flattered by the ostentatious deference shown by so great a statesman in asking him to draw up a con stitu- , tion for the distant colony of Carolina , and even made preparations after Shaftesbury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So blind was the great metaphysician to the vices , the treachery , and the unscrupulousness of the most adroit politician in England . Though the Life was never written , Locke 's favorable judgment of Shaftesbury has counted for much in the opinions which subsequent writers have expressed concerning him . That Sir Anthony Cooper labored with untiring zeal for the Restoration , and that he was a chief agent in bringing it about , will not be denied by any one who is familiar with the history of the period , or who has followed even this rapid sketch of // the transactions which preceded the return of the Stuarts . But that he is entitled to all the praise , or rather to all the disgrace , of having secured its consummation , can scarcely be affirmed . According to the measure of his abilities and opportunities , which were very great , he labored without cessation , and with consummate skill , to prepare the way for this result ; but without the support of the army all his best laid plans would have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large reward ; and for the next twenty years he filled a conspicuous place in the popular regard , either as Chancellor of the Exchequer , as a member of the Cabal , or as the head of an Opposition scarcely less devoid of principle than were the men to whom the restored monarch intrusted the government of the country . Immediately on Charles 's return , Cooper was admitted into the Privy Council , made Governor of the Isle of Wight , and appointed to the command of a regiment of horse . He was also named Chancellor of the Exchequer and Under-Treasurer , and was designated as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset . Nor was this all ; for a few months afterward he was raised to the peerage , by the title of Baron Ashley of Wimborne St. Giles . The nature of these honors , and the rapidity with which they were conterred , afford a standard by which we may estimate the importance attached to his services , though we must unhesitatingly reject Martyn 's assertion , that they " were conferred on him without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he became an actor , and in which he showed his readiness to serve the monarch who had so splendidly rewarded his former services , was the trial of the regicides . With a brazen impudence of which history happily presents few parallels , he did not scruple to sit in judgment , and even to pass sentence of death , on his old associates . He had taken an active part in the Civil War , and helped to drive out the Stuarts ; he had served both in a civil and a military capacity against them ; and he had professed a great friendship for the popular leaders . But these considerations had not prevented him from intriguing to bring the Stuarts back without any security against future misgovernment , and they did not now prevent him from helping to punish the men whom he had formerly aided and abetted. // During the next six or seven years he was sedulous in the discharge of his duties at the Exchequer , and as a member of Parliament , and he appears to have waited with unwonted moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again as the restless and unscrupulous leader of a faction . In Parliament he had the consistency to oppose the Corporation Bill of 1661 , by which all persons who held office in any municipal corporation were required to declare on oath their belief " that it is not lawful , upon any pretence whatsoever , to take up arms against the King , " and their abhorrence of " that traitorous position of taking arms by his authority against his person , or against those commissioned by him . " This bill , and several others equally hostile to the liberty of the subject , were carried through the House of Commons with great precipitancy ; but the opposition in the Upper House was so strenuous , that Charles was compelled to adjourn Parliament . During the recess , the court zealously propagated a report that a plot against the King existed in several of the counties ; and by the help of this contrivance they were enabled to carry the Corporation Bill and the Uniformity Bill through the House of Lords , notwithstanding the opposition of Southampton , Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley performed a highly creditable act , in opposition to the King 's wishes , in opposing and condemning the unfortunate and disgraceful sale of Dunkirk to the French . But in the mean time , to preserve his favor at court , he gave a warm support to an act amendatory of the Act of Uniformity , by which a dispensing power was conferred on the King , who was authorized " to dispense , by letters patent under the Great Seal , with the Act of Uniformity , or the penalties in the said law imposed . " On the other hand , this bill was stoutly opposed by Lord Clarendon ; and finally the measure was dropped , chiefly through Clarendon 's influence in the House of Commons , which was at that time very great . In his capacity of Chancellor of the Exchequer , Ashley labored with much zeal to promote the interests of trade and commerce , and he showed himself strongly opposed to granting monopolies , and even to permitting the existence in some flagrant instances of those already granted . But his official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Exchequer now holds ; and it must be conceded that at this time he exerted comparatively little influence in determining the foreign or domestic policy of the country . On the 16th of May , 1667* , his wife 's uncle , the Earl of Southampton , died , and a vacancy consequently occurred in the office of Lord Treasurer . It was at once determined to put the office into commission , and , after some hesitation on the King 's part , Ashley was appointed one of the five commissioners , uniting his new appointment with his former office at the Exchequer . From this period his political importance rapidly increased ; and there can be little doubt that , almost immediately after the withdrawal of Southampton 's influence , he began to intrigue for Clarendon 's overthrow . This event occurred at the close of the following August ; and it has always been believed that the Chancellor 's downfall was precipitated by Ashley 's exertions . It should be mentioned to his credit , however , that he strongly opposed the impeachment by which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallen minister . It must have given much annoyance to Ashley to find that he was not likely to grasp the splendid prize of the Chancellorship , - long the object of his ambition . But Charles had little confidence in the wily politician , and Sir Orlando Bridgman , at that time Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas , was appointed to sit in the marble chair as Lord Keeper . Ashley was obliged to content himself with the increasing power which he now began to wield as one of the Lords of the Treasury ; and one of his first acts , his support of the Triple Alliance , was well adapted to give him popularity with the nation . Unfortunately , however , for his reputation , he helped soon afterward to break " this triple bond , " in order to please the King ; and none of his apologists have been able to defend him successfully against the charge of having sacrificed the interests of England to his personal ambition . About the same time he drew up and submitted to the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is not open to the charge of being inspired by personal motives . In it he refers to a conversation with Charles on " the decay of // land-rents and trade , and the remedies of it , " and then proceeds to set forth under various heads his own views on this important subject , arguing that of late years the quantity of land fit for cultivation had greatly increased , while the population had been greatly diminished by the civil war , the plague , and emigration to America . Assuming this diminution of the population to be the cause of the existing evils , he proposes as a remedy the adoption of certain measures which he thinks will invite immigration , and afford protection to all persons who may choose to settle in England . These he enumerates as follows - that no person shall be admitted to any office , ecclesiastical , military , or civil , except those who approve themselves conformists to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England , and pay all tithes and church rates ; that all nonconformists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have full liberty to worship in any public place they can procure ; that a general act of naturalization shall be passed , granting permission to every artificer or tradesman to carry on his art or trade in any part of the kingdom ; and that there shall be a public register of all transactions in real estate . Though these measures were not carried out , they show how accurately Ashley understood the wants of the kingdom , and afford additional proof of the folly of the government which rejected them . In regard to another matter , his support of the Declaration of Indulgence , it has sometimes been claimed that his course was equally praiseworthy ; but this claim can not be sustained . Even if the arguments of his admirers were sound , they would only show that in his support of the Declaration he added treachery to contempt for the Constitution . That the Declaration was an unconstitutional act , and that the Papists were the only persons who could derive any benefit from it , will not be denied by any candid reader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other writers , that Ashley , knowing this , and having also discovered with extraordinary skill and sagacity that Charles was a Papist in secret , gave his support to the Declaration , with the sole purpose of inflaming the Protestant zeal of the kingdom to the passage of still more severe laws against the Papists . A more *tterly // untenable hypothesis can scarcely be conceived ; and it is sufficient to dismiss it with a bare statement of the absurdities which it involves . Ashley was at once one of the most adroit and most ambitious of statesmen ; and in this case the obvious explanation is undoubtedly the true explanation . He saw that Charles wished to favor the Romish Church , and that consequently the direct way to his favor was by relaxing the laws against its members ; and perceiving this , he upheld the Declaration simply as a means of advancing his own fortunes . In the beginning of 1672 occurred the shutting up of the Exchequer , - a measure proposed by Sir Thomas Clifford and condemned by Ashley , though he afterward derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition are well stated in a short paper written at the time , and were as follows - that it was contrary to common justice and the express statutes of the realm , that it was against his Majesty 's promises and declarations , that it would amaze mankind and ruin thousands of poor persons , that it would depress trade , and that it would soon be known over Europe , and would cause great joy to the King 's enemies . The measure was , however , carried into execution , to the great and general dissatisfaction of the public , and without any corresponding advantage to the King ; and in order to restore the public credit , Ashley soon came forward with an expedient which was the immediate cause of his elevation to the Chancellorship . This was an application to the Chancellor for injunctions to prevent the prosecution of any suits against the bankers . A more unconstitutional or tyrannical scheme could scarcely have been devised , but it answered Ashley 's purpose ; for J3ridgman refused to grant the injunctions , and was promptly removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little time before , as a reward for other services , was immediately raised to the vacant office as Lord Chancellor . The new Chancellor brought to the discharge of his duties only a very slight acquaintance with legal science , and no familiarity with the rules adopted in equity proceedings . Yet it has been asserted that few if any of his decrees were reversed ; and he certainly managed to make himself very acceptable to the King , who is reported to have said , " My // Chancellor knows more law than all my judges , and more divinity than all my bishops . " His reputation as a judge has , in truth , stood high , probably on account of the character which Dryden interpolated in the second edition of " Absalom and Achitophel " - " Yet fame deserved no enemy can grudge , The statesman we abhor , but praise the judge ; In Israel 's courts ne'er sat an Ahethdin With more discerning eyes or hands more clean , Unbribed , unsought the wretched to redress , Swift of despatch and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point than iDryden , however , Lord Campbell , pronounces a very different opinion , and says , that , " except being free from gross corruption , he was the worst judge that had ever sat in the court . " Much weight has been laid by Shaftesbury 's apologists on the pretended fact that his hands were unstained by bribery , - that in an age when ministers and legislators , and even the King himself , drew pay from a foreign sovereign , he never touched French gold ; and he certainly is entitled to great praise on this last account . He was quick in the despatch of business , and though he committed some absurd mistakes in regard to forms , it is probable that his sagacious intellect prevented him from falling into any grave errors of fact , and from pronouncing any unjust decision where private suitors alone were concerned . By various devices he avoided rendering a decision on the validity of the injunctions , which he had recommended previously to his elevation to the wool-sack , and with his customary shrewdness he adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of a judge in regard to political questions is shown plainly enough in his charge to one of the Barons of the Exchequer . " Let not the King 's prerogative and the law , " he said , " be two things with you for the King 's prerogative is law , and the principal part of it , and in maintaining that you maintain the law . " Before the meeting of Parliament Shaftesbury , in order to strengthen himself in the Lower House , issued writs under the Great Seal for filling the vacancies which had occurred since // the prorogation . This bold expedient was not without the sanction of some precedents , but it excited much indignation among the members of the popular party , and as soon as the Commons met , they unseated all the members thus chosen . At the opening of the session , after the King had delivered the customary speech , the new Chancellor rose and addressed the two Houses with a very remarkable harangue , which must be regarded as furnishing the key to his policy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knights , citizens , and burgesses of the House of Commons , " he said in opening , - " the King hath spoken so fully , so excellently well , and so like himself , that you are not to expect much from me . There is not a word in his speech that hath not its full weight , and I dare with assurance say will have its full effect with you . " He then spoke briefly of the delay in summoning Parliament , and passed to a justification of the war with Holland , which he advocated in language that gave great offence to the country . " You judged aright , " he said , " that at any rate Delendct est Carthago , that government is to be brought down ; and therefore the King may well say to you , It is your war . ' " In another place he is scarcely less warlike . " And if , after this , " he says , " you suffer them to get up , let this be remembered , - the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and inclination . " To the shutting up of the Exchequer , and the grant of injunctions in the suits against the bankers , he refers in passing , apparently for no other purpose than to find in them additional reasons why Parliament should vote his Majesty a large supply . . The Declaration of Indulgence he praises as warmly as though he had first suggested it , alleging , " that no reasonable scruple can be made by any good man . " He then renews his plea for a large supply , and concludes with the most fulsome adulation of both King and Parliament . The whole passage is too long to be cited ; but a few words at the end will afford a very just idea of it . " Let us bless God and the King that our religion is safe ; that the Church of England is the care of our prince ; that Parlianients are safe ; that our properties and liberties are safe . What more hath a good Englishman to ask , but that this King may long reign ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * // and people may never be dissolved ? " The amazing effrontery of this speech has not escaped the notice and censure of subsequent writers ; and even Shaftesbury himself felt ashamed of it . At this moment it is certain that he was eager to win the first place in the King 's confidence ; but a very few weeks afterward he adopted , from some unexplained cause , a radically different policy , and began to intrigue with the popular party . He secretly stirred up the Commons against the Declaration of Indulgence , and in the House of Lords he frequently thwarted his colleagues in the government . He zealously supported the Test Act , which was now brought forward in the House of Commons , and was aimed directly at the members of the IRomish Church . Notwithstanding a strenuous opposition , the bill passed both Houses , and became a law , to Shaftesbury 's great delight . In consequence of its passage the name of the Duke of York , afterward James II. , was stricken from the list of Privy Councillors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Clifford was forced to give up the white staff of Treasurer ; and a number of other Papists of lesser note also lost their offices . Though Charles had not ventured to refuse his assent to this famous law , which remained on the statute-book through all the vicissitudes of party for more than a hundred and fifty years afterward , he took care to adjourn Parliament before any other measures of a similar character could be perfected . Parliament met again toward the end of October , but the Country party showed so much*activity and spirit that the session was twice prorogued within a fortnight ; and in order to punish Shaftesbury for the part which he had recently taken , he was soon afterward deprived of the seals . He had held office for little less than a year , and during that brief period he had rendered himself obnoxious to each of the two great parties in turn . Yet it is a noteworthy fact , that at the period of his dismissal he possessed a much larger influence than he had ever before enjoyed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period to the end of his career he was the most unscrupulous and factious adversary that any government in England has had to encounter ; and his far-seeing // LORD SHAFTESBURY . sagacity was constantly strained to the utmost to give effect to the successive blows which he aimed at his enemies . It is true that in the end he fell a victim to his own rashness ; but for a time his power and influence knew scarcely any limits . The Parliamentary session of 1674 was suffered to continue for only a few weeks ; but during this period the new spirit which Shaftesbury had inspired was rampant . Numerous measures of hostility to the court were introduced in the House of Commons , and pressed with so much vigor and success , that Charles was glad to have recourse to his old expedient of a prorogation before any of them had reached their last stage . Soon after the commencement of the next session , in April , 1675 , the ministry brought into the House of Lords a bill entitled " An Act to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This measure was designed to give additional legislative sanction to the Church heresy of passive obedience , and was a fatal blow at the liberty of Parliament , as well as of every person holding any office , civil , military , or ecclesiastical , all of whom were required to take oath that they would not , " at any time , endeavor the alteration of government either in Church or State . " Shaftesbury was the principal opponent of the bill , which he resisted with his accustomed zeal ; " and yet , " says Bishop Burnet , " though his words were watched , so that it was resolved to have sent him to the Tower if any one word had fallen from him that had made him liable to such a censure , he spoke both with so much boldness and so much caution , that , though he provoked the court extremely , no advantage could be taken against him . " In consequence of the violent opposition which the bill encountered , and of a well-grounded objection that " no care was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church , " the form of the oath was changed so as to read , " I do swear , that I will not endeavor to alter the Protestant religion , or the government either of Church or State . " The vagueness of this declaration furnished a congenial theme for Shaftesbury 's subtile intellect ; and after taking exception in one of his speeches to the oath on general grounds , lie very pertinently asked , " Where are the boundaries , or where shall we find how much is meant by the Prot // estant religion ? " Curiously enough , his opponents did not perceive the force of this question , and by their own folly they furnished him with the opportunity of an easy victory . " Tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streets of Askelon , " Lord Keeper Finch exclaimed , " that a Lord of so great parts and eminence , and professing himself a member of the Church of England , does not know what is meant by the Protestant religion . " And some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Protestant religion is comprehended in the Thirty-nine Articles , the Liturgy , the Catechism , the Homilies , and the Canons . " Nothing could have suited Shaftesbury 's purpose better than such a reply . He rose immediately , and declared that he had so confirmed a belief in the Protestant religion , " that he hoped he should burn for the witness of it , if Providence should call him to it ; but he might , perhaps , think some things not necessary which they accounted essential , - nay , he might think some things not true , or agreeable to the Scripture , that they might call doctrines of the Church . " He then proceeded to show that the Thirty-nine Articles could not be regarded as a standard of orthodoxy , both on account of the obscurity and contradictory character of some of the Articles , and because others " had been preached and written against by men of great favor , power , and preferment in the Church " ; and that neither the Liturgy , the Catechism , the Book of Homilies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reply was unanswerable , and greatly annoyed the Bishops . " I wonder when he will have done preaching , " one of them whispered to a neighbor . Shaftesbury heard it , and , turning round , replied , in a low but audible tone , " When I am made a Bishop , my Lord " ; and then continued his speech . But all his wit and eloquence were powerless against the more persuasive appeal of the secret-service money , which was scattered through both Houses with a lavish hand ; and finally the bill passed the Upper House , and was sent down to the Commons , where its success seemed certain . But Shaftesbury 's genius was equal to the emergency , and he determined even now to prevent the passage of the bill . His new scheme was not indeed creditable to him , and can be justified only by // those who are prepared to maintain the profligate maxim , that " all is fair in war and politics . " It was prosecuted , however , with characteristic energy , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel between the two Houses on a question of privilege , in the excitement of which everything else was forgotten . An appeal had been entered in the House of Lords from a decree of the Court of Chancery , in a case in which a member of the Lower House was the defendant ; and , availing himself of this circumstance , Shaftesbury managed to arouse the mutual jealousy of the two Houses to such an extent that legislation on all other subjects was at once postponed . By his secret instigation the House of Commons resolved , by a nearly unanimous vote , that it was a breach of privilege to serve a summons on any member to appear at the bar of the House of Lords ; while Shaftesbury himself stoutly upheld the right of the Peers to hear appeals in equity , even when members of the Lower House were parties in interest . The Commons next committed two of the appellants to the Tower , and likewise ordered the arrest of the barristers who had argued the appeal before the Lords . Thus far Shaftesbury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this act to push the excitement to a still greater height . Exasperated by his fervid eloquence , the Lords voted that the prisoners should be immediately set at liberty , in disregard of any action by the Commons . In pursuance of this vote , their executive officer , the Usher of the Black Rod , rescued the barristers by force from the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms , by whom the unfortunate lawyers were held under the authority of the Commons . The Lower House was greatly incensed at this indignity to their representative , and a vote was passed , by the active exertions of Shaftesbury 's friends , that , " if this outrage was submitted to , not only the privileges of the Commons , but the liberties of England , were forever subverted . " The Speaker himself participated in the excitement of the members ; and soon afterward , seeing one of the barristers , Pemberton , for some time Chief Justice of the King 's Bench , and still more famous as one of the counsel for the seven Bishops , he arrested him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodged in prison , - an exploit for which the Commons voted him special thanks . // Matters were rapidly growing worse , when the King prorogued Parliament for a period of four months , with the hope of putting an end to these contentions . But as soon as the new session opened , Shaftesbury brought forward a motion for the assignment of a day for hearing the appeal ; and in the debate which followed , he delivered a very powerful speech on the whole subject at issue . " My Lords , " he said with great solemnity as he rose , " our all is at stake , and therefore you must give me leave to speak freely before we part with it . " He then proceeded to answer the arguments of the other party , artfully opposing any concession on the part of the Lords , since " this matter is no less than your whole judicature , and your judicature is the life and soul of the dignity of the peerage of England , " and if they did not settle the question then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the public business was finished . " Pray , my Lords , " he continued , " forgive me if , on this occasion , I put you in mind of committee dinners , and the scandal of it ; as , also , those droves of ladies that attend all causes . It was come to that pass that men hired or borrowed of their friends handsome sisters or handsome daughters to deliver their petitions ; but yet for all this I must say that your judgments have been sacred , unless in one or two causes , - and those we owe most to that Bench the Bishops from whence we now apprehend most danger . " He then briefly expressed his fears , that , if the Houses were to come to an agreement , it would enable the King to bring about a general European peace , which was much to be deprecated on account of the benefit to France . In conclusion , hQ made a truculent attack on the Bishops , as persons who were not affected by arguments the most convincing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous doctrine " that monarchy is of divine right , " - a doctrine which neither the Jesuits nor the Popish clergy had ever maintained , and which was professed only by " some of the Episcopal clergy " of the British isles . " In a word , " he said , " if this doctrine be true , our Magna Charta is of no use ; our laws are but rules among ourselves during the King 's pleasure . Monarchy , if of divine right , can not be bounded or limited by human laws , - nay , what is more , can not bind itself ; and all our // claims of right by the law or constitution of the government , all the jurisdiction and privilege of this House , all the rights and privilege of the House of Commons , all the properties and liberties of the people , ar*e to give way , not only to the interest , but the will and pleasure , of the crown . " This speech has come down to us in a very full report , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is bold , pointed , and direct , with not a few passages of stirring eloquence , and we need feel no surprise at the effect which it produced on those who heard it . His resolution for hearing the appeal was carried by a large majority ; and in the House of Commons the excitement became as great as it was before the recess . His measures having thus far been crowned with success , Shaftesbury next induced one of his friends in the Upper House to bring forward a motion for an Address to the King , praying for a dissolution of the Parliament ; and this motion was defeated by a majority of only two votes . Under these circumstances Charles determined to prorogue Parliament for the term of fifteen months . Shaftesbury had succeeded in preventing the passage of the obnoxious bill , but he had failed in his attempt to bring about a dissolution , - an object which he had scarcely less at heart . As soon as Parliament met again , in February , 1677 , Buckingham , who had also become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the ground that the last prorogation was null and void , and that therefore the Parliament must be regarded as virtually dissolved . In this view he was powerfully supported by Shaftesbury , who was probably the real author of the objection . But their course found less favor than they had anticipated ; and the government was strong enough to carry a resolution that Shaftesbury , who was looked upon as the chief offender , and his principal supporters , the Duke of Buckingham , the Earl of Salisbury , and Lord Wharton , should be committed to the Tower during the pleasure of the Ring and the House of Lords , as a punishment for having brought forward a doctrine so insulting to the King and the Parliament . The minor offenders were released after a short confinement , on acknowledging their error . This Shaftesbury refused to do , and in June , // 1677 , he sued out a writ of habeas corpus ; but the Court of King 's Bench declined to take cognizance of it , on the ground that the Tower was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the generosity of the King and the Duke of York , and he also petitioned the House for his release with no better success ; and it was not until February , 1678 , that he obtained his liberty . Before being restored to his privileges as a peer , he was required to repeat a mortifying apology after the Lord Chancellor - " I , Anthony , Earl of Shaftesbury , do acknowledge that my endeavoring to maintain that the Parliament is dissolved was an illadvised action , for which I humbly beg the pardon of the King 's Majesty , and of this most honorable House ; and I do also acknowledge that my bringing of a habeas corpus in the King 's Bench during this session was a high violation of your Lordship 's privileges , and a great aggravation of my former offence , for which I likewise most humbly beg the pardon of this most honorable House . " To such abasement was Shaftesbury reduced , before he could again enter the field of active partisan warfare . He soon , however , regained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Lords , at a full session , passed a resolution which , after referring to the order for the committal of Shaftesbury and his associates , and the subsequent proceedings in relation thereto , sets forth that " it is ordered , decreed , and adjudged , that the said order and proceedings concerning the said Lords were unparliamentary from the beginning , and in the whole progress thereof ; and therefore are all ordered to be vacated ( by virtue of this judgment ) in the Journal books of this House , that the same , or any of them , may never be drawn into precedent for the future . " Shaftesbury 's release was hailed with satisfaction by his friends , though his influence was much diminished by his long imprisonment and by his subsequent humiliation . But , fortunately for his ambitious spirit , an event soon afterward occurred , which enabled him not only to recover all that he had lost , but to become far more formidable than he had hitherto been . This was the pretended discovery of the Popish Plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , // indeed , been asserted that Shaftesbury himself invented this stupendous falsehood ; but though he readily took advantage of it to promote his own ends , there is not a particle of proof that he first conceived it . With his accustomed sagacity , he saw that it might be used to torment the government , and he took the whole thing into his own hands . As soon as Parliament met , he brought forward a series of measures designed to crush the Catholics ; and he also introduced a motion for an Address to the King for the removal of the Duke of York from his presence and counsels , which failed of success . He succeeded , however , in carrying resolutions for a committee to inquire into the Plot , for the removal of Popish recusants , and declaring that " there hath been and still is a damnable and hellish plot continued and carried on by Popish recusants for assassinating the King , subverting the government , and rooting out and destroying the Protestant religion , " besides a bill for preventing members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government was powerless to resist the rising storm which Shaftesbury had set in motion , and which he now ruled at pleasure ; and after a motion to impeach the Lord Treasurer , IDanby , had been carried in the House of Commons , Charles , as a last resort , dissolved the Parliament , in January , 1679 . It had sat for eighteen years , and notwithstanding the grovelling subserviency of its earlier acts , it had passed through a transformation very much like Shaftesbury 's ; and at its dissolution it was one of the most unmanageable bodies with which any English minister has ever had to deal . The new elections were in general unfavorable to the court , and Shaftesbury 's party received a considerable accession of numbers . In the choice of Speaker of the House of Commons the ministerial candidate was defeated ; and the impeachment of Danby was soon revived as a matter of course . Against this unjustifiable proceeding Charles in vain opposed a full pardon under the Great Seal . Urged on by Shaftesbury , the motion for an impeachment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor did the activity of Shaftesbury stop here . He next brought forward a motion for an inquiry into the state of the nation , and supported it in a vio // Lent speech , setting forth the great dangers which threatened the Protestant faith , and pointing to the condition of affairs in Scotland and Ireland as a pregnant illustration of the evils against which Parliament must provide . It was in this conjuncture that Sir William Temple suggested to the King his scheme of a new council in place of the existing Privy Council and Ministry , in the hope that it might give peace to the country , and inaugurate a new era of good government . This body was to be composed of thirty members , of whom fifteen were to hold the principal offices of state , ten more were to be selected from the House of Lords , and the remaining five were to be taken from the House of Commons ; and according to the new plan all the measures of the government were to be sanctioned by the council . The scheme proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was now eagerly tried by Charles . In the selection of the members , important differences of opinion arose between his Majesty and Sir William , the latter of whom vehemently objected to the admission of Shaftesbury , which Charles deemed indispensable to the success of the experiment . The result was that Shaftesbury was not only admitted , but was also made President of the Council . If Charles expected by this appointment to weaken Shaftesbury 's influence , or to render him less factious , he was soon disappointed . Shaftesbury determined to use his newly acquired power to promote his own advantage , and to carry the measures which he regarded as necessary for maintaining the Protestant ascendency , and for securing the liberty of the subject against the encroachments of the crown . He accordingly drew up , and caused to be introduced in the House of Commons , " An Act for the better , securing the Liberty of the Subject , " which is now known as the Habeas Corpus Act , and is universally regarded as one of the chief muniments of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but in the House of Lords it was violently resisted , and the motion for a conference with the Commons on one of the amendments introduced by the Lords , was carried only by a miscount , which gave a majority of two votes in favor of the conference . The Commons receded , and the bill became // a law . This was the only measure of Shaftesbury which was carried through Parliament at this session ; but it is one the importance of which can not be overrated . Other important measures , indeed , had been brought forward , and some progress had been made with them , when Charles abruptly put an end to the session by a prorogation , which was soon afterward followed by a dissolution . The elections again turned out unfavorably for the government , and without a moment 's hesitation the King determined , before Parliament met , to postpone the session for a period of twelve months by a new prorogation , - a step which came very near breaking up the newly organized council . This bold measure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency , and by the erasure of his name from the list of Councillors , Though deprived of office , the factious patriot did not permit his zeal against the Catholics to grow cold . On the 5th of November , he celebrated the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot by a procession , at the head of which was the effigy of Guy Fawkes , with other symbols suited to keep alive the popular hatred of Papacy . Twelve days later he caused the anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth to be commemorated by another procession , with still more inflammatory devices . He next procured petitions from nearly every part of England ' , praying that Parliament might be immediately summoned ; but to these petitions counter-addresses were at once opposed by the Court party . Indignant at the failure of these expedicuts for compelling the King to call Parliament together , and at the same time elated by his vast influence over the people , Shaftesbury determined to go a step farther . Accordingly , on the 26th of June , 1680 , in company with several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court of King 's Bench , and there presented to the grand jury a formal charge against the Duke of York as a Popish recusant . But before the jury had investigated the matter , and while many charges against private persons were waiting for an examination , the Chief Justice sent for the jury , and , by an unusual exercise of authority , dismissed them . By these and other schemes the popular leaders managed to keep up the excitement until Parliament met. // As soon as the session opened , the House of Commons passed a series of inflammatory resolutions , to the effect , that efficient measures ought to be taken " to suppress Popery and prevent a Popish succession " ; that the Duke of York 's adhesion to the ilomish Church had given great encouragement to the plots against the King and the Protestant religion ; that in defence of the King and the Protestant religion they would stake their lives and fortunes , and that , if his Majesty should come to a violent death , they would " revenge it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the discharging of the grand jury by any judge , before the end of the term , assizes , or sessions , while matters are under their consideration and not presented , is arbitrary , illegal , destructive to public justice , a manifest violation of his oath , and is a means to subvert the fundamental laws of the kingdom . " Having thus prepared the way for the blow which he had long meditated , Shaftesbury now caused a bill to be brought into the Commons for excluding the Duke of York from the succession to the crown . The bill passed the Lower House with little opposition ; but in the Lords it was thrown out on the first reading by a vote of more than two to one , after a fierce debate , which lasted nearly till midnight , and at which Charles II . was present . In this debate Shaftesbury of course took the leading part ; but the speech which he delivered has not come down to us . Another speech , however , on the same general subject , delivered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circulated to the extent of three hundred thousand copies . Probably some things were added in the printed speech ; but if the speech as spoken was not very different from that in print , it must be pronounced one of the most remarkable speeches ever uttered in Parliament . It would be impossible to give any adequate idea of its bold and factious tone by a mere analysis ; and we must confine ourselves to two or three brief extracts . " There must be , " he said near the commencement , " in plain English , my Lords , a change . We must neither have Popish wife , nor Popish favorite , nor Popish mistress , nor Popish counsellor at court , nor any new convert . " And as if he had not gone far enough in this declaration , he elsewhere exclaimed " My Lords , it is a very hard thing to say we can not trust the King , // and that we have already been deceived so often , that we see plainly the apprehension of discontent is no argument at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , that the people have the greatest inclinations to love , yet we must say he is such an one as no story affords us a parallel of . " After much more in the same spirit and equally pointed , he concluded by a direct appeal to his Majesty : " However , we know who hears us ; and I am glad of this , that your Lordships have dealt so honorably and so clearly in the King 's presence , that he can not say he wants a right state of things . He hath it before him , and may take counsel as he thinks fit . " In pursuance of an intimation in this speech , he soon afterward brought into the House of Lords a bill for dissolving the King 's marriage ; but this scandalous proceeding met with so little favor , that he allowed the bill to drop out of notice as quietly as possible . Some of his other measures were more successful , and , before the dissolution , he had caused to be introduced in the Lower House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing that the judges should hold their offices and draw their salaries during good behavior , providing for a Protestant Association to defend the King and keep out the Duke of York , and for making the raising of money without the consent of Parliament an act of high treason , besides carrying an impeachment against Chief Justice Scroggs for illegally discharging the grand jury the year before , and sending up an Address of the House of Commons to the King for the removal from office of the Earl of Halifax , who had been his chief opponent in the debates on the Exclusion Bill . Before all these measures could be perfected , Parliament was dissolved , and a new Parliament was summoned to meet at Oxford . Against the meeting of Parliament in this unusual place , Shaftesbury and fifteen other members of the House of Lords , of whom the Duke of Monmouth was the most prominent , immediately petitioned the King , alleging , that neither the Lords nor the Commons could sit in safety at Oxford , where they would be " daily exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus prevented from enjoying full liberty of debate ; that there were no accommodations for the great 36 * // number of persons who would be present ; and that the witnesses against the Popish Lords , and the judges who had been impeached , or were to be impeached , could neither bear the expense of going there , nor trust themselves to the protection of a Parliament which was not itself free . This petition was much applauded by the popular party , and London and many other places presented their thanks to the Lords by whom it was signed ; but it met with no favor at court , and no attention was paid to its prayer that the place of meeting might be changed to London . The session was opened therefore at Oxford , on the 21st of March ; and notwithstanding Shaftesbury 's loud professions of insecurity , he lost not a moment in resuming his attacks on the government . The Exclusion Bill was again brought forward , together with a second bill for repealing an act passed in the reign of Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundays in their respective parish churches , - a bill for the same purpose which had passed in the last session having been surreptitiously removed from the House of Lords by the King 's command . These measures , and the disputes between the two Houses as to the manner of proceeding against a wretch named Fitzharris , who had been put forward by the court to ridicule the Popish Plot , convinced Charles that he had nothing to hope from this Parliament ; and , eight days after the commencement of the session , he abruptly dissolved it , with the declaration that " all the world may see we are not like to have a good end when the divisions at the beginning are such . " Though it is impossible to commend Shaftesbury 's course , or the means which he employed , it must be conceded that his services in opposing the tyranny of Charles were of vast importance , and were not unfrequently attended by the most beneficial results . The court had long seen clearly enough that he was by far the most formidable antagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if he were crushed , no one remained to fill his place . They determined , therefore , without further delay , to break down his influence , and to ruin him utterly ; and on the 2d of the following July he was arrested on a charge of high treason , at Thanet House , Aldersgate Street , his city residence . His papers were seized , // and he was hurried off to Whitehall , and , after an examination before the King and Council , committed to the Tower . As he was carried along , the populace gathered around him and loudly expressed their sympathy . " God bless your Lordship ! " exclaimed one of the crowd , " and deliver you from your enemies . " With his accustomed readiness , Shaftesbury turned toward the man , and replied , with a triumphant smile : " I thank you , sir , but I have nothing to fear ; they have much , therefore pray God to deliver them from me . " A few days afterward one of the Popish Lords who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surprise at seeing him in such a place , and asked how he came to be there . " I have been indisposed lately with an ague , and am come to take some Jesuits ' powder , " was the reply . While a prisoner , he made repeated applications to the Court of King 's Bench that he might be brought to trial or be bailed , for no indictment against him had yet been prepared ; but in each instance his application was refused by the Chief Justice , Pemberton , under the old pretext that the Tower was not within the jurisdiction of the court . Meanwhile no effort was spared to hunt up evidence against him , and to spread abroad a belief of his guilt . For this purpose the immortal pen of Dryden was called into the service , and the greatest political poem in our language was published just a week before the case was given to the grand jury . Innumerable prose pamphlets were also circulated . Pemberton perverted the law . When the indictment was laid before the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was any ground of suspicion against the prisoner ; and , in violation of the uniform practice in such cases , and against the protest of the jury , the examination was conducted in public , that the authority of the Chief Justice might be exerted to insure the finding of a bill . But all these precautions failed ; the jury had been selected by Whig sheriffs ; and the result was that the bill was ignored . As the officer read the indorsement , a shout burst forth from the waiting crowd , which even the presence of the judges could not restrain . Out of doors , bonfires , illuminations , and the frequent drinking of Shaftesbury 's health , bore witness to the general joy . Nor was this all . A // medal was immediately struck , bearing on one side the bust of the Protestant Earl , as he was called , with the inscription , " Antonio Comiti de Shaftesbury , " and on the reverse the sun emerging from a cloud and shining on the Tower and the city , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Leetamur . " To ridicule this outburst of popular joy , Dryden 's genius was again called into service , and Charles himself suggested the main idea of the poem . " The Medal " was speedily produced , and , as a truculent political satire , is inferior only to " Absalom and Achitophel . " " Of all our antic sights and pageantry , Which English idiots run in crowds to see , The Polish Medal hears the prize alone : A monster more the favorite of the town Than either fairs or theatres have shown . Never did art so well with nature strive ; Nor ever idol seemed so much alive : So like the man , - so golden to the sight , So base within , so counterfeit and light . " The publication of the poem , however , only gave greater notoriety to its subject , and soon every Whig wore the medal as a party badge . Notwithstanding the refusal of the grand jury to return a bill against Shaftesbury , he was detained a prisoner in the Tower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1682 , that he was released , and a gain took up his residence in the city . But his power was gone ; a prosecution which he had instituted against the principal witnesses who testified before the grand jury was removed from Middlesex to another county where the government was more powerful , and he was accordingly compelled to abandon it ; the election of Sheriffs of London and Middlesex was so conducted as to secure the return of the court candidates ; and a minion of the court was fraudulently declared elected Lord Mayor of London . Under these circumstances , it is not surprising that he lost his confidence in the weapons which he had previously used with so much success against the government , and that he joined in the plots for its overthrow . Added to this he was now suffering from great physical pain and debility , and from a morbid fear of being again committed to prison . // It had been his intention to bring forward the Duke of Monmouth , the eldest of the King 's natural children , as successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he now went a step farther , and determined to do by force what he had failed to do by constitutional means . He plotted with iRussell and Sidney , and with West , lRumsey , and Ferguson ; and , impatient of delay , he went farther and faster than his associates wished to go . But he was closely watched by the court spies , and often found it necessary to change his place of residence . At length , in November , 1682 , he received information which satisfied him that all his intrigues had been discovered , and that his only safety was in immediate flight . He accordingly quitted his place of concealment , which was searched only a few hours after his departure , and , disguising himself as a Presbyterian minister , he left London in the night , accompanied by one of his friends who was also disguised . They proceeded directly to ilarwich , where he remained several days , narrowly escaping detection , and at length succeeded in embarking for Amsterdam . Here he was kindly received , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted on their country , admitted him to the rights of citizenship , and hung his portrait in the City Hall . But he did not long enjoy these honors . He was soon afterward attacked with a severe fit of the gout , which terminated fatally on the 21st of January , 168g . He was not much above sixty-one years of age , but his irregular life , and the accident which happened to him on his first visit to Holland , as well as his fiery energy and restless activity , had broken down a constitution naturally good , and made him prematurely old . His new countrymen testified their grief at his death by going into mourning , and by directing that no tolls or fees should be levied on his corpse or his personal effects , in any place through which they might pass on the way to England . His body was borne from these friendly shores in a ship hung in black , and on its landing at Poole in IDorsetsliire , Shaftesbury 's native county , it was received by all the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wimborne St. Giles , where the funeral was solemnized ; and , forgetting all their past animosities , friends and foes alike joined the procession // Oct. which attended the remains of the great politician to their final resting-place . In the long line of English statesmen , from Lord Burleigh to Sir Robert Peel , there is no more conspicuous name than that of Shaftesbury . There are in that splendid catalogue men to whose lofty Virtue and pure patriotism his profligacy and factiousn*ss present only a sad contrast , - men of a more profound acquaintance with the principles of the English Constitution , of more consistent opinions , and who occupied a foremost place in public life for a longer period . But there is not one who possessed a more acute or a more penetrating intellect than Shaftesbury , who exercised a larger influence than that which he sometimes wielded , or who identified his name with any measure of more transcendent importance than the Habeas Corpus Act . At the same time , his course through life was characterized by unrivalled sagacity in the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his keen eye the changes of political fortune were more quickly revealed than they were to any of his contemporaries , and he seemed always to guide , rather than to follow , the current of popularity ; or , as Butler very happily expresses it in Hudibras , he " got the start of every state , And at a change ne'er came too late . " As an orator he was pointed in attack and skilful in defence ; and , if we except Halifax and Bolingbroke , he had till the time of Chatham few or no rivals as an eloquent and effective speaker . Very few of his speeches , it is true , have come down to us , except in imperfect and fragmentary reports ; but even in these there are many passages of fervid eloquence , which , when first spoken , must have thrilled every auditor . Shaftesbury 's personal character presents little that is attractive , except uniform courtesy in private life . His licentiousness was notorious even in that profligate age , and the character of Antonio in Otway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , though some of his biographers have ventured , in the face of undoubted facts , to describe him in very different language , and as being free from the gross immoralities of his time . It has often been asserted by them , // that he never took bribes ; and this is probably true as to his dealings with Louis XIV . and the agents of France , and indeed as to all his transactions in the latter part of his life . But it is not true that his hands were always clean , or that he always bore the reputation of unchallenged integrity . Pepys records one instance within his own knowledge in which Shaftesbury took money as a bribe ; and there were doubtless many other cases of a similar character . Under date of May 20th , 1666 , the laborious Secretary writes , in his Diary , with much simplicity and honesty , that Mr. Yeabsly " hath this day presented my Lord Ashley with ? 100 to bespeak his friendship to him in his accounts now before us ; and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad , as to bribes , as what the world says of him . " The next day the worthy diarist returns to the subject , and writes : " It is stupendous to see how favorably and yet closely my Lord Ashley carries himself to Mr. Yeabsly in his business , so as I think we shall do his business for him in very good manner . But it is a most extraordinary thing to observe , " he adds , " and that which I would not but have had the observation of for a great deal of money . " On two other occasions he again refers to his knowledge of the fact that Shaftesbury was bribed by Yeabsly . An instance so well authenticated as this is sufficient to prove that his Lordship was not above the lust of dishonest gain . That he was a zealous Protestant , and that in all his measures he had regard mainly to the interests of Protestantism , has also been asserted by his admirers ; but his conduct , when calmly investigated , does not admit of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more attached to ProP estantism than to any other system of religious opinions ; but it is not less true , that he thought more of its usefulness as an engine of party warfare , and as a means of his own aggrandizement , than he did of its doctrines and its precepts . He was avowedly a member of the Church of England ; but on several points his views were very far from being orthodox according to the received standards of the age in which he lived . In politics he had no settled theories of government , and no large views of either foreign or domestic policy . He probably regarded a limited monarchy as best adapted to the wants of // the English people ; but he was at all times ready to give his support to any party and any measures from which he hoped to derive personal advantage , He accordingly attached himself in succession to every party in the state , and he deserted each in turn with equal readiness . In any just estimate of his political character he must stand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power as of infinitely greater importance than the maintenance of any principles . Many of his measures , however , were wise and beneficial , though they were generally framed for mere party purposes , and were supported in a factious spirit . In attempting to estimate the nature and extent of his influence we are inclined to attach great importance to the agreeableness of his manners , the liveliness of his conversation , and the brilliancy of his repartees , as well as to his extraordinary political sagacity . Though he lived in the midst of the Civil War , and participated in all the fierce party conflicts of the Commonwealth and the Restoration , lie managed to preserve till the last years of his life his reputation as a courteous gentleman and an agreeable companion in social intercourse . To this he owed his introduction into public life , and he ever afterward made it a means of strengthening his personal and party interests . In public he waged an unrelenting warfare , and cared nothing about the weapons which he used , if they were only effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners which politicians too often neglect . His conversation was lively and entertaining , and his wit was free from any taint of bitterness .
