ARTICLE IV. - NEW PHASES OF THE SCHOOL QUESTION IN CONNECTICUT . Circular respect*ng the Abolition of the Normal School at New Britain , issued by the State Board of Education in Connecticut , September 12 , 1867 . Svo. 4 pp. f/ike Daily Public School in the United States . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 1866 . A Shorter catechism on Consolidation . 1866 . Svo. 4 pp . IN respect of educatian , as well as of politics and religion , Connecticut is a sort of battle-ground between the friends of progress and the advocates of reaction . In almost all questions of public policy two parties appear , nearly equally balanced , and both of them eager to maintain the ascendency . First one succeeds , then the other ; arrd thus the " Land of Steady Habits " is in danger of being known as the Land of Unsteady Habits , so hard is it to foretell what course will be pursued in any matter which depends upon the action of the people . We can cite some recent illustrations of this changeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last summer , upon the Insane Asylum for the Poor a second appropriation fifty per cent . more than the directors asked for , declined giving aid to a Reformatory for girls , caused the Normal School to be abolished , and were only led to make a decent appropriation for the salary of the State Superintendent of Schools , by the personal representations of the Governor and the Lieutenant-Governor . A Republican citizen of New Haven , who desires to be known as an educator by profession , sat by the side of one of the leading Democrats of the Assembly , while he was attacking the established system of public instruction , giving countenance to his effrontery , and p*Asou to his arrows . Just as the Board of Education of the State had // Oct. , accomplished the reforms in the Normal School , which the action of previous Assemblies had demanded , they received a warning for their fidelity and implied censure , in place of gratitude , for their unpaid and unselfish devotion to the interests of the State . From the days when Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until now , the legislation of the State has exhibited this same " jerky " character . His reward was that of Aristides the Just , banishment from the state , because of " the exercise of powers " which Themistocles said were " dangerous in a Democracy . " Tn like manner his successors in office have every one of them been assailed with virulence , commonly by those who should have been their friends ; and the power to bring about good results has been seriously hampered by narrow minded opponents of taxation , by interested advocates of private schools , by disappointed candidates for official place , and by misinformed believers in an erroneous and injurious political philosophy . In regard to these various classes of opponents we shall presently speak ; but , first , we desire to call attention to the fact that while Connecticut goes stumbling along , the system of Public Instruction , of which she is a principal author , and of which her history is a principal record , does not halt . It is established in New York , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republics of the west , where the Sons of Coyinecticut have chosen their homes . It is imitated in the Dominion of Canada . Its principal characteristics are exhibited to the scholars of Europe in the most influential IReview of the continent , as worthy of general approbation and adoption . A Royal Commissioner from Great Britain , after a careful study of our methods and results , officially reports that by reason of the American system of public instruction , we " are certainly the most generally educated and intelligent people on the earth . " There is a second preliminary point on which we propose to dwell still more at length . People at a distance are much more puzzled than are we at home by the apparent inconsistencies of Connecticut legislation , and by the uncertain fluctuations in public opinion . To us , many facts are known respecting the movement of the population which are not revealed by // a scrutiny of the census , or by the hasty observations of travelers . We are well aware of the changes which are in progress in this once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are introduced into society by the accumulation of enormous fortunes , by intimate and incessant intercourse with the great metropolis , and by the rapid immigration of foreigners who have been bred under despotic institutions , and are ignorant of the dangers which beset a republican government . We see how rapidly our population is turning from agricultural to mechanical pursuits , and how the thriving and noisy ' smart factory villages , filled up with new corners , both foreign and domestic , are supplanting in influence , at least at the polls , the shaded town streets , inhabited by substantial and conservative residents , and the still more quiet " rural districts " where the remnant of farmers yet cultivate the soil . We are well enough aware that large numbers of young irien , who would have been among us the efficient promoters of all good interests , are laying the foundations of new cities and states on the slopes of the Pacific , and in the fertile valleys of the Mississippi basin . We understand , nioreover , that in these days of change and fermentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attacked , the right will for a time be overwhelmed by the wrong , and progress will seem to be backward . But we do not despair of the IRepublic . We welcome controversy , discussion , inquiry , agitatation , not for their own sakes , but for the elimination of errors , and for the confirmation of the truth . Facts so obvious to us , as those just recorded , show themselves but imperfectly , in the bare outlines of statistical tables , yet even here they may be discovered . From the official data of 1860 , it appears that during the ten years previous , Connecticut ceased to be a " migrative " state , and became a " receiving* ' state ; that is to say , the number of inhabitants who came into her borders from other states exceeded the number of those who removed away . Among these new corners were large numbers of foreigners , most of whom were Irish . It is a fact not generally known , but undisputed we believe , that the three southern states of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of Irishman 's Paradise . It is // Oct. , here , at least , that " the Exodus " of that people terminates . Hence , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , and New York have each of them among their inhabitants over twelve per cent. , or about one eighth Irish . No other states are favored to a like extent with the Milesian suffrage . While this is so , these same New England states are giving in exchange for this foreign element their own brightest young men , the flower of the land , so that thirty per cent . of the natives of Massachusetts , thirty-three per cent . of the natives of Connecticut , and thirty-nine per cent . of the natives of Rhode Island are found to be permanently resident beyond the states of their nativity . Now , when this double process is at work , when the American element is thus drawn off , and the Irish element is thus infused , it is not to be wondered at that the traditional institutions , habits , usages , and opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one respect suffers more than Rhode Island or Massachusetts . The cities of Providence and Boston exert upon the states of which they are the capitals an educational influence which Connecticut does not gain from its double-headed organization . Hartford and New Haven , important and rival centres of wealth , traffic , enterprise and culture , are not accustomed to act in unison for the advancement of public measures , and thus there is a want of concentration in the efforts of good citizens to promote the general prosperity . It is consequently harder to ward off evil influences , and encourage good undertakings than in those states where most of the leading newspapers , the houses of legislature , the state offices , the higher courts , and the chief seats of learning are clustered in the vicinity of a single capital . Neither the citizens of Connecticut nor their friends in other states have , therefore , any reason to be surprised that the principles of Public Education are sometimes called in question in the very community which has been conspicuous as an originator and defender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays we have had no foundations to lay . We have been called upon to accept , advance , modify , and adapt the inheritance of the past . Other l ) arts of the country have have been forced to determine what plan they would adopt , and have gone through a series of radical and fundamental // discussions , after which they felt " settled . " On the other hand , our controversies have been so far in advance of these radical investigations , and have been so much taken up with secondary questions , that many of our most intelligent citizens show themselves ignorant of the underlying principles . What now is the aspect of the School Question in Connecticut ? Disturbed , controversial , pugnacious , is our reply . The questions which are agitated , the men who are discussing them , the vigor which is manifested , the measures which are proposed , are unmistakable signs of an educational movement throughout the state , originating with no individual , instigated by neither political party , and occasioned by no single transaction , and likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough , and fruitful either of good or evil to every town and village , to every boy and girl within the limits of the state . But the aspect of the School Question in Connecticut is also hopeful , in our opinion eminently hopeful . In spite of what the Evening Po8t of New York has said , and the " dismal " picture which the 2l'lassacku8ett8 Teacher has discovered in the recent report of the Board of Education , and the Jeremiads which are played on a harp of a thousand strings , we believe that the signs of the times indicate an early , comprehensive , and satisfactory advancement of the established system of public instruction . That our readers may understand the reasons for our cheerfulness , in the present hour of momentary discomfitures , let them view with care the situation . On the one hand , the State Normal School , while under the care of an accomplished and highly successful instructor , has been abruptly suspended , the teachers dismissed , and the scholars scattered , in accordance with the directions of the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of explanations , which at another time we may perhaps reveal . In addition to this hostile procedure in the General Assembly of the State , there have been some vigorous local manifestations of dislike to a good school system . For example , last year , in New haven , seven of the nine members of the City Board of Education recommended the abolition of the High School , an institution which , in // Hartford , every one approves ; while in Hartford , a noisy town meeting refused to unite the various school districts on a plan which , in New Haven , receives the general , if not the unanimous , approval of the people . Such local disputes in their general influence ma*y counterbalance each other , but they are significant indications of public opinion , and sometimes of bitter hostility to the school system . When a meeting , called for deliberation , like that which was held in Hartford in August , 1866 , refuses to listen to the most gifted orator of the city , and drowns his voice with cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is some acrimony of feeling . So much for the opposition . Now let us look at the other side . We have gained within a little more than two years , a Board of Education instituted by the Legislature , and composed of four able men beside the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor . Under their direction , a Secretary , well known through New England for his zeal in public edifeation , is at work all over the state , correcting evils , pointing out right measures , awakening public attention , and diffusing right principles . Again , the Teachers ' Institutes , which for want of a suitable pecuniary allowance , have been for years no ornament to the system , are now , by a change of the law , liberally provided for , so that the gatherings held last spring in Norwich , Danbury , and Waterbury , awakened in behalf of these instrumentalities a zeal before unknown . Thirdly , the tax required by the State from every town for school purposes , has been increased one third , the benefit of which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gratifying still , the amount raised in the year 1865 ( the last year of which we have a financial report ) by voluntary taxation in the several towns and districts , reached the sum of $292,347 , a gain of $70,000 in a single year , and a gain of $1T0,000 within ten years . In other words , two and a half times as much was raised for schools by taxation in 1865 as was raised in 1856 . Fourthly , the school law has been so modified as to facilitate the abolition of small school districts , or rather the union of all the districts of a given town , so that the intelligence and // wealth of the central portions of the town may extend their enlightening influence into every nook and corner of the state . This law , it is true , is not compulsory , but permissive . Its main features are intended to meet the difficulties which now exist in towns where there are out-lying , deserted , or impoverished districts , too poor or too forlorn to maintain good schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspapers of the state . The apathy of our people , which is one of the chief dangers of republican society , has been disturbed . The enthusiasm of friends and the bitterness of opponents are combining to secure one excellent result-the scrutiny of the system in its methods and results From this arousal of the community we expect the best results . The recent attempt in New Haven to incite the Irish against the Americans and to exhibit at the polls the power of a Roman Catholic party excited by the priests , while it involves temporary evil , may bring permanent good , if it tends to make American citizens , irrespective of political party , watchful of the ballot-box and watchful likewise of the interests of Public Schools . We , therefore , conclude that while the abandonment of the Normal School of the State and the occasional attacks on local institutions are evidences of hostility to the Public School system , the establishment of a State Board of Education to control our schools , the provision of a competent salary for a competent Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law for consolidating school districts , the voluntary increase of taxation for school purposes , and the general willingness of the newspapers and of the people to discuss the system of public instruction , are signs of progress and of hope . We now proceed to analyze as well as we are able some objections to the received system of public instruction which are current in Connecticut . An extended acquaintance with individuals in different parts of the State , a prolonged official correspondence , an attendance on many public meetings called for the purpose of discussion , and a careful perusal of hundreds // Oct. , of cuttings recently clipped from the different newspapers , afford us the information on which our generalizations will be based . Some of these arguments will appear to the educators of Massachusetts , and perhaps of other parts of the country , as decidedly mediaeval . We regret , for the credit of the State , to present this diagnosis ; but as our ol ) ject is the improvement of the patient , we can see no g**in by concealment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections under five heads , which seem to us sufficiently comprehensive , namely : the Theological , the Financial , the Historical , the Aristocratic , and the Philosophical . Generally , though not always , our opponents are likewise of five classes-grumbling tax-payers , needy gentle-folks , disappointed place-men , ecclesiastical I ) igots , and selfish teachers of private schools . Whenever we meet a man who does not believe in any moral or religious ideas , who is close and parsimonious in his expenditure of mohey , who is tied up in the fetters of any phase of religious formalism , or who cares much more for his greatgrandfather than he does for posterity , we expect to find an opponent of public instruction ; and so , when we meet a frank , open-hearted lover of mankind , who desires the prosperity of the community better than selfish gains , who trusts the people and believes that they can be trained , under American institutions* for the high functions of local self-government , then we expect to find an intelligent advocate of the Common Schools . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns are less than they might be , busying himself to attack the High School , the Grammar School , and the Normal School , not in an open but in a covert way , we can not but raise the question , why this *rreat uneasiness ? and so , when we find school officers displaced from office attacking the very system of which they have been , and still desire to be , the choseii managers , we can not but ask them , why are you among the Philistines ? But the truth is neither to be defended nor embarrassed by personal arguments and insinuations . Our School system , like all republican institutions , and like the Christian faith , commends itself to approbation on its own merits alone , and not because of the endorsement of any advo // cate , however eminent , and not because of the attacks of any opponent , however selfish . It deserves support because of its inherent fitness for the wants of our day and generation . Let us , therefore , irrespective of personal considerations , proceed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates of our common schools , and which is att**cked by our opponents , may be stated in the briefest form as follows : The education of the people is essential to the safety of the republic and the progress of civilization ; and this can only be secured by Public Schools , not designed for any class in society , but FOR ALL ; the schools which are good enough for those who know what good schools are , being none too good for the most ignorant and lowly . The Theological objection to this idea is this : In schools which ALL attend , religion can not be taught , without awakening denominational and ecclesiastical censure ; but religious doctrines and worship should be inculcated in every school ; ergo , denominational or church schools would be much better for the community than common schools . This is the argument- " the Parish School vereuc the Public School . " This plausible syllogism is wholly satisfactory to the Roman Catholic Church , and is regarded with favor by many Episcopalians , Old School Presbyterians , and other Christians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually on the corners of the street , and it is occasionally uttered in the pulpit . Its influence was powerfully felt in Kew Haven at the school election of September 16 , 1867 , when an avowedly Roman Catholic ticket was elected by a majority of seventy votes . The day before the balloting two of the Roman Catholic pastors of the city exhorted their parishioners to show their strength against " the Yankees , " and in the third of the churches , the pastor being absent , the Catholic ticket was distributed through the children of the Sunday school . One of the priests is reported to have said that he had been trying for years to secure public money for his parish school , and now was the time to demand it . This is the ultra , possibly the ultra-montane , advocacy of the Parish School . What would be the effect of carrying out to its logical conclusion an argument // like this ? Does anfone suppose that the community will consent to be divided into simply two religious bodies-the IRomanist and the Protestant ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand separate schools for their children . So would the Jews . So would the Disbelievers . So would the Spiritualists . So , in fine , would all the religious bodies . It is easy to conceive what would be the character of such schools , free from inspection , managed without responsibility to the public , liable to the most bigoted influences , and rife in sectarian gall . But we need not merely theorize , for this plan of public education has been tried in England , and has failed to educate the people . It satisfies nobody . The admissions of her own writers might be quoted to show that England is getting behind the continental states , and behind our own country , in some important respects , simply for want of better systems of popular education . Hence , the British government is causing the theory and methods of public instruction t*41 ) be studied by good observers in the most enlio'ht-b ened nations , and we do not hazard much in predicting , as an imminent result , that the days of the Parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already numbered in that land . More than this , without fear of contradiction , we assert that the people have never been in any land , by the parish school , as generally well educated as they are here under our American popular system . The real fallacy of this theological argument seems to us to be in the assertion or the enthymeme that because the young must be instructed in religion , the day school is the place where this teaching should be given . We heartily believe in the religious training of the young , but we do not believe that teachers chosen because they understand the arithmetical ruleofthree , are , of course , the best persons to expound the mystery of the Trinity . In our view , tuition in spelling , reading , geography , grammar , figures , and the other rudimentary arts , is no more a religious exercise than playing ball . We hold that the tenets of Christian faith and worship should be taught under the direction of Christian pastors in a totally different manner and at a totally different time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular " knowledge . // 681 Where the catechism is taught by a perfunctory teacher , and where a prayer is made , or a chapter in the Bible is read as a perfunctory task ( as it may be in any school by a bigot or an unbeliever employed as a teacher ) , Religion herself is dishonored . It would be better by far , in our opinion , that positive religious instruction should be given by competent and , if necessary , by salaried teachers , employed by the various churches , in their sacred places , than that religious people should content themselves with the erroneous and dangerous notion that our present Sunday schools , and the brief religious opening of the day schools , furnish adequate training in the knowledge of Christianity . On the other hand , any good school ( our best Public Schools , for example ) , are , of necessity , schools of positive morality , though not of Christian faith . The virtue of Truth is taught , and not only so , but the scholar is trained to habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of language and on accurate recitations . Self control is taught in the school where good order is preserved . Fidelity to engagements is taught by a strict requirement of regular and punctual attendance . Obedience to lawful authority is enforced by the required submission to the rules of school . So of other moral duties . Better is it , in our opinion , to encourage these virtues in the public school , and to impart religious doctrines under the guidance of the ministers of religion . In short , as the church is not the place to study arithmetic , so the Public School is not the place to provide religious training . The Financial objection to common schools is the second point to which we call attention . This is the case of " the Private Purse versus the Public School . " " They cost too much , " is the complaint . When this remark is made by elderly people living on a fixed income inadequate to their support , and seriously diminished by the tax-collector 's bills , we can listen to it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who clutch , with the miser 's hand , every dollar they own , we grow restless and impatient . " No taxation for the benefit of other peoples ' children , " is the cry with which they rally all the crusty old bachelors , all the fast young men , all the mean and illiberal citizens . They do not often // complain that the Public School is too costly for the work it performs . Commonly it is admitted that so many children could not be so well educated in private schools at so small a cost . The current argument is this- " You have no right to tax me for my neighbor 's benefit . " The answer is obviousthe community has a right to tax every citizen for the good of all . I may never ride , or even walk , in certain streets ; but it is right to tax me for laying them out , for repairing them , for paving , draining , or lighting them . I may own no house ; but it is right that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . I may have no suit at court , but it is for my interest that justice be administered . So of the school . If it benefits the community it benefits me , and I am rightly taxed for it . The establishment of any other principle would lead to the dissolution of society . That Public schools , well ordered and administered , are a positive financial benefit to the communities in which they are located , admits of ready 1 ) roof . The argument has been so often presented that we will not repeat it here . But the objector says-Shall every project , then , for the benefit of the community be maintained at the public expense ? We answer , no . Every such measure is to be judged on its own merits , and the public support bestowed on those projects only which can not be secured without public aid . The education of the people , as the experience of all nations shows , can only be secured by public aid , and on this account the Public Schools are essential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is commonly employed by ignorant men only , yet occasionally it appears in the writings of those who ought to know better . For example , this remark is made by a correspondent of one of the New Haven dailies , whose love of military symbolism finds expression in the General 's star , ( * ) , which he affixes to an anonymous communication : " Our schools , supported by the school fund and by taxation , were DE5IGNED ORIGINALLY for the children of parents who could not educate them at their own expense . " This phrase alone might be considered as an accidental or trivial inaccuracy . But the same idea crops out repeatedly in an Article of two // columns . He complains of " new measures " introduced " on the deceptive plan that the schools for the poor should be made as good as the schools for the rich . " He scoffs at the " magnificent communism of Massachusetts innovators , " and at the " clap-trap of declamation " of a Connecticut writer , who speaks of the rich and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so , he implies , in the days of our forefathers . A similar statement was recently made by the official guardians of the public instruction in one of our large towns . Our schools , they say , were " originally designed for the poor . " Many people actually believe that the idea of a school , common to all , irrespective of social station , originated with Horace Mann , or if not with him , then with some one of those horrid " Prooshans " whom he visited in Europe . Horace Mann has many claims to honor , but none so great as this . At most , he was only the restorer , not the founder , of the American school system . " Did I know , " said a distinguished citizen of Connecticut , nearly seventy-five years ago , " the name of the legistor who first conceived and suggested the idea of common schools I should pay to his memory the highest tribute of reverence and regard . I should for him have a much higher veneration and respect than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sparta and Athens . I should revere him as the greatest benefactor of the human race . " Probably , says a historian of acknowledged authority , " the honor of devising the scheme of popular education , which has prevailed in New England , belongs exclusively to no individual , but to Theophilus Eaton and John Davenport , more than to any others in New Haven , should be ascribed this honor . " What , then , was their idea of public instruction ? Take New Haven colony , for example . The system may be easily ascertained by a perusal of the Colonial Records now within the reach of all . It was simply this : " All the children must be taught . The public must see to this . The community must establish a school , engage a school master , superintend the instruction . A Grammar school or Latin school must supplement the elementary class , so that boys may be fitted for the university . ' There was no select academy or institute for the children of Eaton // and Davenport , Goodyear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was one school for all , a Common school . It is true that this school was not a free school , in our acceptation of the phrase . Those paid tuition who were able ; and only those who could not pay received gratuitous instruction . But the school was for everybody 's children ; no matter whether they could pay or not , it was open to them all , like the air they breathed , and like the common which they trod . It is therefore sheer ignorance of our local history to claim that it is a modern notion to propose instruction for all " in the public school system . The feature of all others which distinguishes the American educational establishment is this democratic principle . It is the gift of New England to the pedagogics of the world . Public schools for different classes are known elsewhere . Public schools for the poor have long been maintained by the Roman church , and various Protestant corumunions . But Common Schools , schools common to all , are the characteristic of the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth century . It may be that our forefathers planted better than they knew ; that they thought simply of their own wants ; that they were not expecting to introduce a system for the continent . But the germ still grows ; its branches cover the land ; its offshoots will be transplanted to every people of the civilized world . We would not be considered as laying undue stress on the value of past institutions . Antiquity alone is no argument . But when our opponents charge us with innovations , it is well for our friends to look up the record . Fortunately in this case experience confirms the positions of antiquity . The Aristocratic objection to public schools , is of all others to us the most obnoxious . The point of this argument , as we understand it , is this . It is dangerous to the refinement and morality of well-bred children , to sit side by side with barefooted clod-hoppers . The poor are , of necessity , so demoralizing that children who can wear broadcloth and silk must avoid the calico and satinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these are not stated in just these words ; // but stripped of their euphemisms this is their import . People at the West will be astonished to learn that any man of any creed , or of any party , should hold such opinions . A school officer from beyond the Mississippi recently expressed to us in the strongest terms his opinion of the mode in which such opinions would be received in those new commonwealths . As we are not among the believers in Cologne-water churches , or in Cologne-water schools , it has astonished us beyond measure , to learn that one who has been a prominent member of the Republican party appeared before the Joint Standing Committee on Education in the General Assembly , as an open advocate of social " caste . " " It will not do " ( he is reported to have said ) " to have the children of parents who can not pay for their education associate with the children of those who can . Not that the line of virtue and vice is always coincident with the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case as to constitute the rule . " Let our readers mark these words . Have we a Bourbon or a Stuart among us ? or is this the daring utterance of Hammond , or Davis , or some other fire-eater of the South opposed to Northern institutions ? Fortunately , when this plea for class distinctions was uttered in the crowded committee room at Hartford , a distinguished scholar , an officer of Yale College , was present , who could say , " I have had four boys at one time in a public school of New Haven , and I have never known them to be there exposed to any vicious or contaminating influence . " We are not opponents of private schools . We presume that in all time to come , however good the public schools may be , private schools will be required . We have no objections to the attempt to secure for the favored few a culture of a higher order than can be provided for the multitude . It does no harm to the post-office for rich men to use the telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private watchmen . But we shall oppose the expenditure of public money for any other object than the good of all ; we shall protest against the attempt to establish or recognize in this country any permanent class of " poor ; " and we shall fight to the // best of our ability against " the Pauper theory " of Public Education . Dr. Holmes has somewhere humorously delineated the virtues of " the Brabmin Caste " in New England . There is an inherited aristocratic sentiment , which often manifests itself in the older historic families of New England . So long as it is seen in an idolatrous reverence for traditional blue-china , or in a superstitious avoidance of certain articles of diet , we laugh at it ; so long as it appears in a conservative desire to perpetuate the refinements and manners , the intelligence and good breeding of " old-school " gentlemen and " old school " ladies , we admire and uphold it ; but when it appears in a horror of popular advancement in intelligence and comfort , or in a ridiculous shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we despise and abhor it . We have no sympathy with the arguments of " the Brahmin caste , versus the Public Schools . " The om*ly remaining arguments which we shall notice are those , which , out of compliment to the authors , and for want of a better term , we call Philosophical ; but be it understood that they are the results of " Philosophy , falsely so called . " They are the utterances of men who think it is sagacious and profound to combat all accepted and established usages in society ,  --  who extol the past as the golden age , who join with Carlyle in his dread of " Shooting Niagara ; " who sniff and jeer at every noble sentiment of Christian brotherhood , or republican public spirit . Their ideas of social science may be crude , prejudiced , and superficial , but they are also positive , dogmatic , and unreasonable . Their leading principle seems to be opposition to every good principle . If religion is advocated we hear them sneer at priest-ridden congregations . If the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untimely advocates of state rights . If the government is forced to raise funds on credit , they believe in nothing but very hard cash , and are intensely interested in the history of the copper cent . If the growth of the town is under consideration , they do n't want to see any more people in it , it is too large already ! Their opposition to public instructi9n is equally profound , and is based upon the tenet stated in one of their recent utter- // 687 ances , that " the State can not keep school . " There are many variations of this cry adapted to different occasions ; for example : " We have too much eddi-cation now , " is one ; the High school is " a fungus , " is another ; the Latin class is " a trap to catch unsuspecting juveniles , " is a third Normal Schools are " Augean stables , " is another . These philosophers were represented in the last Assembly by an eloquent disciple and advocate , into whom it would seem that the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other valiant crusader had entered , and who thus exclaimed , on " philosophical " not on shallow " parsimonious " grounds , against the increase of pay to the Secretary of the State Board of Education : " It is monstrou8 to give a mere clerk $3,000 and his expenses , when the Chief Justice of the state receives but $2,000 . If he is to advocate the State Normal School , I would not give him a cent . I am told that he is a sort of preacher of the principles of the Normal School . I am told he advocatesthe introduction of the Prussian system of education once more , those horrid Prooshans ! which looks to the establishment of a great National Seminary at an expense of twenty millions , and that these first steps are only the beginning of a plan looking to that system . Mr. Speaker , I move the postponement of the whole matter . " * We will not detain our readers with any attempt to answer such flings as these . The fundamental error on which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without exaggeration , it is this . " The state botches ' all that it undertakes , it mismanages so badly that we should strip it as far as possible of all powers . Parents alone should be responsible for the education of the young , and the state should only see to the training in elementary knowledge of those abandoned children whose parents give them over to ignorance and vice . " This is sometimes fitly called the Pauper theory of public education . It places the common school on the basis of the alms-house , so that every honest and deserving poor man will avoid it as he would the lazaretto . Necessity alone is the usher to its halls . // Now we have but little fear that any such views t is these will be prevalent among the American people to such an extent as to modify our laws and institutions ,  --  but they do thrnish arguments which to weak-minded friends of public instruction seem weighty . The answer is this : Imperfect as are our modes of civil government , they are the only means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parks , municipal improvements , the post office , the courts of justice , the militia , may not be perfect . A battalion of school boys may march better than the organized troops of the state . What then ? Shall we have no public works , no state improvements , no progress in civilization and state-craft , because all political machinery is defective ? By no means . The community is bound to l ) rovide public schools for the same reason that it provides the other institutions we have named ,  --  because in no other way can the *benefits desired be secured so generally , so cheaply , and so satisfactorily . As for the fear that parents are led to give up their own care of the young by the creation of such public schools as those of New England , it is a pure invention of the enemy , a ground . less apprehension , a calumny just as applicable to private as to public schools . The employment of any teacher may be called a shifting of parental responsibility ; but tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a public school for five hours a day , or to a boarding school for twenty-four ? One thing is certain , if the Public School in America is abandoned to the so-called poor it will soon be abandoned by them . The only safe theory for our government is to recognize no permanent class of poor or rich , no line of aristocratic distinction , no barrier of caste , but to provide for the benefit of all . " This is a government of the People , by the People , for the People . " It is the masses , the multitude , who are neither very rich nor very poor , who are neither high bred nor degraded , for whom all our institutions are contrived . We have no fear that these mock philosophers , these educational " owls , " will make any progress with their theories of government . We have thus enumerated the various arguments which are presented by the advocates of the Parish School , the Private // Purse , Inaccurate Tradition , tbe Brahmin Caste , and the Philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing reader has probably discovered that they are not imaginary objections , but are the actual statements which have been seriously made , within a short time past , in the State of Connecticut , by intelligent and influential men . We have recounted them that our friends elsewhere , liable to hear like discussions , may know the light in which we regard them . The opposition to the Common School system of Connecticut has shown itself in four phases , or rather , there have been four points of attack ; first , the New Haven High School ; second , the law providing for uniting small school districts into one town district ; third , the appointment of that so-called " Massachusetts Innovator , " Mr. Northrop , to the superintendence of schools in the State ; and fourth , the Normal School at New Britain . In all the first three points , the Public School party have been heartily sustained . The high School has been continued , fhe consolidation law has been passed , and the appointment of Mr. Northrop , a Connecticut man by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remaining point has been lost , for the moment at least , in consequence or the open desertion , and the still more dangerous whispers of professed friends of the institution , rather than the criticism of opponeuts . We may at some future time show our readers by what influences this Teacher 's Seminary was brought into disrepute ; and how it happened that an institution which had enjoyed for sixteen years the guidance of so many excellent men as Principals and as Trustees , was fin ally stranded . For the present we forbear , and content ourselves with expressing the hope , that the suspension of the school will lead to reorganization at an early day on a wise and enduring basis . The arguments in favor of such a course are enumerated in the circular referred to at the beginning of our remarks , which bears the signature of Governor English and his coadjutors in the Board of Education . We presume that in the next Assembly this subject will receive the attention it deserves , and our fi-iends should see to it that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty prolongation of personal difficulties . // With two or three further remarks we shall conclude our observations . In the first place , we urge upon the friends of public education to stand firm for the right . It may be well for them to combine in local or state organizations for the promotion of pu blic schools , in order that by the publishing of documents , the delivery of addresses , and the holding of public conferences , the true theory may be presented to the voters of every town , and village , and district . We can trust the people , if they understand the question ; see to it that they are enlightened . Secondly . The interests of public education should be kept free from ordinary political partisanship . The system is ruined if either Democrats or Republicans assume its direction , or enrol themselves to assault it . lit is noteworthy that among the oppone4lts of the Normal School were leading Republicans , and that among its defenders were many prominent Democrats . The remarks of our present chief magistrate , Governor English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMliddletown , and in presiding at the anniversary in New Britain , showed a sympathy with popular education and a desire for the maintenance of the Common School System which will always be remembered to his honor , especially among those who may have differed from him on other political issues . A similar tribute is due to the present Lieutenant-Governor , Hon. E. H. Hyde . Years ago , in like manner , another Democratic magistrate , Governor Seymour , planted himself firmly as a friend of Common Schools , and of the Normal School , and the services he rendered are still gratefully borne in mind . The Hartford Times has been one of the strongest advocates of district consolidation . We call attention to these facts , because most of our readers are of the Republican party , and we desire to have them know that there are efficient allies to be found in educational contests among men of all shades of political belief . Certainly questions so vital to the public welfare ought not to be confounded with the struggles of national political parties . Finally ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain the present State Board of Education . In addition to the two chief magistrates it consists of four wise and cautious advocates of public instruction , all of them liber // ally educated gentlemen , two of them at least experienced teachers , all of them accustomed to public life . They understand the state , and are interested in its welfare , and their guidance may be safely followed . Their selections of teachers for the Normal School , and their various suggestions for the improvement of the schools at large , deserve the scrutiny and the approbation of every citizen . We are in the midst of grave discussions . If we are wise and temperate , watchful and persistent , the victory will be ours , and we shall soon see the Land of Steady Habits restored to its former educational renown .
