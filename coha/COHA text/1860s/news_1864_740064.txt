txt There is one mean thing the iebeis will not do . They will not rob a dead negro . Give them all credit for the honor or humanity which thus restrains them . it must be honor , for it is surely not humanity , else white corpses would be spared . On the afternoon of the 17th inst. , arrangements were made by flag of truce for the hurtal of the dead of the battle of White Tavern  --  or of Farrell 's Mills , as we call it ? on the north side of the James . The bodies of forty or fifty of our slain were delivered to us by rebel authorities . Most of these lacked boots or shoes ; many were without coats or pants ; some were almost entirely nude  --  stripped by chivalrous South-row , . It was sad to look upon the desecrated remains of gallant Union soldiers , and to consider how the dear ones at home would , if they knew the whole gloomy truth , grieve over the barbarous handling of bodies they would have treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were bodies of black soldiers returned , and not one of them had been stripped . Not a garment had been taken . Coats , pants , shoes , even caps and equipments , all were spared . A Southern soldier , however destitute he may be , is too proud to steal from a dead negro . There is Donor among thieves . The question is ap open one , whether this sparing of the sable corpses arises ! rom antipathy to the black man in his social or in his military condition . Southerners have not bsen re ) uctant to WV from pegroes before death . They have insole their living by robbing the blacks . And as they steal from deed white men , why should they not from dead black ones ? Is not their continence a result of unwillingness to recognize the colored soldier as a belligerent  --  after his rifieds silenced ? Do they not leave his uniform as they find it , because it is not legitimately before them ? because he has no right to wear it , and they likYO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this latter supposition be correct , then the new decision of Confederate authorities to recognize as soldiers all colored troops raised from free blacks of the North . or from slaves of Maryland and Delaware , will ease the minds of fastidious Southerners . Henceforth they can rob the bodies of these as consistently as if they were pure Caucasians . But will not that be hard on the unfortunate colored soldiers from further South ? Must their remains be neglected when the vandal chivalry glean all the battle-O ' 14 for ** and caps , and coats , and pants of Yanlee eilnufactore ? How the down-trodden descendants of Ham are called to suffer ! tomthe narrow-minded exclu- siveness of those against Who &; they stand in battle ! A SINGULAR CASE OF DESERTION . A singular occurrence took place on the picket line before this position , to-day . The rebs and Yanks have been for some time accustomed to meet for friendly chat in a cornfield between their lines . This afternuou a Federal soldier went down into that held as though to his a word to Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Some of them followed in his tracks until within hall of the enemy 's piesets , and there called out to know if the man whom they described had been seen that way . Answer was promptly given that he had come to that post and yielded himself up as deserter . It was added by the rebels that he said he wished to avail himself of Adj. - Gen. 000PHR'B promise to send promptly to the North deserters from the Union army , he being tired of the war . Upon this they cautioned him that he was not an alien , and that to that class alone the provisions of the proclamation extended ; therefore he must come , if at all , on his own risk of permanent detention as a prisoner of war , lie had better go back . He proposed to take his chances and passed - on . The advising of a deserter to return to his own lines is not a common thing with armies arrayed against each other in active campaigning . Poor Johnnies ! They are so straightened and pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better feelings of humanity , shrinE from admitting to the companionship of their misery one who is under the protection of so good a Government as ours . " I would never let a dog I cared for go through the lines , " said to me the deserter whose execution I wrote of a short time since .
