ARTICLE YIJJ. - EDWARD IRVING . IN the July Number of the NEW ENGLANDER we gave place to an Article in review of Mrs. Oliphanli 's biography of Edward Irving , from the pen of a writer who has had , perhaps , greater facilities for becoming acquainted with the character and religious convictions of that eminent man , than any other individual in this country . In that Article , it will be remembered , the reviewer had not space to enter upon any examination of those remarkable occurrences which , during the last four years of Mr. Irving 's life , exerted so important an influence upon his career , and gave such a new direction to his efforts . This period is one over which great obscurity has hung . It has not been easy to gain satisfactory information with regard either to the facts or to Mr. Irving 's views respecting them . His friends have always claimed that on these points he has been grievously misrepresented and misunderstood . Under these circumstances we are confident that our readers will be pleased that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of these remarkable events , and of the development of Mr. Irving 's belief in connection with them , prepared by one whose means of becoming acquainted with the whole subject have been unusually complete . And if in the detail of the facts , and the discussion of these novel subjects , the reviewer discloses , what is already generally known , that he is the warm supporter and hearty advocate of the views which Mr. Irving was led to embrace , his readers who are obliged to differ from him in his conclusions have , in the undisguised sympathy which he shows , this additional guarantee that lie has given a presentation of the whole subject which will be admitted by all to be satisfactory . It way , perhaps , be well also , in giving place to an Article of this kind in our pages , to guard occasional readers from imputing // any adherence to the views , that are here unfolded , to those who are interested in the conduct of this Quarterly . ED . NEW ENGLANDER. like Life of Edward Irving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his Journals and Correspondence . By MRS . OLIPHANT . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers , Franklin Square . 1862 . IN one of Emerson 's Essays , if we mistake not , there occurs this pregnant saying , " To-day is a king in disguise . " The true meaning of it is , that God 's greatest works are misunderstood at the time that Ife is doing them . The prophets are killed , and it is after-generations who build their sepnlchres . That a servant of God should have met with almost universal obloquy and reproach , does not show him to have been unfaithful , or to have failed in his mission . His very fidelity may have been the cause of his rejection , for a work may have been given him to do beyond the reach of his generation , the necessity and glory of which only a later age can discern and appreciate . This principle is especially to be borne in mind , in forming a judgment upon the career of one whose holiness , it is universally admitted , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , and whose services to the cause of Christian doctrine were unsurpassed by those of any man of his time . The charity which " thinketh no evil " would be slow to believe that such an one was left to follow an ignis fatuws which led him into a land of " Gorgcns , hydras , and chimeras dire , " where he wasted his noble gifts in ineffectual toils and sufferings . The history of Edward Irving up to the year 1830 , was not such as to prepare us for that utter wreck of his magnificent endowments and opportunities which he is commonly thought to have made towards the end of his life . " From year to year , " says Mrs. Oliphant , " as Irving proceeded farther on his career , the tide of thought and emotion had been hitherto rising with a noble and natural progress . He had now reached // almost to the enimination of that wonderful and splendid development . Everything he had uttered or set forth with the authority of his name , had been worthy the loftiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to the high position he assumed as a teacher and embassador of God . All his discourses and openings up of truth had operated only , so far as his own mind was concerned , to the heightening of every divine conception , and to the increase and intensification of the divine love in his heart . " It was not long before this time that Coleridge said , " I see in Edward Irving a minister after the order of Paul . " There can be no doubt that he had thus far been most providentially guided and trained , and had abounded in the noblest labors for Christ and His Church .. Born in the most intensely Protestant country of Europe , and educated in the grave and sober ways of its religions peasantry , he was transplanted to England in the prime of his early manhood to receive a spiritual and intellectual culture such as his native land could not give him . He inherited all that personal strength and courage and unconquerable firmness , which have made Scotland victorious in many a stormy conflict , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing and painful disappointments of thirty years . After he had learned the first lessons of the pastoral work , as the helper of Chalmers , the wisest and greatest of the Scottish pastors , he was removed by a striking providence of God , and without any seeking on his own part , to the Metropolis , then as now th' great center of the Protestant world . When he went up to London he was ill-fitted for the high sphere lie was ultimately to 1111 . Full of genial life and power he was ( no one more so in all these Islands , " said Thomas Carlyle ) , and his wonderful gifts , then for the first time finding room and range enough , at once made him the splendid pulpit orator whose fiery eloquence shook the whole kingdom . But before he could become the profound and powerful teacher of Christian doctrine , he must sit a docile pupil at the feet of the greatest Christian philosopher and sage of these last ages , to learn from him the principles on which all vital philosophy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , Mr. Irving 's training for the ministry began at Highgate . It was from the lips of Coleridge that he received those seeds of truth , which , quickened by the Divine Spirit , brought forth the rich fruits of his teachings on the Incarnation , the Ordinances of God in society and the Church , and the future Kingdom of His Son . Humanly speaking , he could not otherwise have been that mighty expounder of the purpose and work of God in Christ which he soon became . It was his communion with this remarkable man , at a time when his energetic intellect was all a-glow with youthful lire , that gave the right direction to his theological studies , and lifted up the eloquent orator into the far-seeing interpreter of the ways of God to man . His removal to London also brought him under the influences of the more varied structure of English society , enlarging him from provincial narrowness , and giving him a broader understanding of the applications of Christianity to human life . To the simplicity and earnestness of Scottish character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus joined the wider range of thought , and the richer , mellower tone of feeling , which come from the blending of so many diverse elements in the national life of England . In the Dedication of his " Lectures on the Parable of the Sower , " to his " dear and honored friends , " Mr. and Mrs. Basil Montague , " with all those honorable men and women of the English nation , who have showed me much kindness in these parts , " he thus beautifully expresses his obligations in these respects to the land of his adoption : * * " For while I must ever acknowledge myself to be more beholden to our sage friend Mr. Coleridge ( whose acquaintance and friendship I owe likewise to you ) , than to all men besides , for a knowledge of the truth itself as it is in Jesus ; I feely confess myself to be much your debtor for the knowledge of those forms of the natural mind , and the actual existing world , with which the minister of the truth hath in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the seed of truth is to be cast . Your much acquaintance , worthy Sir , and your much conversation of the sages of other days , and especially the fathers of the English Church and Literature , and your endeavors to hold them up unto all whom you honor with your confidence , your exquisite feeling , dear and honQred Madam , of whatever is just and beautiful , whether in the idea or in the truth of // things , and your faithfulness in holding it up to the view of your friends , together with the delicate skill and consummate grace with which you express it in words , and embody it in acts-these things , my dear and honored friends , working insensibly during several years ' continuance of a very intimate friendship and very confidential interchange of thought and feeling , have , I perceive , produced in me many of those views of men and things which are expressed in the following discourse concerning that question of the several soils into which the seed of truth is cast . " Such were the influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years of his ministry there , and there could have been none more favorable to his intellectual and spiritual growth . Some reviewers have fancied that he lost the healthful tone of his mind by excluding himself from general society , and becoming the centre of a narrow coterie of admirers . Xever was there a more ground less charge . He touched society at every point , and saw every phase of life . At Highgate , he was thrown into the brilliant circle that was wont to gather there around the " the old man eloquent , " the endless flow of whose discourse , rich in learning and wisdom and prophetic excursions of the imagination , drew to it for delight or instruction , every variety of talent and every form of character . Charles Lamb , * and Godwin , and Hazlitt ; and of the younger men of the day , Talfourd , and Maurice , and Stuart Mill , and Trench , were amongst those whom Irving was likely to meet with at the home of his revered teacher . Talfourd names him amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Cary ( translator of Dante ) , and Hood . He certainly had free access to the highest intellectual and literary society of London , where lie could ( to say the least ) have found no fuel for fanaticism . At Albury , the hospitable country residence of his friend , * The following anecdote of Lamb , which we believe has never been published , we give merely as showing that the range of Mr. Irving 's acquaintance was not narrow . As they two were walking together on their way to Coleridge , where they were to meet the Smiths ( Horace and his brother , the authors of the Rejected Addresses ) , Lamb kept constantly saying , drawing back as he spoke , with a shuddering motion , " I hate those men , I hate those men . " At length Irving said , " why , Charles what makes you hate those men ? " " I do n't know them , I never saw them , " was the quick reply . // Mr. Henry Drummond , he was brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church of England-some of them of great biblical and theological learning , faithful and zealous pastors , members of Parliament , officers of the Army and Navy , and men in other high social positions , who were drawn together by their common interest in the prophetic Scriptures . Of one of these meetings he tlmns speaks in a letter to his wife : " We are not without some diversities of opinion upon most subjects , especially as to the Millennial blessedness , which was handled yesterday . Lord Mandeville and Mr. Dodsworth take a view of it different from me , rating the conditioa of men in flesh higher than I do , and excluding death . I desire to think humbly , and reverently to inquire upon a subject so high . Mr. Dow has great self-possession and freedom among so many strangers . Mr. Borthwick is very penetrating and lively , but Scotch all over in his manner of dealing with that infidel way of intellectualizing divine truth which came from Scotland . I myself have too much of it . Mr. Tudor is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly sublime and soul-subduing in the views he presents . I observed a curious thing , that while he was reading a paper on Christ 's office of Judgment in the Millennium , everybody 's pea stood still , as if they felt it a desecration to do anything but listen . Mr. Drummond says that if I and iDodsworth had been joined together , we would have made a Pope Gregory the Great-he to furnish the popish quality , not me. " p. 360 . This little glimpse into one of the Albury conferences , taken in connection with the passages of his life we have already given , shows how many-sided was Mr. Irving 's intercourse with society , and that if he fell into unsound ways of thinking , and erratic courses of conduct , it was not for want of knowledge of men and sympathy with them . At the time to which we have now arrived , he united in himself without being able perfectly to reconcile them , the most varied religious elements . He was a Protestant in his strong individuality ( the per8onal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; in his abhorrence of IRomish superstitions and errors and tyranny ; in his appreciation of the fullness of the Gospel , and of the power of the Cross of Christ ; and in his strong assertion of the Will of the Father , and of his eternal , all-embracing purpose in His Son . He had recovered , also , the great truth of Patristic Theology , the Incarnation , the basis of all sound Christian doctrine , which // the Reformers , and their successors still more , had too much lost sight of in contending for one of its fruits , the Atonement . And in addition to the noblest features of the Reformation , and of the age of the Fathers , he was holding np with great power the hope of the primitive Church , the return of the Lord Jesus Christ in the glory of the resurrection to rule the earth in righteousness . Such was Edward Irving , when the events of which we are now to speak startled the whole Christian world . Suddenly , and to the amazement of every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West of Scotland an outburst of supernatural manifestation in the form of tongues , and prophesyings , and gifts of healing . It was his faith in these as the work of the Holy Ghost , and in the restoration of the ancient Ministries of the Church for which they prepared the way , that characterized the last few years of Mr. Irving 's life , and led to conflicts , and sufferings , and noble endurance , which give a tragic interest to his history . The subject of spiritual gifts and ministries is too large to be entered upon here , and all that we propose to do is to state the facts as to this remarkable religious movement , only so far as may be necessary to indicate his position , and the reasons by which he vindicated it . If we shall seem to any of our readers to take them into a region , our reason for it is that Mr. Irvino* 's life led strange b through it , and can not be understood except by a careful following of his career , step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no expectation of any reappearance of miraculous powers , for he says in his Preface ( dated January , 1825 ) , " The miraculous endowments of all these offices have ceased , because there is no longer any occasion for them ( the external healings , which were like fruit before the harvest , being superseded by the fruits of health and blessedness which the Gospel hath produced , not upon individuals , but upon nations and generations ) , " &amp;c . But at the first meeting for the study of the prophetic Scriptures at Albury , in Novemuber , 1826 , the Rev. J. Haldane Stewart , a clergyman of the Church of England , " mentioned the success he had had in promoting meetings for // 785 special prayer for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Church , and for the promise of the latter rain , made in Joel , " and in the discussion to which this gave rise , another person ( understood to be not Mr. Irving , but Mr. Drummond ) is reported to have said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were no longer of use to the Church , but because the faith of the Church grew cold and dead . The IRomish Church maintains that we Protestalits have no ground whatever for saying that miracles were ever to cease , and that we can produce no warrant from Scripture for so saying . In this she is right ; and if the faith and purity of the Church burned as bright now as in the days of the Apostles , she would again exhibit that light to the world . " This , so far as we know , was the first expression of faith in our times by a Protestant , in the supernatural gifts of the Spirit as the permanent endowment of the Church . Mr. Irving 's attention seems to have been thus turned to the subject , for , in the second of his Homilies on Baptism , which were preached the next year ( 1827 ) , we find the following : " The other part of the dispensation of the grace of God , under which the baptized are brought , is expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Ghost . ' By which , they say , we ought to understand , not the outward gift of power , which bath ceased , but the inward gift of sanctification and fruitfulness , which we all bclieve to be co-essential in the salvation of a sinner with the work of Christ itself . But for my own part , I am inclined to understand both ; for I can not fiusd by what writ of God any part of the spiritual gift was irrevocably removed from the Church . I see , indeed , that she hath lost the power which heretofore made her terrible as an army with banners ; so , also , bath she lost the bright and glorious raiment which made her fair as the moon and clear as the sun ; but why she may not hope , yea , assuredly believe , to have the former , when the Lord shall see it good , as well as the latter , is what I can not see , the one being as truly a supernatural work of God as the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abstract opinion that spiritual gifts and miraculous powers ought to be manifested in the Church , it evidently took no strong hold of his mind , and entered little into his public teachings . It was not till the report of the reappearance of the gifts in Scotland reached him several years after , that he seems to have examined the subject with his usual earnestness . And what were the facts in regard to these manifestations ? // Some of our readers will remember " Peace in Believing , a Memoir of Isabella Campbell , " which was republished iu this country iu 1830 , with a Prelirniuary Essay , understood to have been writteu by the iRev . John Wheeler , afterwards President of Burlington College . In this Memoir , frequent mention is made of an elder sister , Mary Campbell , who was the bosom companion of Isabella during most of her last sickness , in which her remarkable religions experiences gave her the reputation of a saint in all the count around . They were the daughters of a retired officer in the army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the secluded hamlet of Fernicarry , on the north side of the Clyde . They had both passed through long-protracted spiritual darkness and conflicts and agony , from which they had at length been brought into great peace and joy . Of Isabella , Dr. Wheeler says in his Essay : - " Isabella Campbell treated religion as a life . She lived in it . It was the life of her life . And she received it not from the arguments of man , nor from the opinions of men , nor from any source in man , but from God She went about to establish no righteousness of her own , to form no notions of her own , to seek no path of her own , to lean on no strength of her own , but submitted herself to the rigteousness of God in Christ . She believed God . In that belieg , she found all her wants more than supplied . Her soul was filled with peace ; yea , it overflowed with love ; it broke forth in joy , it shouted with thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnify the Lord our Saviour . " Isabella died in 1827 , after a very long and painful illness , during which she seemed often to be filled with the Spirit , and was impelled to speak with unusual fervor and power of utterance to thdse around her . It was in Mary that the first spiritual manifestations in tongues and prophecyings appeared about three years after ; and it is a fact not without significance , that she should previously have had so much knowledge and experience of the highest forms of the religious life then known to the Church . She was thus delivered from the danger of confounding mere . fervor of feeling with the supernatural actiugs of the Holy Ghost . // The circumstances attending this first*manifestation of spiritual gifts , can not be better described than in the following passages from a letter written by Mr. Irving to the Editor of Fraser 's Magazine , and published January , 1832 : " Being occupied with the ministry of these two great truths-Christ 's union with us by the one flesh , and our union with Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind , nor taught my people to look or to pray for the restoration of the spiritual gifts , but confined myself to the confession of our sins and the sins of our fathers for which they had ceased , and to the bewailing of our low and abject state before the Lord . Thus we stood , when the tidings of the restoration of the gift of tongues in the West of Scotland , burst upon us like the morning star heralding the approach of day , and turned our speculations upon the true doctrine into the examination of a fact . . . . . I did rejoice with great joy when the tidings were read to me , coming through a most authentic channel , that the bridal attire and jewels of the Church had been found again " In the West of Scotland , the thick and dark vail which men *iave cast over the truth , had been taken away chiefly by the preaching of that man of God , John Campbell , late minister of iRow , * who was deposed by the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Christ died to redeem all mankind . His word leavened all that land , and took firm and fast hold of many to the saving ef their souls . But he had received no insight , nor held any discourse with the people , on this subject ; only he had prepared them for everything by teaching them the boundless love of God , and the full and free gift of Jesus with all the riches of glory which He contained . To another preacher of the Gospel , f now also deposed by the same General Assembly for postponing the Confession of Faith to the Holy Scriptures , presiding at present over the Scotch congregation at Woolwich , it was reserved to sow the seed which has borne this precious fruit . He was at that time my fellow laborer in the National Scotch Church , being our missionary to preach to the poor of the city ; and as we went in and out together , he used often to signify to me his conviction that the spiritual gifts ought still to be exercised in the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound , to pray for them , as being baptized into the assurance of the gift of the Holy Ghost , ' as well as of repentance and remission of sins . ' " Towards the end of the year 1829 , our excellent missionary , whose mind God * The North British Review says of this movement : " Mr. Campbell 's new light ' created no small stir round the Gairloch , and over all the land . There was an awakening of religious life there , which got its first impulse from the Rowkirk . Greenock , Glasgow , Edinburgh , thrilled as with the gush of a fresh springtide ; and many a pulpit , erewhile given over to a dry tradition of dogmas , kindled with the evidence of an unwonted vitality , as men really hoped to see the salvation of their God . " j The Rev. Alexander J. Scott , now a Professor in a College in Manchester , England . // was more and more confirming on this head , and enabling to disentangle the subject of the baptism of the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly confounded ; . . . . being called down to Scotland on some occasion , and residing for a while at his father 's house , which is in the heart of that district of Scotland upon which the light of Mr. Campbell 's ministry had arisen , he was led to open his mind to some of the godly people in those parts , and among others , to a young woman who was at that time lying ill of a consumption from which afterwards , when brought to the very close of death , she was raised up instantaneously by the mighty hand of God . Being a woman of a very fixed and constant spirit , he was not able , with all his power of statement and argument , which is unequaled by that of any man I have ever met with , to convince her of the distinction between regeneration and baptism with the Holy Ghost ; and when he could not prevail , he left her with a solemn charge to read over the Acts of the Apostles with that distinction in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to be the truth of God . . . In the month of December of the same year , 1829 , the handmaid of the Lord , to whom reference hath been made above , was led by the Spirit of God to read with a new light that blessed portion of His Word which is written in the 14th , 15th , and 16th chap ( ers of the Gospel according to John , and to find therein that seed of faith and hope which afterwards bore fruit in the manifestation of the Holy Ghost . . - . . Sometime between the 23d of March , 1880 , and the end of that month , on the evening of the Lord 's day , the gift of speaking with tongues was restored to the Church . Then He restored that which He took not away . ' The handmaiden of the Lord , of whom He made choice on that night to manifest forth in her His glory , had been long afflicted with a disease which the medical men pronounced to be a decline , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister had been hurried by the same malady some years before . Yet , while all around were anticipating her dissolution , she was in the strength of faith , meditating missionary labors among the heathen ; * and this night she was to receive the preparation of the Spirit  --  the preparation of the body she received not till some days after . It was on the Lord 's day , and one of her sisters , along with a female friend who had come to the house for that purpose , had been spending the whole day in humiliation , and fasting , and prayer before God , with a special respect to the restoration of the gifts . They had come up in the evening to the sick chamber of their sister , who was laid on a sofa , and , along with one or two others of the household , they were engaged in prayer together . When , in the midst of their devotion , the Holy Ghost came with mighty power upon the sickwoman as she lay in her weakness , and constrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Rev. W. R. Caird , who has labored as an Evangelist in many parts of Europe and America , has lately borne this witness of her : " And here I crave no apology for openly stating the fact , for which I have blessed the name of the Lord , and shall ever do so , that her longing to have an opportunity of testifying for God among those who gladly received that testi*nony and profited by it , was abundantly gratified . Not in Scotland and England alone , but in Canada and in Switzerland , she proved herself the most efficient helpmeet that ever missionary had in his arduous , but holy work . " // and with superhuman strength , in an unknown tongue , to the astonishment of all who heard , and to her own great edification and enjoyment in God ; for he that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself . ' She has told me that this first seizure of the Spirit was the strongest she ever had ; and that it was in some degree necessary it should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to it . " Almost immediately afterwards , there were similar manifestations in the family of the McDonalds , living in Port Glasgow , on the opposite shore of the Clyde . " They were distinguished , " says Mrs. Oliphant , " like these two young Campbells , for a profound and saintly piety , which had marked them out from their neighbors , and attracted to them many friends out of their own condition . The leading members of this houshold were two brothers , according to all report men of the soberest steadfast life , quietly laboring at their business , and in no way likely to be the subjects of extatic emotion . " Early in the Spring of 1830 , one of the sisters , who was very ill at the time , was suddenly lifted up in the Spirit , and made to pass through very wonderful experiences in which ( to use her own language ) she " felt surrounded by the heavenly hosts , a multitude which no man could number , and heard them saying , Allelulia , for the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language can express the glorious things which were made to pass before inc . I was constrained to cry for a speedy revelation of the glory that all flesh might see it. *** The family accounted for these remarkable experiences on the supposition that their sister was dying , knowing that holy persons have often had visions of God in the last moments of life . Nearly two months passed away without any unusual occurrence , when the following events took place as related by one of them : * We are reminded by this of our own Payson , who , upon his death-bed , was full of spiritual joy and rapture . " The Sun of righteousness , " he snid , " has been gradually drawing nearer and nearer ; appearing larger and brighter , as he approached ; and now he fills the whole hemisphere ; pouring forth a flood of glory , in which I seem to float like an insect in the beams of the sun , exalting , yet almost trembling , while I gaze on this excessive brightness . " voL . XXII. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually ill that I thought her dying . She had scarcely been able to have her bed made for a week . Mrs. and myself had been sitting quietly at the bedside , when the power of the Spirit came upon her . She said There will be a mighty outpouring of the Spirit this day ; ' and then broke forth in a most marvelous setting forth of the wonderful works of God ; and , as if her own weakness had been altogether lost in the strength of the Holy Ghost , continued with little or no intermission for two or three hours , in mingled prayer , praise , and exhortation . At dinner time James and George came home as usual , whom she addressed at great length ; concluding with a solemn prayer for James that he might at that time be endowed with the power of the Holy Ghost . Almost immediately James calmly said I have got it . ' He walked to the window and stood a minute or two . I looked at him , and almost trembled , there was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step and manner of most indescribable majesty walked up to Margaret 's bedside , and addressed her in those words of the twentieth psalm , Arise and stand upright . ' He repeated the words , took her by the hand , and she arose . We all sat down and took our dinner . After it , my brothers went to the building yard as usual , where James wrote to Miss Mary Campbell , commanding her in the name of the Lord to arise . The next morning , after breakfast , James said I am going to the quay to see if Miss Campbell is come across the water ; ' at which we expressed our surprise , as he had said nothing to us of having written to her , ( and she was thought to be dying ) . She came as he expected , declaring herself perfectly whole . " It is not strange that Mr. Irving should have heard with joy , and with a predisposition to believe , of this reviving of the gifts of the Holy Ghost . All that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ and the Church , had prepared him to welcome it . He dared not say of the Church , " that she was rich , and increased with goods , and had need of nothing , " for he knew that she was spiritually impoverished . lie believed the coming of the Bridegroom to be drawing nigh , and he saw the suitableness of such a work of restoration for the adorning of His Bride ; remembering that Paul thanked God for the Corinthians , that they " came behind in no gift , waiting for the Coining of our Lord Jesus Christ . " He knew that there was no limitation of them in the original grant to the primitive age , and he was ready to listen with openness of heart , and thankfulness of spirit , to the report that they were again bestowed . But be did not act rashly , nor come to any hasty conclusion . All that year he kept about his customary work as a pastor and preacher , being very much occupied with the controversy // about the IThman Nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , but in the month of August , three gentlemen , one of them a member of his session , and the other two members of the Church of England , spent several weeks at Port Glasgow , for the purpose of examining into the alledged manifestations . An account of this visit was connunnicated by one of them ( Mr. Cardale , a , solicitor in London , belonging to Baptist Noel 's congregation ) to the Morning Watch , for IDecember , 1830 . It is valuable as the testimony of a sound and sober-minded man , whose professional pursuits fitted him to weigh evidence with discriminatioli and irupartiality , and who was not acting at all under Mr. Irving 's influence . He says : " These persons , while utteriun the unknown sounds , as also while speaking * the Spirit in their own language , have every appearance of being under supernatural direction . The manner and voice are ( speaking generally ) different from what they are at other times , and on ordinary occasions . This difference does not consist merely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess ) , but their whole deportment gives an impression , not to be conveyed in words that their organs are made use of by supernatural power . In addition to the outward nppearances , their own declarations , as the declarations of honest , pious , and sober individuals , may with propriety be taken in evidence . They declare that their organs of speech are made use of by the Spirit of God ; and that they utter that which is given to them , and not the expressions of their own conceptions , or their own intentions . " Soon after the return of these gentlemen , meetings for prayer began to be held in private houses to ask of God the restoration of spiritual gifts . These were not established by Mr. Irving , nor were they attended exclusively by members of his congregation ; but devout persons of different communions , who had faith in the promises of God as to the outpouring of His Spirit , met together to unite their supplications for this end . It was not till the end of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first instance was in a iady  --  a member of the Church of Englandand in her own house . Not long afterwards , one or two young women of Mr. Irving 's flock received like gifts . This narrative of facts shows how far Mr. Irving was from acting rashly , as one swayed by his intense feelings and vivid imagin // 792 Edward Irving . ation , in a matter of so much moment ; and also how little he had to do with the beginnings of the movemnem*t . Others were far more influential than he in originating it . His part was to believe what God had by other agencies brought to pass , and then to give it his powerful advocacy . And on what grounds did he rest his faith that so mighty a thing had been done by the Holy Ghost , as to revive the gifts of Pentecost ? The North British reviewer admits that " Scripture does not authoritatively limit the time for the working of signs and wonders . ' We do not assert that the power is fore.ver departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exceeding care , and even with wholesome scepticism , any alledged irregularity in the common course of nature . " If by " wholesome scepticism " he means the disposition of unbelief , we say that this is not the proper state of mind in which a Christian should appoach the subject of God 's supernatural manifestations in His Church . He never commends it . It is the spirit of faith , not of scepticism , that He seeks for and rewards . " Because thou hast seen Me , thou hast believed ; blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed . " And the evidence which He gives of His workings is addressed to the spirit , rather than to the intellect . A child , or an ignorant woman , may have discernment of the Divine presence and manifestations where the sharpest philosophic acumen would be at fault . Spiritual things are spiritually discerned , and in their highest form they transcend altogether the noblest natural faculties . It is the pure in heart that see God . It is Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a spiritual intuition deeper and more penetrating than any processes of logic , and it is to this that God appeals in all His greatest works . Simple minded and true-hearted fishermen and peasants received Him whom the wisdom of this world rejected . Quantum 8umu8 *cimu8 ; the more we are like God , the more quickly and surely do we app rehend His revelations . Who does not feel that it was faith , not reasoning ; the trustful spirit of a little child , and not the " wholesome scepticism " of the schools , that opened the heart of Abraham to those Divine commandments and promises // which found no support in mere nature , but rested upon the naked word of God ? No one can look back over the various manifestations of Himself which He has made from the beginning , without seeing that it is the believing and obedient , rather than the philosophic , spirit , which has ever been quickest to sympathize with His purposes and to walk with Him in His ways . There must also be faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be wrought in the presence of all , and by most must be believed , if believed at all , on the testimony of others . It was on these principles that Mr. Irving acted in forming a judgment upon these manifestations . That the phenomena were supernatural , he had the testimony of the persons who were the subjects of them-men and women of sound minds and blameless lives , whose declarations on any other subject within their own knowledge , would have been received without a moment 's hesitation . And that they were of God , and not of Satan , he was assured by the character of the utterances* themselves , which he found to be , what St. Paul says * Mrs. Oliphant speaks slightingly , if not contemptuously , of the prophetic utterances . In relation to this , we extract the following from a pamphlet recently published in Edinburgh : " Observations on Mrs. Oliphant 's Life of Edward Irving , by David Ker , Esq . " Mr. Ker was one of Mr. Irving 's deacons , and has been acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here but take notice also , of the decidedly false impression to which Mrs. Oliphant 's narrative leads , regarding the nature and value of the spokea words of prophecy in the churches . Some words are cited , which were published by individuals who chose to attend the meeting of Mr. Irving 's flock , but who could not fail to give an untrue impression of what took place there . The words so cited convey very imperfect ideas , as indeed they must have done when read in an isolated form , without the essential elements of interpretation furnished by the time , place , and circumstances in which they were uttered , by the lessons read , or the discourse delivered on the occasion . Thus divorced from their context , and , it may be , as I can vouch to be the case in some of them , most inaccurately reported , they convey a totally erroneous impression of what the word of prophecy is ; they misrepresent both the style and substance of prophetic words , the utterance of which has been of constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostles . Those only who have experienced the benefit received from the word of prophecy , in giving light for opening scripture ; in interpreting types and symbols ; in unfolding the secrets of the heart , and in revealing the knowledge of God and Ills ways and purposes , can judge of the reality of the gift , and the inestimable benefits the Church has received from this source . " // prophesying was in his day , " unto edification , and exhortation , and comfort . " " Such depths of doctrine " ( he says in his letter to Fraser ) , " such openings of truth , such eagleglances into the mind of God , such purity of love , such earnestness of exhortation , and , in one word , such heavenly exaltation of spirit , heard I never from man 's lips , as I have heard from those speaking in this manner by the Holy Ghost . " Nor was he alone in his convictions . Men most unlike him in every intellectual and spiritual trait , were as firm as he in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The late Mr. Henry Drummond , one of the k*enest and most sarcastic intellects of the day , and a remorseless hater of shams and pretences ; as fearless in exposing , as he was sharp-sighted in detecting , all imposture and charlatanry ; a man whose whole character was in antagonism to the fanaticism that is bred in excited crowds , of the highest culture , and the widest acquaintance with society ; who had already been a member of Parliament , and sat again from 1847 to his death-twelve or thirtecn years-as the representative of his county ; - this man , who won for himself the universal respect of the country by his independence , his boldness , his integrity , and his sound conservative principles , which yet never carried him into factions opposition to any administration , not only believed in the reality of the spiritual manifestations , but was himself the subject of them . Ilis own account of his experience is as follows : " So soon as the manifestations occurred in London , I watched them nnrrowly ; I found persons uninstructed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine , condensed into a few abrupt sentences , such as no living divine could utter . I heard everything they said tend to exalt Jesus , and to abase the creature ; I felt a sympathy in all that was expressed with something within myself ; I experienced the spoken word to be like a two-edged sword , dividing soul and marrow , and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart , in the detection and rebuke of sin Although I soon found my requests answered by a greater spirit of grace of supplication being given me , and by a fuller realization of God as Love  --  and consequently a greater confidence in Him than I ever had before-nothing particular occurred until the 29th of the above-mentioned July ( 1832 ) , when , during an utterance of the Spirit through Mrs. Caird , which , however , contained nothing remarkable , either in word or manner , I felt an extraordinary anxiety for the souls of men , and particularly for some persons pres // ent. and a most earnest desire that they should enter into Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , which then appeared peculiarly near ; so that I was constrained to cry out to all present , with a loud voice , to enter now . This took place at family prayers in the evening ; and as soon as they were over , I retired to my own room , and on my knees implored my Heavenly Father , if this were excitement or delusion , to let it pass from me ; hut that if it were of His own Spirit , he would cause the same power to return quickly , and abide on me ever . Upon joining some other persons afterwards , I felt their most religious expressions cold to express the sensations I myself had ; there was a realization of the presence of God in Christ , and of my own oneness with Jesus , diffusing a joy such as no words can descrihe ; and just in proportion as I have been enabled ever since to abide all day long in Him , so is the power of the Spirit mi , , hty within me to tell forth His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command this power to come upon me ; nor can I tell beforehand what will be given me to say , the subject and the power coming together ; while , on the other hand , if I repress or withhold what I am prompted to utter , I feel a grief of the Spirit which must he experienced to be understood . I am therefore as conscious as I am of my existence , of a power within me , yet distinct from me ; not using me as a mere machine , hut heading my will and affections to love , to glorify Jesus ; giving a peace and joy , and love to God and man , passing all understandino " We give this testimony of one as iinlike*y as any man in all England , to have been the victim of imposture or hallucination , to show that to ascribe Mr. Irving 's faith in spiritual gifts to his imagination , is no solution of the problem . Mrs. Ohiphaut does him this injustice in saying , " Of all men in the world , perhaps this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grandeur upon everything which interested him deeply ; with his perfect trust in other men , and tender sympathy with all genuine emotion , was least qualified to institute the searching and severe investigation which the case demanded . " The imagination is closely allied with the faculty of spiritual intuition , and tho*e who possess it in large degree are always foremost to apprehend the deep things of God , even if they lack the practical wisdom to deal with them aright . No man had more of penetrating insight than Mr. Irving to reach through the outward husk to the living germ within , and to detect the underlying principle in manifold varieties of manifestation . Let a spiritual phenomenon be submitted to his discernment , and no one could pierce through all folds of circumstance to the essential truth more swiftly // and unerringly . But men that were most unimaginative , and in whom sharp common sense or robnst judgment predominated , were not one whit behind him in faith and devotedness . In respect to the gift of tongues , * it is remarkable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting any such power of utterance in unknown forms of speech as came upon them . They had shared in the general opinion of the Church that it was the gift of speaking in foreign languages for the endowment of the m ? ssionary ; and Miss Campbell at first supposed that the tongue in which she was constrained to speak , was that of those heathen Islanders to whom she had been purposing to go . The best critics and interpreters are now agreed that the tongues spoken of by St. Paul , in his first Epistle to the Corinthians , were not known languages , and were not used for the preaching of the Gospel , but for personal edification , and as a sign to others  --  a sign of the presence of the Holy Ghost thus using the organs of a man beyond his comprehension , or of the unbelief and unpreparedness of men constraining Him to conceal under " another tongue** what it was in His heart to say . The testimony of one who had received this gift , is thus narrated by Mr. Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said one of the gifted persons to me , however fixed my soul be upon God and Him only , I am conscious to other thoughts and desires , which the very words I use force in before me . I am like a man holding straight forward to his home full in view , who , though be diverge neither to the right hand nor to the left , is ever solicited by the many well known objects on every hand of him . But the moment I am visited with the Spirit , and carried out to God in a tongue which I know not , it is as if a deep covering of snow had fallen on all the country round , and I saw nothing but the object of my desire , and the road which leadeth unto it . I am more conscious than ever to the presence of God . lie and He only , is in my soul . I am filled with some form of the mind of God , be it joy , or grief , desire , love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am made to utter it in words which are full of power over my spirit ; but not being accessible to my understanding , my devotion is not in. terrupted by associations or suggestions from the visible or intellectual world ; I feel myself as it were , shut in with God into His own pavilion . " * The specimen of the tongues given in the North British Review as taken from the Morning Watch ( a " Quarterly Journal on Prophecy , and Theological Review , " published from 1829 to 1833 ) , is not to be found in that JournaL // During the summer and early autumn of 1831 , * these manifestations in " tongues and prophesyings " were going on in * It may interest our readers , and a little relieve the subject , to give the following sketch of him at this time , which was communicated to us by a friend : " My first personal knowledge of Edward Irving was in 1831 . I had in common with the world at large , heard and read much of him during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been not a little impressed by his commanding person , his striking Miltonic cast of countenance and arrangement of hair , and the somewhat antique style of his studiously clerical costume . One evening in the summer of that year , I catered for the first time Mr. Irving 's church in Regent Square , which was full without being crowded , and I had no difficulty in finding a convenient place . The first effect on my mind was awe at the deep stillness pervading the whole congregation . On every face , within my observation , appeared vividly depicted lofty enthusiasm united with the deepest devotion . I had never before witnessed such manifestly intense emotion in such a multitude , kept under a control so perfect . They seemed to me , one and all , to be under the most profound and undoubting consciousness of the divine presence in their midst , and Presented the aspect of a people of one heart and one mind . ' When I entered the church , Mr. Irving . whom I had never heard in public before , was giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version used in the Scotch church , Let Ged arise , and scattered Let all His en'mies be , ' &amp;c . After reading , he proceeded to comment on the verses to be sung , in their order . His words were heard with a profound attention and interest , for which I could not account . To me his manner seemed to be unduly vehement , his gestures ungraceful , his Scottish accent and dialect somewhat uncouth and barbarous , and his language harsh and prolix . The comment was mainly an exposition of what were then called Millenarian doctrines , the truth of which , to say nothing of their momentous importance , I had not so fully appreciated at that time , as I was soon afterwards enabled to do , and I thought his earnestness in enforcing these matters unnecessary , and his denunciations of their opponents unsparing and unwarrantable . He dwelt with , what seemed to me , special unction on the discomfiture and destruction of God 's enemies , in the spirit , as I thought , of a minister of the solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal persecutors ; and feeling myself somewhat obnoxious to his censures , I was rather offended than edified , and left with my previous prejudices confirmed . I mention these particulars without reserve , having to this day a vivid recollection of them , in order to show how much a more favorable estimate of Mr. Irving had to contend against in my mind . About this period , I entered upon the work of the Christian ministry , and formed acquaintance with some prominent members of Mr. Irving 's church . At a dinner party in the house of one of these I mentioned that I had received an invitation to supply the place of a clergyman in B. , whose health required cessation from his work for a short period , but that a request was added that I would not advance Millenarian doctrine in his pulpit . My friends attempted to dissuade me from accepting this invitation , considering // private houses at meetings for prayer and the reading of the Scriptures , and for several weeks also in the daily morning it a shrinking from duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline an opening for the testimony of other truths as important . They then expressed a wish to hear Mr. Irving 's judgment on the matter . Next day I was not a little surprised to receive a note from Mr. Irving himself , inviting me to his breakfast table on the following morning . Thither I went accordingly , not sorry to make the acquaintance of so remarkable a man , though by no means prepossessed in his favor . This was my first introduction to Edward Irving . I was receivedby him with great cordiality , and immediately introduced to several distinguished persons who had also been invited , but he was himself facile princeps amongst them all , not from any effort to display himself , but rather to elicit what was in others . This his manifest ascendency , and kindly consideration for every one , enabled him to effect , for all seemed at ease in his company . When the party began to break up , Mr. Irving asked me if I would accompany hii to his study for a private interview , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here he at once opened the subject of my communication from B. , and objected with great earnestness against the condition prescrihed , but was silenced when I told him that I felt bound by what I considered implied assent to the application , and that my friend was fully expecting me , although I had given no formal answer . He then proceeded to the great question of the Lord 's coming , which he treated with such demonstration of the Spirit and power , as led m* to see its transcendent interest and importance , as I had not previously done . I was then but a stripling , little more than of age , fresh fiom the University , and had just received authority for the ministry . He was my senior in years , and in the ministry , and incalculably my superior in every othel respect , but he so brought himself to the level of my ignorance and inexperience , that the embarrassing sense of the disparity between us was effectually removed . I afterwards had opportunities of knowing how faithfully he observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might be great men , or gifted men , but because they were men , although none knew better than he how to appreciate such distinctions . This interview made a deep and lasting impression on my mind , and was the beginning of a friendship which continued till his death in December , 1834 , and which I valued as of inestimable price . having fulfilled my engagement in B. , I returned to London and soon made another visit to the National Scotch Church . I found Mr. Irving engaged in publicly receiving a number of members to the church . Each of these was addressed individually on receiving a tokenof membership , in a few words of solemn and impressive eloquence , suited to their several conditions , indicating intimate acquaintance with them , and calculated to have a powerful influence on their subsequent life . The service occupied nearly three hours , but riveted the attention and interest of the large congregation to the last . To myself it was a memorable occasion . Soon after this I went to B. , and there continued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving 's life . I was not a member of his church , had never partaken of the Lord 's Supper under his ministry , and had no partiality for Presbyterianism . B. was then a long day 's journey from London , where I had no business , but as often as // meetings of the Church ; but it was with gre at deliberation and even reluctance , that Mr. Irving consented to their having place in the public services of the Lord 's day . He waited long that his people might have every opportunity of " trying the spirits " whether they were of God ; and he describes himself as " burdened in conscience " through fear of acting precipitately . Nor did he finally allow it until he felt that to forbid it longer would be to grieve the Holy Ghost ; for a female of his congre*atiou , under a strong impulse to utterance , which she strove to restrain , " fled out of the Church into the vestry , " ( they are his own words ) , " but found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that volume of ma , jestic sound which passed through two closed doors , and filled the whole Church . " From that time his mind was made up that the voice of the Spirit should not be restrained , by his authority , in the Lord 's house . The result was , what might have been foreseen , a storm of reproach and persecution , before which most men would have cowered and fled . Excited crowds rushed to the clmrch to hear the startling " utterances , " which sometimes burst forth with a power to fill the stoutest heart with fear . The press , religious and secular , scoffed at the " Tongues " as a wicked imposture , or the wildest fanaticism . This Mr. Irving could bear , for he was a lion-hearted man , whose courage rose with the tempest ; but the falling away*of old friends , who had stood by him in all his previous conflicts , well nigh broke his heart . Many of the dearest and the most honored , from whom he had found counsel and sympathy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow or in anger , for making such a shipwreck . " Coleridge poured out an eloquent tribute I could , I took the journey , solely to attend his ministry , which I found more instructive and valuable the more I heard it , and to cultivate his acquaintance more closely . From his instruction I learned more of Christian truth , and from his example more of the Christian life , than from any other man . I ever found his house a home to me , or if it should be already full , as it often was , then that of some of his friends , during very frequent visits to London . To a very large number of young men , earnest in purpose to devote themselves to God 's service , and from various ranks of society , I found him to be , as to myself , a guide , a counselor , and friend , and his early , and I may call it , tragical death , left among us a blank which never can be supplied on earth again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetically that such a man should be throwing himself away . ' " " Thomas Carlyle and his wife , both much beloved , not oniy disagreed , but remonstrated ; the former making a vehement protestation against the Bedlam ' and chaos'to which his friend 's steps were tending , which Irving listened to in silence , covering his face with his hands . " But he was inflexible . It was with him a simple matter of obedience to God , and nothing could shake him . That voice , which to many wise and good men was a jargon , or a mere ontbreak of excited feeling , was to him the utterance of the Holy Ghost , and he dared not silence it . Here ; no doubt , is one of the hardest problems that meet us in this life . How can we account for such contradictory judgments by Christian men ? We can only throw ont a hint or two towards the solution . It must be remembered , then , not only that the mere intellect fails when it ventures to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , different degrees of spiritual as of natural discernment . Many apprehend truth in its more outward relations , who can not enter into its imnost life and power . Amongst the Apostles themselves , John had the keenest spiritual vision , and reached the fruth by no slow processes of reasoning , but by a divine intuition . The same appearance of the grave clothes which conveyed no meaning to the zealous but slower-minded Peter , flashed upon the beloved disciple the conviction that Jesus was risen . Love is ever quickest to discern the presence and the actings of the loved one . The deepest sympathy is accompanied by the readiest apprehension . The spirit of obedience is also most helpful to spiritual discernment , according to our Lord 's word , " If ye will do the will of my Father , ye shall know of the doctrine whether it is of God . " Where there is not willingness to follow Christ at any cost , there can not be perfect freedom from prejudice ; the eye must be single , that the whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a time of transition , when there is " a change from era to era , " and God has some new disclosure of His purposes to make , and some unlooked-for and perilous work to do . Then He calls for // 801 m*n to lead the forlorn hope who can forsake all things , and to them He first reveals the secrets of His heart . The position in which Mr. Irving was placed by his recognition of spiritual gifts , and the liberty he gave to their exercise in his church , was one of great responsibility and trial . It was a new region of temptations , as well as of experiences , into which he and his flock were lifted up . The possession of a gift does not ensure the wise and profitable exercise of it . There may be grave defects of character in those thus endowed ; they may fall into sin , and become unfit vessels for the Spirit 's use ; or they may even be overcome by the wiles of Satan , and be made his tools . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to distinguish between the manifestations of the Holy Ghost , and the counterfeits and mockeries which fleshly excitement and the subtlety of the Devil might bring in ; to determine the true meaning and bearings of the word of prophecy ; and to be a guide and counselor to those who were thus used of God . The following year was one of great trial , anxiety , and sorrow . One of his flock was tempted , on two or three occasions , to simulate the voice of the Holy Ghost . Evil spirits mingled their utterances with those of the Comforter . And many were the occasions of stunibling given to the world without , through the ignorance and frailty of those who were thus lifted up into a new world of spiritual power and excitement . There is great truth in the following admirable passage from the chapter on " Miracles and Spiritual Gifts , " in Dr. Bush . nell 's work on " Nature and the Supernatural : " " It does not follow , because one heals the sick , or speaks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmities as a fallen man . He is taken with the stare of multitudes , gives way to a subtle ambition , magnifies overmuch his particular gift , runs into shows of conceit , grows impatient of contradiction , and loosens the rage of passion-by that , driving himself into wild excesses both of opinion and practice  --  and finally coming to a full end , as one burnt up in the fierceness of his own heat . As before , without the miracles and gifts , religion went down to extinction , under the wear of mere routine , so now the miracles and the gifts have issued in a wild Corinthianism , which // whole chapters of Apostolic lecture can hardly reduce to *obriety . " There were , no doubt , many such extravagances in the infancy of this movement both in Scotland* and in England . How could it have been otherwise , where all were ignorant and inexperienced ; remembering that the vessel is earthen , though the power may be of God ; and that there is an enemy ever on the watch to mar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these things could shake the faith of Mr. Irving , or quench the ardor of his hope . lie recognized the presence of the Holy Ghost in the midst of , and overpowering , all these elements of evil ; and he never doubted that the struggling dawn , though many clouds strove to hide it , would lead on to a glorious day . While he was thus cherishing the spiritual gifts , and doing his best to guide his flock amidst these untried and perplexing circumstances , there came suddenly from the North of England a blazing meteor athwart his path , bringing a new element of power , and ultimately of trouble , into the movement of which his church had now become the centre . A devout and able man of the Church of England , a lawyer of eminence in Yorkshire by the name of Robert Baxter , appeared in their assemblies with a mightier gift than had as yet been manifested . lie had heard of the spiritual manifestations in Scotland , and believed them to be of God , and when on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in attendance on the meetings in Mr. Irving 's congregation , he was himself made to speak in supernatural power , and with an energy and ful * The following ingenuous confession of some of these errors and mistakes , is taken from a " Letter to the Rev. Robert II . Story , by W. R. Caird , " who married Miss Campbell : " You know well that both previous and subsequent to the restoration of the voice of the Spirit of the Lord in 1830 , Mrs. Caird , in common with many on both sides of the Clyde , regarded the casual opening of the Scriptures after prayer for direction , as the express mind of God , revealed for the particular case before them : and that the texts thus got , ' as it was termed , were thought to be , and actually called , the speaking of the Lord , and warrants for faith , and thus proved the source of much mistake and consequent disappointment . These things were not done or directed by any utterance of the Spirit , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , but ill-taught children of God , feeling their way in midst of much darkness and stumbling towards a better state of things . " // ness of utterance , and a tone of authority , which had appeared in no one else . He gave forth many new and wonderful openings of Scripture , and was received and deferred to by Mr. Irving , as one having a great prophetic gift , and destined to do some mighty work in the Church . But it was a gift without control , running wild , and over-mastering its possessor . Mr. Baxter was in a false position . He was under no spiritual authority and guidance , and , it would appear , not willing to be under any ; and it was inevitable that his gift should be misunderstood , if not misused , and involve him in trouble . After an erratic course lasting only a few weeks , the failure of some predictions which he had been made to utter-their failure according to the interpretation he had put upon them  --  and his persuasion that Mr. Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , led him to renounce the work as not of God , but of Satan . In the " Narrative of Facts which he published the following year , he expressed his deliberate conviction that it was no mere excitement or delusion , but the effect of a supernatural power.t In the Prefac* he says , " Another observation deserves remark Why persuade yourself that the work was supernatural ? ' Glad , indeed , would . the writer be , if he could , upon safe grounds , persuade himself otherxvise. ile has often endeavored to pursue the course of circumstances , and account for the occurrences from excitement , and the frenzied workings of a distempered mind ; but he finds himself utterly at a loss , and without shutting his eyes to most of the material facts of the case , he could not honestly come to such a conclusion . " On Baxter 's own statements , Mr. Irving was shut up to one of two conclusions : either that the whole body of spiritual ut * Of this " Narrative " Mrs. Oliphant says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the truth and genuine character of these spiritual manifestations . After reading such a narrative , it is impossible to dream of trickery ; and very difficult to believe in mere delusion , although the sole object of the writer in the extraordinary and touching tale , is to show that he had deceived himself , and was no prophet " ( rather that he had been taken in a snare , nad had spoken in the power of an evil spirit ) . t On a visit to this country last year , Mr. Baxter , in the hearing of some friends of ours , reaffirmed his conviction that the power in which he spake was supernatural . // terances was the work of Satan , or that they were of the Holy Ghost , yet not without some admixture of evil . Between these alternatives it was clearly impossible that he should hesitate , without doing violence to all his perceptions of truth . He felt that what came to him in these new forms of manifestation , was in harmony with all that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , and he could not but refer it to the Spirit of Christ. * That a work of God should be counterfeited by His enemy , seemed to him no reason for rejecting it . As long as the tares are to grow with the wheat , he knew that there must be misapprehensions and perversions even of real spiritual gifts . " The signs and wonders , " he said , " are demonsti*ations of supernatural power ; but whether from the region of spiritual good or of spiritual evil descending , the fact of their being above nature determineth not . This is to be known by their character , of grace , and goodness , and blessing , or of violence , and malice , and destructiveness . The diabolical possessions were witnessed in the torture which they brought , and the Divine Power in delivering from the same , and bringing back to peace of conscience , soundness of mind , and health of body . And so shall it continue to be evidenced unto the end ; an evil *spiritnal world contending with the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to seduce the faith and obedience of men . " * How Mr. Irving accounted for his friend 's fall , we learn from his speech before the London Presbytery a few days after Baxter told him that he had renounced the werk : " A dear friend of my own , who lately spake by the Spirit of God in my Church-as all the spiritual of the Church fully acknowledged , and almost all acknowledge still-I mean Mr. Baxter , whose n*me is in everybody 's mouth , hath , I believe , been taken in this very snare of endeavoring to interpret , by means of a mind remarkably formal in its natural structure , the spiritual utterances which he was made to give forth ; and perceiving a want of concurrence between the word and the fulfillment , he hastily said , It is a lying Spirit by which I have spoken . ' No lie is of the truth ; no prophet is a liar ; and if the thing came not to pass , he bath spoken presumptuously . But while this is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began has been able to interpret the time , place , manner , and circumstance of the fulfillment of his own utterances . And to Jeremiah thus unwarrantably employing himself , God seemed to be a deceiver and a liar , as the Holy Ghost hath seemed to be to my honored and beloved friend , whom may the Lord speedily restore again . " // And yet we can not help thinking that in spite of the general soundness of his principles as to spiritual gifts , and the wisdom and sobriety which ordinarily marked his pastoral ministry , one of the greatest of Mr. Irving 's failures was in this ease of Robert Baxter . He was too0mueh overborne by the power of his utterances , and yielded to him a place which belongs to no prophet , however great his gift , in the Christian Church , in which the headahip of Christ subordinates to itself the manifestations of the ILfoly Ghost , and the Spirit works in obedience to His will . All spiritual powers are under His authority , and they can be safely exercised only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , Apostles ; secondarily , Prophets , " was the order of God in the beginning . It is a violation of that order for a prophet to be under no control , and to take upon himself the interpretation of his own words , and the carrying out of what he may conceive to be contained in them. * Mr. Baxter was not a member of Mr. Irving 's flock , and therefore not subject to his pastoral rule ; nor was he , in respect to his prophetic gift , under any ecclesiastical restraint  --  a position most perilous to himself , and contrary to the law of Christ . Mr. Irving erred in perri1itting him , when in this state of independency , not to say lawlessness , to give the loose rein to his spiritual impulses . We think that he plainly erred in some of the interpretations which he gave to Baxter 's words , and was thns led into unfounded expectations in regard to the immediate future . If he ever lost the poise and balance of his judgment , it was when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance , which , with all his remarkable insight , he failed fully to comprehend , and to , which , notwithstanding his great boldness and decision , and his firm vindication of authority , he yielded too unquestioning an obedience . * Amongst the many unwarrantable things which Mr. Baxter did as the selfconstituted judge and fulfiller of his own words , were his going to the Court of Chancery with the expectation of interrupting its proceedings by bearing a witness in the power of the Spirit against the sins of the kingdom ; and his officiating in the Church of England as a minister , in violation of her canons , and of all ecclesiastical order . // And yet he saw clearly , and pointed out with great truth and beauty , the causes of Baxter 's fall : " Therefore it is , thou hast fallen , because thou wouldest be both giver and receiver , both utterer and container , both prophet and angel , and pastor and teacher ; and so , by usurping all offices , which dignity belongeth only to Jesus , thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block in the way of the Lord . " Baxter 's brief and meteor-like career terminated in April , 1832 , by his renunciation of the work ; and the following month the doors of the church in Regent Square were closed against Mr. Irving . This was done by the London Presbytery , which had legal jurisdiction in the case by the provisions of the trust deed , constituting it a tribunal before which any complaints against the minister as " unworthy or unfit to be continued in his office , " might be brought . A majority of the trustees , disliking the spiritual manifestations , after ineffectual endeavors to persuade Mr. Irving to exclude them from the public services on the Lord 's day , complained to the Presbytery . He was not now a member of it , having withdrawn himself because it would not follow the Lord 's rule of discipline in dealing with him for his alleged errors touching the Humanity of Christ ; and it had afterwards cut him off for heresy . This act of excommunication did not affect his standing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming no component part of that church , and being little more than a voluntary association of ministers and elders . Before this body he appeared to plead against the charge that he had permitted disorderly interruptions of the public worship of God , in violation of Presbyterian order and discipline . It w*ould have been more generous , not to say just , for the Presbytery to have declined sitting in judgment on a question which it was all but impossible it could examine with judicial fairness ; especially as the trust-deed provided that , in such an event , the matter should be referred to the pew-holders , to whom it properly belonged . But it chose to exercise its legal right , and a long and exciting trial was had . Mrs. Ohphant has given Mr. Irving 's defense , which occupied the greater part of two days , in an Appendix ( omitted , we know // 807 not why , in the second edition of her book ) ; and we commend it to all who wish to see his exposition of the great doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking in the power of the Spirit , as was done in the primitive Church , was not forbidden , because not intended to be forbidden , by the Church of Scotland . It is remarkable that in the second Book of Discipline of that Church , it is said that the offices of apostle , prophet , and evangelist , have now ceased , except when it please God extraordinarily for a time to stir some of them up again . " This Mr. Irving urged , He had now done . 1'Ie had revived the prophetic gift , and he , as an obedient servant of the Lord Jesus Christ , had permitted its exercise for the honor of his Master , and the edification of the Church . All turned upon the question of fact , whether God had indeed restored again the gifts of Pentecost . It was really a matter of spiritual discernment , more than of ecclesiastical law ; although the Presbytery insisted on looking at it as a question of mere order , and refused to allow any appeal to the Scriptures . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint , testified that they believed the " utterances " to be of the Holy Ghost-one of them , that he himself had spoken , in tongues and prophesyings , in the power of the Spirit ;  - -  -   --  but it is not surprising , considering the temper of the times , that these ministers and elders , who would not look beyond the Scotch standards , were able to see only disorderly proceedings of persons who were neither " ministers nor hicentiates of the Church of Scotland , " in what to Mr. Irving was the begimmi ng of a mighty work of God . The following Sunday was to be the Coniinunion season , a which a large accession of members was expected ( " and as I sat yesterday in my vestry for nearly five hours , " he said in his Defense , " examining applicants for the liberty of sitting down with my contemned and rejected Church ) ; " but the very next morning , or morning but one , after the verdict was rendered , " the daily congregation gathering to their matins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It had been built for his use , amid on the " credit of his name " - very much by the contributions of Englishmen , his personal friends , who had // no special attachment to the Church of Scotland ;  --  and a very large majority of the communicants , and of the congregation , did not desire his removal , and even memorialized the Presbytery against it . It certainly seems an act of injustice that for what was complained of only as disorderly , and was really less an interruption of the regular services than many things which have been tolerated before and since ( as the " Men " of the Highlands , and the late " Revivals , " ) a holy and faithful pastor with his flock of nearly eight hundred communicants should have been driven forth from the building which their liberality had reared , and have been left literally homeless . But it could not well have been otherwise . Spiritual 4ifts , if they were not prohibited by the laws , yet did not harmonize with the genius , of Presbyterianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit of blessing could only appear where they would be bound by no sectarian shackles . What the Presbytery really decided was , that the Church of Scotland had made no provision for the supernatural manifestations of the Holy Ghost . This was quite true , and any attempt to graft them upon its order and discipline , would have been as injurious as to pour new wine into old bottles . If the Spirit were truly making His voice to be heard as in the beginning , He should have a liberty which no existing Church constitution could give Him , framed , as all had been , on the supposition that His gifts had ceased . The new power could not but make rending work with the old institutions . It was the instinctive feeling of this which alarmed Presbyterianism , and provoked it to a decision which , in Mr. Irving 's judgment , turned the Holy Ghost out of doors , but was really meant to defend its own life against what it took to be an enemy . Those to whom the Kirk of Scotland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to look kindly upon an intruding elemerit , the laws and movements of which they were unable to calculate . Men are bound to stand by the old things , where their spiritual discernment fails to detect the new forms of the Divine actings . Nor , on the other hand , could Mr. Irving do otherwise than he did . Believing that the Holy Ghost was speaking again by // 809 the mouths of men , he must endure the loss of all things rather than silence His voice . When the Church in iRegent Square was dedicated , Dr. Chalmers preached from the words , " Thus saith the Lord , Stand ye in the ways , and see , and ask for the old paths , where is the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls . " And a good old Scotch minister in London , Dr. Waugh , came to Mr. Irving after the services were over , and said in the broad Scotch accent , shaking him warmly by the hand , " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new church . I awoke at five o'clock this morning , and as I lay thinking about it , the Lord gave me a name , and it is Jehovah Sharnrnah , Mw lord is tkere . " The solemn charge of that dedication sermon he had endeavored to obey , and the promise of that name he believed God to have fulfilled . He had asked for the old paths , not of the Westminster Assembly alone , nor of the Reformation alone , though to these he gave due honor , but going back to the originessacras , the true and holy beginnings of the Christian Church . He had sought for the ancient gifts of God , and vindicated the full privilege of them for all His faithful people ; and when the Spirit had manifested His presence again as a Person , by speaking through servants and handmaidens , he had given Him welcome . And now he was only suffering the common fate of martyrs and confessors , in being driven forth from the church where he had boldly stood as a witness to his Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His servant by the voice of the Comforter . He went forth as a pilgrim and stranger in very deed , for every sacred place was shut against him . It was on Friday morning that the doors of his church were found closed , and all that day diligent search was made by himnseW and his elders , and his deacons , but no chapel in London was proffered for their use . The only place that could be had was the ball and concert room occupied by the infidel Owen for his lectures , and there on the Sunday afternoon , Mr. Irving Tadministered the Communion to his large flock . Rejected by the religious world , he found a temporary refuge and a contemptuous toleration amidst the haunts of unbelief . That was their place of meeting through the summer // months , but as it was too small for the numbers that still thronged to hear him , he preached much out of doors . " Multitudes stand hushed before him on those summer days , " says Mrs. Oliphant , " as on the parched suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he preaches the Gospel of his Master , with an eloquence deeper and richer , a devotion more profound and perfect , than when the greatest in the land crowded to his feet , and all that was most wise and most fair in society listened and thrilled to his prophet voice. ** We know not if any records of his sermons during this and the subsequent years of his ministry remain . They were not written ;  --  the labors and anxieties of his life would have left him little time for toilsome preparations for the pulpit , even if his deliberate judgment had not preferred the greater treedom of extemporaneous discourse . " I begin to find , " he says about this time , " that the tongue , not the pen , is the instrument for uttering the mind ; and that the heart of man , not books , is the place wherein to record it . This is a poor substitute for my preaching . There the Lord gives me to express some portion of His living truth ; but when I take these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence of every thought and feeling escapes from me , and it is a poor residue that I can preserve. *** But if we may judge from his occasional writings , there must have been in his preaching , if less of intellectual splendor , far more of spiritual insight and heart-breaking tenderness than before . He seems to have learned from the utterances of the Spirit deeper lessons of love and sorrow , and to have been brought into closer and holier sympathy with the mind of Christ . Thus , in speaking of " Jesus our Example , " he says : * Mr. Irving 's example should not be taken as decisive on the question between written and extemporaneous discourses . He was a great master of both , and , no doubt , the careful and elaborate studies of his earlier years , helped to give him that range of thought and mastery of language which always characterized his preaching . He was a man , too , of intense feeling , and of almost unbounded powers of imagination ; both of which are so helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will meditiite on the Scriptures as lie did , and abide in the communion of the Spirit , he need not be always chained down to written words . // " Be it , therefore , fixed and settled in your hearts , 0 ye servants of the Lord , that ye must know God as a forgiving Father , and yourselves as his beloved and favored children , crc ever you can do for Him one nct of right profitable service . While a man is standing in doubt and dread of God , the darkness and dismay which he suffcreth within his own heart , the sadness and the gloom , are all against God , denying and confessing Him not , telling of Him as the hard master and the stern judge , and not as a perfect Saviour from sin , and the most merciful Father of goodness to the sinner .

Peace , therefore , towards God , through the blood of the Lord *lesus Christ , is the inlet to our Father 's sorrow , and the beginning of our Father 's service ; and the continuance of it standeth in our freedom from sin ; for if we commit sin , then stay we the current of our Father 's love to men , hy the barrier of our own concern for ourselves ; instead of going out with the blessing we have to go in for forgiveness ; instead of shining out with peace and joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of expressing through us His yearning love over sinners is sadly prevented by our unholiness ; if we had the confidence of sons , and the obedience of sons , which Jesus had , the Father would fill us with the same mighty stream of pity , and compassion , and sorrow with which He filled Him Ah ! the Son of God hath indeed foiled Satan in that fall which he wrestled with flesh , and down , down , in the depths of mortality hath made it tell a tale of God , over which creation shall sing eternal anthems ; the tale of God 's love to the unloving , the tale of God 's pathetic sorrow over the rebellious , the tale of God 's purpose to save and exalt the most worthless and ungrateful of Ills creatures , because He is good , because his mercy endureth for ever .

And the way whereby he prepareth us for such blessed service , is by making us believe God 's love to ourselves , which apprehendeth us for sons , all loathsome as we lie , and washing us at once in the blood of Jesus , doth lay us in the security arid confidence of His own bosom , the nearest to Him of all creatures ; more near to Him than any creature , near to Him as his only begotten Son . " In October , 1832 , Mr. Irving and his congregation removed to the spacious rooms in Newman street , which had been occupied by the painter West , and which they found in all re // most their purposes . Here they remained spects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-until the noble edifice in which they now worship , in Gordon Square , was built . Soon after their removal to Newman street , an event occurred of great importance in the progress of the movement , and , in its ultimate consequences , much affecting Mr. Irving 's relation to it . hitherto he had been the acknowledged leader , not as clahuing or exercising any authority beyond the bounds of his own flock , but as the pastor who had first given shelter and protection to the gifts of the Spirit , and within whose charge they had been chiefly manifested . He had qualities which eminently fitted him to be a leader in any work to which he devoted himself ; great power of winning the affections of men , boldness , decision , fiery eloquence , and far-reaching insight ; and up to this time that place had been , not officially , but morally as it were , and from the necessities of the case , devolved upon him . But at this period a new step was taken , and a higher office developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing , was the recovery of all which the Lord had given to His church when He was exalted to be her Head , in order that by the help of every ministry and every gift , she might be prepared for his coming in glory . In his speech before the Presbytery in April , he said , " The body needeth to be edified , and we are not yet come to the measure of the stature of Christ ; and I believe the Lord will seal Apostles , I believe the Lord hath sealed Prophets , " &amp;c . If God had indeed begun to restore His ancient gifts , there was reason to believe that H e would , in due time , restore them all ; and that no channel of His grace , and no means of spiritual growth and blessing , would be withheld . In the beginning , Apostles were first in time as well as in place , being chosen by the Lord Himself while upon the earth , that He might prepare them by His personal instructions to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to be an Apostle long after the Lord 's Ascension , His will was expressed by the Holy Ghost speaking through Prophets : " As they ministered to the Lord and fasted , the H oly Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul // for the work whereunto I have called them . " ( Acts xiii , 1-3 . ) The restoration of Apostles would seem , therefore , to require the previous restoration of the gift of prophecy , and might be expected to follow it . The case of Baxter had proved that Prophets can not be safely left to their own gnidance , nor be adequately controlled by Pastors ; and if the movement is to be wisely directed , and to assume a largeness and completeness which shall meet all the necessities of the Christian Church , that ministry which differs from all others in deriving its authority immediately from Christ , and in its universal jurisdiction , must be again restored . The brief account of its restoration by an eye witness is , that " while Mr. C- was in prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churches , there came a word of prophecy , declaring that the Lord had called him to be an Apostle , and to convey His holy unction . The next morning , Mr. Irving , narrating the dealings of the Lord , in the designation of Mr. C --  , solemnly addressed him accordingly , adjuring him to be faithful , and warning him of the exceeding great responsibility and awfulness of his office , also warning us against any idolatry or undue exaltation of a man , inasmuch as the whole church was Apostolic , and instead of needing to lean on any man , was itself the pillar and ground of the truth . ' " This gentleman was a member of the Chnrch of England , a layman , who had joined Mr. Irving 's congregation because his pastor would give uo countenance to the gifts of the Spirit which had appeared in his own flock . A truly religions and well-instructed man , of great sobriety of spirit and soundness of judgment , he was received by Mr. Irving and his church as an Apostle , on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Ghost . No immediate change followed upon this step . An office which had been in abeyance since the first age of the Church , could not be expected to leap at once into the full exercise of its functions . It was brought forth , as it were , under bonds . The Pastorate was in possession , and the Apostolate must , by slow degrees , and without violence , rise up into its true place . The new-called Apostle was under the pastoral care of Mr. Ir // ving , and remained so , we believe , till Mr. Irving 's death . Under such circumstances , the development of the office would be gradual , and the determination of its true relations to the other ministries of the Church a work of time . In point of fact , no change whatever was made so long as Mr. Irving remained in connection with the Church of Scotland . The same outward form , discipline , and mode of worship , which his congregation had in iRegent Square , it retained without alteration until his deposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 504-505 ) conveys the impressson that " new names , new offices , and a changed order of worship , " began to come in immediately on their removal into Newman street ; but we have the best authority for asserting that , with the single exception ( already alluded to ) of the call of one man to the Apostolic office , nothing of the kind took place . In March 1833 , he was called before the Presbytery of Annan on the charge of heretical doctrine as to the Human Nature of our Lord . This was done in obedience to the General Assembly , acting by its Commission , a kind of Representative Committee . Annan was his birth-place , and there in his old parish church , and in the presence of not less than two thousand persons who came flocking in from all the country around , he was put upon his trial for what was far dearer to him than life . In his defense , he denied with vehement indignation the charge that he had imputed sinfulness to the Lord . Ie does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his feelings would not allow him to discuss with calmness ; but with a heart now breaking with sorrow for the dishonor of Christ , and now swelling with anger at the grievous injustice that was done to himself , he re-affirmed his faith that Jesus became in all things one with His brethren , and was tempted in all points as they are , yet without sin : " I stand here a witness for the Lord Jesus , to tell men what He did for them ; and what He did was this : He took your flesh and made it holy , thereby to make you holy ; and therefore He will make every one holy who believes in Him . He came into your battle , and trampled under foot Satan , the world , the flesh ; yea , all enemies of living men , and He saith to every one , Be ye holy for II am holy . ' . . . . Ah ! was He not holy ? Holy in His Mother 's womb ; holy in His childhood ; holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy in His resurrection ; and not more holy in one than in another ? " // But all his protestations of his innocence were in vain . The Presbytery found him guilty of the charge , and proceeded to depose him from the ministry . But before the sentence could be pronounced , and as the senior member of the Presbytery was about to offer a prayer , " the Holy Ghost " ( said Mr. Irving in a letter to his flock the next day ) " opened the mouth of David Dow , who sat at my right hand , and with awful power and solemnity commanded us who would bear the vessels of the Lord to depart and not touch the unclean thing , and added one word of bitter rebuke : flow can ye pray to God in any other name than in that which ye have rejected ? ' Wherefore we arose at the voice of the Lord and came forth , and I sang in my heart , Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us a prey to their teeth ; our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fowler ; the snare is broken , and we are escaped . Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth . " ' " Thus , " says Mrs. Oliphant , " in the twilight of the March night , - - . Irving went forth from the church where he had been baptized and ordained-from the Church of Scotland , the sanctuary of his fathers-never more to enter within walls dedicated to her worship , till he entered in silent pomp to wait the resurrection , and advent of his Lord . Clouds and coming night were now upon the path to which he went forth , commanded by the Holy Ghost . No longer triumphs and victory , no second spring of hope ; only the reproach that broke his heart  --  the desertion  --  the sin , as he held it , of his brethren , for whom he would have given his life , But it was a comfort to his forlorn heart to be sent forth by that voice which he believed to be the voice of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared him , and with a pathetic joy he rejoiced over this when he gave his own account of the eventful day . " ' But for his unstaggering faith in God , this terrible blow would have crushed him , for with all his boldness and immovable determination , no man had more tenderness of heart to grieve at the wrong done him by a brother . He was one of those who , to use his own words , " feel with childlike simplicity and tenderness every act and word of unkindness and enmity . " Eleven years before he had gone forth from his native land full of filial love and reverence , which neither the charms of his new life , nor his engrossing labors , nor the storm of reproach which had burst upon him , had been able to weaken . // His Mother church had ever been to him the dearest and most venerable of all the churches of Christendom . And he loved her none the less that he stood up a faithful witness against her degeneracy , and sought to bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own better days . For such a soil to be treated by his Mother as a heretic - as one who had denied his Lord , and made shipwreck of the faith , and was no longer worthy to be entrusted with the ministry of Christ-was a stroke of cruelty* which nothing but the firm assurance that he had been true and faithful to his Master , could have enabled him to bear . But in that assurance he never wavered , and he believed that He for whose work as the Redeemer of fallen huinanityt he had boldly witnessed in the face of a very tempest of opposition and reproach , would not forsake him now in this bitterest of all his trials , disowned and cast out by the chbNrch of his native laud . After spending a few days in preachitig in the country around , he returned to London , where , says Mrs. Oliphant , " he was received , not with extraordinary honors as a martyr , but with an immediate interdict in " the power , " forbidding * Of a babe that died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was a child filled with the beauty of God from his mother 's womb ; peace , patience and joy , and boundless love were in all his ways until about the time Iwas cast out by the Church ; when he was smitten with a gradual fading away , and never smiled again . After I returned he never smiled ; and before he never but smiled ; and now he lieth in peace , like one whose spirit is in the arms of Jesus . " j We need not repeat what we said on this subject in our former Article , but we give the following extract from the Christian Remembrancer , as a candid and temperate statement : " Nevertheless on a calm review of Irving 's theological tendencies and general teaching , we confess we believe his honest purpose was to bring out , in all its fullness , the Scriptural truth that our blessed Saviour was tempted in all points as we are , yet without sin ; ' that , saving the indiscretions of a too exuberant rhetoric , and apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this high subject does not go beyond that expressed in the following words of a living writer , whose allegiance to Catholic doctrine is unimpeachable : We should not be truly of one Flesh and Blood with Him , but that He took His Flesh and Blood from the loins *f a mother of the same race . Neither would it be the very same nature which had sinned , had He not received His humanity from one cf the daughters of the fallen . " ' // 817 him to exercise any priestly function , to administer saci'aments , or to assume anything out of the province of a deacon , the lowest office in the newly formed church . Such an inconceivable indignity , " she adds ; " according to all human rules , did the spiritual authorities whom his constant and steadfast faith had made masters of his flock , put upon their former leader . " This strain of complaint and indignation is re*choed by several of her reviewers . But , in truth , there never was a transaction more misrepresented both in its facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annan , he " resumed all his accustomed duties ; " but on Sunday the 31st of March , the following events occurred , as he himself soon after described them in a letter to a friend : " On the Lord 's day before the last , when , as usual , during the forenoon service , I proceeded to receive into the church the child of one of the members who had been baptized at home during sickness , and had desired the father to stand forth , the Lord by the mouth of his Apostle* arrested my hand , saying that we must tarry for a while . Though I wist not wherefore this was done , I obeyed , and desired the parent to postpone it . Then the Lord further signified it was His will we should know , and the whole Church feel , that we were without ordinances , to the end we might altogether feel our destitute condition , and cry to Him for the ordinances from heaven . Then I discerned that He had indeed acknowledged the act of the fleshly church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was minded , in His grace , to take us under Ills own heavenly care , and constitute us into a church , directly in the hands of the Great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls ; for He commanded us to rejoice , and confirmed our souls with words of prophecy , assuring us that lIe would build the house , saying unto Jerusalem , Thou shalt be built , ' and to the Temple , Thy foundation shall be laid . ' We did accordingly take heart and sing , When Israel out of Egypt went , " ' &amp;c . ( Ps. 114 ) . " In obedience to what he believed to be God 's word , " ( says one who was an eye witness of these transactions ) , " he abstained from administering sacraments ; but iu all other respects he acted as the minister of the congregation just as previously . No one usurped his place , or fulfilled his previous duties , nor did he remain in silence for a day , or for an hour . " On the following Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest stages of the work , the Ap*ostles were helped in their inexperi. ence , by being made themselves to actings. speak in supernatural utterance in their official // the hand of him whom he and his flock recognized as an Apostle ; so that the effect of what Mrs. Oliphant calls the " inter - dict , " was to restrain him from the administration of sacraments for five days . The only act , so far as appears , from which he really abstained , was the baptism of one child ! And now a word as to the principle8 involved in this . Mr. Irving had been fulfilling his pastoral ministry for eleven years in virtue of his ordination by the Church of Scotland . His authority to administer sacraments was conferred on him by the Presbytery of Annan . The Church which gave him this authority had now taken it away . By a formal act of the Presbytery which ordained him , lie had been deposed from the niinistry . How shall this act be regarded ? Shall it be treated as a nullity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his pastoral functions in defiance of it ? If so , it must be on one of two grounds ; either that the Church of Scotland had no right to give ordination , and that there was , therefore , nothing to be taken from him ; or that , although she had a right to give , she could not take away that which she had given . In the former case , the foundations of ecclesiastical order will be subverted by denying the necessity of ordination ; for if Mr. Irving has received no authority from his Mother Church , then he has had none , except what is inherent in every Christian . In the latter , the authority of the Church of Scotland to exercise discipline will be set aside , and the individual member will be lifted up in independence of the body . If she can not depose Mr. Irving from the ministry which her own hands have conferred , then she has no power to preserve purity of doctrine or godliness of life amongst her members , and must have forfeited ber standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was one of those critical moments which stamp the character of a movement . That which claims to be a work of recovery in the midst of Christendom , i snow , for the first time , brought in.to . collision with one of the Established Churches , and is called to pronounce authoritatively on the validity of its acts . The real question to be decided is , whether there is a Church in the earth ? have the Sacra // 819 ments been continued ? Are there Divine ministers still clothed with the authority of Christ ? flow are the existing Churches to be regarded , now that the ancient gifts and offices are beginning to reappear ? The answer given in the acknoxvledgment of Mr. Irving 's deposition was , " There is a Church with lawful ministries and . valid sacraments , which is to be honored as the Body of Christ . " We wonder that those who have found fault with this act , have not iuore deeply considered the matter . The contrary course would have been a contemptuous trampling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside of the law of the whole Church from the beginning by sanctioning the principle that gifts are to be a substitute for orclin ation ; in other words , that authority to minister does not come from investiture by Christ , but from the possession of a spiritual endowment . It may interest our readers if we extract one or two additional passages from Mr. Irving 's letter on the subject of his ordination . The office of the prophet , in expressing the mind of God concerning it , is thus described : " After singing , he read the first chapter of Jeremiah , and being come to these words , I see a rod of an almond tree , ' he was made in the Spirit to speak much upon it , and to apply it to the spiritual ministry , which even now was beginning to bud ; and in the midst of it he brought a message , or rather delivered a command , to the Apostle to ordain me Angel over the church on the morrow evening , and to charge me and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this holy action I sought to prepare myself and myjlock with all diligence . " Of the ordaining act by the Apostle , he thus speak* : " Thea he came from the place of testimony ( the preacher 's place ) on my right hand , and knelt beside me on my left hand , and prayed in the Holy Ghost over the flock and me , joining us together in the presence of our God ; and then he arose , and , laying both his hands upon me , he ordained me Angel over the church , bidding me be filled with the Spirit of grace , and of wisdom , and understanding , and the fear of the Lord ; to be filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost for the office wherein I was now set . This done , he gave out the 132d Psalm , and all the congregation arose to sing it with one heart . " After giving an account of the ordination of elders and deacons , at subsequent meeting* shortly after , he says in con-clusion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way of ordering His house with an angel , elders , &amp;c. ; all which may the Lord enable you to receive with faith and love , and to render thanks for His wonderful doings in the midst of us. " // This shows clearly that , however Mr. Irving may at first have looked upon his deposition , he came to acknowledge its validity , and received re-ordination at the hands of one whom he believed to l ) e an Apostle , with great joy . It is probable that , left to his own guidance , he wonld have disregarded the sentence of the Presbytery , feeliiig keenly , as lie did , its great in justice , and knowing that the Lord had borne abundant witness to his niinistry. 1-us lofty personal spirit , and his burning zeal for his Master , wonid have impelled him to treat it as Luther did the Pope 's bull . 1*ather than that his witness for the truth should be arrested by their unrighteous decree , he would have cut the Gordian knot which he saw no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching everywhere the Gospel of the Kingdom . And thus he would have become the head of a schism , and the founder of a sect ! lie would have done what so many mighty leaders had done before hiin- ( none of them , it may be , under so urgent a pressure ) - violate the order , to save the life , of the Church . But God preserved him from this , for His time had come to bind life and order together in the unity of the one Spirit , and the one Body . The knot was disentangled by Divine wisdom . The authority of the Church of Scotland was vindicated by his submission to her sentence , and the wrong that she had done him was redressed by a higher ordination . By these two acts his position was essentially changed . He was no *nger a Presbyterian minister . His mother had rejected him , but he believed that the promise was fulfilled , " When father and mother forsake me , then the Lord will take me up . " He looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from him-higher in its intrinsic di * The name Angel ( originally used as an ecclesiastical title in the Seven Epistles in the Apocalypse , and so used as signifying a messenger between heaven and earth ) , best expresses the dignity of the chief Pastor over a flock , who represents to it Jesus the Angel of the Covenant , the Shepherd and Bishop of the one Church . The office differs from that of the modern Bishop in being confined to a narrower sphere , viz , the limits of a fully organized church ( Episcopal jurisdiction being now enormously overgrown ) , and implying a higher ordination , that is , one not by equals , but by a superior , according to the principle that " the less is blessed of the better " // ty , its spiritual authority , and the grace that was conferred with it . And if he was right in his faith that the Apostolic office had been restored , then more must have been given back to him than he had lost . To have been ordained by Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery without Paul . Mr. Irving 's position , after his reordination , was in some respects less independent than before , owing to the necessary subordination in which he and his flock were placed to the Universal Church , in which Apostles are the chief rulers . As the head of a separate congregation , his authority was augmented , and his power of ministering the grace of God enlarged ; but in all that respects the Church as one great Whole , he was now under limitations , for this had been committed to another office . Mrs. Oliphant complains of this , but it seems to us without reason . If the work was of God , as Mr. Irving believed as firmly as any man , such a change was inevitable . It was simply impossible that a pastor should have the same range of authority when in subordination to an apostle , as when no higher ministry was over him . If the Apostolic office is restored , it must assert itself , and reclaim powers which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The error , if there be any , lies further back . Once admit that the Holy Ghost is reviving the ancient gifts and ministries , and we must look for a new order of things which shall involve many changes . That Mr. Irving should have met with difficulties and trials in the progress of the work under this new phase , need not surprise us . It could not have been otherwise to a man of his great strength of character and gifts for leadership , accustomed hitherto to be foremost in whatever he engaged in . The trial may have been aggravated by a certain infelicity in his position , growing out of the fact that his church was for a time , and sq long as he lived , the ecclesiastical centre of the Apostles . It was within the bosom of his flock that the ministers of the Universal ( in distinction from the particular or local ) Church began to be developed , which made it more difficult to define the borders of the respective offices . It was much as if the ordinances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape themselves within the limits , and amongst the institutions , of one of the States . Some mingling of functions would be almost inevitable , and the old office-bearers might well be pardoned if they were sometimes slow in apprehending their true relations to the new . But we believe that Mrs. Oliphant has greatly exaggerated ( on pp. 533 and 534 ) the disagreements that may have been sometimes felt between Mr. Irving and the Apostles ( of whom , by the call of one after another , there were six before his death ) ; * and that , considering the untried and difficult circumstances in which they were placed , there was great harmony between them . They were of one heart and one mind in respect to the Divine reality of the work , and in their zeal for its furtherance ; and a spirit of mutual love and honor ruled all their intercourse . What disagreements at any time existed ( and there were none that interrupted their brotherly communion ) , were in relation to questions of ecclesiastical order and rites of worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community went on . Mr. Irving had been strongly attached to the usages of the Church of Scotland , which , up to this time , had not been departed from , except in the liberty given to the spiritual utterances* But the preparation of the Church for the coming of her Lord required not only that she should be adorned with every gift of the Spirit , but also that her structure , and government , and outward services should be conformed at all points to the mind of God . This gradually disclosed itself as the end for which He was raising up again His ancient ordinances , and the great means of attaining it were seen to be the light of Prophecy , and the wisdom and authority of Apostolic rule . That . Mr. Irving should have been troubled at some of the steps which were taken in this work of re-organizing the Church , and perfecting its institu * Of the whole number called to this office , only one was originally a member of Mr. Irving 's congregation . Others had joined it from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three were clergymen of the churches of England , Ireland , and Scotland respectively ; three were members of the Bar ; two were members of Parliament ; and all were of irreproachable character . // tions according to its original law , is not wonderful , considering his attachment to Presbyterianism ; that he did not refuse obedience even when the path was dark , but waited patiently for clearer light , seems to us a great triumph of faith . From his reordination in April , 1833 , to his death in December , 1834 , or rather until his last sickness , there is little of incident to narrate . Although his labors were more confined to his own flock than formerly , they were never more abundant . He was helped in them by his Elders and Deacons , the range of whose duties was greatly enlarged in consequenc&amp; of their new ordination , and whom ( instead of feeling them a hindrance , as Mrs. Oliphant intimates ) one who knows testifies he " received with the greatest joy . They afforded him the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no way interfered with his own absolute authority , or his personal intercourse with his people . " When she speaks of his being " no longer the exclusive ministrant " to his flock , she conveys a wrong impression , for the ministries of his Elders were confined to " short homilies or addresses made by them in one service which he invariably concluded by a sermon addressed to his people of more than an hour in length , besides preaching to strangers in the evcning . " So far from being restricted in his labors , it is said that " at no previous period of his life did he devote so many hours to public preaching , as from the time of his ordination to the period of his illness . " The character of his teachings during this time may be inferred from a description by Professor IMlacdongal of Edinburgh , who heard him in that city in the winter of 1834 : " His characteristic fire had then , in a great measure , given place to a strangely plaintive pathos , which was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been majestic . " How early the disease of which he died began to show itself , we do not know . Mrs. Oliphant first speaks of it in connection with his visit to Edinburgh , from which she says , " he returned very ill , with threatenings of disease in the chest . " We remember to have heard it said in England many years ago , that he to*k a cold from which he never fully recovered , from going hot // 824 Edward Irving . and perspiring from his church after preaching on Sunday evening , and traveling all night in the mail coach on his way to Annan for his trial ; but we can not vouch for it . There can be no doubt that his gigantic and unceasing labors , joined to the anxieties and sorrows which pressed so heavily upon him during the last three years of his life , were enough to break down even his herculean strength . lie continued to preach as usual through the spring and summer , but with increasing " lassitude ; " and in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease from his labors for a time , and seek recovery by journeying . His physicians advised that he should go to a warmer region , to which his friends in the church joined their entreaties , and offered to defray his expenses . But his heart was set on visiting Scotland , and he seems to have anticipated no danger from exposure to its harsh climate , but fully expected that relaxation and the invigorating exercise of riding on horseback would speedily restore him to health . Mrs. Oliphant lays the blame of this imprudent journey on the church authorities in Newman Street , implying that his presence was felt by them as a restraint , and that therefore they gave him an " authoritative command " to go to Scotland on a mission , or at least , an " authoritative sanction " to his own wish to go . Neither is true . Mrs. Oliphant 's statements have been met by the following full and explicit denial in a letter from Mr. Cardale ( the oldest office-bearer in the new community ) , to Mr. Eler , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then in reference to the last journey , it is most certain that there was neither authoritative command or mission , neither was there authoritative sanction given to Mr. Irving to proceed to Scotland or elsewhere . The state of Mr. Irviug 's health was such as deeply to alarm his friends , and I know that Mr. Drummond repeatedly coujured him to go away , and give himself entire relaxation . When he resolved to go to Scotland , it was not without remonstrance on the part of many . We were met by the suggestion that it was his native air . His determining to go to Scotland , as well as his imprudent exertion in preaching , and exposure of himself in traveling , were his own acts , and so far as any of those whom I suppose to be referred to as leaders are concerned , these thing were all contrary to advice , and entreaties , and remonstrances , oft repeated . I well remember the pain it gave to those in London , when they heard of his preaching , and of his imprudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars of others , not of himself . " // He left London about the first of September , and journeyed through Wales on horseback , sending to his wife and children many beautiful and touching letters , which show a loving sympathy with all around him , and great power of appreciating natural beauty , while they breathe the spirit of unabated faith in that work of God which lay nearest his heart . For a time he felt himself better , and wrote very hopefully of his progress towards recovery . But when viewing the iMienai Bridge , he got wet by a sudden gust driven through the straits by the wind , " and became much worse . When he reached Liverpool he found himself so ill that he gave up his plan of journeying to Scotland on horseback , and wrote to his wife to join him . " The Lord hath made vain the remedies of man . The last three days have been the days and nights of sorest trial I ever had . . . . Now I feel unable to take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my nurse and companion . " They went by water to Greenock , the weather being " boisterous and stormy , " and towards the end of October reached Glasgow , where only fifteen years before he had begun his ministry in the full vigor of his strength , and in the glow of youthful hope . A lady who was with them , thus describes his changed appearance : " To human appearance he is sinking under deep consumption . Ills gigantic frame bears all the marks of age and weakness ; his tremendous voice is now often faltering , and when occasionally he breaks forth with all his former feeling , one sees that his bodily powers are exhausted . Add to all this the calm , chastened dignity of his expression-his patient waiting upon God for the fulfillment of His purposes to himself and his flock through this affliction , and it is exceedingly edifying . . . . I was going to Glasgow with them ; and just before we left the house , he lifted up his hands in blessing , commending them ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the reward of His grace , for their kindness to him . I had a great deal of conversation with him in the boat In driving through the crowded streets of Glasgow , he laid aside his hat and exclaimed , Blessed be the name of the Shepherd of Israel , who has brought us to the end of our journey in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of peace ! ' and continued for some time praying . " p. *55 . One of his first labors in Glasgow , after resting from his journey , was to write two letters to his flock in London , so full of pastoral love and sorrow , so humble in their confessions of sin , and yet so strong in their spirit of faith , that we can not // withhold some parts of them , especially as they throw light upon what we have said as to the trils and temptations of his position . The " sin " of which he speaks was the going beyond the border of his office , as the Angel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Apostolic ministry-that sin of which the Papacy is the great manifestation in Christen doin , as being the exaltation of a Bishop or Pastor into the place of chief rule over Jhe whole Church . " We were inipatient , " he writes , " of the government of Apostles , of the Lord in them . We sought independence as a Church ; and but for the grace of God , we had reaped the very independence of Satan . " And after saying that he was " greatly weakened and wasted , " he adds , " Much have I sought to find out , and much have I besought the Lord to reveal unto me , the manifold causes of this sad separation and utter weakening of your head ; and it is made manifest unto me that we have not been taught by the Word of the Lord ; we have not been broken by it , neither I nor you ; and therefore the Lord bath come in with His judgments , and laid His hand upon the head of the offense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardness and impenitency of heart , under those streams of love which flowed fresh from the bosom of God , hath at length provoked hun to anger , and lie bath arisen in His faithfulness to smite the shepherd of the flock , and I confess that in righteousness He doth afflict , yea , and in mercy , and in loving kindness ; and if He should slay me with the sword of His judgment , I would justify the dealing of His mercy , and put my trust in Him . Oh ! I have had many deep exercises of soul in my absence from you , and Satan hath been suffered to buffet me ; but the Lord bath stood with me , and brought me up out of the depths , and comforted me with His own free Spirit . My confidence in Him in whom I have believed , bath been enlarged , together with the assurance that He bath arisen to build his Zion and Jerusalem , that the nations and kings may assemble all to praise the Lord . But , oh ! my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , with an unjoyful heart , and therefore the Lord bath been provoked to smite . I have sinned , and you have sinned , in not yielding to the voice of the Lord , by reason of the hard : ness of our hearth , and now the Lord breaketh them with sorrow . Sure I am that this affliction is to the working of tenderness of heart , both in you and in me Moreover , I discern that the Lord will utterly separate my name from the work which He worketh for the blessing of the whole world . Oh ! what a grief it bath been to me that my name should be familiarly joined with the work of the Lord . Oft times in my prayer I have been so ashamed and grieved that there should be any name but that of Jesus , that I have almost besought the Lord to be taken out of the way , rather than eclipse in any way the name of His honorable Son . And it is indeed , my chief consolation n being so far apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , that it will be seen , even by the // enemies of the Lord 's work , how little I have had to do with it ,  --  how little any of us have had to do with it , save to mar and hinder it . Again , I have discerned that the Lord , who had made me strong in the flesh to serve Him , would in me first give before the Church the fulfilment of that word , All flesh is grass , and the glory of it as the flower of the grass . ' The hand of the Lord hath touched me , and I am consumed like the moth ; but He sendeth forth His quickening Spirit , and the decayed face of the earth is renewed again . Oh ! cry ye for the outpouring of the Spirit , then shall there be the melody of health and joy in the habitations of the righteous . " A few days later he wrote to Mr. Cardale : " The hand of the Lord is still upon me as heretofore , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to wait and learn the purpose of the Lord in such a separation . Oft times I think that it is the Lord 's gentle hand , breaking that bond by degrees between me and my flock , which threatened to grow up into a kind of necessity , and even to pass over into idolatry. 0 , how I love them ! how I am thankful to them ! how I am laden with their benefits ! And I am sure that their love to me is stonger than my love to them , and I do see it is of the great goodness and tenderness of God to take order that such affection should be stayed from passing over into unholiness ; and that He bath done us a great favor to put us so far asunder , and for such a time , that we might try our hearts and prove ourselves that our mutual love is in the Lord . 0 , how terrible a thing it is in any way to eclipse or defraud that Brother who purchased every soul with the blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear son , jealous for that Church which He hath betrotbed unto Himself a chaste virgin . 0 , let no minister of Jesus seek to win her affections unto himself ; for doth he not therein withdraw them from her Husband-from his Lord ? " He lingered on for a few weeks , able at first to ride a little on horseback , and even to preach to the small company that synipathized with him in his faith and hope ; but soon his failing strength confined him to his room , where on Sunday the 8th of December , after great bodily suffering , he fell asleep in him in whom , amidst all his trials and heartrending disappointments he had ever trusted . " Once he was heard murmuring to himself sonorous syllables of some unknown tongue . Listening to these mysterious sounds , Dr. Martin ( his father-in-law ) found them to be the Hebrew measures of the 23d Psalm- ' The Lord is my Shepherd , ' into the latter verses of which the dying voice swelled as the watcher took up and echoed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of death , I will fear no evil . ' " Not till the very last did he give up the hope of a Divine interposition which should re // tore him even from the brink of death . Words of prophecy had been spoken concerning him which seemed to promise a great work which he should do in his native land , and he was slow to believe that he must die without seeing their fulfillment . Whether , as is the case with so many of the promises in the Old Testament , they still wait for their accomplishment in the resurrection , when there will be many stages in the setting-up of the kingdom , and many acts of ministry to be performed by the risen and translated saints ; or whether the words expressed rather the de8ire of *od than His fixed and absolute purpo8e , and were of the nature of encouragements to faith and hope , more than of unconditional pledges , we will not undertake to say ; but no one who remembers how farreaching are the prophecies of the former dispensations-as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how God himself speaks of His " breach of pron*ise " in a case where the failure of others made it impossible for Him to fulfill His own part , will look upon Mr. Irving 's death as any proof that his faith was resting in a delusion . Once he had been healed by the immediate act of God when all but overpowered by the cholera , and many were the instances of recovery by Dhine pow*y which he had known in his own flock and elsewhere ; and it is not strange that , apart from any words of the Spirit , he should have looked for the arm of the Lord to be stretched forth to save him . But he was full of patient resignation to God 's will , nor did his faith waver when it became evident that his end was near at hand . We can not better describe his last hours than in the words of one of the ministers who was sent from London to be with him , but failed to reach Glasgow till after his death : " From all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hours of him who is gone to his rest , there is reason both to rejoice and to be sorrowful . In his flesh it is evident he suffered much and painfully , both to himself and to those about him . In his spirit , as evidently , all was peace and joy . On Sunday , he said to his wife , If I die , I die to the Lord . ' The last words he spoke to his wife were desiring her to read Ps. 15 , to the end , always requesting her to go on when she paused ; and then the fourth and fifth chapters of I. Thessalonians. lIe then said Peace be with you , ' which were the last words expressly addressed to her . To Mr. Taylor the gentleman in whose house he lodged , his last words // were , Cleave to the Church , cleave to the Church . ' To his father-in-law he said , 0 , the depths of the peace and joy in Christ Jesus ! ' His prayers were principally for the Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he had nothing to say about his wife and children , he answered , No , what have I to say ? the Elders will take care of them , ' or I commit them to the care of the Elders of the Churches . ' The last intelligible words he was heard to utter were , Keep that day , ' which they supposed was that passage in IL Tim. , I , 12 , I know in whom I have believed , ' &amp;c . He then continued for about six hours in an unconscious state , moaning very much ; and then the spirit of Edward Irving departed to that bosom of rest where it shall moan no more forever . " And thus ended the mortal career of one of the noblest of God 's servants in these last ages . Ko man of larger gifts , or a more heroic spirit , or a greater measure of self-sacrificing fidelity and love , has arisen in the Church for generations . He was cast altogether in a gigantic mould , and it was a giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a career which , from the beginning to the end , drew the eyes of men to it as no other has done-which was felt to be something by itself-a new and wonderful spiritual phenomenon , which the world could not help gazing at . Twelve such years of toil and achievement , of fame and reproach , of triumph and suffering , are almost , if not altogether , without parallel . When they were ended by what seemed a premature and tragical death , there was a universal burst of sorrow . The Church which had cast him off , and poisoned by her cruelty the very fountains of his life , * honored him at his burial , and gave him a sepulchre within the walls of her noblest cathedral . The friends who had stood aloof* , and well nigh broken his heart by their alienation in the hour of his greatest trial , could not withhold their praise when the grave had received him . Chalmers gave utterance before his class to his reviving love and admiration , saying of him that " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined to the virtues of the old IRoman. " * " I believe , " says one who was a minister in the church at the time , " from the testimony of those who had the best means of judging , that the great burden of Mr. Irving 's soul in the last year of his life was . . . the condition of the Church of his native land , which had rejected him and his testimony . If to any single circumstnnce beyond himself his death is to be ascribed , it is to that act of deposition at Annan . " // Thomas Carlyle , who had no spiritual ken to discern heavenly mysteries , but was quick to recognize truth and conrage and faith within the sphere of this world , recorded this noble en-comium : " Edward Irving 's warfare has closed , if not in victory , yet in invincibility , and faithful endurance to the end . The spirit of the time , which could not enlist him as its soldier , must needs fight against him as its enemy . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , in questionable , modern garniture which he could not wear . Around him a distracted society , vacant , prurient , heat and darkness , and what these two may breed ; mad extremes of flattery , followed by madder contumely , by indifference and neglect . The voice of our son of thunder , ' with its deep tone of wisdom , . . . has gone silent so soon . The large heart , with its large bounty , where wretchedness found solacement , and they that were wandering in darkness the light of a home , has paused . " Think ( if thou be one of a thousand , and worthy to do it ) , that here once more was a genuine man sent into this , our ungenuine phantasmagory of a world , which would go to ruin without such ; that here once more , under thy own eyes , in this last decade , was enacted the Old Tragedy ( and has had its fifth act now ) , of The Afessenger of Truth in the Age of $kams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his light not then turned into darkness by a soured heart ) , that this man was worthy to be God 's einbassador , although , alas ! he himself had little power of apprehending a Divine message . The nobleness of the vehicle he was able to appreciate , even while the treasnres of the truth it cdnveyed were hidden from his sight . It is , perhaps , too soon to form a just estimate of the life and labors of Mr. Irving . Up to the year 1S30 , his great work had been to show forth Christ in the two great poles of His hnmiliation and His glory . The chief themes of his preaching were , efe8zts come in fte8h , and fe8u8 made Lord of all . These precions truths , the very Alpha and Omega of Christianity , were set forth by him with a fullness and power of argument and illustration , and a fire of holy ardor , not surpassed in the whole range of English theology . In this he rendered an incalenlable service to the Church , which she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true gateway to a reviving of the work of the Holy Ghost , for manhood redeemed and glorified in the Person of the Son of God , is the fountain head of all that is peculiar to the work of // the Spirit in this dispensation . The declaration of John ( vii , 39 ) , that " the Holy Ghost was not yet given , because that Jesus was not yet glorified , " sets forth a connection of cause and effect which the Church can not ponder too deeply . If He must lay hold of fallen humanity , and bear it triumphant above all curse into the glory of God , before the Comforter could come with His gifts of love and His works of power ; then the preaching of the Incarnation and Lordship of Christ might be expected to precede the mighty outpouring of the Spirit . This was not understood at the time that Mr. Irving was so earnestly and powerfully proclaiming these tru*ths , for God keeps His own secrets , and gives to His servants only light enough for the work they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie had thus prepared the way for the reviving of spiritual gifts . They could not be safely given until those two great heads of doctrine , of which St. Paul and St. John* speak as the criteria by which to distinguish between the Spirit of God and evil spirits , had been fully and thoroughly opened . Nor would gifts , which are the earnest of the kingdom , be of use where the hope of the kingdom was not cher ished . It is certain that Mr. Irving 's preaching of Christ as one with us in fallen flesh , and as hereafter to come to glorify us as His joint-heirs , was fitted to make ready a people amongst whom the Spirit could manifest the first fruits of that glory which the Church is hereafter to inherit . There was another feature , also , of his labors , which should not be overlooked . The wise steward brings out of his treasury things new and old ; both , and not one to the exclusion of the other . And God 's way is to honor time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will be vindicated in what He has given already , before He gives more largely . The preparation of the Church for the revelation of the Itingdom , must be a Catholic work , as reaching beyond what is contained in any fragment , IRoman , Greek , or Protestant . But before this new step should be taken , He would have that which had been // already attained to , honored to the utmost . As it was to begin in Protestantism , where alone there was liberty for such a Divine movement , the truth that was in that religions system must be fully recovered and declared . Mr. Irving was a fit instrument for this work , for the doctrines and the spirit of the Reformation were embodied in him beyond any of his contemporaries ; we may say , beyond any man since the sixteenth century . What that great struggle of the Western Church accomplished in the way of disentombing long-buried truth , and awakening spiritual life out of its deep stagnation , was exhibited in him to the utmost that a man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw all things clearly , or was able to present them in their exact relations . The age of the Reformation was more or less chaotic ; truth was struggling out of its prison-house ; it was that stage of returning sight in which men are seen as trees walking . He who would truly represent this , must be , not the scientific theologian with his exquisitely poised balance , and his infinitesimal weights , but the man of war , rushing with fiery courage into the thickest of the fight , and dealing ponderous and well-aimed blows with his mailed hand ; yet sometimes mistaking friend for foe . In this respect , Mr. Irving 's obliqztity of vi8iom  --  the only feature which marred a noble and otherwise faultless face-was a symbol of the man and of his work . He seemed to be looking at the same time in different directions . No eyes were more bright and penetrating , but he saw with distracted vision . It was a sign of his inability to bring into perfect har- , mony the truth that was disclosed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own spfrit between instincts and principles which he knew not how to reconcile . A staunch Protestant and Presbyterian , he yearned after what was good and true in every communion , and had words of loftiest eulogy for the pre cious things and holy men of Rome ; full of reverence for the Past , the monuments of which he delighted to study , and its treasures to recover for the profit of his own times , he reached forward with joyful hope to the coming and Kingdom of his Lord ; strong in his love , and bold in his assertion of personal freedom , he upheld with his whole heart the principle of obe // 833 dience to authority . These oppositions of truth and countercurrents of feelings he could not perfectly reconcile , and this made him an enigma to his generation . There was no spirit of partisanship in him . He sought for the whole truth , and gave it forth as he learned it , without fear or partiality ; andi narrow men who clung to their parties and their shibboleths , were vexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theirs could measure , wild in his look , and terrible in his power , breaking their idols in pieces , and making the land to ring with the battle-cry of the coming King ; and they knew not that God was preparing to lead np ITis Church out of the dark night of the past into the glory of His kingdom , and that this man 's work was to startle the sleepers , and summon them to arise and gird themselves for the march . He was himself a sign that the time for a change had come . That looking with divided vision signified that he stood on the border land between the Old and the New , cleaving to the one , struggling towards the other , his eyes reaching backwards and forwards as in the confused breaking up of a camp at the dawn of day . But while Mr. Irving was doing these great services for the Church , he was made to know , as few have done , " the pains and penalties of following the Lord . " God gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that it was for no selfish ends he toiled and suffered for his Master . Not only did scorn and reproach come upon him from the world ; not only was he rejected by his brethren , and disowned by the mother that had nourished him at her breast , and consecrated him to the holy ministry ; not only was he bereaved of child after child , till five were sleeping in their graves , with6ut any Divine interposition to save them , although lie staggered not at any promise , and his prayers had drawn down blessing upon many a household ; not only was no supernatural gift vouchsafed to him who had stood forth to claim them as the birthright of the whole Church , and had welcomed and cherished them in the huniblest members of the body ; but this mighty champion for God , whom men would have set in the van , and made the leader of the host , saw others who had rendered no such services to the // truth , lifted above himself into the highest places of rule . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Henry Drummond to us ; but he accepted a subordinate position without a murmur , and rendered spiritual obedience to those who were his own children in the faith . And , last of all , the burden of failing health , and the disappointment of an early death , were laid upon him ; and he was not suffered to carry abroad , as he had hoped , the Gospel of the kingdom , and to see the progress of the work , the foundations of which he had helped to lay in toil and sorrow . It was with him as with John the Baptist , who , after being the Lord 's herald , the Voice in the wilderness which shook the whole land , saw the multitudes which had flocked to his ministry falling away from him , and ended his life in the prison-house , and by the axe of the executioner , without seeing the salvation of God . But premature and sorrowful as his death in the prime of manhood must seem ; sad as it is to think of his giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of heart thrill with wonder and joy as he unfolded the mighty mysteries of IRedemption , breaking down so early into the silence of the grave , yet we must all feel that his work was done . Those who look upon him as under a delusion , must rejoice that he was bound by it no longer , but that the evil spell was at length broken in death . And those who believe that he did not forsake his God , nor was forsaken of Him to the end , but that the work of his last years was the fitting consummation of all his previous labors for Christ , will confess with thankfulness in the midst of their sorrow , that he was not taken from the earth till he had fully done his part in preparing his Lord 's way . Years before the revival of spirit*iial gifts , he had spoken of himself , with a prophetic presentiment , * as " a sort of pio * It was in the dedication of a Volume of Sermons to Mr. Drummond , January 10th , 1828 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , like my fathers , formed for border warfare , as God may please to call me ; to hew wood and draw water for the camp of his saints . Yet will I fight for the King with the spiritual weapons of our warfare until the end ; though I be rather a sort of pioneer and forerunner of the Elias dispensation which is to introduce the kingdom , than a herald of the kingdom . " // 835 neer and forerunner of the Elias dispensation , which is to introduce the kingdom . " He little knew at that time the full meaning of what he said , for he could not foresee what God was about to bring to pass . But in the light of subsequent events it was seeu that his great and peculiar wDrk-that for which he was so extraordinarily endowed-was to prepare the way for the restoration of the ancient gifts and ministries , and to receive them when they came . When this was doue , and the chief rule of the Church had been , by Christ , committed to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his labors . He had accomplished deeds of individual prowess , such as the time demanded , and all which were possible to a single-handed champion of the faith . What remained to be done was the work of a body , in which every member should be brought into its rightful place , and fulfill its proper fui*iction , according to the law of Christ . For such a work different gifts were necessarypatience to gather up the truth part by part out of the ruins of Christendom , careful deliberation , and wisejudgment ; the gifts of the ruler rather than of the preacher . Mr. Irving had been like the bold and splendid leader of men in a time of disorder and transition , who exercises a provisional and temporary rule until the permanent ordinances of government can be established . Beyond any other man , he had made it possible for the original and normal institutions of the Church to be restored ; and then , in the spirit of the Baptist who said , " Tie must increase , but I must decrease , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been sent with the Lord 's authority . Mr. Irving died too soon to see whereunto the work would grow for which he had thus periled all things , and how signally the providence of God was to accomplish his vindication . Within ten years after his death , the Church of Scotland , of which he had said , " That the General Assembly , Synods , Presbyterics , and Kirk Sessions , with all the other fur niture of the church , are about , like the vail of the temple , to be rent in twain , or to be left like the withered fig tree , fruitless and barren , I firmly believe , and yet would do all I // could to retard it , " wa* rent asunder , after one of the fiercest struggles through which any Church ever passed . The " Life " before us , which is an indignant protest against the injustice that was done him , comes from the bosom of the very Communion which cast him out . The flock which followed him into exile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , now celebrate Divine service with majestic rites in a building worthy almost , for size and grandeur , to be ranked with the Cathedrals of England . And had he lived till today , he would not much have overpassed the lhnits of three score years and ten , and he would have seen in almost every country of Europe and North America , where there is liberty of worship , but especially in England and Germany , a community of churches revering his character , but refusing to be called by his name ; comforted by the same spiritual gifts , and defended by the same Apostolii* rule , for which he witnessed ; holding in all their fullness the great truths of the Orthodox Faith which he so nobly vindicated ; rejoicing amidst the increasing evil and tumult of the day in that " blessed hope** of the Lord 's speedy coming which he was amongst the first to proclaim ; worshiping God day by day in a spirit which he would have sympathized with , but with a fullness and beauty of holy rites that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original and fundamental law of the Church , in recognizing all the Baptized as of the one Body , and , striving to bring together into a living and organic unity all the good and precious things now unhappily divided among the various Christian sects ; standing in the van of true spiritual and ecclesiastical progress , and anticipating the movements which the Spirit of Christ is inaugarating in all parts of the Church wherever He has liberty to work ; and thus presenting to the Churches of Christendom an example and promise of what God will , in His time , accomplish for all His faithful people , as the first bnds of Spring , in the warm and sheltered valley , are a prophecy of life soon to burst forth in every grove and forest-along the hill side , and on the mountain top .
