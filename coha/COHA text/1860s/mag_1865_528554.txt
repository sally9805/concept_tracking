MEMORIES OF AUTHORS . A SERIES OF PORTRAITS FROM PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE . MISS LANDON . WITH unmingled pain I write the name of L*etitia Elizabeth Landon , - the L. E. L. , whose poems were for so iong a period the delight of all readers , old and young . We were among the few friends who knew her intimately . But it was not in her nature to open her heart to any one ; her large organ of " secretiveness " was her bane ; she knew it and deplored it ; it was the origin of that misconception which embittered her whole life , the mainspring of that calumny which made fame a mockery and glory a deceit . But I may say , that , when slander was busiest with her reputation , we had the best means to confute it , - and did . For some years there was not a single week during which , on some day or other , morning or evening , she was not a guest at our house ; yet this blight in her spring-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournful and mysterious death . The calumny was of that kind which most deeply wounds a woman . How it originated , it was at the time , and is of course now , impossible to say . Probably its source was nothing more than a sneer , but it bore Dead-Sea fruit . A slander more utterly groundless never was propagated . It broke off an engagement that promised much happiness with a gentleman , then eminent , and since famous , as an author : not that he at any time gave credence to the foul and wicked rumor ; but to her " inquiry " was a sufficient blight , and by her the contract was annulled . The utter impossibility of Its being other than false could have been proved , not only by us , but by a dozen of her intimate friends , whose evidence Would have been without question and conclusive . She was living in a school for young ladies : seen daily by the ladies who kept that school , and by the pupils . In one of her letters to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life , since childhood , with the same people . The Misses Lance were strict , scrupulous , and particular , - moreover , from having kept a school so long , with habits of minute observation . The affection they feel for me can hardly be undeserved . I would desire nothing more than to refer to their opinion. ** Dr. Thomson , her constant medical friend and adviser , testified long afterwards to her " estimable qualities , generous feelings , and exalted virtues . " It would , indeed , have been easy to obtain proof abundant ; but in such cases the very effort to lessen the evil augments it ; there was no way of fighting with a shadow ; it was found impossible to trace the rumor to any actual source . Few then , and perhaps none now , can tell how deeply the poisoned arrow entered her heart . If ever woman was , La*titia Landon was , " done to death by slanderous tongues . " I have touched upon this theme reluctantly , - perhaps it might have been omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to comprehend the character of the poet towards her close of life , and the secret of her marriage , which so " unequally yoked " her to one utterly unworthy . Here is a passage from one of her letters to Mrs. Hall , - without a date ,  --  but it must have been written in 1837 , when she was suffering terribly under the blight of evil tongues : - " I have long since discovered that I must be prepared for enmity I have never provoked , and unkindness I have little deserved . God knows , that , ig when I do go into society , I meet with more homage and attention than most , it is dearly bought . What is my life ? // One day of drudgery after another ; difficulties incurred for others , which have ever pressed upon me ; health , which every year , by one severe illness after another , shows is taxed beyond its strength ; envy , malice , and all uncharitableness : these are the fruits of a successful literary career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that false and bitter words could harm her . At first they seemed but to inspire her with a dangerous bravery in her innocence , and to increase a practice we always deplored , of saying things for effect in which she did not believe . It was no use telling her this ; she would argue that a conversation of facts would be as dull as a work on algebra , and that all she did was to put her poetry into practice . In these moods you might as well attempt to imprison a sunbeam as keep her to matter-of-fact ; and the misery was , that gradually the number of detractors increased , who caught up these " effective " scraps , and set them in circulation . She was not more than fifteen years old when the letters " L. E. L. " - appended to some verses in the " Literary Gazette " - riveted public attention ; and when it became known that the author was scarcely in her teens , a full gush of popularity burst upon her that might have turned older heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " courted and flattered and feted ; yet never was she misled by the notion that popularity is happiness , or lip-service the true homage of the heart . She was residing at Old Brompton , when her first poem appeared in the " Literary Gazette , " which Mr. Jerdan had not long previously established . It would be difficult to conceive the enthusiasm excited by the magical three letters appended to the poems , whenever they appeared . Mr. Jerdan was a near neighbor of the Landons , and he thus refers to their residence at Old Brompton : - " My cottage overlooked the mansion and grounds of Mr. Landon , the father of L. E. L. , ' at Old Brompton , a narrow lane only dividing our residences . My first recollection of the future poetess is that of a plump girl , grown enough to be almost mistaken for a woman , bowlino* a hoop round the walks , with a hoop-stick in one hand and a book in the other , reading as she ran , and as well as she could managing both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born on the 14th of August , 1802 , at Hans Place , Chelsea , where her*father , a junior partner in the prosperous house of Adair , army - agents , then resided . And in that locality , with few brief intervals , the whole of her life was passed . When we first knew her , in 1825 , she lived with her grandmother in Sloane Street ; subsequently she was a boarder in the school-establishment of the Misses Lance , at No. 22 , Hans Place , the house in which she had been a pupil when but six years old ; and here she was residing up to within a few months of her marriage , when , in consequence of the retirement of the Misses Lance , she became an inmate in the family of Mrs. Sheddon . Her grandmother 's grave was , if I recollect rightly , the third that was made in the grave yard of Holy Trinity , Brompton . Her lines on this " new " churchyard will be remembered . I attend*d the old lady 's funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - . " I have had time to recover the first shock , - and it was great weakness to feel so sorry , though even now I do not like to think of her very sudden death . I am thankful for its giving her so little confinement or pain ; she had never known illness , and would have borne it impatiently , - a great addition to suffering . I am so very grateful to Mr. Hall , for I really did not know what to do . Her funeral is fixed for Friday ; the hour will be arranged to his and Mr. J erdan 's convenience . Mni . Hall supplies me with the following particulars concerning her early acquaintance and intercourse with Miss Landon. 33 ' // 332 " I forget how it came about , but my husband was introduced to a certain little Miss Spence , who , on the strength of having written something about the Hi* hiands , was most decidedly BLUE , when blue was by no means so gener'al a color as it is at present . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and *z5afronized ' young littJrateurs , inviting them to her humble abode , ' where tea was made in the bedroom , and where it was whispered the butter was kept cool in the wash-handbasin ! There were lots ' of such-like small scandals about poor Miss Spence 's humble abode ; still people liked to go ; and my husband was invited , with a sort of apology to poor me , who , never having published anything at that time , was considered ineligible ; it was a rule , ' and Miss Spence , in her humble abode , ' lived by rule . " Of course I had an account of the party when Mr. Hall came home . I coveted to know who was there , and what everybody wore and said . I was told that Lady Caroline Lamb was there , enveloped in the folds of an ermine cloak , which she called a cat- skin* ' and that she talked a great deal about a periodical she wished to get up , to be called Tabby 's Magazine ' ; and with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rosina Wheeler , - since well known as Lady Bulwer Lytton , - and who sat rather impatiently at the feet of her eccentric GamalieL ' Miss Emma Roberts was one of the favored ladies , and Miss Spence ( who , like all Leo-hunters , ' delighted in novelty ) had just caught the author of The Mummy , ' Jane Webb , who was as gentle and unpretending then as she was in after-years , when , laying aside romance for reality , she became a great helper of her husband , Mr. Loudon , in his laborious and valuable works . When I heard Miss Benger was there , in her historic turban , I thought how fortunate that I had remained at home ! I had always a terror of tall , commanding women , who blink down upon you , and have the unmistakable air about them of Be hold me ! have I not pronounced sentence upon Queen Elizabeth , and set my mark on the Queen of Scots ? ' Still , I quite appreciated the delight of meeting under the same roof so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , But there was one lady there whom I promised you should call on to-morrow . Imagine my mingled delight and dismay ! - delight at the bare idea of seeing her , who must be wellnigh suffocated with the perfume of her own Golden Violet , ' the idol of my imagination , - dismay ! for what should I say to her ? what would she say to me ? " And now I must look back , - back to the long ago . ' " And yet I can hardly realize the sweep of years that have gone over so many who have since become near and dear to us . At that first visit , I saw Letitia Landon in her grandmamma ' s modest lodging in Sloane Street , - a bright - eyed , sparkling , restless little girl , in a pink gin*ham frock , - grafting clever things on commonplace nothings , frolicking from subject to subject with the playfulness of a spoiled child , - her dark hair put back from her low , but sphere-like forehead , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine , and falling in curls around her slender throat . We were nearly of the same age , but I had been almost a year married , and if I had not supported myself on my dignity as a married woman , should have been more than nervous , on my first introduction to a living poet , ' though the poet was so different from what I had imagined . Her movements were as rapid as those of a squirrel . I wondered how any one so quick could be so graceful . She had been making a cap for grandmamma , and would insist upon the old lady 's putting it on , that I might see how pretty it was . ' To this grandmamma ( Mrs. Bishop ) objected , - she could n't ' and she would n't ' try it on , - how could L*titia be so silly ? - and then La*titia put the great beflowered , beribboned thing on her own dainty little head , with a grave // look , like a cloud on a rose , and folding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called a Sir Roger de Coverley ' curtsy , skipping backwards into the bedroom , and rushing in again , having deposited out of sight the cap she was so proud of constructing , took my hands in hers , and asked me if we should be friends . ' " Friends ! ' I do not think that during the long intimacy that followed that child-like meeting , extending from the year 26 to her leavino- Enol in *8 band during which time I saw her frequently every day , and certainly every week , - I do not think she ever loved me as I loved her , - how could she ? - but I was proud of the confidence and regard she did accord me , and would have given half my own happiness to shelter her from the envy and evil that embittered the spring and summer-time of her blighted life . It always seemed to me impossible not to love her , not to cherish her . I'erhaps the greatest magic she exercised was , that , after the first rush of remembrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rendered you completely oblivious of what she had done by the irresistible charm of what she was . You forgot all about her books , - you only felt the intense delight of life with her ; she was penetrating and sympathetic , and entered into your feelings so entirely that you wondered how the little witch ' could read you so readily and so rightly , - and if , now and then , you were startled , perhaps dismayed , by her wit , it was but the prick of a diamoncf arrow . Words and thoughts that she flung hither and thither , without design or intent beyond the amusement of the moment , come to me still with a mingled thrill of pleasure and pain that I can not describe , and that my most friendly readers , not having known her , could not understand . " When I knew her first , she certainly looked much younger than she was . When we talked of ages , which we did the first day , I found it difficult to believe she was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so girlish .333 in her gestures and manners . In after.days I often wondered what made her so graceful . Her neck was short , her shoulders high . You saw these defects at the first glance , just as you did that her nose was retroussi , and that she was underhung , which ought to have spoiled the expression of her mouth , - but it did not : you saw all this at once , but you never thought about it after the first five minutes . Her complexion was clear , her hair dark and silken , and the lashes that sheltered her gray eyes long and slightly upturned . Her voice was inexpressibly sweet and modulated , but there was a melancholy cadence in it , - a fall so full of sorrow that I often , looked to see if tears were coming : no , the smile and eyes were beaming in perfect harmony , but it was next to impossible to believe in her happiness , with the memory of that cadence still in the ear . " Like all workers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inner and an outer life . Many times , when I have witnessed her suffering , either from those spasmodic attacks that sapped the foundation of her life , or from the necessity for work to provide for the comforts and luxuries of those who never spared her , I have seen her enter the long , narrow room that opened on the garden at Hans Place , and flash upon a morning visitor as if she had not a pain or a care in the world , dazzling the senses and captivating the affections of some new acquaintance , as she had done mine , and sending them away in the firm belief of her individual happiness , and the conviction that the melancholy which breathes through her poems was assumed , and that her real nature was buoyant and joyous as that of a lark singing between earth and heaven ! If they could but have seen how the cloud settled down on that beaming face , if they had heard the deep-drawn sigh of relief that the little play was played out , and noted the languid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered her young limbs on the common seat , opposite the common // 334. table , whereon she worked , they would have arrived at a directly opposite and a too true conclusion , that the melancholy was real , the mirth assumed . " My next visit to her was after she left her grandmamma 's , and went to reside at 22 , Hans Place . Miss Emma Roberts and her sister at that time boarded in Miss Lance 's school , and Miss Landon found there a room at the top of the house , where she could have the quiet and seclusion her labor required , and which her kind-natured , but restless grandmother prevented . She never could understand how speaking one word to Letty , just one word , and not keeping her five minutes away from that desk , where she would certainly grow humped or crooked , ' could interfere with her work ! She was one of those stolid persons who are the bane of authors , who think nothing of the lost idea , and the unravelling of the web , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word , . ' only a moment , ' which scatters thoughts to the wind , - thoughts that can no more be gathered home than the thistledown that is scattered by a passing breeze ; " She continued to reside in that unostentatious home , obedient to the rules of the school as the youngest pupil , dining with the children at their early hour , and returning to her sanctuary , whence she sent forth rapidly and continuously what won for her the adoration of the young and the admiration of the old . But though she ceased to reside with her grandmother , she was most devoted in her attentions to her aged relative , and trimmed her caps and bonnets and quilled her frills as usual . I have seen the old lady 's borders and ribbons mingled with pages of manuscript , and known her to put aside a poem to settle up ' grandmamma 's cap for Sunday . These were the minor duties in which she indulged ; but her grandmother owed the greater part , if not the entire , of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Her mother I never saw : moraly right in all her arrangements , she was mentally wrong , - and the darling poet of the public had no loving sympathy , no tender care from her . L. E. L. had passed through the sufferings of a neglected childhood , and but for the love of her grandmother she would have known next to nothing of the love of motherhood . Thus she was left alone with her genius : for admiration , however grateful to a woman s senses , never yet filled a womans heart . " When I first knew her , and for some time after , she was childishly untidy and negligent in her dress : her frocks were tossed on , as if buttons and strings were unnecessary incumbrances , - one sleeve off the shoulder , the other on , - and her soft , silky hair brushed any how ' : but Miss Emma Roberts , whose dress was always in good taste , determined on her reformation , and gradually the young poet , as she expressed it , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' because she was wonderfully youthful in . appearance , and positively as she grew older looked younger , - her delicate complexion , the transparent tenderness of her skin , and the playful expression of her child-like features adding to the deception . " I was one day suddenly summoned to Hans Place , and drawn into a consultation on the important subject of a fancy - ball , which Miss Landon and Miss Emma Roberts had talked over ' Miss Lance to let them give to their friends . They wished me to appear as the wild Irish girl , ' or the genius of Erin , with an Irish harp , to which I was to sing snatches of the melodies . Miss Spence was there in consultation , as she knew everybody . ' She congratulated me on my dibut as an authoress , ( I had recently published my first book , Sketches of Irish Character , ' ) and politely added , Now you are one of us , I shall be happy to receive you at my humble abode . ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish girl and the Irish harp , but agreed to carry a basket of flowers . Certainly the fi/e-givers worked with a will , ' turned the great house out of windows , ' convert- // 335 ing the two school-rooms , big and little , into a ball-room , and decorating it richly with green leaves'and roses , real and artificial . I congratulated them on the prospect . Yes , ' said Miss Landon , the mechanical getting-up is all very well ; I wish all that is termed " dashing " did not lie in the tomb of the Duchess of Gordon . A quadrille is but still life put into motion . Our faces , like our summers , want sunshine . Old Froissart complained in his day , that the English , after their fashion , " s'arnusent mow/I tris/ement . " A ball-room is merely " Arithmetic and the use of figures taught here . " A young lady in a quadrille might answer , - " I am too busy to laugh , - I am making my calculations . " And yet ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that servants and wives are so expensive , - still young lady 's delight in a ball , if not raisonnable , has always - que/que ralson /and lam determined , if I die in the cause , that ours shall be a success ! ' Her conversation was always epigrammatic . " It seems absurd that a ball should be the first great event of my literary life . There I saw for the first time many persons who became in afteryears intimate friends , and whose names are now parts of the history of the literature of their country . Mr. ' Edward Bulwer , then on the threshold of fame , came out ' in military uniform . L. E. L. assured me he was very clever , had written a novel , and piles of poetry , ' and would be wonderful soon , but that he was much too handsome for an author ; at which opinion , little Miss Spence , in a plum-pudding sort of turban , with a bird - of- paradise bobbing over the front , and a fan even larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assured me that nothing elevated the expression of beauty so much as literature , ' and that young things , like many of the present company , would not look as well in ten years ! ' Mr. Bulwer was certainly pronounced by the ladies the handsomest youth in the room . The gentlemen endeavored to put him down as effem mate , ' but all in vain . They cafled him a fair , delicate , very , very young man , ' - a boy , ' in fact . I remember wondering at the searching expression of his large , wandering , bluish eyes , that seemed looking in and out at everybody and at everything . The lady of his love was there , and she ought to have been dressed as the Sultana poor Miss Spence burlesqued . Nature had bestowed on her an Oriental style of beauty , and she would have come out well in Oriental costume ; but she chose the dress of a Swiss peasant , which , being more juvenile , brought her nearer to her lover 's age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth like chiselled coral , ' and eyes fierce as an eagle 's or tender as a dove 's , as passion moved her . Her uncle , Sir John Milly Doyle , then an old man of mark in the military world , was naturally proud of his beautiful charge , and companioned her that evening . " Miss Benger 's turban was a formidable rival to that of Miss Spence . The historian was long and lanky , according to the most approved historical fashion ; consequently her turban was above the crowd , whfle poor Miss Spence 's was nearly crushed by it , and was all too frequently shoved on one side by the whirling dancers . At last , in despair , she donned a handkerchief , tying it under her chin , and wherever she went she wished the gentle - hearted Miss Webb to follow , appealing after this fashion to the merry crowd - Please let me pass ; I am Miss Spence , and this lady is Miss Webb , author of " The Mummy , " - " The Mummy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the last time I saw little Miss Spence that evening , she had scrambled up into one of those so-called education - chairs , ' in which poor girls were compelled to sit bolt upright for several hours of the day , by way of keeping their shoulders flat and strengthening their spine . " I remember Father Prout of Watergrass Hill ' that evening ,  --  then a smooth-faced , rosy-cheeked young man . Jane *nd Anna Maria Porter joined // the party late in the evening . They came from Esher , and , though not in direct fancy-dresses , added to the effect of the gathering . Jane was dressed in black , which was only relieved by a diamond sparkling on her throat . Her sweet , melancholy features and calm beauty contrasted well with the bright sunshine of her sister 's round , girlish face . She was dressed in white , soft blue gauze floating round her like a haze . L. E. L. ( who personated a flower-girl in a white chip hat ) called the sisters the Evening and Morning Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid me on my new dignity of authorship , - a c mpliment from the author of the Scottish Chiefs , ' - the book that in childhood I had read stealthily by moonlight , coiled up in my nursery-window , just near enough to the sea to hear its music , while the fate of Sir William Wallace made my heart pant and my tears flow ! " I saw there for the first time Julia Pardoe . She had just returned from Portugal , and was escorted by her little , round father , the Major . She was then in her dawn of life and literature , having published tw6 volumes ahout Portugal , - a pretty little fairy of a girl , with a wealth of flaxen hair , a complexion made up of lilies and roses , with tiny feet in white satin boftines with scarlet heels , and a long , sweeping veil of blue gauze spangled with silver stars . I think she dressed as some Portuguese or Spanish character ; for I remember a high comb in her hair . I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I remember one group of Quakers among the glitterin* , throng , who looked sufficiently quaint to attract attention , while the matron of the party said clever , caustic things , differing in quality as well as quantity from the sparkling , playful jests and repartees , that , as the evening passed , were flung about by Mr. Jerdan , the popular editor of the Literary Gazette , ' the oracle of that time , and stammered forth by Dr. Maginn . " The Doctor " and Mr. Jerdan and Theodore Hook entered together , three men of mark , from whom much was expected - after supper . " The Quaker matron was Mrs. Trollope , a portly lady , of any age between thirty and forty , staid and sedate , as became her character , and attentive to her thees ' and thous , ' which lent their clo*ik for plain speaking , of which she was not chary . She frequently admonished her daughters - perhaps adopted for the evening - against the vanities by which they were encompassed on every side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or actual bitterness . The character was well sustained throughout the evening , and occasioned quite as much fear as fun . When Theodore Hook asked her , according to the fashion of those days , to take wine with him , she answered , Friend , I think thou hast had enough already , and so have I. ' There was nothing particularly wise or witty in the words ; but their truth was so evident , and the manner in which they were spoken so clear and calm , that they were followed by a roar of laughter that for a little time upset the mighty humorist , though , in the extempore song in which he rallied , he did not forget that He had just received a wallop rrom the would-he Quaker Trollope . ' " We enjoyed most thoroughly the intercourse commenced thus early in our married life with the spirits of our time ; and I remember entering into grave debate with L. E. L. whether it would be possible for us to give a party that might be , as it were , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . We proposed a conversazione , with firstrate music ; but in that Miss Landon could not sympathize . It was all very well , ' she said ; I had a talent for listening ; she had not ; and if I must have music , let there be a room where the talkers could congregate , and neither disturb others nor be themselves disturbed . ' The only thing she disliked in dancing was the trial of keeping time ; and to do this , she was obliged to count . " The conversazione was determined // on , and the invitations issued ; and then my husband and I began to count the cost . Of course , if done , it must be well done . The method was not clear ; it was very*loudy ; and there was only one way to make it clear . We were but children of a larger growth , ' and we had a money-box , ' - not one of those pretty cedar inventions , with a lock and key and a slit in the cover , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapeless , roundabout thing of earthen-ware , with a slit in the middle . W* had intended its contents should gratify another fancy , but now it would be the very thing to . sacrifice ; so we locked ourselves into the drawing-room , placed the box on the hearth-rug , and in a moment the brown roundabout was smashed , - and there was quite a heap of silver , and a little brightening of gold ! We had never put in any gold . XVe were astonished , and counted our treasure with great delight . My husband accused me of conveying the gold by some cunning art into the box ; and I was indignant that he should have done so without my knowledge . A quarrel was imminent , when we thought perhaps it was the hand of the dear mother that had dropped in the gold . Yes , that was her ruse ; and we would have it that the party cost us nothing , because the contents of the money-box never had been counted on : it was a treasure-trove , - nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in our triumph , ( for the party , every one said , was a brilliant success , ) we communicated the fact to L. E. L. that the party had cost nothing I She laughed , and determined to set up a money-box. on her own account ; but , poor girl , her money was anticipated by her dependants before she received it . " I remember once meeting her coming out of Youngman 's shop , in Sloane Street , and walking home with her . I have been , ' she said , to buy a pair of gloves , - the only money spent on myself out of the three hundred pounds I received for " Romance and Reality . " ' That same day she spoke 337 of having lived in Sloane Street when a child . Her mother 's m6nage must have been curiously conducted ; for I remember her saying , On Sundays my brother and myself were often left alone in the house with one servant , who always went out , locking us in ; and we two children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the one-o'clock dinners that went past from the bake-house , well knowing that no dinner awaited us. * * In the zenith of her fame , and towards her terrible close of life , the personal appearance of Miss Landon was highly attractive . Though small of stature , her form was remarkably graceful ; and in society she paid special attention to dress . She would have been of perfect symmetry , were it not that her shoulders were rather high . There were few portraits of Miss Landon painted , although she was acquainted with many artists , and had intense love of Art . Her friend Maclise painted her three or four times ; but I know of no other portraits of her , except that by Mr. Pickersgill , which I always thought the most to resemble her , albeit the likeness is not flattering . She first met the Ettrick Shepherd at our house . When Hogg was presented to her , he looked earnestly down at her , for perhaps half a minute , and then exclaimed , in a rich , manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ye d been sae bonnie . I ye said mony hard things ahoot ye . I 11 do sae na mair . I did na think ye d been sae bonnie . " Mrs. Opie , who also met her at our dwelling , paid her a questionable compliment , - that she was " the prettiest butterfly she had ever seen " : and I remember the staid Quaker shaking her finger at the young poetess , and remarking , " What thou art saying thou dost not mean . " Miss Jewshury , ( the elder sister of the accomplished authoress , Geraldine , ) whose fate somewhat resembled her own , said of her , " She was a gay and Memories of Authors . // gifted thing " ; but Miss Jewsbury knew her only " in the throng . " In short , I have rarely known a woman so entirely fascinating as Miss Landon ; and this arose mainly from her large sympathy . She was playful with the young , sedate with the old , and considerate and reflective with the middleaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosaic or practical , and essentially of and with whatever party she happened to he among . I remember this faculty once receiving an illustration . She was taking lessons in riding , and had so much pleased the riding-master that at parting he complimented her by saying , - " Well , Madam , we are all horn with a genius for something , and yours is for horsemanship . " One of the many writers who mourned her wrote , - " Apart from her literary abilities and literary labors , she was , in every domestic relation of life , honorable , generous , dutiful , self-denying , - zealous , disinterested , and untiring in her friendship . " Her industry was wonderful . She was perpetually at work , although often - nay , generally with little of physical strength , and sometimes utterly prostrated by illness . Yet the work must be done , as her poems and prose were usually for periodical publications , and a given day of the month it was impossible to postpone . Poetry she wrote with great ease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , - " I write poetry with far more ease than I do prose . In prose , I often stop and hesitate for a word ; in poetry , never . Poetry always carries me out of myself . I forget everything in the world but the subject that has interested my imagination . It is the most subtile and insinuating of pleasures ; but , like all pleasures , it is dearly bought . It is always succeeded by extreme depression of spirits , and an overpowering sense of bodily fatigue . " And in one of her letters to me , she observes , - " Writing poetry is like writing one 's own native language , and writing prose is like writing in a strange tongue . " In fact , she could have improvised admirable verses without hesitation or difficulty . She married Mr. Maclean , then Governor of the Gold Coast , * - a man who neither knew , felt , nor estimated her value . He wedded her , I am convinced , only because he was vain of her celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change her name , and to remove from that society in which just then the old and infamous slander had been revived . There Was in this case no love , no esteem , no respect , - and there could have been no discharge of duty that was not thankless and irksome . They were married a fortnight , at least , before the wedding was announced , even to friends . A sad story was some time afterwards circulated , - the truth of which I have no means of knowing , - that Mr. Maclean had been engaged to a lady in Scotland , which engagement he had witbdrawn , and that she was in the act of sealing a letter to him when her dress caught fire , and she was burnt to death . The last time I saw L. E. L. was in Upper Berkeley Street , Connaught Square , on the 27th of June , 1838 , soon after her marriage , when she was on the eve of her fatal voyage . A farewell party was given to some of her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the Misses Lance having resigned their school . When the proper time arrived , there was a whisper round the table , and , as I was the oldest of her friends present , it fell to my lot to propose her health . I did so with the warmth I felt . The chances were that we should never meet again ; and I considered myself free to speak of her in terms such as could not but have gratified any husband , - except the husband she had chosen , - and sought to convey to Maclean 's mind the high re.sy5ect , as well as affection , with which we all regarded her . The * She was married on the 7th of June , 1838 , to Mr. Maclean , at St. Mary 's , Bryanston Square-her brother , the Rev. whittington Landon , officiating . The hride was given away by her long and attached friend , Sir Lytton Buiwer. // reader may imagine the chill that came over the party when Maclean rose to return thanks . He merely said , " If Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , I only wonder they allowed her to leave them . " One by one the guests rose and departed , with a brief and mournful farewell . Probably not one of them all ever saw her again . She sailed with her husband for Africa on the 5th of July , 1838 . On the 15th of August she landed , and on the 15th of October she was dead - dying , according to a coroner 's jury , " of having incautiously taken a dose of prussic acid . " The circumstances of her death will be forever a mystery ; for her husband has since " died and made no sign " ; but no one ever heard of her having had this horrible medicine in her possession . Dr. Thomson , who made up her medicine-chest , and who had been her attendant for many years , declared he never pte*cribed it for her ; and it was next to impossible she could have possessed it . To the various rumors that arose out . of her death I do not allude . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she did not , although I know she was most wretched in her mournful banishment , most miserable in her changed condition , and that , if her past years had been gloomy , her future was very dark ; but I believe that poison in some shape - not from the small vial which it was said was found in her hand - was administered by the African woman who is known to have been her predecessor , - one of those " children of the South With whom revenge is virtue . " The following letter from L. B. L. was received by Mrs. Hall on the 3d of January , 1839 . It is without a date . On the 1st we had heard of her death . It was a " ship-letter , " but the mark of the place at which it was posted is indistinct . " Mv DEAR MRS . HALL , - I must send you one of my earliest epistles from 339 the tropics ; and as a ship is just sailing , I will write , though it can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my whole voyage in three words , - six weeks ' sea-sickness ; but I am now as well as possible , and have been ever since I landed . The castle is a very noble building , and all the rooms large and cool , while some would be pretty even in England . That where I am writing is painted a deep blue , with some splendid engravings ; indeed , fine prints seem quite a passion with the gentlemen here . Mr. Maclean 's library is filled up with bookcases of African mahogany , and portraits of distinguished authors . I , however , never approach it without due preparation and humility , so crowded is it with scientific instruments , telescopes , chronometers , barometers , gasometers , etc. , none of which may be touched by hands profane . On three sides , the batteries are dashed against by the waves ; on the fourth is a splendid land view . The hills are covered to the top with what we should call wood , but is here called bush . This dense mass of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to different gentlemen , and on two of the heights are small forts built by Mr. Maclean . The cocoatrees with their lon6 fan-like leaves are very beautiful . The natives seem to be obliging and intelligent , and look very picturesque with their fine dark figures , with pieces of the country cloth flung round them . They seem to have an excellent ear for music : the band plays all the old popular airs , which they have caught from some chance hearing . The servants are very tolerable , but they take so many to work . The prisoners do the scouring , and fancy three or four men cleaning a room that an old woman in England would do in an hour , - besides the soldier who stands by , his bayonet drawn in his hand . All my troubles have been of a housekeeping kind , and no one could begin on a more plentiful stock of ignorance than myself . However , like Sindbad the Sailor in the cavern , I begin to see daylight I have numbered and labelled my keys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and every morning I take my way to the store , give out flour , sugar , butter , etc. , and am learning to scold , if I see any dust or miss the customary polish on the tables . I am actually getting the steward of the ship , who is my right hand , to teach me how to make pastry . I will report progress in the next* We live almost entirely on ducks and chickens ; if a sheep be killed , it must be eaten the same day . The bread is very good , palm wine being used for yeast ; and yams are an excellent substitute for potatoes . The fruit generally is too sweet for my liking ; but the oranges and pine-apples are delicious . You can not think the complete seclusion in which I live ; but I have a great resource in writing , and I am very well and very happy . But I think even more than I expected , if that be possible , of my English friends . Your truly affectionate L. E. MACLEAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but had erased " Landon , " and written in " Maclean , " adding , " How difficult it is to leave off an old custom ! " Poor girl ! She thus fulfilled her own mournful prediction , though speaking of another - " Where my father 's bones are lying , There my hones will never lie I Mine shall be a lonelier ending , Mine shall be a wilder grave , Where the shout and shriek are blending , Where the tempest meets the wave Or perhaps a fate more lonely , In some drear and distant ward , Where my weary eyes meet only Hired nurse and sullen guard .
