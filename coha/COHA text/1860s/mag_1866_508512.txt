txt THE FREEDMAN 'S STORY . 1 have thought that a plain , unvarnished account of a servant 's trials in Imis efforts to secure his freedom might not be uninteresting . It is given as nearly as possible in his own words . Oby is now with me , moy dining-room servant . He imas learned to read himself what I have written . CuoeLswasvmLLu , vmaamamA . M. S. Dc V. name is Oby ; they say it is because my . LVL father was an Obeah man , when he lived down South in Florida and drove a stage . I // have heard him say , to the contrary , that he belonged , at the time I was born , to a man by the name of Overton , and that that is my true name . So when I went down to town the other day , and the Provost-Marshal asked me if I could sign my own name , I boldly wrote down " Mr. Overton Paragon . " I was raised at this place , by people who were ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; hut that was not very long , for they were poor white folks and could not keep me , or my mother , or my father either . So we were hired out to a very good master , who took good care of father especially , because he had hired him for more than twenty years , and I was living with them in his house , though I could not do much work , being rather weak4y and , I am afraid , lazy too . One fine day master comes down stairs and says to father : " Uncle James , you have served me faithfully these ten years , and you know I only bought you because I did not want your master to set you iu your old days to hard work . But I do not like to own yen , and you are free . You can go whenever and wherever you choose . I can not give you your frcedom in any other way , because the laws of the State do not permit me to do so , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that you can stay or go as you choose . " Father could not say much , for he was not handy with his tongue , but he told master that he did not want to leave him as long as he cared to keep him . But when master had gone up again , he comes in and tells mother , and Uncle Henry , who was there , tells him he had better goacross the line and live at the North . Father had been there when master sent him all the way to Boston with a fine horse-his name was Topaz  --  and they tried very hard then to make father stay . But he did not like their ways ; lie said they were not genteel at all like our old family servants , and lie came back and was mighty glad to be again in Old Virginia . So father staid , and mother staid , and I was taken up to the dining-room , and mistress taught me to wait , and to wash the china and the glass . I was nearly grown-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees came right down upon us . We had been expecting them often before , and many is the time Uncle Henry came running in where mother was and cried out , " God he thanked , they are coming , they are coming ! " And mother asked him , " Who are you talking about ? " and he would say , " Our deliverers , the Yankees , whom God sends to make us all free ! " But mother did netlike his ways at all , and when he was gone she would take me and brother Henry by her little stool close to the fire and say : " Now , boys , do n't you think you 'll he so much better off when you are free . Folks have to work every where , free or slave , black or white ; and it 's much better for you to be with genteel folks , and go to church , and have nothing to do with poor niggers , than to be way off where you have not any body who cares for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know she meaflt it all for the best , but , to save my life , I could not help thinking of what Uncle henry said , and what a fine thing it would be to be free , and to have twelve dollars a month and nothing to do . So I went over to Colonel Wood 's Aleck and we talked it over behind the wood-pile , where nobody could hear us , and he told me how he knew a plenty more who would go away as soon as ever the Yankees came . He said they were fighting for us , and if we wanted to go we need not run away by night , like a poor three-hundred-dollar nigger , but we might ride off on a fine horse , in the middle of the day , and our masters could not say a word against it for fear of the Yankees . So I promised I would join him , and when we heard that General Sheridan was coming this way , with a hundred thousand men , we knew that the Confederates could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off all together . I remember it well ; it was a dark night , but the stars were all out and the mud awfully deep , when all of a sudden Uncle Henry comes rushing in by the side gate , quite out of breath , and tells us that General Early has been beaten all to pieces , and that the Yankees are comiug across the mountains . They did not know any thing of it in town , and I had heard master say at supper-table that we need not be afraid ; the Yankees would again go up the Valley to Lexington and pass us by . But we knew better , and mother would have told mistress , whom she was mighty fond of , but Uncle Henry would not let her , and mother was terribly worried about it . He told us that we must all put on our Sunday clothes , and be very polite to the soldiers , because they were coming to make us all free , and we were just as good now as they . Father was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the others said , and shook his head and groaned as he sat before the fire and smoked his pipe ; but he said nothing , only now and then he would look up , and when mother looked at him at the same time , he would shake his head and sigh , until it made me feel quite badly , and I did not know what to do . At night , when the white folks had all gone to bed , we , Aleck and I , took an ash cake and a piece of middling , and we ran up the turnpike , miles and miles , until we came to the top of the long hill , where Doctor White 's house stood before it was burned , and there we sat the livelong night , and watched the camp-fires against the dark mountain side , thinking what the Yankees were doing up there , and why they did not come to help us all . It was very hard to trot back again in the morning early , and to go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought if we could but once see the bluecoats coming down the hill , and their horses standing by the side of the lake , we would . be perfectly happy . And so it did come about one fine , clear morning . On Monday a man in gray had come racing up the turnpike , looking right and left un // der his broad-brimmed , slouched hat , and gone into town . Uncle Henry had met him as he came up , and shook his head and said : " Now , I should not wonder if that was a real Yankee . " They all laughed at him , and asked him if he did not see the Confederate gray and the ragged hat the man wore . Bnt he shook his head and said : " Now , I 'll tell you , boys , it may be so , and it may not be so ; but that man there did not ride like one of our folks , and he had his eyes too bnsy and his hand too near his revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early there came two , a ad three , and at last a whole number of these graycoats , and somebody said in a whisper , as we were standing at the stile close to the turnpike , " Those are the Jessie Scouts , you believe me I " But we looked at the old man who said so , and as nobody knew him we did not believe him . It was all the same true ; it turned out afterward that they were Jessie Scouts , as they called them from General Fremont 's wife ; and there had been a dozen of them in town all day long , and nobody had known them . We knew how little our soldiers cared about spies and that sort of men , and so it was not very difficult to come in and find out every thing . But on Tuesday , early in the morning , as soon as master had had his breakfast , we all slipped out and went down to the road , where we found a great many people standing about and talking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the servants , and the town itself . Down by the lake , where the road from the house comes into the turnpike , and not far from the little lodge , stood a heap of gentlemen , who had come up from town to beg pardon of the General , and to ask him not to burn them all out . They were mightily scared , and Mr. Fowler , the tailor , who is a great goose , as I have heard it said often and often , looked white and shook in all his limbs . It could not be from the cold , for although the rain had stopped overnight , it was quite mild in the morning . Alongside of them , but a little apart , stood master and some of his friends ; I do n't know if they I*ad come too to ask the Yankees to spare the house . Soon one man came flying down the hill , and then another , and then three or four together , galloping right by us without ever stopping , and just crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming 1 " 1 slipped up close to where master stood , and I could hear them say that it was a mighty hard thing to stand there and not to know whether they would have a house over their head next night or not ; and what would become of the ladies and of the little ones . One I heard say distinctly , " Oh , gentlemen , we 'll all go up before night , sure enough I " William Gibbons , who preaches down in the big bath-house every Sunday , said the gentleman was very *vicked , for if God would take us up we must all be ready at any time ; and he , for one , was quite willing to go to heaven . Every now and then somebody would cry out , " There they are ! " and we all looked up to the top of the hill , behind which the road was hid , and when a man slowly rose over the brow and it turned out that he was on horseback , we thought sure enough there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just when we thought they would not be coming that day , two men rode up the hill and down again slowly , then three more , then a dozen or more all in a body , with flags in their hands ; and at last the whole turnpike was blue , and we knew for a certainty they were come . We just looked at one another , and I felt mighty queer ; but Uncle Henry and all the others , who stood way down by the stile , looked exactly as if they were going to shout to the sky and to jump out of their skin . Aleck looked at me too , and winked , and shut his eyes , and shook all over , till I could not help myself , and I laughed , and they all laughed , and it set the others down at the stile a-laughing , and we held our sides and did not mind master and his friends looking at us as if they did not like it at all . When the first officer came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came near fidling between the horses ' feet , and they *dl cried out together , I do n't know what ; but the tailor had the biggest mouth , and he talked loudest . So I suppose they heard him , and one of the officers said something about private property being spared , but public property must be given up . Just then master walked up himself , like a real gentleman that he is , and although he was on foot and had not even a spur on his boot , he looked as good a man as the big officers on their fine horses . One of them told him he was not the General , but he would send up a guard as soon as they got into town . Then they moved on , and such a sight ! They looked very different from our poor Confederate soldiers , with their sleek horses and bright swords , and there was not a ragged jacket or a bare foot among thens all . They had , every one of them , a pile of good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many had a fine horse by their side with all sorts of packages and parcels strapped upon their hack , ever so high , but nobody in the saddle . But I thought , what would n't I give if I could but ride one of those fine horses and be a soldier and as good as any white man ! I looked at Aleck , and I saw he thought so too ; and what is best about it , it did not last long , and it all came true , sure enough . We stood there and looked and looked until we were tired , for there was no end to the horses , and the big guns , and the wagons , and oh , they had every thing so nice and so whole , though they were bespattered from head to foot ; I did not think soldiers could look so well . At last they were nearly all gone , and .1 and Aleck went back . When we came to the other side of the lake we saw Miss Mary and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some of them were crying ; but Miss Mary // qwq every thing . All the silver was gone , and all the china was broken , and the pictures cut to pieces , and the books thrown out of the window ; and as they were telling me the soldiers came out . Some had a pillow-case full of flour , another a tureen filled with meal , and still another had two big gold watches in his hand . At last one came out with a silver cup in his hand . When Miss Emma sees him she jumps up and catches hold of it , and says , " You sha' n't take away my poor baby 's cup I " " But I will , " says the soldier  --  a great big fellow with a sword by his side . " But you sha'u't ! " cries Miss Emma again , and the big tears ran down her cheeks . And there they pulled , she on one side and the gentleman on the other side , and I thought she was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts his hand upon the soldier 's arm , and says , " You will surely oblige the lady and let her have the cu** . " The Yankee looked quite bewildered , but he had let go , and Miss Emma ran back to her seat with her baby in her arm ; and the baby held the cup with her dumpy little fingers , as if she knew what she held , and master looked pleased and said : " lam glad , Sir , you can act so handsomely . " I thought the soldier had a great mind to tell him he did not want any of his praise ; but I know most men were rather afraid of master , he looked so stiff and so stately ; and he invent sloinvly away . Then master called out in a clear , loud voice : " Mike ORoarke ! Mike O'Rourke I was half frightened , when all of a sudden there stepped out from behind a big oak-tree a great red-haired Yankee , with a sword , and a carbine , and a pistol in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he . Master answered , " Were you not l ) laced here as guard , Sir , to protect this house ? " " Well , I believe I was . " " And when these marauders came , and the ladies begged you to protect them , you ran away and hid ? " The soldier looked as if he did not like at all being talked to in that way , and perhnps he had not a very good conscience ; so he said , in a sulky tone : " I could not stop all those fellows ; they were too many for me ! , Master said , very quietly : " You know very well that yonr orders are to do your duty , and to shoot down the first one who breaks the safeguard . " The Yankee looked rather taken aback ; bat then he cried out very angrily , " I * n't know what all this is to you , Sir , but I would have you know that it is very hard for a man whose house has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these beggarly rebels , and whose old father and mother have been driven out by night and ruined for life , to stand here and protect people who , for all I know , may have been the very ones to do so to me . " With that he turned on his heel and walked to the house . I do n't know what master thought ; but he looked rather puzzled , and went up to Miss Emma and began talking to them in a low voice . Soon after the Yankees made a great nproar in the house , and then they came out , one by one , the red-haired man shoving them out with a laugh and a curse , until the house was clear again . I had been watching them , so that I did not hear what master said to the ladies , but just as the last one went down the hill I heard Miss Polly crying bitterly , and saying : " And would you believe it , Sir , one of these wretches told me I was the ugliest woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma , she was too ugly to live ? " I looked hard at master , to see what he would say to that , but I thought lie was trying all lie could not to laugh . The*i he smiled and gave his arm to Miss Emma , and asked her when she had heard from her husband , and they all went back to the house . The red-haired man came out and sat down on the bench in the veranda ; arid when he sees me standing there , lie says , " Conic here , man , and bring nie some water ; and , look here , bring me some whisky too , or I 'll cut your head off ! " I was certainly afraid he would do it , too , so I ran as fast as I could to Uncle Tony close by , who I knew had some apple brandy , and telling him that it was for a Yankee soldier he gave me some . I ran back to the Irish gentleman-for I knew him to be Irish , because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the canal  --  and brought him the whisky . I *vns running for the water too , but he called after me , arid said lie *x'as not thirsty now , I need not go for water . So I sat down on the grass by his side , and looked up at him , and got hold of his sword , and made the little *vheels on his spurs play as fast as they xvoul* go . All of a sudden he looks at me and says : " Hallo , Cuffec , how would you like to have a fine horse and ride along with us all ? " My heart jumped when I heard him make such an offer ; but I did not know if he was in earnest , so I only laughed and laughed until he could not help himself and had to laugh too . But after a while he looked very sober , and said : " Nonsense , Cuffee , nonsense ; do n't laugh that way , but tell me soberly would not you like to go with me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really in earnest I jumped up and said , as loud as I could , " Yes , Sir , that I will , and I have long waited for the day ; God be thanked it has come at last , and I shall be a free man I " lie told me then to follow him , and we went over to Burr 's Hill , where the General had his head-quarters , and the red-haired man 's regiment had their camp . When we got there I found out that he belonged to the artillery , and the whole wood was filled with guns , and wagons , and horses , and all about the bill were fires lit , and the men were sitting around them eating their supper . I felt all of a sudden as hungry as a rattlesnake , for there they had coffee , and white sugar , and lemons , and all the good things we had not seen at our house for ever so long . We went past them all , until we came close to the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing around in a circle , and in the middle were some Yankee soldiers . Just as we came up I heard one of them say , // " Here is another fine lot ; what 's the bid ? " I she looked so wicked out of her eyes ; and then felt as if I was turning to stone , when I found Aunt hannah stood hy , and although she madeout that he held Boh , my second cousin , hy his believe she was husy with her pots and plates I right ear , and pushed him forward in the bright knew she had heard every word I said . But I light . I thought sure enough it was all the old could not help looking at Flora , and just to say story ovcr again , and we were not free yet , hut " Oh , Miss Flora ! " and I thought she looked to he sold just as we were before . Somebody as sweet as a rose-hud , when she cast her eyes cried out , " I 'll give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickcd at the pretty belt I had given hid a loaf of sugar ! " Now I wondered more her the Sunday hcfore , and seemed to thiak very than ever , for Bob was a powerful fellow , and hard . qwq him down to water , and I did not like to be bucked like Bob . I went down to the spring , and I could not help thinking he was the handsomest horse I bad ever laid eyes on , and it would be a great thing for me to ride alongside of all the gentlemen on such a fine horse . When I came back to the fire they showed me a quantity of bags and bales , all nicely fixed in white cotton sbeets , which I had to strap on the horse ; there was just enough room left between the pile in front and the pile behind to get into the saddle . They did not give me any breakfast either , but I did not miud that much , for soon the bugles sounded-it made me feel like a gentleman to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my new master , who was a corporal or a major , had some other gentlemen under him , and when the guns were all ranged in beautiful order , the Colonel came out and looked at us , and off we marched with the music at our head . First caine the Colonel and some officers , then came the music , with all sorts of instruments such as I had never seen before ; after them came men who bore a number of flags , which I knew nothing of , and after them , before all the regiment , came we colored people , about fifty of us , all on fine horses , and the happiest boys ever you saw in your life . It was glorious . But when we got to the corner by the tobacco-house , where the gate has been out of order for many years and the lane is quite low and narrow , they all stopped and we could not go any farther . The mud was awful , and the horses could not pull the heavy guns and the wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt mighty badly , but I could not run away , and I looked for my new master to stand by me and let them all know that I was free . When master 's eye came slowly down the line and at last fell right upon me , I thought I was going to sink into the ground . It made me feel sick . When I looked up again he was making his way through the horses and the cannons right up to me , and did not mind the mud , and the way the soldiers all looked at him , and the horses that wanted to kick him . When he came up to where I sat on my horse , he just said , " Oh , Oby I " and before I knew what I was doing , I was out of the saddle and standing right before him , with my new cap in my hand . He said , in his quiet way , " Oby , you know you are not strong enough to sleep out in the open air ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not three weeks since you were sick with pneumonia . Come home , my boy , and do n't distress your father and your mother . You know it will kill my new master came dashing up to where we were , and with a terrible oath told me to mount my horse and be ready to start . I was so frightened I did not know what to do . Master never said a word , but just looked at me as if he pitied me from the bottom of his heart , and I could not stand that ; I did not think of father and mother at home , nor of Flora , nor of the nice times we had had together in the fields at night , but I just looked at master and went away with him . But the soldier was not satisfied yet ; he came straight up to us , and swearing worse than ever , he said to master , " flow dare you , Sir , force that man away ? Do you not know that he is free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master changed color ; I knew he was not accustomed to be spoken to in that way , and I wished I had never thought of enlisting as a soldier . But he said nothing at all , and although the soldiers all turned around , and my new master pulled out his carbine and cocked it , he made his way between the horses and the guns , I fol-. lowing him close by , until we came out on the other side of the column , and then he said very quietly , " Now , Oby , go home and tell your father not to distress himself about you any farther . " I was just running up the road , when I heard somebody galloping up , and as I turned round I saw it was a great officer , with a sword in his hand , who rode up to master and asked him what was the matter . I could not hear his answer , but the officer said , " We do not force servants to go with us , and if your Joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came home I found father and mother , Uncle Henry , and all of them in mother 's room , and when they saw mc they all cried out , " Oh , Oby , what have you been doing ? " Well , it made me right angry to be treated thus like a baby , and I went out into the yard . There stood Flora , and what must she do but come up to me in the prettiest way of the world and drop me a little courtesy , and say in a little lisping way , " Oho , Mr. Paragon , you had not the courage to go with your friends ? Do n't you look like a little whipped boy ? Shall I ask Miss Lucy for some candy for you ? " It made me mad to hear her talk so , when she had all the time been telling me that I ought to stay , and not run away like the poor stupid fieldhands . I turned round without looking at her , and ran over to Uncle Bob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in , but Aunt Betsy was there , with the children about her , packing up all her things . I wondered what she was doing , but she would not give me any answer , and I was too mad to go home again ; so I staid them ! " and waited for Uncle Bob to come home again . I knew that what he said was but too true ; They had some nice middlings that day , and but then again , when I looked at the fine horse goody-bread with the sweetest cracklings I ever I was on , and all the gentlemen around me , I ate , and we all laughed , and talked , and I felt quite undecided . Master said again , very danced a jig for Aunt Betsy , and others came in quietly , " Come home , Oby ! " and I followed until the house was full . him , I did not know why . But just as we were Late in the evening Uncle Bob came home , getting out of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sight he was ! He bad a double barness // hanging over his shoulders , and a saddle made a roaring fire in the woods , and we joined on his head , and his hands full of bags and them . I was so sleepy I fell down where we satchels , and a big gun under his arm . lie stopped , and did not know what happened any looked very tired , aud threw it all down ; then more . qwq then I pitched Aunt Bctsy and the little ones into the carryall , and all the bundles I could find . I was as in a dream , but it was not long before the horses were put in , and Uncle Bob was cracking his whip , and we were running after them as fast as we could . When we were a little more quiet again we looked around , and then we found out that we bad left our friends the Yankees , and were quite alone by ourselves . There were about five or six colored ladies with us , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of clothes and such things under the other ; thea there were one or two elderly men who looked scared and did not know , I believe , what they were doing , except that they must go on , on until they got to the North ; and lastly , there were three or four little children who were just running along with the rest of them for the fun . After a while I began to feel hungry , and when I looked at Flora in the bright daylight I thought she looked hungry too ; at all events she was very pale and drooping , and I saw she had no shoes on , and could hardly walk . I went to help her , but she tried to hold up , and said it did not matter . I saw , though , it would matter pretty soon , for we had not a mouthful of bread nor meal among us , and , excopt Uncle Bob , who was rich enough , there was not one among us who had any money . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protectors , and not likely to he received on any plantation . It seemed that all of our party felt the same way , for no one sail a word . Every now and then one of the children would begin to whine and he told to hush up . Then some girl would laugh right out and suddenly stop short , as if she was frightened at the sound of her own voice . Uncle Bob , who knew best , had his hands full to drive his tired horses and to pull the carrval 1 , with its heavy load , through the awfnlly bad roads . I *valked steadily on , Flora right behind me , Indian file , and what with the cold drizzling rain , *vettiug us to the skin , and the loads of mud that stuck to our feet , and the heavy thoughts that weighed on our minds , we did not make a very merry couple . I thought , every now and then , what a glorious time I would have at the North . I knew I could make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of a nice little shop I might have in Cincinnati , where Peter Rite went when he was made free , and of Flora being my good wife , really married , and the beautiful things I was going to buy for her , so that she mightlook areal lady . But in the midst of my thoughts I stumbled against a big , 01 ( 1 root , or Flora sighed behind me , and then coughed a little to put me on a false track , or asked nie some question , to show that she was not sad at all , and my dreams were gone in a moment , and I saw all our troubles clear before me again . We tramped on until late in the evening , when we met an old field-hand , with a bag of1 potatoes on his back , who told us we were sti ll* eight miles from the canal , and that he had seenl no Yankees any where . We asked him to let us have his potatoes , but he said he did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going away to leave us , when Uncle Bob came up and asked him what lie would take for them in greenbacks . When he heard us speak of greenbacks he became very polite at once , and sold them for ninepence to Uncle Bob , who made him promise to bring some fat middung and some corn-meal up to the old tobacco house , where we meant to spend the night . We all went in there , and it was a nice enough place for us to get dry in ; there was some hay in a lean  --  to on one side , and I made a nice little bed for Flora ; but we did not dare make a large fire for fear they might see it at the house and send the overseer down to turn us out . Uncle Bob got his niiddling , and Aunt Betsy cooked all they had for herself and her children , asking me and Flora to come up and help ourselves . I did not like much going there , when there were so many others who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to make no hesitation-he always loved big words  --  and to partake of his victuals . I took Flora by the hand and pulled her along with me to the fire . Aunt Betsy looked at us , and I thought she was going to have a . hearty laugh , but somehow there was none of us that night could laugh heartily , and we ate just to satisfy our hunger , but it ( lid not taste good . Then we had a chew of tobacco , and Uncle Bob proposed we should sing a psalm about the mansions in the sky , and hallelujah , but we broke down pretty soon , and then we all lay down , one here , one there , as we were sitting . I was tired enough , but I could not sleep ; the thoughts would come into my head . I could not drive father and mother out of my head , and every time I saw them in my mind they looked so sad it made me feel very badly . Then the children cried and moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ones groaned too , and cried out : " 0 Lord , 0 Lord a-mercy it w'ms very hard to hear it all and not be able to help them in any way . So I was right glad when the mist hroke in the morning and the sun rose , first red , like blood , and looking us if it were angry at us , and then clear and bright , like the dayspring from on high . I ran down to the spring , where there was a plenty of water , to wash , and when I came back I saw Flora talking very anxiously to Aunt Betsy . They hushed lip when I came near , but I could see well enough that Flora had been crying , and that somebody had given her an old pair of shoes that were twice as big as her feet . She did not have big splash-feet , like a field-hand nigger woman , hut hers were nice enough for any white lady . I felt mighty sorry for her ; she was not accustomed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly ever been sent out of the house . I knew she could not stand it long , and I was determined to make her go back . I did not mean to speak to her directly . I knew she would not listen to me if she once had made // up her mind ; but I thought she would mind along . Whenever we met a colored man we what Aunt Betsy would say to her . I took asked him how far it still was to the canal , for the old lady aside , and told her all about my we knew we would meet the Yankees there sure fears and troubles , and she promised at once to enough , and they would not let us starve , but talk to Flora and to persuade her to go home give us all rations . It seemed as if we were again . never getting nearer to it , for every time we qwq others , who had gotten far ahead of us , and it was late in the evening when we saw them all standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was just about setting , and the sky was golden , and as we looked at them we could see every ray of their clothes and every hair on their head . They all talked very loud , even Uncle Bob , who seemed to be very angry . We came up slowly , for we were terribly tired , and Flora could hardly drag one foot after the other . When we came up to where they stood , we saw we were on the side of the canal , and there on the tow-path sat Aunt Hannah , crying and screaming all together , and the others stood around her and looked as angry as could be . We pressed close up to Aunt Betsy , and I asked her in a whisper what was the matter . " Oh , Oby ! " she said , " just think of it , Aunt Hannah was the first to see the canal , and she walks right up to where we now are and takes her poor little baby-it was not more than two months old  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the water , and there it lies now . Oh , Oby , these are awful times ! God . have mercy upon us ! " I could not say s* word . I had never seen or heard of such misery in my life . Flora went quietly down to where Aunt Hannah was rocking herself ; weeping like a child , and then screaming out aloud , and sat down by her and tried to take her hands and to soothe her . But Aunt Hannah would not be soothed ; she cried out : " Leave me alone , you ! leave me alone ! You do n't know what it is to have a baby and to see it die on your breast . She is happier down there than she could ever have been in this world . I only wished I was there too . Ca n't yolx leave me alone ? or give me something to eat ? I have not eaten any thing since day before yesterday , not a mouthful . Oh , my baby , my baby ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that she began screaming again , as if she were distracted . I could not stand it any longer ; so I touched Flora and told her to come along , Uncle Bob was going and we must try to get something ourselves , or we would be starved too , or get mad like poor Aunt Hannah . Flora got up and followed me , but she did not say a word . The tears were just running down her cheeks , and she did not mind it in the least . Uncle Bob was driving along on the tow-path , and we all followed in a long string , very slowly . At last we came to another turn , and there , right before us , lay a big mill , and behind it the town . On the mill-race stood a soldier in blue , and I could have shouted aloud , for now I knew our troubles would surely be at an end . I do not know what made me so bold , but I walked right up to the soldier and asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good servant . He looked at me and then at Flora , who was standing behind me , and said : " You mean two good servants , do n't you ? I ca n't afford keeping a servant , but there is the sutler ; I heard him inquire a little while ago for a hanVOL . XXXHI. - No. 197. -X x dy fellow , who understood horses and knew how to make coffee and such things . " I hardly let him finish , for that was exactly what I was good for , and Flora made beautiful coffee . I just asked him where the sutler was , and when he showed me some way down the street a splendid team of four gray mules , standing before a large , fine house , and said that was the sutler 's wagon , I took hold of Flora 's hand and ran down as fast as I could . But when I camo* between the mules and the house I saw a whole crowd of servants standing around the door and crying out : " Take me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over , and I had lost say first and last chance , when Flora suddenly let go my hand and fell down like a log of wood , right between the wheels of the wagon . I tried to lift her up , but there was such a crowd , and the mules began to kick , and I thought she was going to die right away . Just then a man who had been inside the wagon popped his head out , and seeing Flora lying there , he asked : " Hallo , what is the matter , my man ? " I told him as well as I could , and begged him for mercy 's sake to help me , for Flora was sore enough dying . He laughed and stepped down leisurely over the swingle-trees , with a piece of hard tack in one hand and a bottle in the other . He poured some out of the bottle into his hand and rubbed her head with it , then he poured some down between her teeth , and when I could see next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , opening her eyes as if she had been fast asleep , and munching a little bread in her mouth . I thanked the gentleman for having saved her life , but he only laughed the more . Then he asked me if I was not hungry too ; and before I could say a word he pushed a whole pile of crackers into my hands . When Flora was all right again , he asked us what we were going to do with ourselves , and we told him as fast as we could , for we were both mighty grateful to him for his kindness . Then he told us that he was the sutler himself ; and that if we promised to do well and be faithful servants to him he might find something to do for us both . He called to his clerk2 who was in the house , and told him to see to it that we got a place to sleep in and some supper . When I looked a little around me I saw they had a beautiful flag flying from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night I slept under the Stars and Stripes , a free man .
