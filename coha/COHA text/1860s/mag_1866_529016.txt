KATHARINE MORNE . PART I. CHAPTER I. ONE day , near the middle of a June about twenty years ago , my landlady met me at the door of my boarding-house , and began with me the following dialogue . " Miss Morne , my dear , home a ' - ready ? Goin ' to be in , a spell , now ? " " Yes , Mrs. Johnson , I believe so . Why ? " " Well , someb'dy s been in here to pay ye a call , afore twelve o'clock , in a tearin ' hurry . Says I , Ye ye got afore yer story this time , I guess , ' says I. Says he , I guess I 'll call again , ' says he . He s left ye them pinies an ' snowballs in the pitcher . " " But who was it ? " " Well , no great of a stranger , it wa ' n't , - Jim " 0 , thank you . " " He kind o ' seemed as if he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his mind to say to ye . My ! how he colored up at somethin ' I said ! " I walked by , and away from her , into the house , but answered that I should be happy to see Jim if he came back . Well I might . Through all the months of school - keeping that followed my mother 's death , - in the little country village of Greenville , so full of homesickness for me , - he had been my kindest friend . My old schoolmate , Emma Holly , from whose native town he came , assured me beforehand that he would be so . She wrote to me that he was the best , most upright , well-principled , kind-hearted fellow in the world . He was almost like a brother to her , ( this surprised me a little , because I had never heard her speak of him before , ) and so he would be to me , if I would only let him . She had told him all about me and our troubles and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  and he was very much interested , and would shovel a path for me when it snowed , or go to the post-office for me , or do anything in the world for me that he could . And so he had done . He had little chance , indeed , to devote himself to me abroad ; for I seldom went out , except now and then , when I could not refuse without giving offence , to drink tea with the family of some pupil . But when I did that , he always found it out through Mrs. Johnson , whose nephew he was , and came to see me home . He usually brought some additional wrappings or thick shoes for me ; and even if they were too warm , or otherwise in my way , I could be , and was , grateful for his kindnesn in thinking of them . He was very attentive to his aunt also , and came to read aloud to her , while she napped , almost every evening . At every meal which he took with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and luxuries for me , till I was afraid she would really be annoyed . She took his hints , however , in wonderfully good part , sometimes acted upon them , and often said to me , " How improvin ' it was for young men to have somebody to kind o ' think for ! It made em so kind o ' thoughtful ! " Many a flower , fruit , and borrowed book he brought me . He tried to make me walk with him ; and , whenever he could , he made me talk with him . But for him , I should have studied almost all the time that I was not teaching or sleeping ; for when I began to teach , I first discovered how little I had learned . Thus nearly all the indulgences and recreations of the rather grave , lonely , and hard-working little life I was leading at that time were associated with him and his kind care ; and so I really think it was no great wonder if his peonies and snowballs that day made the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morne. staring , uncouth daguerreotypes on the mantel-piece , look very pretty to me , or that to know that he had been there , and was coming back again , made it a very happy place . I walked across it , took off my hot black bonnet , threw up the western window , and sat down beside it in the rocking-chair . The cool breeze struggled through the tree that nestled sociably up to it , and made the little knobs of cherries nod at me , as if saying , " You would not like us now , but you will by and by . " The oriole gurgled and giggled from among them , " Wail ! Come again ! Come again ! Ha , ha ! " The noise of the greedy canker-worms , mincing the poor young green leaves over my head , seemed a soothing sound ; and even the sharp headache I had brought with me from the school-room , only a sort of sauce ute to my delicious rest . I did not ask myself what Jim would say . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how anything to follow could surpass that perfect luxury of waiting peace . He did come soon . I heard a stealthy step , not on the gravel-walk , but on the rustling hay that lay upon the turf beside it . He looked , and then sprang , in at the window . He was out of breath . He caught my hand , and looked into my face , and asked me to go out and walk with him . Before I had time to answer , he snatched up my bonnet , and almost pressed it down upon my head . As I tied it , he hurried out and looked back at me eagerly from the road . I followed , though more slowly than he wished . The sun was bright and hot , and almost made me faint ; but everything was very beautiful . He wrenched out the topmost bar of a fence , jumped me over it into a meadow , led me by a forced march into the middle of the field , seated me on a haycock , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own all aglow . Then he told me that he had been longing for weeks , as I must have seen , to open his mind to me ; but , till that day , he had not been at liberty . He had regarded me , from almost . the very beginning of our acquaintance , as his best and trustiest friend , - in short , as just what dear Emma had told him he should find me . My friendship had been a blessing to him in every way ; and now my sympathy , or participation , was all he wanted to render his happiness complete . He had just been admitted as a partner in the store of the village , in which he had hitherto been only a salesman ; and now , therefore , he was at last free to offer himself , before all the world , to the girl he loved best ; and that was - I must guess who . He called me " dearest Katy , " and asked me if he might not " to-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter my guess . He seemed to think I had done so , notwithstanding ; for he hurried on , delighted . " Of course it is , Katy darling , ' as we always call you ! I never knew your penetration out of the way . It is Emma Holly ! It could n't be anybody but Emma Holly ! " Then he told me that she had begged hard for leave to tell me outright , what she thought she had hinted plainly enough , about their hopes ; but her father was afraid that to have them get abroad would hurt her prospects in other quarters , and made silence towards all others a condition of her correspondence with Jim . Mr. Holly was " aristocratic , " and in hopes Emma would change her mind , Jim supposed ; but all danger was over now . He could maintain her like the lady she was ; and their long year 's probation was ended . Then he told me in what agonies he had passed several evenings a fortnight before , ( when I must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hearing of her illness . The doctors were right for once , to be sure , as it proved , in thinking it only the measles ; but it might just as well have been spotted fever , or small-pox , or anything fatal , for all they knew . And then I rather think there must have been a pause , which I did not fill // properly , because my head was aching with a peculiar sensation which I had never known before , though I have sometimes since . - It is like the very hand of Death , laid with a strong gasp on the joint and meeting-point of soul and body , and makes one feel , for the time being , as Dr. Livingstone says he did when the lion shook him , - a merciful indifference as to anything to come after . - And Jim was asking me , in a disappointed tone , what the matter was , and if . I did not feel interested . " Yes , " I said , " Mr. Johnson - " " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it would be 7irn at least , to-day , if you ca n't say dear Jim . " " Yes , dear Jim , ' " I repeated ; and my voice sounded so strangely quiet in my own ears , that I did not wonder that he called me cold . " Indeed , I am interested . I do n't know when I have heard anything that has interested me so much . I pray God to bless you and Emma . But the reason I came from school so early to-day was , that I had a headache ; and now I think perhaps the sun is not good for it , and I had better go in . " I stood up ; but I suspect I must have had something like a sunstroke , sitting there in the meadow so long with no shade , in the full blaze of June . I was almost too dizzy to stand , and could hardly have reached the house , if I had not accepted Jim 's arm . He offered , in the joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which luckily made me laugh , - declaring that mine must be a perfect portable stove for the brains . Thus we reached the door cheerfully , and there shook hands cordially ; while I bade him take my kindest love and congratulations to Emma , - to whom he was going on a three days ' visit , as fast *s the cars could carry him , - and char*ed him to tell her I should write as soon as I recovered the use of my head . He looked concerned on being reminded of it , and shouted for Mrs. Johnson to bring me some lavenderwater to bathe it with . I had told him , on a former occasion , that the smell of lavender always made it worse ; but it was natural that , when he was so happy , he should forget . Whistling louder than the orioles , whose songs rang wildly through and through my brain , he hastened down the road , and was gone . CHAPTER II . JIM was gone ; but I was left . I could have spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . However , for that afternoon the blessed pain took such good care of me that I lay upon my bed still and stunned , and could only somewhat dimly perceive , not how unhappy I was , but how unhappy I was going to be . It quieted Mrs. Johnson , too . She had seen me suffering from headache before , and knew that I could never talk much while it lasted . Her curiosity was at once satisfied and gratified by hearing what Jim had left me at liberty to tell her , - the news of his partnership in the firm . The engagement was not to be announced in form till the next week ; though I , as the common friend of both parties , had been made an exceptional confidante ; and Jim , afraid of betraying himself , had not trusted himself to take leave of his aunt , but left his love for her , and his apologies for outstaying his time so far in the meadow as to leave himself none for the farm-house . Thus I had a reprieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worn out and slept ; so that it was not till the birds began to rehearse for their concert at sunrise the next morning , that I came to myself and looked things in the face in the clear light of the awful dawn . If you can imagine a very heavy weight let somewhat gradually , but irresistibly , down upon young and tender shoulders , then gently lifted again , little by little , by a sympathizing and un // looked-for helper , and lastly tossed by him unexpectedly into the air , only to fall back with redoubled weight , and crush the frame that was but bowed before , you can form some idea of what had just happened to me . My mother 's death , our embarrassments , my loneliness , the hard and to me uncongenial work I had to do , all came upon me together more heavily than at any time since the first fortnight that I spent at Greenville . But that was not all . Disappointment is hardly the right word to use ; for I can truly say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim 's attentions to me . They were offered so honestly and respectfully that I instinctively felt I could accept them with perfect propriety , and perha*s could scarcely with propriety refuse . I had never once asked myself what they meant , nor whither they tended . But yet I was used to them now , and had learned to prize them far more than I knew ; and they must be given up . My heart-strings had unconsciously grown to him , and ought to be torn away . And I think that , beyond grief , beyond the prospect of lonely toil and poverty henceforth , beyond all the rest , was the horror of an idea which came upon me , that I had lost the control of my own mind , - that my peace had passed out of my keeping into the power of another , who , though friendly to me , neither would nor could preserve it for me , - that I was doomed to be henceforward the prey of feelings which I must try to conceal , and perhaps could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own eyes , and would do so in those of others if they were seen by them , which were wrong , and which I could not help . These thoughts struck and stung me like so many hornets . Crying , " Mother ! mother ! " I sprang from my bed , and fell on my knees beside it . I did not suppose it would do much good for me to pray ; but I said over and over , if only to stop myself from thinking , " 0 God , help me ! God have mercy on me ! " as fast as I could , till the town clock struck five , and I knew that I must begia to dress , and compose myself , if I would appear as usual at six o'clock at the breakfast-table . My French grammar , was , as usual , set up beside my looking-glass . As usual , I examined myself aloud in one of the exercises , while I went through my toilet . If I did make some mistakes it was no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before breakfast to correct some of the compositions which I had brought with me from school . The rest , as I often did when hurried , I turned over while I tried to eat my bread and milk . This did not encourage conversation . During the meal , I was only asked how my head was , **d answered only that it was better . I had taken care not to shed a tear , so that my eyes were not swollen ; and as I had eaten nothing since the morning of the day before , nobody could be surprised to see me pale . Mrs. Johnson left her seat , too , almost as soon as I took mine . She was in a great bustle , getting her covered wagon under way , and stocked with eggs , butter , cheese , and green vegetables for her weekly trip to the nearest market-town . She was , however , sufficiently mindful of her nephew 's lessons to regret that she must leave me poorly when he would not be there to cheer me up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my dinner while she was gone . I chose a boiled chicken and rice . It was what my mother used to like best to have me eat when I was not welL I often rebelled against it when a child ; but now I sought by means of it to soothe myself with the fancy that I was still under her direction . Mrs. Johnson also offered to do for me what I forgot to ask of her , - to look in at the post-office and see if there was not a letter there for me from my only sister . Fanny , for once , had sent me none the week before . Mrs. Johnson went to town , and I to school . I worked and worried through the lessons , - how , I never knew ; but I dare say the children were forbearinb ; // children are apt to be when one is not term a little earlier than usual , and bewell . I came home and looked at the ginning a little earlier in the fall . ' chicken and rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . They would have made me cry . JULIA . So I hurried out again , away from them , and away from the meadow , and walked in the woods all that Saturday afternoon , thinking to and fro , - not so violently as in the morning , for I was weaker , but very confusedly and in endless perplexity . How could I stay in Greenville ? I should have to be with Jim ! But how could I go ? What reason had I to give ? and what would people think was my reason ? But would it not be wrong to stay and see Jim ? But it would be wrong to break my engagement to the school com-mittee ! At length again the clock struck five , which was supper-time , and I saw myself no nearer the end of my difficulties ; and I had to say once again , " God help me ! God have mercy on me ! " and so went home . Mrs. Johnson was awaiting me , with this letter for me in her pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in that of a friend of ours with whom she was staying , Mrs. Physick , the wife of the most eminent of the younger physicians in Beverly , our native town . I opened it hastily and read : - " Mv DEAR KATIE : - " You must not be uneasy at my writing instead of Fannie , as the Doctor thinks it too great an effort for her . She has had an attack of influenza , not very severe , but you know she is never very strong , and I am afraid she is too much afraid of calling on me for any little thing she wants done . So we think , the Doctor and I , it would do her good to have a little visit from you . She wanted us to wait for the summer vacation , so as not to alarm you ; but you know that is three , whole weeks off , and nobody knows how much better she may be within that time . The Doctor says , suggest to Katie that the committee might , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. 5 . You must not be anxious about dear Fannie . She has brightened up very much already at the mere thought of seeing you . Her cough is not half so troublesome as it was a week ago , and the Doctor says her very worst symptom is weakness . She says she must write one word herself . " 0 what a tremulous word ! " DEAR KATY : - " Do come if you can , and do n't be anxious . Indeed I am growing stronger every day , and eating so much meat , and drinking so much whiskey . It does me a great deal of good , and would a great deal more if I could only tell how we were ever to pay for it , I knew she would have said ; but Dr. Physick had evidently interposed ; for the signa-ture , " Your mutinous and obstreperous " SISTER FANNY , " was prefaced with a scratched-out involuntary " R , " and looked like a prescription . I might be as sad as I would now ; and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was standing on the door-step , and held the letter helplessly up to Mrs. Johnson . It did seem to me now as if Fate was going to empty its whole quiver of arrows at once upon me , and meant to kill me , body and soul . But I have since thought sometimes , when I have heard people say , Misfortunes never came single , and How mysterious it was ! that God only dealt with us , in that respect somewhat as some surgeons think it best to do with wounded men , - perform whatever operations are necessary , immediately after the first injury , so as to make one and the same " shock " take the place of more . In this way of Providence , I am sure I have repeatedly seen accumulated sorrows , which , if distributed through longer intervals , might have darkened a // lifetime , lived through , and in a considerable degree recovered from , even in a very few years . Mrs. Johnson 's spectacles , meantime , were with eager curiosity peering over the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do tell ! My ! What a providence ! There s Sister Nancy Newcome 's Elviry jest got home this arternoon from her situation to the South , scairt off with the insurrections as unexpected as anything . She s as smart a teacher as ever was ; an ' the committee d ha ' gin her the school in a minute , an ' thank you , too ; but she wuz alwuz a kind o ' lookin ' up'ards ; an ' I s'pose she cal'lated it might for'ard her prospects to go down an ' show herself among the plantations . There s better opportoonities , they say , sometimes for young ladies to git settled in life down there , owin ' to the scurcity on em . She 11 be glad enough to fill your place , I guess , till somethin ' else turns up , for a fortni't or a month , or a term . It 'll give her a chance to see her folks , an ' fix up her does , an ' look round her a spell . An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' an ' go right off an ' close that poor young creatur 's eyes , an ' take your time for t . Seems as if I hearn tell your ma went off in a kind of a gallopin ' decline , did n't she ? " " No , she did not ! " cried I , springing up with a renewal of energy that must have surprised Mrs. Johnson . " Nothing of the kind ! I will take my letter again , if you please . My sister has a cold , - only a cold . But where can I see Miss Newcome ? " " To home ; but I declare , you ca n't feel hardly fit to start off ag'in . Jest you step in an ' sup your tea afore it s any colder . I ye had mine ; an ' I 11 step right hack over there , an ' see about it for ye . " Mrs. Johnson , if coarse , was kind ; and that time it would be hard to say whether her kindness or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused me , between indignation and horror , to a strong reaction . Mrs. Johnson , I said to myself , knew no more of the matter than I. Nobody said a word , in the letter , of Fanny 's being very ill ; and there had been , as I now considered , to the best of my recollection and information , no consumption in our family . My father died when I was five years old , as I had always heard of chronic bronchitis and nervous dyspepsia , or , in other words , of over-work and under-pay . An early marriage to a clergyman , who had no means of support but a salary of five hundred dollars dependent on his own health and the tastes of a parish , early widowhood , two helpless little girls to rear , years of hard work , anxieties , and embarrassments , a typhoid fever , with no physician during the precious first few days , during which , if she had sent for him , Dr. Physick always believed he might have saved her , a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill poor , dear , sweet mamma ! She had a magnificent constitution , and bequeathed much of it to me . Else I do not think I could have borne , and recovered from , those three days even as well as I did . The cars did not run on Sunday . That was so dreadful ! But there was no other hindrance in my way . Everybody was very kind . The school committee could not meet in form " on the Sabbath " ; but the chairman , who was Miss Elvira Newcome 's brother-in-law , " sounded the other members after meetin ' , jest as he fell in with em , casooally as it were , " and ascertained that they would offer no objection to my exchange . He advanced my pay himself , and brought it to me soon after sunrise Monday morning ; so that I was more than *ufficiently provided with funds for my journey . Mrs. Johnson forced upon me a suspicious-looking corked bottle of innocent tea , - one of the most sensible travelling companions , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can possibly have , - and a large paper of doughnuts . Feverish as I was , I would right willingly have given her back , not only the doughnuts , but the tea , to bribe her not to persecute me // as she did for a message for Jim . But I could leave my thanks for all his kindness , and my regrets - sincere , though repented of- that I could not see him again , before I went , to say good-by ; and , already in part effaced by the impression of the last blow that had fallen upon me , that scene in the dreadful meadow seemed months and miles away . The engine shrieked . The cars started . My hopes and spirits rose ; and I was glad , because I was going hom* , - that is , where , when I had a home , it used to be . CHAPTER III . THE rapid motion gratified my restlessness , and , together with the noise , soothed me bomceopathically . I slept a great deal . The midsummer day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I found myself rather refreshed than fatigued when the conductor ioused me finally by shouting names more and more familiar , as we stopped at way - stations . I sat upright , and strained my cinderf 7 eyes , long surfeited with undiluted green , for the first far blue and silver glimpses of my precious sea . Then well-known rocks and cedars came hurrying forward , as if to meet me half-way . As the cars stopped for the last time with me , I caught sight of a horse and chaise approaching at a rapid rate down the main street of the town . The driver sprang out and threw the reins - to a boy . He turned his face - a grave face - up , and looked searchingly along the row of car-windows . It was Dr. Physick . I darted out at the nearest door . He saw me , smiled , and was at it in an instant , catching both my hands in his to shake them and help me down by them at the same time . " Little Katy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I sometimes took the liberty to tell him , I was very sure I had long left off being Ikat , even if I was not yet quite the size of some giants I had seen , - " Lit-565 tle Katy ! How jolly ! Fanny ? ' 0 , Fanny s pretty comfortable , - looking out for you and putting her head out of the window , I dare say , the minute my back s turned . I look to you now to keep her in order . Baggage ? Only bag ? Give it to me . Foot , - now hand , - there you are ! " And there I was , - where I was most glad to be once more , - in his gig , and driving , in the cool , moist twilight , down the dear old street , shaded with dear old elms , with the golden and amber sunset still glowing between their dark boughs ; where every quiet , snug , old wooden house , with its gables and old-fashioned green or white front-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and sign even , seemed an old friend . The lingering glow still lay full on the front of our old home , which now had " Philemon Physick , M. D. " on the corner . As we stopped before it , I thought I spied a sweet little watching face , for one moment , behind a pane of one of the second-story windows . But if I did , it was gone before I was sure . " Here she is ! " called out the Doctor . " Julia ! - Wait a minute , Kate , my dear , - no hurry . Julia ! " Up he ran , while " Julia " ran down , said something , in passing , to him on the stairs , kissed me at the foot three times over , - affectionately , but as if to gain time , I thought , - led me into the parlor to take off my bonnet , and told me Fanny was not quite ready to see me just then , but would be , most likely , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see about it , and would let me know . " 0 , did n't I see her at the window ? " " Yes , dear , you did ; and that was just the trouble . She saw you were there ; and she was so pleased , it made her a little faint . The Doctor will give her something to take ; and as soon as she is a little used to your being here , of course you can be with her all , the time . " The Doctor came down , speaking cheerily . " She is all right now . Run Kat4arinc Morne. // up , as fast as you like , and kiss her , was her solemn , peaceful gaze still Kate , my child ; but tell her I forbid watching me , like that of an unsleeping your talking till to-morrow .

' And now , Katy , " continued kind , cheery Mrs. Physick , " you see , your coming hack has put her in the best of spirits ; and you and the Doctor and I are all going to take the best of care of her ; and so we may all hope the best . " " The best of care " ? Ah , there was little doubt of that ! But even " good spirits " ! who could hope to see Fanny enjoying them for any length of time , till she had done with time ? Good , uncomplaining , patient , I had always seen her , - happy , how seldom ! - when , indeed , till now ? There was not enough of earth about her for her to thrive and bloom . My mother , I believe , used to attribute in part to Fanny 's early training her early joylessness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have understood , - it was thought right even by some good people of our " persuasion , " to lose no opportunity of treating the little natural waywardnesses of children with a severity which would now be called ferocity . Mamma could never have practised this herself ; but perhaps she suffered it to be practised to a greater extent than she would have consented to endure , had she foreseen the consequences . My poor father must have been inexperienced , too ; and I suppose his nerves , between sickness and poverty , might at times be in such a state that he scarcely knew what he did . I was four years younger than Fanny , and know nothing about it , except a very little at second-hand* But at any rate I have often heard my mother say , with a glance at her , and a gravity as if some sad association enforced the lesson on her mind , that it was one of the first duties of those who undertook the charge of children to watch over their cheerfulness , and a most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ofl so much as to reprimand them when one 's own balance 567 was at all disturbed . This was a rule that she never to my knowledge broke ; though she was naturally rather a highstrung person , as I think the pleasantest and most generous people one meets with generally are . From whatever cause or causes , - to return to Fanny , - she grew up , not fierce , sullen , nor yet hypocritical , but timid and distrustful , miserably sensitive and anxious , and morbidly conscientious . There was another pleasure in store for her , however ; for , the afternoon following that of my return , Mrs. Julia , looking out as usual for her husband , - with messages from four different alarmingly or alarmed sick persons , requesting him to proceed without delay in four different directions , - saw him at length driving down the road with such unprofessional slowness that she feared some accident to himself or his harness . When he came before the door , the cause appeared . It was a handsome Bath chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large nosegay on the seat , fastened to the back of his gig , and safely towed by it . " What is that for ? " cried I from Fanny 's window . " Fanny 's coach , " said he , looking up . " Miss Dudley has sent it to be taken care of for her . She does not want it herself for the present ; and you can draw your dolly out in it every fine day . " " 0 , " cried Fanny , sitting upright on the couch by the window , - where she spent the greater part of the day , - to see for hersell with the tears in her eyes . " 0 , how lovely ! That is the very kindest thing she has done yet ; - and you do n't know how she keeps sending me everything , Katy ! " " Miss Dudley ? Who is she ? " " 0 , do n't you know ? The great naturalist 's sister . He lives in that beautiful place , on the shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it before you went to Greenville . She is very sick , I am afraid , - very kind , I am sure . I never saw her . She has heard about me . I am afraid Katharine Maine . // the Doctor told her . I hope she does not think I meant he should . " " Of course , dear , she does not . " " Do you really think so ? " " Certainly . " " Why ? " " Why , - I know I should not like being begged of in that underhand way myself ; and if I did not like it , I might send something , once , but after that I should never keep on sendino " " I am very glad you think so ; for I like her kindness , though I scarcely like to have her show it in this way , because I am afraid I can never do anything for her . But I hope sbe does like to send ; for Dr. Physick says she always asks after me , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased if she hears that I have been so . I suppose the Doctor will think it is too late* to take me down to-night . Katy , do n't you want to go and see the wagon , and tell me about it , and pour the strawberries into a great dish on the tea-table , and all of you have some , and bring up the flowers when you come back after tea ? " When I came back with the flowers , Fanny smiled rather pensively , and did not ask me about the chair . " Fanny , " said I , " the Doctor says you may go Out to-morrow forenoon , and stay as long as you like , if it is fair ; and the sun is going down as red as a Baldwin apple . The chair is contrived so , with sprinbs and the cushions , that you can lie down in it , as flat as you do on your sofa , when you are tired of sitting up . " " 0 Katy , " cried she , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak to bear anything , " I have been seeing how inconsiderate I was ! To think of letting you exert and strain yourself in that way ! " In came the Doctor , looking saucy . " Fanny wo n't go , I suppose ? I thought so . I said so to De Quincey his horse , as I drove him down the street at a creep , sawing his mouth to keep him from running away , till he foamed at it epileptically , while all the sick people were sending north , south , east , and west after all the other doctors . I hope you wo n't mention it , said I to the horse ; but Fanny is always getting up some kind of a row . But there is Katy now , - Katy is a meek person , and always does as she is bid . She has been cooped up too much , and bleached her own roses with teaching the Greenville misses to sickly o'er with the pale cast of thought . Katy needs gentle exercise . So does Deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , and ill of the dropsy . " I will send Katy out a-walking , with Deacon Lardner in Miss Dudley 's chair . " I laughed . Fanny smiled . The Doctor saw his advantage , and followed it up . " Julia , my dear , get my apothecary 's scales out of the office . Put an ounce weight into one , and Fanny into the other . Then put the ounce weight into the chair . If Katy can draw that , she can draw Fanny . This time , it was poor Fanny who had the laugh to herself . The next day , the Doctor carried her down stairs , as soon as she could bear it after her breakfast , and left her on a sofa , in the little parlor , to rest . About ten o'clock , he came back from his early rounds . I was dressed and waiting for him , with Fanny 's bonnet and shawl ready . I put them on her , while he drew out the chair from its safe stable in the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by easy stages we got her into " her coach . " I pulled , and he pushed it , " to give me a start . " How easy and light and strong it was ! How delighted were both she and I ! Fanny was too easily alarmed to enjoy driving much , even when she was well ; and she had not walked out for weeks . During that time , the slow , late spring had turned into midsummer ; and the mere change from a sick-room to the fresh , outer world is always so very great ! For me , it was the first going abroad since my return to Beverly . We went in the sun till my charge 's little snowdrop hands were warm , and then drew up under the shade of an elm , on a little airy knoll that com // manded a distant view of the sea , and was fanned by a soft air , which helped poor Fanny 's breathing . She now insisted on my resting myself ; and I turned the springs back and arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new handkerchief of my guardian 's from my pocket , and hemmed it , as I sat at her side on a stone , while she mused and dozed . When she awoke , I gave her her luncheon from a convenient little box in the chair , and drew her home by dinner-time . In this way we spent much of the month of July - shall I say it ? - agreeably . Nobody will believe it , who has not felt or seen the marvellous relief afforded by an entire change of scene and occupation to a person tried as I had been . If I had but " one idea , " that id'ea was now Fanny . Instinctively in part , and partly of set purpose , I postponed to her every ' other consideration and thought . It was delightful to me to be able , in my turn , to take her to one after another of the dear old haunts , in wood or on beach , where she had often led me , when a child , to play . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the care of Fanny wore upon me little . She was the most considerate of invalids . Besides , she was better , or at any rate I thought so , after she began to go out in Miss Dudley 's chair . Her appetite improved ; her nerves grew more firm ; and her cough was sometimes so quiet at night that her laudanum would stand on her little table in the morning , just as it was dropped for her the evening before . Not only were my spirits amended by the fresh air in which , by Dr. Physick 's strict orders , I lived with her through the twenty - four hours , but my health too . He had declared her illness to be " probably owing in great part to the foul atmosphere in which , " he found , " she slept " ; and now she added that , since she had known the comfort of fresh air at night , she should be very sorry ever to give it up . In windy weather she 569 had a large folding-screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Besides the chair , another thing came in our way which gave pleasure to both of us , though it was not very pleasantly ushered in , as its pioneer was a long visit from Fanny 's old " Sabbath schoolma'am , " Miss Mehitable Truman , who would come up stairs . Towards the close of this visit her errand came out . It was to inquire whether " Fanny would n't esteem it a privilege to knit one or two of her sets of toilet napkins for Miss Mehitable 's table at the Orphans ' Fair , jest by little and little , as she could gether up her failin ' strength . " Fanny could not promise the napkins , since , luckily for her , she was past speech from exhaustion , as I was with indignation ; and Miss Truman , hearing the Doctor 's boots creak below , showed the better part of valor , and departed . The next day , it rained . We were kept in-doors ; and Fanny could not be easy till I had looked up her cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ; for they made her side ache ; and when Dr. Physick paid his morning visit , he took them away . I knew she would be sorry to have nothing to give to that fair . It was one of the few rules of life which my mother had recommended us to follow , never from false shame either to give or to withhold . " If you are asked toA give , " she would say , " to any object , and are not satisfied that it is a good one , but give to it for fear that somebody will think you stingy , that is not being faithful stewards . But when you do meet with a worthy object , always* give , if you honestly can . Even if ' you have no more than a cent to give , then give a cent ; and do not care if the ' Pharisees see you . That is more than ' the poor widow in the Gospels gave " ; - how fond she always was of that story - " and you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said ? His objects would not have to go begging so long as they do now , if every one would follow her example . " Ka/karine Maine . // From pride often , and sometimes from indolence , I am afraid I had broken that rule ; but Fanny , I rather think , never had ; and now I would try to help her to keep it . My mother 's paint-box was on a shelf in our closet , with three sheets of her drawing-paper still in it . Painting flowers was one of her chief opiates to lull the cares of her careful life . I think a person can scarcely have too many such , provided they are kept in their proper place . I have often seen her , when sadly tired or tried , sit down , with a moisture that was more like rain than dew in her eyes , and paint it all away , till she seemed to be looking sunshine over her lifelike blossoms . Then she would pin them up against the wall , for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , afterwards , she would give them away to any one who had done her any favor . Her spirit was in that like Fanny 's , - she shrank so painfully from the weight of any obligation ! She wished to teach me to paint , when I was a child . I wished to learn ; and many of her directions were still fresh in my memory . But the inexperienced eye and uncertain hand of thirteen disheartened me . I thought I had no talent . My mother was not accustomed to force any task upon me in my play-hours . The undertaking was given up . But I suppose many persons , like me not precocious in the nursery or the school-room , but naturally fond , as I was passionately , of beautiful forms and colors , would be surprised , if they would try their baffled skill again in aftertimes , to find how much the years had been unwittingly preparing for them , in the way of facility and accuracy of outline and tint , while they supposed themselves to be exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious cerebration " has been at work . Scatter the seeds of any accomplishment in the mind of a little man or woman , and , even if you leave them quite untended , you may in some after summer or autumn find the fruit growing wild . Katharbze Morne . November , Accordingly , when , within the last twelvemonth , I had been called upon to teach the elements of drawing in my school , it astonished me to discover the ease with which I could either sketch or copy . And now it occurred to me that perhaps , if I would take enough time and pains , I could paint something worthy of a place on Miss Mehitable 's table . Fanny 's gladness at the plan , and interest in watching the work , in her own enforced inaction , were at once reward and stimulus . I succeeded , better than we either of us expected , in copying the frontispiece of a " picturebook , " as Dr. Physick called it , which he had brought up from his office to amuse her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , - an old fellowstudent , - from the other side of the world . Lovely ferns , flowers , shells , birds , butterflies , and insects , that surrounded him there , were treated further on separately , in rigid sequence ; but as if to make himself amends by a little play for so much work , he had not been able to resist the temptation of groupmb them all together on one glowing and fascinating page . I framed my copy as tastefully as I could , in a simple but harmonious tasse-i5artout , and sent it to Miss Mehitable , with Fann* " s love . Fanny 's gratitude was touching ; and as for me , I felt quite as if I had found a free ticket to an indefinitely long private picture-gallery . Fanny 's satisfaction was still more complete after the fair , when Miss Mehitable reported that the painting had brought in what we both thought quite a handsome sum . " It was a dreadful shame , " she added , " you had n't sent two of em ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takin ' a bite , my niece , Letishy , from Noo York , had another grand nibble for that one after t was purchased . Letishy said a kind o ' poor , pale-lookin ' , queer-lookin ' lady , who she never saw before , in an elegint camel's-hair , " - ( " Poor-lookin ' , in a camel's-hair shawl ! " was my inward ejaculation ; " do n't I wish , ma'am , I could catch you and Letishy'in my // composition class , once " ) - " she come up to the table an ' saw that , an ' seemed to feel quite taken aback to find she d lost her chance at it . Letishy showed her some elegint shell-vases with artificial roses ; but that would n't do . I told Letishy , " continued Miss Mehitable , " that she d ought to ha ' been smart an ' taken down the lady 's name ; an ' then I could ha ' got Kathryne to paint her another . But you mu't do it now , Kathryne , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' then , if she s anybody that belongs hereabouts , she ii be likely to snap at it , an ' the money can go right into the orphans ' fund all the same . " Much obliged , ' ' thought I , " for the hint as to the bookseller 's shop-window ; but I rather think that , if the money comes , the orphan 's fund that it ought to go right into'this time is Fanny 's . " For my orphan 's fund from my months of school-keeping , not ample when I first came back , was smaller now . Fanny 's illness was necessarily , in some respects , an expensive one . I believed , indeed , and do believe , that it was a gratification to Dr. Physick to lavish upon her , to the utmost of his ability , everything that could do her good , as freely as if she had been his own child or sister . But it could not be agreeable to her , while we had a brother , to be a burden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his profession , though rising , and still probably earning not very much more than his wife 's and his own daily bread from day to day , and owing us nothing but a debt of gratitude for another 's kindnesses , which another man in his place would probably have said that " he paid as he went . " In plain English , the tie between us arose simply from the fact that he boarded with my mother , when he was a poor and unformed medical student . He always said that she was the best friend he had in his solitary youth , and that no one could tell how different all his after-life might have been but for her . She was naturally generous ; yet she was a just woman ; and I know that , while we were unprovided for , she could not have given , as the world appraises giving , much to him . Still " she did what she could . " He paid her his board ; but she gave him a home . After she found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fireside of a winter evening ; and , though she would not deprive us of our chat with one another and with her , she taught us to speak in low tones , and never to him , when we saw him at his studies . When they were over , and he was tired and in want of some amusement , she afforded him one at once cheap , innocent , and inexhaustible , and sang to him as she still toiled on at her unresting needle , night after night , ballad after ballad , in her wild , sweet , rich voice . 1-fe was very fond of music , though , as he said , he " could only whistle for it . " It was the custom then among our neighbors to keep Saturday evening strictly as a part of " the Sabbath . " It was her half-holiday , however , for works of charity and mercy ; and she would often bid him bring her any failing articles of his scanty wardrobe then , and say that she would mend them for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally fine , and trained by regular and wellchosen Sunday reading ; and she had the tact to select for these occasions books that won the mind of the intellectual though uncultivated youth by their eloquence , until they won his heart by their holiness . Moreover , she had been gently bred , and could give good advice , in manners as well as morals , when it was asked for , and withhold it when it was not . The upshot of it all was ; that he loved her like a mother ; and now the sentiment was deepened by a shade of filial remorse , which I could never quite dispel , though , as often as he gave me any chance , I tried . The last year of my mother 's life was the first of his married life . His father-in-law hired , at the end of the town opposite to ours , a furnished house for him and his wife . My mother called upon // her by the Doctor 's particular invitation . The visit was sweetly received , and promptly returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had many other visits to pay , especially when she could catch her husband at leisure to help her . He was seldom at leisure at all , but , as he self-reproachfully said , " too busy to think except of his patients and his wife " ; and poor mamma , with all her real dignity , had caught something of the shy , retiring ways of a reduced gentlewoman , and was , besides , too literally straining every nerve to pay off the mortgage on her half-earned house , so that , if anything happened , she might " not leave her girls without a home . " Therefore he saw her seldom . After he heard she was ill , he was with her daily , and often three or four times a day ; and his wife came too , and made the nicest broths and gruels with her own hands , and hegged Fanny not to cry , and cried herself . He promised my mother that we should never want , of he could help it , and that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told him that , if she died , this promise would be the greatest earthly comfort to her in her death ; and he answered , " So it will to me ! " Then after she was gone , when the lease of his house was up , as no other tenant offered for ours , he hired it , furniture and all , and offered Fanny and me both a home in it for an indefinite time ; but our affairs were all unsettled . We knew the rent , as rents were then , would not pay our expenses and leave us anything , to put by for the future , which my mother had taught us always to think of . Therefore I thought I had better take care of myself as I was much the strongest , and perfectly able to do so . " And a very pretty business you made of it did n't you , miss ? " reflected and queried I , parenthetically , as I afterwards reviewed these circumstances in my own mind . The best we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he should join us in paying the interest on the mortgage till real estate should rise , - as everybody said it soon must , - and then the rise in rents should enable us to let the house on better terms , and thus , by degrees , clear it of all encumbrances , and have it quite for our own , to let , sell , or live in . The worst we had to fear was , that he would insist on forcing it at once into the market , at what would be a great loss to us , and leave us almost destitute . He was going to be married , and getting into business , and wanted beyond anything else a little ready money . He scarcely knew us even by sight . He had been a sprightly , pretty boy ; and my mother 's aunt 's husband , having no children of his own , offered to adopt him . Poor mamma 's heart was almost broken ; but I suppose George 's noise must have been very trying to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide for him . After she objected , I have always understood that my father appeared to take a morbid aversion to the child , and could scarcely bear him in his sight . So George seemed likely to be still more unhappy , and ruined beside , if she kept him at home . He was a little fellow then , not more than five years old ; but he cried for her so long that my great-uncle-inlaw was very careful how he let him have anything to do with her again , till he had forgotten her ; and little things taken so early must be expected to fall , sooner or later , more or less under the influence of those who have them in charge . Poor mamma died without making a regular will . It was not the custom at that time for women to be taught so much about business even as they are now . She thought , if she did make a will before she could pay off the debt on the house , she should have to make another afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deduct from the little she would have to leave us . After she found out that she was dangerously sick , she was very anxious to make her will , whenever she was in // her right mind ; but that went and came so , that the Doctor , and a lawyer whom he brought to see her , said that no disposition she might make could stand in court , if any effort were made to break it . All that could be done was to take down , as she was able to dictate it , an affectionate and touching letter to George . In this she begged him to remember how much greater his advantages , and his opportunities of making a living , were than ours , and besought him to do his best to keep and increase for us the pittance she had toiled so hard to earn , and to take nothing from it unless a time should come when he was as helpless as we . Two copies of this letter were made , signed , sealed , and witnessed . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fanny and myself , that he would come and let mamma see him once again , before she died , if , as we feared , she must die . We had asked him to come before . He answered our letter - not our mother 's - rather kindly , but very vaguely , putting off his visit , and saying , that he could not for a moment suffer himself to believe that she would not do perfectly well , if we did not alarm her about herself , nor worry her with business when she was not in a state for it . His reply was handed me before her , unluckily . She wished to hear it read , and seemed to lose heart and grow worse from that time . Thus then matters stood with us that July . The sale of our house was pending - over our kind host 's head too ! It was plain to me that George would not , and that Dr. Physick should not , bear the charge of Fanny 's maintenance . So far and so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , no further examination was made of her lungs . The Doctor 's report was often " Remarkably comfortable , " and never anything worse than , " Well , on the whole , taking one time with another , I do n't see but she s about as comfortable as she has been . " I was , of course , inexperienced . I was 573 afraid that , if she improved no faster , I should be obliged to leave her , when I went away to work for her again at the end of the summer vacation , still very feeble , a care to others , and pining for my care . That was my nearest and clearest fear . But what did Fanny think ? I hope , the truth ; and on one incident , in chief , I ground my hope . One beautiful day - the last one in July - she asked me if I should be willing to draw her to our mother 's grave . There could be but one answer ; though I had not seen the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than calmness , - with the solemn irradiation of countenance which had during her illness become her most characteristic expression . She desired me to help her from her chair . She lay at her length upon the turf , still and observant , as if calculating . Then she spoke . " Katy , dear , " said she , very tenderly and softly , as if she feared to give me pain , " I have been thinking sometimes lately , that , if anything should ever happen to either of us , the other might be glad to know what would be exactly the wishes of the one that was gone - about our graves . Suppose we choose them now , while we are here together . Here , by mamma , is where I should like to lie . See , I will lay two red clovers for the head , and a white one for the foot . And there , on her other side , is just such a place for you . Should you like it ? - and - shall you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and said it firmly . " And then , " added she , after a short , deliberating pause , during which she , with my assistance , raised herself to sit on the side of the chair with her feet still resting on the turf , " while we are upon the subject , - one thing more . If I should be the first to go , - nobody knows whose turn may come the first , - then I should like to have you do - just what would make you happiest ; but I do n't like mourning . I should n't wish to have it worn for me . My feelings about it have all changed since // we made it for mamma . It seemed as if we were only working at a great black wall , for our minds to have to break through , every time they yearned to go back into the past and sit with her . It was as if the things she chose for us , and loved to see us in , were part of her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able still to think of us in them , and know just how we looked . And it seemed so strange and unsympathizing in us , that , when we loved her so , we should go about all muffled up in darkness , because our God was clothing her in light ! " I answered , - rather slowly and tremulously this time , I fear , - that I had felt so too . " Then , Katy , " resumed she , pleadingly , as she leaned back in her usual attitude in the chair , and made a sign that I might draw her home , " we will not either of us wear it for the other , - without nor within either , will we - any more than we can help . Do n't you remember what dear mamma said once , when you had made two mistakes in your lessons at school , and lost a prize , and took it hard , and somebody was teasing you , with making very light of it , and telling you to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little offended , and said , you always chose not to be hoodwinked , but to look at things on all sides and in the face . Mamma smiled , and said , It is good and brave to look all trials in the face ; but among the sides , never forget the bright side , little Katy . ' If I had my life to live over again , I would try to mind her more in that . She always said , there lay my greatest fault . I hope and think God has forgiven me , because he makes it so easy for me to be cheerful now . " " Fanny , " said I , as we drew near the house , " things in this world are strangely jumbled . Here are you , with your character , to wit , that of a little saint , if you will have the goodness to overlook my saying so , and somebody else 's conscience . I have no doubt that , while you are reproaching yourself first for this , then for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said somebody else is sinning away merrily , somewhere among the antipodes or nearer , without so much as a single twinge . " Smilinb , she shook her head at me ; and that was all that passed . She was as cheerful as I tried to be . With regard to the other world , she seemed to have attained unto the perfect love that casteth out fear ; and I believe her only regret in leaving this lower one for it was that she could not take me with her . In fact , throughout her illness , her freedom from anxiety about its symptoms - not absolute , but still in strong contrast with her previous tendencies - appeared to her physician , as he acknowledged to me afterwards , even when he considered the frequent flattering illusions of the disease , a most discouraging indication as to the case . But to her it was an infl*-nite mercy ; and to me , to have such glimpses to remember of her already in possession of so much of that peace which remaineth unto the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , though at first a very gentle one to her , if not to me . She slept more , ate less , grew so thin that she could no more bear the motion of her little wagon , and begged that it might be returned , because it tired her so to think of it . Then word came that our house was advertised to be sold , unconditionally , at an early day . To move her in that state , - how dreadful it would be ! I did not mean to let her know anything about it until I must ; but Miss Mehitable , always less remarkable for tact than for good-will , blurted it out before her . Her brows contracted with a moment 's look of pain . " 0 Katy , " she whispered , " I am sorry ! That must make you very anxious , - and then she went to sleep . Evidently it did not make her very anxious , as I knew that it would have done as lately even as two or three months before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death // was approaching me also , as steadily , if not so nearly ; and , after her example , my thoughts took such a foretaste of that anodyne that , was I sat and gazed on her unconscious , placid face , all terrors left me , and I was strengthened to pray , and to determine to look to the morrow with only so much thought as should enable me to bring up all my resources of body and mind to meetitas I ought , and to leave the result , unquestioned , quite in God 's hand . The result was an entire relief to her last earthly care . The appointed day came . The matter took wind . None of our townspeople appeared , to hid against my guardian ; hut enough of them were on the spot " to see fair play , " or , in other words , to adyance for him whatever sum he might stand in need of ; and the house was knocked clown to him at a price even below its market value . He paid the mortgagee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my title and Fanny 's as it was , not to be settled till I came of age . These details would only have worried and wearied her ; but the auctioneer 's loud voice had hardly died away , or the gathered footsteps scattered from the door , when the Doctor came to her chamber , flushed with triumph , to tell us that " Nobody now could turn us out ; and everything was arranged for us to stay . " Fanny looked brightly up to him , and answered : " Now I shall scarcely know what more to pray for , but God 's reward for you . " And most of all I thank Him for that news , because her last day on this earth was such a happy one . The next morning , just at dawn , she waked me , saying , " 0 Katy , tell the Doctor I ca n't breathe ! " I sprang up , raised her on her pillows , and called him instantly . She stretched out her hand to him , and gasped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do anything to help me ? " He felt her pulse quickly , looking at her , and said , very tenderly , " Have some ether , Fanny . I will run and bring it . " Throwing wider open every window that he passed , he hurried down to the office and back with the ether . Eagerly , though with difficulty , she inhaled it ; and it relieved her . I sat and watched her , silent , with her hand in mine . Presently the door behind me opened softly , as if somebody was looking in . " My dear , " said the Doctor , turning his head , and speaking very earnestly , though in a low voice , " I wo id n't come here . You can do no good . " But presently his wife came in , in her dressing-gown , very pale , and sat by me and held the hand that was not holding Fanny 's . And next I knew they thought she would not wake ; and then the short breath stopped . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him for help ; but , looking at me , he burst into tears , as he had not when he looked at Fanny ; and I knew there was no breath more for her , nor any ether for me . I did not want to go to sleep , because I should have to wake again ; but his wife was sobbing aloud . I knew how dreadful such excitement was for her ; and so I had to do just as they wished me to , and let them lead me out and lock the door , and lay down on a bed and shut my eyes .
