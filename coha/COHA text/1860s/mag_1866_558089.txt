P. , Formerly Physician to the New York State Prison at Auburn . Auburn , N. Y. 1866 . HAVING attempted , in the January number of the North American Review , to sketch the improvement in Prison Discipline since 1850 , it now remains for us to consider what is the condition of the American prisons , in which we have a more direct interest than in those of France or Ireland . And if this subject seems a broad one , whether judged by the extent of America or the number of Reports named above , it should be remembered that mere extent of territory counts for little , provided the same system prevails throughout , while one need only glance at most of the documents named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world 's knowledge . It is by collecting a vast number of imperfect instances , that we must supply the lack of careful observation in this important field . Of late , however , the attention of an unwonted , though still a small , * number of close observers has been turned to the investigation of Crime and Punishment ; the result appearing in the later Reports of the New York and Philadelphia Societies , and now and then elsewhere . But it is still painfully true that our Prison Reports generally do not even communicate that dry kind of information which they are intended to convey , or else communicate it very defectively ; while some of the best of them are so disfigured with self-complacent praises of the establishment where they are written , and onesided statements of conflicting systems , as greatly to lessen their value . " This is , without doubt , the best prison in the world , " says one warden , speaking of his own penitentiary . The inspectors of a rival establishment say , with a little more apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single purpose of maintaining its character as the only penitentiary in which the separate system has been carefully tried . " If , as advertisements say , " this should meet the eye " of the prison officers at Dublin , Berlin , or London , of M. IDuop6tiaux , Dr. Wichern , or Sir Walter Crofton , we can imagine the smile which would be excited at the assurance of the Yankees , and for which there would be some cause . Every patriot , of course , believes his own country the best in the world ; but it is unfortunate when a board of directors or a warden believe their prison the best , - for then they will do little to improve what is already so superior . The truth is , that not one person in fifty of those who manage the American prisons has ever seen any three of the best European prisons , or even read a good description of them . Pentonville , Lusk , Bruchsal , Moabit , La IRoquette , are but names , if they are anything , to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crofton , and the rest , who have changed the whole aspect of the Prison Question within the last twenty years , are ' unknown to them . Nay , there are few of them who ever examined a dozen prisons outside of their own State , or who even know the present cOndition of the lower prisons within their own State . That such // persons should manage prisons well is not strange , for prison management is an art or a gift quite as much as a science ; but that they should profess to compare their own success with that of the thousands engaged in the same work all over the civilized world , and to boast themselves superior to all , is something to be astonished at . They must presume on a state of ignorance among their readers still more dense than their own ; and unconsciously they do this , - with some reason , too , for how few can contradict such assertions ! All , however , are not such . A few go to the other extreme , and denounce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as undiscriminating . iDr . Fosgate , in his curious pamphlet on the New York prisons , ( the title of which is cited above , ) stigmatizes the Auburn system in such terms as men use to blacken a false friend , or a religion which they have renounced . No words are too severe ; and yet Dr. Fosgate was , for a while , an officer of the Auburn prison . There are examples , too , of private citizens , accidentally brought to a knowledge of the management of prisons , who use similar plainness of speech in their criticism on the evils they discover . Of this class is Dr. Eliot of St. Louis , whose little tract , attacking the abominations of the city and county prisons of that great Western city , will stimulate inquiry and reformation wherever it is read . Intermediate between the self-satisfied and the censorious are the patient and disinterested investigators . The New York Prison Association has enlisted many men of this class . The Philadelphia Prison Society , like the Boston Prison Discipline Society , has inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done good service . The Board of Inspectors in Canada ( since 1859 ) and the Board of Charities in Massaciusetts ( since 1863 ) seem also to belong to the better class . The newly established Prison Commission of California , and the Department of Jurisprudence in the Social Science Association , have hardly had time to contribute to the literature of the subject ; but something valuable may be expected from both . There is every reason to believe that the Second Part of the Twenty-first ileport of the New York Prison Association , soon to be published , will give more information respecting the // prisons of the United States and Canada than any work which has appeared within the last quarter of a century . Committees of this Association , during the past and present year , have visited nearly all the larger American prisons , collected their statistics , and compared their results ; have investigated the important question of pardons , and examined in various localities the method of criminal administration . The record of these inquiries will appear in the volume just mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the well-known abilities of Dr. Wines and Professor Dwight , the chief editors , we have a right to expect a thoroughly good report . In anticipation of their statements , and with the light derived from the documents before us , we hope to give the reader some general notion of the American prisons . It has been too much the custom of writers to pay attention only to the higher prisons in which the more serious offences are punished , and to the jails in which persons lie while waiting trial . These two classes of prisons existed in the days of Howard , and were visited and made infamous by him ; in consequence of which great improvements in their management have since been made . But an entirely new class of prisons has been instituted since Howard 's day , - or , if existing then , has been prodigiously increased , and made the basis of the whole modern prison system , except in rural districts . We mean the Station-Houses , Watch-Houses , Jlfaisons de Police . Yliafticipale , or by whatever name may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all large towns are lodged for a night , or for a day or two , before the preliminary examination of their guilt or innocence is made . Prisons of this kind exist in all civilized countries , and almost everywhere they are in bad condition . The improvements set on foot by Howard have not done much for these prisons , which oftentimes are little regulated by law , and still less by the inspection of disinterested visitors . Let us call these ZJIiunicipal Prisons , and speak of them first of all . We have no list of them , - seldom any reports of them appear , - yet they are thrice as numerous and receive twice as many inmates as all the other prisons in the country . In his Report to the Belgian Parliament on the subject of // Prisons , in 1844 , M. IDucp6tiaux had occasion to notice this class of prisons , and what he then said of those in Belgium is still applicable to our own " By their nature they are withdrawn from the direct action of the general government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have by no means partaken of the improvements introdnced by the government into the prisons directly under its control . " * In many instances the local authorities in the United States have constructed good prisons of this kind , such as the newer station-houses in Boston and other cities ; but in too many places it is to be feared that the shocking description given by Dr. Eliot of the St. Louis " Calaboose " is true , with the necessary changes . There are times when the Boston " Tombs " hardly present a less revolting appearance , if we may trust those who have seen that prison crowded . In the pamphlet named above , Dr. Eliot says : " The St. Louis Calaboose is in the cellar of the large building now occupied by the Metropolitan Police , at the corner of Chestnut Street and an alley , in the most crowded part of the city , where the streets are narrowest and ventilation the worst . The building was erected for a livery-stable and carriage-house , and the basement or cellar was fitted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or tea steps , so that the floor is six feet below the level of the street . It is paved with small , rough blocks of stone , carelessly put together , and impossible to keep clean , laid in such a manner as to make two open drains or gutters by which the waste water from hydrants is carried the whole length of the cellar . One of these gutters passes through the range of cells , so that the floor is always damp and frequently quite wet . They were arranged for the convenience of the stable , for drainage of the stalls , but are now exactly where they ought not to be . The cellar is bounded on the north by Chestnut Street , on which there is no opening except the cellar door ; east by a narrow , dirty alley ; south by a livery-stable , from which the waste water continually trickles through the stone wall , and sometimes runs the whole length of the apartment , and is absorbed under a coal-pile which is kept at the extreme north end ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , the foul water * M ! mobe Zi i'Appui du Projet de Loi cur les Prisms .

The passage quoted may he found on page 6. // from which keeps the wall , for a distance of twenty or thirty feet , filthy and wet . It is forty feet wide by one hundred and fifty deep , and lighted by grated windows opening upon the alley , to the east . When occupied by horses , the stalls were arranged so that their heads were near the windows , and barely enough light and air for the health of the animals was thus secured . There was also at that time , I believe , some circulation of air by openings at the south and east . But when it came to be used for human beings , who are well known to be hardier than horses , convenience of arrangement and security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space as possible between the windows and the cells , which are built of rough boards , at a distance of twenty feet from the windows , in such a manner as to admit of no ventilation at all . They are constructed in front with horizontal wooden slats , protected by upright iron bars , with grated doors , and the only entrance for the borrowed air and light is through this crossbarred partition , darkened by the anxious faces of the prisoners within , who keep as near it as possible for breath . They are not cells , but cages , like those for wild beasts ; but no wild beast could be kept alive in such a place . There is a sort of ventilation , too , for the side and back partitions are rudely made , and through the partitions opposite the door comes a close , earthy smell from the back part of the cellar , now unoccupied and totally dark except for a gas-light always burning , and fitted up with rude bunks for the use of houseless wretches ' some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed . " Each one of the cages ( iu the range of six ) is twelve feet square and nine feet high , paved with stone , as I have mentioned , a surface drain running through it , and with a rough bench fifteen inches wide extending round three sides of the apartment . That is the whole furniture , except a rough , open cesspool arrangement in the corner . They seldom put more than TWELVE human beings at a time in one cage , although pressure of business sometimes causes an excess . With that number , at night , six can sleep on the benches , which are probably secured by the strongest ; the rest must take their chances on the stone floor ; which allows to each of the ' prisoners one foot by twelve , equivalent to two feet by six , - almost enough to bury them in . That is to say , when the whole floor can be used ; but the space is much diminished when the surface drain is full of water , as it often is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in consequence of a stoppage in the outlet , that not more than a fourth of the floor in one of the cages was tolerably dry ; yet ten prisoners , all of them grown men , had passed the night there . I saw them come out of it in the morning , pale , bruised , haggard , with an exasperated look in their faces ; and // when I went into the room immediately after , enormous rats were run fling familiarly about , the floor was wet and filthy , the smell was foul , and I wondered how it had been possible to breathe there . One of the ten was left asleep on the bench , with the rats to run over him . " At present there is no provision for beds , blankets , or covering of any kind , and I doubt if such supply is a part of ' the system . The suffering through these chilly nights , sitting or lying on the damp stone floor , must go as a part of the punishment . Of course no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there only three days at the longest , and generally not more than twenty-four hours ; and are put in promiscuously , black and white , old and young , with a primary view to convenient stowage . The women , however , have their own cages , or are permitted the freedom of the hail , in front of the cells . " We quote this detailed account , with all its sickcning particulars , because so little is known to the public of this class of prisons . They are seldom entered by any save prisoners , officers of police , criminal lawyers , or other persons whose business leads them there . But they are powerful auxiliaries in the work of corrupting the young , and making shameless the older culprits , while they often receive and contaminate persons guilty of no offence , and charged with none . They are the holes where petty official fraud and abuse hide and coquette with monstrous vice ; they are the workshops of detectives , where felony is compounded and impunity is manufactured to order . The Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels , but Dr. Eliot has given several hints for his journey . We have spoken of these municipal prisons as being thrice as numerous , and containing twice as many persons in a year , as all other prisons put together . But it must be understood that the period of confinement for each person arrested is very short , ranging from half an hour to a week , but usually less than a day . Hither are brought all persons arrested at night in cities and villages , and a great many of those arrested by day . From one half to five sixths of these persons are discharged without conviction , and a great number without trial ; the rest are taken from court to the jail , the workhouse , or the house of correction , according to the magnitude of their // offence or the convenience of the parties . If the offence is gross , or the trial can be delayed , they are sent to jail to await trial ; otherwise they are sentenced to some convict prison , or , if fined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we come to the second grade of prisons , - those of the counties . These are not only second in the logical order , but , in many cases , in order of time , - the municipal prisons , in some form or other , being often older than tbe county prisons . Within the last forty years in the United States the term " jail , " which once included all these prisons , has got a more restricted sense . In Massachusetts and in some of the other States , county prisons are now divided into two distinct classes , jails , and houses of correction , or penitentiaries . The first is used to signify the place of confinement for persons waiting trial or sentence , while the house of correction or penitentiary receives only sentenced persons , and exacts labor from all its prisoners . In the jails of Massachusetts labor is optional except for sentenced persons , and in few or none of them is any considerable amount of work performed . But the South Boston House of Correction , the Albany Penitentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a lower grade of penitentiary , all exact labor as rigidly as the State prisons at Charlestown or Auburn . This class of county convict prisons is gradually extending into all the States . Michigan has one or more , Illinois is about to have one at Chicago , and in New Hampshire , Vermont , Connecticut , and other States of small area , the establishment of such prisons is proposed . It is probable , however , that there and in Massachusetts , and perhaps finally in all the States , they will take the form of district prisons , receiving the convicts of several counties in one establishment . Such is now the actual character of most of the New York county penitentiaries ; that at Albany receiving convicts from eight counties , and these at Rochester and Buffalo from a still larger area . By an act passed by the Massachusetts Legislature in May of the present year , convicts sentenced in one county are allowed to be transferred to the house of correction in another county for imprisonment ; thus opening the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all such establishments in all the States , so far as we know , are managed by the connty authorities , with more or less supervision by the State government . In Massachusetts , for many years , the county prisons have been required to report their condition annually to the Legislature ; and since 1863 they have been placed under the inspection of the Board of Charities . In New York the Prison Asso. ciation , which is a semi-official body , has the right of inspecting jails and county penitentiaries , and has exercised it faithfnlly . In Pennsylvania there seems to be no central board to inspect the county prisons ; but that work has been recently undertaken by the Philadelphia " Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons , " and , so far as it has gone , seems to have been well performed . Of the method of inspection in other States , we have little knowledge . In Delaware , there being no State prison , the convicts are all sentenced to the county jails ; in Rhode Island the State prisou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and controlled by one warden ; while the other jails in the State have but few inmates . The necessity for some central inspection of the county prisons in each State requires little demonsti*ation . To such as are familiar with the condition of these establishments in most of the States , the wonder has been that 110 such uniform method of examination and report has been adopted here as that maintained in Great Britain , Ireland , and France . It is almost incredible what abuses have crept in , or have always existed , by ignorance and neglect , throughout the county prisons of New York and Pennsylvania . In several of them there is no sufficient separation of the sexes , and in very few any separation of old and young offenders . Of iuore than sixty jails in New York , only two are provided with baths for washing the whole person ; and there are but few where the ventilation is even tolerable . Communication by talking is hardly restricted at all in most of the jails in tile United States . In Massachusetts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent this , it still prevails in a majority of the county jails . Indeed , we find in Pennsylvania the curious anomaly of a prison discipline // for heinous offenders which requires their entire isolation , while the lower prisons from which these inmates of the penitentiary come up are managed , with a few exceptions , in the old , higgledy-piggledy fashion which made the ancient Walnut Street prison of Philadelphia so detestable . Separate confinement is not a Pennsylvania but a Philadelphia system ; and even in the Moyamensing prison of Philadelphia we are coolly told by the " Journal of Prison Discipline " that " the convicts have separate cells ; and it would be better if the untried and the vagrants could be insured the same advantage ; but this is at present impossible . " ( p. 23 . ) In Massacliusetts , although the law is stringent forbidding the confinement of two persons in the same cell , and the conversation of prisoners at all times , yet in half the jails it is openly and notoriously violated , especially when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . In several of the jails no attempt is made to separate the tried and the untried prisoners , who may be seen sitting by the stove in the corridors in front of their cells chatting together as familiarly as the company in a tavern barroom . In some of the county prisons , however , the rule of silence is very carefully observed . Carelessness in keeping the records of these prisons is another general and conspicuous fault . In Massachusetts this has been partially corrected by the law of 1864 , requiring more exact returns . A similar law , borrowed in part from the Massachusetts statute-book , was passed in New York at the last session of the Legislature , and will be put in force under the efficient oversight of General Barlow , the Secretary of State . In Pennsylvania and most of the other States such legislation is still lacking , and consequently we have few statistics of any value from the countiy prisons of most of the States . It is a simple matter to require from each jailer periodical schedules of names and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these returns , compiled by the Secretary of State and published annually , would much increase our statistical knowledge of crime and its relations . So far as we can learn , except in a few of the counties of Pennsylvania , the discipline in all the county prisons , both of // the United States and Canada , is that known as the Auburn System . But as some wit said of the Russian constitution , " that it was a despotism limited by assassination , " so we might say in this case , it is the Auburn System limited by crowding and free communication . We doubt not it resembles quite as much the old Congregate System , against which Louis Dwight and his associates fought so stoutly until they began to think the Separate System of Philadelphia a worse subject . Of course there are exceptions , such as the Detroit House of Correction , the Albany Penitentiary , and others , including some in Massachusetts ; but the rule is to crowd prisoners during court-time , and not to watch them too closely at other seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of allowing the sheriff a fixed sum for the board of his prisoners is kept up , and the jailer is constantly tempted to stint their food in order to enrich himself or his employer . The good of all parties requires that jailers shall receive fixed salaries , and be debarred from increasing their income by fees and perquisites . In Massachusetts this is the law , but not in New York , nor , we believe , in a majority of the States of the Union . As for the number of county prisons in the United States and British America , that may be stated as about the same as the number of organized counties ; although in the West many of the jails are of the rudest kind . In Massachusetts and other thickly settled regions , there are many more prisons than counties . We have fourteen counties and twenty-three county prisons , including the Boston Houses of Industry and Correction . If , then , we suppose there are two thousand prisons in the whole country and the British Provinces of the class of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far out of the way . Among these there are many well-built , wellkept , and on the whole useful establishments ; but the majority probably deserve , in a greater or less degree , the censure bestowed by Dr. Eliot on the County Jail of St. Louis . Again we must quote his terse and accurate description - " It is built of solid stone , with thick walls , three stories high , and contains thirty-six cells , eighteen on each side of a narrow well ' or open hall , just wide enough to admit of passage-way and stairs , the doors of the cells being opposite each other so that the prisoners can // see through the gratings and hear each other talk . The cells are eight fret square and ten feet high , furnished with an iron bedstead and one stool or chair . in each of these cells the average number of prisoners is four , seldom less than three , and sometimes five or even six . The light is admitted by a narrow window , or slit in the wall , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ventilation , if you can call it such , is through this window and the grated door opening upon the close , unventilated hall . At night , if there are four inmates , three may possibly manage to sleep on the bed ; the remaining one must content himself on the floor . No bed covering has yet been provided , and in these chilly autumn nights the men complain bitterly of the cold . No provision is made for a change of garments or for cleanliness , and those who have no friends outside to bring them clothing must wash their own clothes in a bucket or basin , and dry them in the cell . I saw one of them , in a cell where four were confined , more than half stripped while he was thus employed . INo arrangement is made for waste water , and everything for the prisoners ' use and relief must he carried in and out by hand . Once a day the slop-bucket is removed , rio oftener , whatever sickness may prevail ; the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclean cloth . Their meals are given to them twice a day , in tin pans , to be eaten in the cells , the men sitting on the bed or on the floor . In short , the whole monotonous routine of their dreary lives , day and night , in sickness and health , in summer and winter , sometimes for twelve consecutive months , is passed in that little stone box , containing six hundred and forty cubic feet of air . " Four apartments in the jail are used for women . They are generally well filled , but I examined only one , in which I found three women and a child . One of them was a miserable outcast , found guilty of some nameless heinous offence . One was a young woman charged with petty theft . The third was under trial for poisoning her husband . She had had no change of garments for six weeks ! The child was running about the cell unconscious of its degradation , but beginning to look dull and stupid . The two bunks were supplied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed covering of any kind " Under such circumstances nothing but the most scrupulous care on the part of the officials could prevent the jail from becoming a pesthouse , and they deserve praise for the degree of cleanliness enforced and the consequent average of health enjoyed . The food also is well cooked and abundant , and in general the comfort of the prisoners is regarded , so far as opportunity is given . It is not of the officers that complaint is to be made , but of the abominable , heathenish system under which they arc compelled to work . Think of the moral influ // ence upon the prisoners in those crowded rooms ! No classification of either age or crimes is possible . The hardened sinner and the beginner in crime are placed together to give and receive instruction . In one cell Isaw four young men , the oldest just tu'enty-one years of age , one of whom was under charge of murder , two for grand larceny , and one , a boy of seventeen years , accused of some petty offence , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind is possible , and it must be almost impracticable to read . Religious or moral influence is out of the question , and to preach the Gospel of Christ there , in that dismal place , to those kennelled human beings , seems like a mockery before high Heaven . I have tried it more than once , and felt it to be so , and have no doubt the prisoners felt the same . " We are glad to learn from Dr. Eliot , that since the publication of his pamphlet , nearly a year ago , steps have been taken to improve the condition of the jail , while the " Calaboose " has been entirely changed for the better . Still these words of his , written after a heart-felt experience of this miserable state of things , shall stand to depict like evils in other places , and aid to remove those also . What is needed to make the county prisons everywhere what they should be is , first , a vigilant inspection , not by the local , but by the State authorities ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoners among the community where the prison stands . Very forcibly does Dr. Eliot say , towards the end of his pamphlet - " Who is to blame ? Upon whom does the fearful responsibility rest ? It is easy to say , Upon the City Council and the County Judges , ' and that they should be indicted for maintaining so great a nuisance . But in fact they are only the representatives of the community , and it would be unjust to throw the censure exclusively upon them . The evil has been in existence for half a generation , with little or no change , and every succeeding set of officers and every political party that has governed the city and county for the last fifteen years may take its share of the blame . It is the public which is really at fault . Public indifference and neglect are the root of the difficulty . Every obstacle in the way of immediate improvement would disappear , if the publc will were so . Enlightened public opinion alone can make enlightened and active officers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what common humanity demands . Repeated efforts have been made by city and county officers for the establishment // of an improved system , but they have uniformly failed , and will continue to fail until the public conscience is more thoroughly aroused to the enormity of the sin . " To arouse the public conscience is indeed the duty of all who know the facts about our prisons ; and there are certain considerations very apt to do so at the present time , of which we shall speak in course of what we have to say concerning State prisons . It is the State prisons of the United States which have for so many years claimed the attention of the world . Previous to 1825 the introduction of the Silent System at Auburn began to attract notice , so skilfully was it conducted and with such obvious results . Of the origin of this system at Auburn , Dr. Fosgate gives an account somewhat different from those generally received - " In the early history of the Aubura prison , when the convicts were employed on its own construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and at night huddled promiscuously in apartments , each accommodating fifteen or more individuals , without method or any settled plan of discipline , John D. Cray , an Englishman by birth , a retired soldier of the British army , and a coppersmith by trade , assumed its police regulation . To this remarkable personage , endowed with wonderful physical endurance , - making little difference between day and night in prosecuting his arduous labors , - possessed of uncommon energy and decision of character , as portrayed in the result of his undertaking , - and who , though unaided except by the work of his own hands , possessed a fund of knowledge seldom equalled even by those on whom wealth and station had showered their favors , - belongs the fame , whether it be good or whether it be evil , of defining and executing a system of prison polity which has arrested the attention of civilized man . " - Crime and Punishment , pp. 15 , 16 . This was in 1821 - 22 . In succeeding years the equal abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance of the system at Auburn ; while at Wethersfield , in 1827 , Amos Pilsbury , then a young man , aided by the experience of his father , the Warden of the New Hampshire prison , began to modify the brutal severity of Cray and Lynds by a discipline equally strict , but resting upon personal infinenee rather than personal violence . In 1828 the Massachn // setts State prison wa* opened under the Auburn System . In 1829 the Eastern Penitentiary of Pennsylvania was opened under the Separate System . Three years earlier the Western Penitentiary near Pittsburg had begun to receive prisoners ; but as a model of the Separate System its claims have never been so good as those of the Philadelphia prison , which for many years has regarded itself as the rival par excellence of the Massachusetts prison , whose managers seem to have accepted the challenge . Before 1838 the Auburn System had been put in practice , with more or less strictness , in the State prisons of New ilamp-. shire , Vermont , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland ; since then it has been adopted in Maine , IRhode Island , New Jersey , Michigan , Indiana , Iowa , Wisconsin , Missouri , Kansas , Minnesota , California , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , Kentucky , and probably in all the other Southern States which have given up the old Congregate System . For a time , the Separate System was tried in Rhode Island and New Jersey , but has long been abandoned there . To investigate the claims of the conflicting systems and the general results of prison discipline in America , Beaumont and Tocquevilie , Demetz and Blouct , Crawford and Julius , visited the country from 1831 to 1838 , on behalf of the French , the English , and the Prussian governments . But it was the State prisons , almost exclusively , which they visited , and whatever comments they made related for the most part to these . Their reports , and the subsequent discussion in this country and in Europe , were noticed at the time in these pages , and need not here be considered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these discussions dealt with our State prisons , and only incidentally with either of the two classes of which we have already treated .

I Approximate . Before the war . I The population of these twenty-one States in 1860 was nearly 23,000,000 , and is now upwards of 25,000,000 . In Canada , of which the population in 1860 was 2,501,888 , there is one State prison , located at Kingston , where the average number for 1864 was 776 , the number at latest date 729 , and the deficit of earnings about $ 60,000 . The number of county gaols reported is 54 , wherein the whole number of commitments for 1864 was 13,016 , and the greatest number of prisoners at any one time 1,638 ; the average number being probably about 1,400 . The Clinton prison , in New York , is located in the town of Dannemora , in Clinton County , hut is always called by the name of the county . The Kentucky Penitentiary was rebuilt about 1845 . With regard to the earnings of the prisons of Illinois and Kentucky an explanation is necessary . In these two States the odious practice prevails of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed and clothe them , and provide for their sanitary and spiritual wants without expense to the State , provided he can have the profits of their labor . In this way these prisons are self-supporting , and the lessee grows rich , but it is at the cost of a terrible slavery to the convicts . From Kansas , where the prison is building , and Virginia , where the war has unsettled everything , we have no return of earnings . The footing of the deficit column shows the excess of deficit over income in all the prisons taken together ; deduction being made of the excess of earnings in four States . 398 // Here are twenty-five prisons in twenty-one States ; yet the average number in all is less than five times as many as in the twenty-three county prisons of Massachusetts ( 1370 ) , while the whole number at the latest dates is also less than five times as many as the number ( 1666 ) remaining in those twenty-three prisons on the 1st of April , 1866 . We may reasonably conclude , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aggregate in these States , that in these 1200 county prisons there are at least four times as many prisoners as in these State prisons ; while in the municipal prisons there are at least ten times as many . If this estimate is correct , then the number in our State prisons is not more than one fifteenth of the whole number of prisoners at any given time in the United States . That this estimate is not too small will appear further from the following facts . In the year 1865 the whole number in State prisons in New York was 2909 , while the number of arrests in the city of New York alone was 39,616 , or nearly fourteen times as many . At the same time there were in confinement in the Albany Penitentiary alone ( a county prison ) 1247 persons , or more than two fifths as many as in all the State prisons . The number confined in the Philadelphia county prison in 1865 was 17,163 ; in the Eastern Penitentiary during the same time , 582 , or a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number for the year was considerably larger at the county prison than at the penitentiary . We must believe , then , that when we read the Reports of our State prisons , we are learning the numbers and condition of less than a tithe of all the prisoners in the country . And yet what these Reports indicate will serve as a guide to the condition of the great mass of whom we hear little or nothing . We may be sure , for one thing , that the nine tenths or fourteen fifteenths are no better treated , no more carefully instructed , no more thoroughly disciplined , than the remaining fraction . These last are , in large establishments , frequently visited , and under the eye of the public . Whatever pride we take in our prison system is derived from an inspection of these ; whatever private philanthropy does is mainly for the benefit of their inmates . And what is to be said of our State prisons ? // In the first place , we must notice their great diversity , in the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , the cost of support , etc . No two prisons are alike , even iu the same State . The Pittsburg Penitentiary differs from that at Philadelphia almost as much as from the Rhode Island prison . The Auburn prison is unlike that at Sing Sing , and both differ greatly from that at Dannemora . The Ohio Penitentiary has contained upwards of a thousand convicts ; so has the Sing Sing prison ; while the Minnesota prison can not get its average number up to twenty-five . Some receive female convicts and boys , like the Vermont prison ; some receive boys , and not women , like the Massachusetts prison ; some receive neither females nor boys , like the Auburn pris on . Some elect their warden every six months , as in Pennsylvania , and yet retain the same officer for twenty years ; some have the warden appointed during good behavior , and dismiss him at the end of the first or second year , as in New York . A few are self-supporting , more are always expecting to become so , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the supervising board are called Inspectors , sometimes Directors , sometimes Commissioners ; sometimes - as in Kentucky - the Legislature exercise the supervision . In some there are no means for bathing the convicts ; in some the meals are eaten in common , while the cells are separate ; some give instruction in reading and writing , but most do not ; some do not receive the insane , some keep them in a distinct prison , others in cells of the ordinary kind. * In some the party-colored convict dress has been given up , but in most it is still worn ; in some the only punishment allowed by law is solitary imprisonment , in others flogging , yoking , showering , and , other tortures are practised . And so we might go on indefinitely , pointing out the diversities . But in some things there is uniformity ; and what impresses most strongly the observant visitor is the high average of good sense and humanity among the officers . However they may * Some painful facts concerning the condition of the insane convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the newspapers . But the same things arc occurring elsewhere . // be appointed , with few exceptions they are men who would not knowingly lend themselves to any of those schemes of fraud and cruelty which prison life is wont to generate ; while their intelligence is such that they do not fall ignorantly into misconduct . They come to their duties with the minimum of special qualification , oftentimes , - without having spent a day in a prison , and even without a knowledge of the criminal law , - and , of course , they are sometimes found incompetent . But it often happens that one of these untrained officers , who has been a private soldier perhaps , or a master mechanic , in a few months becomes one of the best of wardens or turnkeys . He has little to unlearn , he is not poisoned by a system or paralyzed by the spirit of routine ; while he has acquired that equity of mind , that respect for his fellow-men , and that practical philanthropy which are the best fruits of our social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such persons and their upright intentions , the difficulties of the position rapidly vanish , and a year or two places them among the first in their class . We have two or three such examples in mind among the wardens of the State prisons that we have visited . In this particular , our prisons are probably superior to those of Europe , to many of which they are in some respects inferior . None of our prison buildings can compare with some of those abroad ; we have no code of prison rules so carefully prepared and so judiciously administered as those established in Ireland by Sir Walter Crofton , who is now laboring in the same way for England ; nor have we anything like the uniform inspection and the elaborate statistical reports of several of the European countries . But , on the other hand , it is doubtful if such horrors as those perpetrated in the Birmingham gaol , on which Charles IReade has founded the most thrilling portion of one of his novels , could exist in any American prison . It is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been practised , but it must be remembered that in New York the officers of prisons are selected for political reasons , and are frequently quite unfit for any position there except that of convict . The almost universal prevalence of the contract system of // labor is another point of agreement in American prisons . There is scarcely a State prison in the United States where this mode of employing the labor of the convicts is not now in vogue to some extent , and there is none , we believe , in which it has not recently been used . By this system , the convicts do not work upon material purchased by the State , nor are the finished products of labor sold for the benefit of the prison . Between the State and the laboring convict a third party steps in , - the contractor . He hires the prisoners at so much a day , furnishes instructors and foremen , sometimes machinery and steam power , and carries on the business of a manufactory inside the prison yard . Sometimes one contractor employs all the available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , engaged in various manufactures . In the Vermont prison all the men " on contract , " as it is termed , are making scythe-snaths ; in the New Hampshire prison they are making furniture ; but in the Charlestown prison they are engaged in half a dozen different employments under four or five contracts . Iron-founding , the manufacture of iron lamps , clocks , &amp;c. , brush-making , whip-making , chair and cabinetmaking , are all carried on there , by men who outside the prison would be earning from . $ 2 to $10 a day . The highest price paid by any contractor is $1 . Another pays 88 cents a day , and lays aside $ 2 a week as a bonus to the family of each man , which together amount to $ 1.16 a day . Probably this is the largest price paid by any prison contractor in the United States , - at least , we have learned of none so high . Much more commoim are such rates as these 20 to 81 cents ( New Jersey ) ; 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 cets ( Sing Sing ) ; 28 to 45 cents ( Michigan ) ; 40 cents ( Southern Indiana ) ; 40* cents ( Iowa ) ; 88 cents ( Minnesota ) ; 85 cents ( Vermont ) ; 40 cents ( New Hampshire ) . With such prices , it is 110 wonder that the prisons are not self-supporting ; and , by a reference to the preceding table , it will be seen that none of the above-named prisons are so , except that of New Hampshire . In this prison , however , it is not the contract labor , but the labor of a part of the convicts , directly for time State , which turns the balance in favor of the prison . And nothing can better show the absurdity of the contract system as a finan // cial measure for the good of the State , than the figures given in the table . But there is a much stronger argument against admitting contractors into the prisons . Their interest is not to secure the reformation of the convicts , or the discipline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the men . Accordingly , they are anxious to keep as many as possible off the sick list , and to reduce to a minimum the hours spent by the convict in study and reading . These and other evils incident to the system are set forth by Dr. Fosgate , perhaps in colors too glaring , but so as to convey a wholesome truth . " The contracts are held , generally , by individuals possessed of wealth and endowed with talents ; influential in society , and oftener than otherwise powerful in party politics . In fact , they are among the strongest members of the community . Now , it would be preposterous to suppose that individuals , whose salaries barely sujJlce for their support , and who depend for that support upon the precarious tenure of office , could meet , single-handed , those contractors whose familiarity with the institution gives them an advantage over both ojJicers and convicts absolutely incalculable . The truth is , that the interests of the contractor and the interests of the State are continually at variance . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one , to the total disregard of the other ; and that the momentous interests of society involved in the good management of criminals were entirely ignored . It is through this branch of polity that the corruptibility of prison inspectors is so readily attained , and which , as by contagion , reaches every grade , until a full development is found in its incarcerated population . " The contract plan of support is not only detrimental to the State , but unjust to the convict , as it regards each one whose labor is contracted for an able-bodied man , and consequently a corresponding amount of labor is required of him . The modifying influences of incarceration are disregarded , and , through bribes from the contractor , or punishment by the keeper , he is driven on until he falls under the care of the physician , again to run , on his restoration to health , the usual round of injustice . " The discipline is also seriously impaired by the common practice of bribing convicts to increased exertion . Shut up from the pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lever in the hands of the unscrupulous . The craving for fruit , confectionery , spirits , and whatever may he the desire of taste or fancy , are the means whereby // many a convict is driven to labor with a zeal almost unaccountable . To gratify these cravings is to overstep the rules of order . Yet it is the secret work of daily practice , and when discovered by the officer on duty , it is at his peril that he reports the *ffender . Experience , gained by precept and example , has taught him that the money power of the contractor is more efficient , in prison management , than the political influence of the officials in whose keeping they are but apparently placed . " Upon a close investigation , it would be found that the financial result of this system is as unprofitable to the State as its moral effects are pernicious to the officers and convicts . " - Crime and Punishment* pp. 30-32 . These passages all deserve attention , but those which we have put in italics contain a truth which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long employed labor will fully sustain . The New York Prison Association , to which we have already alluded , has undertaken , by authority of an order of the last Legislature , to examine the prisons of that State , and to receive testimony from persons not connected with the prison administration , as well as from the officers , in regard to the contract system , among other things . These investigations began on the 10th of August last , in the city of New York , and have been continued at the several State prisons and penitentiaries . The evidence thus obtained will probably have weight in other States , and we hope will lead to the modification or abandonment of contracts in our prisons . The two conflicting modes of prison discipline - Silent and Separate , or Auburn and Pennsylvania - are still on trial in the United States . Both have been seriously modified within forty years , and , in some respects , have shown a tendency to approach each other . The Irish system has also offered itself as a compromise between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we can not perceive that the partisan spirit of the advocates of either system has growii milder . The Report of the Charlestown prison declares that the " Massachusetts system " comprises " all that is desirable , valuable , or elevating to be found in any of the others , discarding the many evils connected therewith . " * // The Report of the Eastern Penitentiary of Pennsylvania for 1866 takes up the antiphony in a similar strain - " In vain is it that experiments are tried by plans for Intermediate Prisons , ' Tickets-of-Leave , ' Police Supervisions , ' Self-shortening Sentences , ' and kindred projects , which involve association of the convicts during punishment . They will all fail . They are in open hostility to the philosophy of penal jurisprudence , and the logic of cause and consequence . There can be no exception to either which can be relied upon as controlling the princ*ples which underlie both . " - p. 25 . " If the facts do n't agree with my theory , " said Sir Joseph Banks , " so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have in regard to the success of " self-shortening sentences , " and the other parts of the Irish system , the passage quoted has a singular sound . That the officers of the Philadelphia prison do really believe in and understand the principle of their system is clear , however , and we honor them for it , while wishing their zeal was tempered with a greater knowledge of the facts . But what shall we say of the Warden of the Pittsburg Penitentiary , who , with all the logical and penological appliances of the Pennsylvania system at his hand , finds the gre at agent in prison discipline to be - Tobacco ! We quote from his last Report : - " There is no punishment so severe to him as depriving the convict of tobacco . He will resort to every species of cunning to obtain it , and , if unsuccessful , will become sullen and obstinate , and refuse to work . The giving or withholding it according to conduct , would be one of the most effectual means of controlling the turbulent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the law with reference to this matter so modified , that it may be left discretionary with the officers of the prison to administer tobacco in limited quantities , as a reward for good behavior. " - p. 5 . Our own impression is , that tobacco would be found less serviceable than a good plan of religious and secular instruction , carried out by an earnest and gifted chaplain , such as we find described in the Report of the Albany Penitentiary for 1865 : - " I know well that a merely official discharge of chaplain services in our convict institutions will do but little good , and that they require men of sound judgment , extended knowledge , ready and correct obser // vation , and fervent piety . After spending several years in pastoral labor , and that in a town adjoining Boston , I am compelled to say that these services demand all the talent required for an ordinary pastorate ; and that many a good man that might honorably fill the latter would find himself incompetent to the requisitions of the former . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , of ripened experience , of catholic dispositions and sentiments , who are animated by the love of God , and who will cheerfully devote their powers of body and mind to the work ; and let their whole time be engaged and adequately remunerated , and , other things being equal , success will be realized beyond what has yet been known , and the problem , How shall we reform our convicts ? will be welinigh solved . " - p. 32 . In the Ohio Penitentiary , it is a part of the chaplain 's duty to look after the education of the convicts . In his last Report he says - " There is also in this department the prison school , devoted to secular instruction in the various branches prescribed by law . The whole number attending the school during the year was seventy-seven . Average daily attendance , seventeen . Of these 51 were white , 26 were colored .

The advantages of the school can not be overrated , and it is to be regretted that the incentives to overwork are such as to induce many to forego these advantages , that they may earn something for themselves and their families . " In the department of secular instruction the results have been highly gratifying . Of the seventy-seven who have attended the school during the year , all but five have acquired a knowledge of reading , and some already show a remarkable proficiency in the art of writing ; while others discover a taste and talent for arithmetic , the study of which is so well calculated to beguile the solitary hours of prison life of their sad loneliness . " - Ohio Pc . . Rep. , 1865 , p. 18 . The statements here made may serve as a slight answer to those who donbt whether a school can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other State prisons the same attention is paid to secular instruction , but nowhere in this country are such brilliant results achieved as those which Mr. Organ can show in his Dublin prisons . The increasing necessity of this sort of instruction appears from the increasing number of prisoners who can not read and write . This increase seems to be coincident , ( though far less marked , ) with the increase in army and navy convicts . In Massachusetts , in New Hampshire and Vermont , and probably in all New England , two thirds of the commitments within the last twelve months have been of men who served by land or sea during the late civil war . In the Philadelphia Penitentiary , the Inspectors say , - " The number of prisoners received during the year who have served in the army , has been largely in proportion to the whole number . Since January 1 , 1866 , this class of prisoners has largely increased . " From the " Journal of Prison Discipline , " we quote the following in regard to this prison - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same period , we find ninety-eight , sixty-seven of whom are from the county jails . Of the whole number , fifty-nine have been in the army or navy . Of the last twenty-eight admissions , eight tenths are of that class on whose account our feelings have been deeply enlisted . They appear to be nearly all first convictions . In conversing with them , it is admitted that the moral hedge has been weakened by the army nssociations and practices ; through the frailty of our common nature , and the want of moral courage , they have fallen . It is a painful reflection , that men who have perilled their lives for the stability of our government should be brought into this situation , some having long sentences . " It is suoc*ested whether something can not be done to alleviate their condition . When we reflect that every State in the Union has contributed its quota to this class , and that they have returned there respectively to be disbanded , it is reasonable to suppose that all of the State prisons in the Union will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report of Committee on Discharged Prisoners , p. 250 . From the same Journal we quote the only description we have seen of a Southern Penitentiary since the war ended , - that at Richmond , Virginia . " The Penitentiary I found under the control of a military guard , // who kindly received me . Two of the old officers remaining informed me of the manner in which it was conducted before the evacuation of Richmond . The prison was conducted on the silent system : working together in extensive factories in the daytime , and locked in separate cells at night , and on the Sabbath . rJ7hey have no moral instruction , no library for the use of the prisoners , nor any care taken to classify them .

With a few more details of the condition of the American prisons , we may offer some general statements , and some suggestions for their improvement , recapitulating and adding to those already made . The most marked circumstance in the prison annals of America for the past ten years has been the diminution of punished crime since the war began in 1861 , and its rapid increase since April , 1865 . This might have been anticipated , but perhaps not to the extent which was actually noticed . In the State prison of Massachusetts , at Charlestown , the average number of convicts in 1861 was 520 ; in 1865 it was Gnly 359 . The highest number in 1861 had been 554 ; the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county prisons of Massachusetts reported an average of 1,957 prisoners ; in 1865 , but 1,050 ; while the number at the lowest point was but 950. * In the Ohio Penitentiary , in November , 1860 , there were 932 convicts ; in November , 1865 , exclusive of military prisoners , there were but 567 . In 1861 , the average number in the New York State prisons was 2,762 ; in 1865 , it was but 1,826 , of whom a part were military prisoners . This decrease extended to Canada , and would have been much greater there , if it had not been checked by the incr*ase of deserters , Copperheads , // and Rebels in some parts of the Province . In 1863 the num her committed to the Provincial Penitentiary at Kingston was 295 ; in 1864 it was only 166 . In most places , this decrease was only of male criminals , and was generally accompanied with a large increase of crime among females . Thus , at Sing Sing , the average number of female convicts in 1857 was but 84 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than double . In 1860 the female commitments to the Massachusetts county prisons were about 2,000 ; in 1864 they were at least 3,500 , while in 1865 they fell again to 2,700 , and will this year be still less . In some States , however , and in Canada , there was a decrease in female crime , even during the war . How rapidly commitments have risen in number since April , 1865 , will be seen by the following figures . For the six months ending with that date there were 40 commitments to the Charlestown prison ; in the next six months there were SO , and in the six months ending April 1 , 1866 , there were 179 commitments ; being an increase in these three periods at a geometrical ratio of more than two . At the Auburn prison , the number committed in the six months ending April 1 , 1865 , was 91 ; in the next six months it was 114 , and in the next ten months 440 . Here the rate of increase is still greater , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half to one ; and it is the more extraordinary , because the proportion of returned soldiers committed is estimated only at two fifths , instead of two thirds , as at Charlestown . In the Eastern Penitentiary of Pennsylvania , the number committed in the six months ending April 1 , 1865 , was 56 ; in the next six months , 134 ; and in the six months ending April 1 , 1866 , not less than 200 . In the Western Penitentiary , the commitments in the first period were 49 ; in the second , 52 ; and in the ten months following , 217 , of whom about three fifths were returned soldiers . The startling number of soldiers and sailors in our prisons has been made a new occasion for denouncing the war and those who have carried it on . We must be a little careful how we accept this conclusion . It should be remembered that our prisons are not yet so full , by some thousands , as they were // before the war , although our population has largely increased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of war have been operating powerfully ; that the alarming increase in commitments which manifested itself within the first year after the fall of Richmond is already checked ; and that there had been a steady growth of crime for the five years preceding the war . Nor will it escape notice that , in many places , there has been a rapid acceleration of commitments other than those of persons who took a direct part in the war . Even in the Massachusetts prison , where , probably , the statistics are most accurate 6n this head , these commitments rose from 28 in the first period of six months , to 36 in the second , and about 60 in the third period , between October 1 , 1864 , and April 1 , 1866 . In the Auburn prison , the number of civilian commitments has not simply doubled , but quadrupled , and similar facts are observed elsewhere . But we can not look with unconcern upon the thousands of veterans now lying in our prisons , though their crimes may have been heinous and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in defence of the nation , working with the other at the convict 's bench , is not an agreeable spectacle , , nor do we smile to see " les ltal3its Hens par la victoire uses exchanged for the prison-jacket . What stirs within us at such sights as these may well lead us to consider how our prisons can be improved . If they truly were what the theory of our law contemplates , - moral hospitals for the reformation of the culprit , as well as workshops and dungeons , - we should still shrink at the thought of pensioning in them the comrades of Grant and Sherman , of Foote and Farragut and Winslow . But as we know them to be , the good ones almost ineffective for good , the indifferent tending towards evil , and the bad fearfully developing and gendering crime , how can we rest under the thought that they are exercising their most hurtful influences upon thousands of these brave men ? And this mode of argument , far more forcible than logical , will , we believe , produce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first step towards improving our prisons is to provide a uniform and impartial inspection . This step has already been // 1866 . American Prisons . 411 taken in Canada , where , since 1859 , the Board of Inspectors of Asylums , Prisons , and Hospitals have been intrusted with the supervision of all such establishments in the Province . The Secretary of this Board , Mr. E. A. Meredith , has devoted much time and ability to the examination of prisons , and has more than once made special reports recommending improvements in the system in use . Mr. Meredith favors the Irish System , and , we believe , was the first official person on this side of the Atlantic to give it his hearty adhesion . The prison inspection of Massachusetts and New York , though better than in most of the States , is much less efficient than that of Canada . In Massachusetts the Board of Charities , in New York the Prison Association , perform duties of inspection in addition to the regular Inspectors ; but these bodies can not make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation lately held by the Prison Association , however , is one of the most searching ever instituted in America . Provision should be made in every State for such examinations by an impartial inspector or commission , not chosen by political intrigue or local partiality , but bringing to the work a knowledge of the subject and a spirit of intelligent humanity . We hazard nothing in predicting that the first recommendation of such inspectors would be a more strict separation and classification of prisoners , for that has always been the first result of careful examinations in congregate prisons . Probably they would next urge , as half the wardens in the country do , the importance of " commutation , " or conditional remis.sion , - that is , the shortening of sentences for good behavior ; and would insist on some effectual means of aiding discharged prisoners to find employment . They would then call for a better religions and secular instruction of the convicts while in prison , and a systematic organization of their labor . They would demand instruction in reading and writing for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enforced idleness which is the curse of our jails . Along with these things , they would seek to regulate by wise rules and by fre* quent inspection the sanitary condition of the prisons . They would see that baths were regular , that the food was neither // too good nor too bad , that cleanliness was made a religion , that the wardrobe of the prisoners was sufficient and properly changed , and that they should have an occasional holiday . They would demand that the contractor should not stand between justice and the convict ; and that neither the convict nor the public should be defrauded in the payment of wages . They would point out thults in the prison officers , and specify what qualities and what experience are needful in such establishments . When these and the concomitant changes shall be effected in our prisons , we shall have all that is best in the Irish System , which is now the most successful in the world . Under it the prisons of Dublin have become in earnest what Charles IReade called the English prisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , morals , religion , grammar , writing , and cobbling . " This system has by no means reached perfection , but it travels in the way of common sense and common humanity towards it , and , we believe , is destined to achieve its greatest success in some parts of the United States . In Vermont , for example , where a simple state of society and a profound desire for the good of men combine with the demand for labor to make the path of the reformed convict an easy one ; in Massachusetts , where the union of numbers , and the profuse beneficence of a community accustomed to further its kindly purposes by large gifts , can be brought to the aid of the more unfortunate of the human race ; and in many other States , the ideas of Maconochie and Crofton will find their more complete realization . But before this can happen , it is necessary that the public attention should be plainly directed to the defects , as well as the excellences , of our prisons , and in our judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sharply and with sincerity .
