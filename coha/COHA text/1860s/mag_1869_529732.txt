txt THE CLOTHES MANIA . THAT Alpine hat which broke out upon us with so much violence last September , and which , I am told , has not yet spent its force in the interior States , is a good illustration of the way in which a fashion originates , " takes , " spreads , rages , declines , dies away in the distance , and is lost to view , until it pleases our sovereign lords , the fashion-makers , to spring it upon mankind again . The son a New York hatter , late in the year x867 , while making the tour of Europe , found himself at Naples , where he noticed a pretty green // hat that was much in vogue , called the Alpine hat . It was steeple-crowned , with wide brim , and a broad black ribbon round the crown which was further decorated by a feather . It differed from the familiar T*rolese hat , which we often see at the opera upon the heads of picturesque banditti , chiefly in having the brim turned up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular dent or cleft in the top of the crown , such as all soft hats have when they are first unpacked . The young hatter , though on pleasure bent , had a mind attentive to business , and he sent one of these hats home to his father , who placed it in his store for the amusement of his customers . It was as though he had said : " See what things those absurd foreigners wear ! Yes , sir , they actually wear that kind of thing in Naples ; out of doors , and in broad daylight ! Just fancy a man wearing a green hat with a feather in it , in the streets ! " For three months or more this hat , so pretty at Naples , so ridiculous in New York , was exhibited in the hat store in Broadway without exciting in the breast of any man a desire to possess it . The realistic drama was then in fashion . Managers advertised their new effects as patented ; dramatists sought the twofold protection of the Patent Office and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man 's play to incur any but an original peril . The hats worn upon the stage being thus as real as the real water of the stage fountain , and the real donkey of the stage cart , this romantic hat was not in request for the drama . Indeed , it remains unsold at the present moment , and may still be inspected by the curious . But one day it occurred to the philosophic mind of the hatter who owned it , that , apart from its green color and its feather , the fundamental ideas of this hat were good , and were also in harmony with the tastes of the American people . He thought he saw in it a taking compromise between the orthodox respectability of the stiff . and glossy cylinder , and the too careless lowering loaferism of soft felt . He thought he could Americanize the Naples hat in such a way as to combine the safety of the stovepipe with the grace that is latent in the slouch . Then he said , " Make me a dozen hats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In due time , the hats were placed in the store for sale . The hit they made was immediate and most decided . Every one who saw them was delighted with them , and they were all sold in a few hours . It is a long time since hatters have offered the public so pleasing a union of the becoming , the comfortable , and the convenient . Andabout this time arrived in New York the gallant band of English cricketers , wearing hats somewhat similar ; and these gentlemen , performing daily in the presence of a great multitude , gave an impetus to the fashion . In a short time , the originator was selling a hundred Alpine hats a day , and all the other hatters were in full cry after them . In a few weeks , one half the better dressed men in New York were happy in the consciousness of having their heads more becomingly covered than they ever were before ; and the other half secretly craved the same happiness , but were prevented from indulging their desire by the noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this little story of the Alpine hat is contained , as I have said , all the principles that control the rise , spread , and extinction of fashions . But in order to present the subject properly , we must go back of the Alpine hat , and see by what steps we arrived at the state of mind and taste which caused so many of us to adopt it so eagerly . And this is a subject which goes down to the depths of human nature . As the topmost leaves of the tallest tree draw their nourishment from the far distant and unseen root , and take their form , color , and texture from the tree 's constitution and circumstances ; as there is a natural necessity that the leaves of the willow shall be long and the leaves of the holly shall shine ; so the feathers in ladies ' bonnets and the // shape of men 's hats , and all the seeming caprices of fashion , are controlled by law , originate in the nature of things , and are influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why walking-sticks are seldom carried at present in our streets , where , three years ago it was common to carry them ; but if any one had a month in which to find out , he could find out ; and very likely his investigation would carry him up among the great events and men of the age . He might have to write to Count Bismarck about it ; the national debt may have something to do with it . The shade of care that comes over the countenances of a community when times are hard , and which our faces have worn for the last three years , since our burden began to settle down heavily upon us ( the flush-money of the war being all spent , and the fictitious prosperity of war having been succeeded by its proper reaction ) , may explain it ; for a walking-stick is the natural accompaniment of a mind at ease . It is when we go forth to stroll among the girls in the Fifth Avenue on a fine afternoon , that we take a cane with us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow money . But I leave this interesting branch of the subject to future investigators , and return to my hats , merely reporting , for the information of those investigators , that , during the whole of the year i868 , the walking-stick trade was exceedingly dull , and that in 1864 and i86* it was very brisk indeed . Among the pictures in the gallery of the New York Historical Society , there is one representing the interior of the Park Theatre , on an evening in 1822 , during the performance of the elder Matthews . Every face in the audience is a portrait , the object of the artist being to assemble upon one canvas portraits of all the leading persons then moving in the society and business of New York . Often as I go into this interestinggallery , I never fail to take a look , in passing , at the round-faced , burly fathers of the present kings of commerce and finance . What a contrast , their amplitude of countenance and form , their good-humored torpidity of intellect , their consummate , solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectualized " operators* ' of the present time ; connoisseurs in tandems , pictures , books , operas ! As the persons in that distinguished audience are in full dress , the picture serves as an historical fashion-plate . The greater number of those stout gentlemen wear the most voluminous white neckcloths , which seem to have been wound round and round their necks , completely fill-* ing up the space between the coat and the countenance . Others have on those high stiff stocks which many of us remember , - things of buckram covered with black silk , satin , or velvet , fastened behind with a buckle that was not *always invisible . From out the depths of the stocks , stiff and sharp-cornered collars thrust themselves toward heaven . The coat-collars of these solid gentlemen are several inehes high , and only less stiff than a pine board . A few of the spectators , who are standing at the back of the pit , have their hats on , and those hats are immense ; they are structures , regularly built , bell-crowned , and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-distant haunts of his trappers . Most of the ladies wear bonnets , which also are vast , wide-spreading , and lofty , apparently of construction scarcely less massive than the beavers of their husbands . Stiff and cumbrous as the clothes in this picture seem to us , they are light and easy compared with the cocked hats , the padded coats , stiffened with buckram , the wigs , the overflowing ruffles , the knee - breeches and great buckles , from which victorious democracy , in Jefferson 's early day , delivered the fathers of these fathers who sit so solemnly enjoying Charles Matthews the elder . Old men used to be about New York who remembered when the young dandies of the Democratic party , in - the year of Mr. Jefferson 's inauguration , - first dared to show themselves in Broadway without wig or 533 // 534 pigtail . It was thought to be an innovation scarcely decent for a young man to go about the streets exhibiting his own hair ; and many men surrendered the pigtail only with life . When Mr. Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , and concealed his well-formed legs in pantaloons , the Federalists were prone to regard it as the trick of a demagogue to secure the favor of the mob . A gentleman in trousers and short hair ! But what better could be expected of a Democrat and an atheist ? After the revolutionary ferment , which in Europe ended in defeat under Napoleon , and here in peaceful victory under Jefferson , there was a reaction toward the opinions which are called conservative , and this reaction expressed itself in stiffness and uniformity of dress . People forty years of age can remember the high stock , the cruel shirt-collar , the ruthless coat-collar , the prodigious bonnet , and the general setness and severity of costume which prevailed among us , before Channing , Dickens , Carlyle , Emerson , Beecher , and the New York Tribune had begun the emancipation of the American understandinb from the tight-fitting armor of opinions in which it was once confined . The primness and stiffness of the ladies who used to walk past the Astor House when it was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk was between the Battery and St. Paul 's Church , can only be realized by those who remember their leg-of-mutton sleeves bulged out with buckram , and their lace handkerchiefs carried in their hands before them in a ludicrously precise and uniform way . The dress of the men was only less formal , cumbrous , and unyielding . Over all hung heavily the large black beaver hat ; which maintained its supremacy so long because it harmonized with the stiffness and angularity of the rest of the attire . It required three great historical events merely to circumscribe the dominion of the stove-pipe hat First , the Mexican War revealed to a large May , number of American citizens the unsuspected truth , that the head of maa could be covered becomingly without resorting to the stiff beaver . A good many officers and soldiers brought home from Mexico the wide-brimmed , steeple-crowned , flexible hat worn by Spaniards and Spanish creoles ; but the large and sweeping picturesqueness of that tropical production was felt to be incongruous with the square-shouldered , tight-fitting garments worn by the busy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face a staring population , and most of those spacious hats were hung on pe*s as mementos of warlike adventure* Then occurred the discovery of gold in California , and the wonderful rush across the Plains , around Cape Horn , and over the Isthmus , which compelled thousands of people to discard from their attire everything that wa* not pliable . The Mexican soft hat , modified to suit the American taste , became part of the uniform of the goldseeking multitude , and was frequently seen in the streets of the Atlantic cities . But neither the war with Mexico , nor the discovery of California gold , nor both these important events together , sufficed to make the soft hat fashionable . Something more was needed . Europe had to be convulsed , and half a dozen ancient thrones shaken , before the scene became possible which gave a rival to the stiff cylinder . The Mexican War began in 1846 . Captain Sutter 's men discovered the glitterin* particles of gold in the California mill race , in 1848 . On a certain day in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full activity ) , the most picturesque human figure which recent America has had the pleasure of beholding flashed upon two hundred thousand of us as we stood packed in Broadway , between the Battery and Union Square , - two miles and two thirds of excited people , every creature of whom desired in his secret soul to be a pleasing object of contemplation to his friends and the // public . We saw the hero of the hour but for half a minute each , as he passed , standing in his barouche , his pale and handsome face set off so strikingly by that graceful hat , with the large black feather wound about it . What a beautiful object he was ! The mere beauty of the man and his costume was such as to excite in every susceptible beholder a thrill of delight . I can see him now , the splendid Magyar , the magnificent , marvellous , histrionic Kossuth ! It was done ! The stove-pipe had a rival ; the feather , of course , was a thing to which we could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute these northern climes , and the races inhabiting them , that a male of our species , who wears a feather in his hat of his own free will , must be either more or less jban man . We could not attain to the feather ; but the KOSSUTH HAT , adapted to the American taste , immediately appeared , and from that day to this , the stiff cylinder has never been able to reign over us with its former absolute sway . An unpopular article of attire is the hat stigmatized as the stove-pipe . It is generally reviled as the acme of inconvenience and ugliness . It binds the head , and reddens the skin ; it is heavy , large , inflexible , expensive , easily injured , difficult to restore , and very much in the way on a journey , in a crowd , or at a public meeting . No one pretends to admire or defend it . And yet there is something in the breast of the respectable citizen which prompts him , upon the whole , to prefer it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is worn by about one half of the men in cities and large towns . There is , besides , a tendency in men , after indulging in soft infidelities for a while , to return to this unyielding head-covering . If between the sublime and the ridiculous there is a whole step , there is only a finger 's breadth between the becoming and the absurd ; and a staid citizen , when he ventures upon a soft hat , is not qz*ite sure on which side of that dividing finger he is . But the stiff hat is a fixed quantity ; he feels safe in it ; and 535 he is content not to be picturesque so long as he is sure not to be ridiculous . In itself , the hard hat is unpleasing and irrational , but it harmonizes with the angularity and stiffness which solid men still affect in the rest of their attire . Hence in Boston and Philadelphia , it is more frequently seen than in New York . The time has been in those two cities when the credit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business in any other kind of hat than one of that polished and unyielding description which was once associated in the public mind with punctuality in meeting pecuniary obligations . If his hat was flexible , what guaranty had the public for the rigidity of his principles ? The Alpine hat took half our heads by storm , because it held out to us the alluring prospect of being safely picturesque . The dent in the crown was regular ; the brim was somewhat broad , but it was not allowed to flap about of its own free will ; and that wide black ribbon round the crown gave richness and digniy to the whole . In truth , the soft hat was arranged in its most becoming form , and then fired in that form by block and stiffening . Such was its success in reconciling discordant conditions , that I saw the president of one bank and the cashier of another going down town wearing the Alpine hat , at a time when it was in high favor with the easy-going gentlemen of the press . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpine hat , indeed , expresses clearly the spiritual condition of the age , that halffledged freedom of the soul , that longing to be free , without quite daring to launch away from the native twig , which is characteristic of so many at present . In most of our large libraries there are collections of costume-books sufficient to show how immediately a change of opinion reveals itself in costume ; and many modern historians have recorded the fact . Henri Martin , in his History of France , frequently pauses to note the connection between changes of spiritual condition and changes in // the general style of dress . " In order to judge of a community , " he says in one place ( Martin , XII . 124 ) , " it almost suffices to see its costume , that faithful interpreter of the bodily habits , which reflects always those of the spirit . " Handling masses of illustrated works , and living near galleries of old pictures , he observed that both the morals and the minds of his countrymen have been faithfully reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashions were elegant and voluptuous ; at the immoral court of Henry III. , they were extravagant and monstrous ; in the time of Henry IV. , they had a military cast ; under glorious Richelieu , the costumes assumed " a nobleness , a severe and picturesque amplitude , a style at once graceful and distinguished , never equalled in modern Europe . " Fashions in that age , as in every age , originated in the country where there was most money and most leisure to spend upon dress , which then was Holland . Venice once gave the law to fashionable Europe , then Spain , then Holland , then France . While Louis XIV . was a gay and gorgeous personage , the costumes of his court were gay and gorgeous , but when he had been scared into a kind of repentance , and settled down with Madame de Maintenon into the steady-going married man , and no one could hope for royal favor who did not attend mass once a day , costumes became heavy , ugly , awkward , a monstrous blending of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought pleasure into fashion once more , instantly the cumbrous extravagances of the old court were abandoned , and dress became simpler , costlier , and more elegant . As the Revolution approached , democratic ideas were fashionable in chateaus and grand drawing-rooms . All costume and all decoration became simpler and less expensive . English modes were introduced , the splendid carriages with panels painted by artists of repute , and heavy with elaborate decoration , all disappeared , and Paris was sombre with chariots , darkcolored and devoid of ornamentation , in the London style . Later , meanness and shabbiness of attire were the height of the mode in Paris , where republicans of ancient lineage and renown strove to express in this way their newly felt brotherhood to the less fortunate of mankind . Under Napoleon , all fashions for men had something in them of a military character , Napoleon reserving to himself the striking simplicity of a field uniform . We have all observed , I suppose , what Mr. Herbert Spencer mentions in one of his essays , that the character of a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend it . " At a chartist demonstration , " he tells us , " a lecture on socialism , or a soirie of the friends of Italy , there will be seen many among the audience , and a still larger ratio among the speakers , who get themselves up in a style more or less unusual Bare necks , shirt - collars It la Byron , wonderfully shaggy great-coats , numerous oddities in form and color , destroy the monotony usual in crowds And when the gathering breaks up , the varieties of head-gear , the number of caps , and the abundance of felt hats , suffice to prove that were the world at large like-minded , the black cylinders which tyrannize over us would soon be deposed . " These remarks apply as well to New York as to London . They perfectly describe the motley assemblies which used to crowd the old Tabernacle in Broadway , when Theodore Parker lectured to all that was most advanced and enlightened , as well as to much that was eccentric and affected , in the city . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who issue in dark clouds about 12.15 on Sundays , from churches where all endeavor to think alike , and engage an able man , at great expense , to assist them in so doing ! In those Theodore Parker days , members of the press sported various peculiarities of costume ; especially men connected with the journal supposed to be most at variance with public opinion . Since that time , ex // tremes of opinion have drawn nearer together , and we now observe that the public-spirited and exemplary workingmen of the New York press , Bohemians of the new school , only discard so much of the conventional in costume and demeanor as is inconvenient and irrational . Compared with people of twenty years ago , we are all radicals , and our clothes show it . The eccentrics of the old Tabernacle platform have generally chosen to conform to the fashions of a public with which they are no longer much at variance and the public , less trammelled than formerly by orthodoxies in politics and theology , dress more easily , comfortably , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks ladies do not , I would like to show him a set of fashion-plates of 1820 to 1830 , now lying before me . Paniers , do you say ? Paniers first came in , I believe , about six months after the marriage of Louis XV. , which occurred in 1725 . They have been in fashion several times since , but they have never been so light , so modest , so harmless , so little worn , and so generally ridiculed as now . We can at least boast that they are not now regarded as an affair of state , disturbing the peace of courts , and callinb for the interference of a prime minister . That gossiping Paris lawyer , Barbier , in his diary for 1728 , has a curious passage relating to the paniers then worn at the French court , a passage which may console some readers whom the sight of a panier causes to despair of the human race . " One would not believe , " says Barbier , " that the Cardinal Fleury , prime minister has been embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petticoats to render them large and spreading . They are of such a size , that when the ladies sit down , the whalebones are pushed out and make such an astonishing spread that they have been obliged to have arm-chairs made on purpose . Only three women can get into a box at the theatre without crowding . The fashion has gone to such an extravagance , as 537 extreme fashions always do , that when the princesses are seated on each side of the queen , their petticoats , which rise as they seat themselves , hide the queen 's petticoat . That seemed improper , but it was difficult to devise a remedy . By dint of pondering ( dl force de river ) the Cardinal has decided that there shall always be an empty chair on each side of the queen , which will prevent the inconvenience ; and the pretext is , that those two chairs are reserved for Mesdames de France , her daughters " ( twins , two years old ) . Thus the wise old priest , who governed France for so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that the princesses did not like their petticoats concealed by the paniers of adjacent duchesses , and the Cardinal was obliged to grant them a vacant stool on each side . This offended the duchesses , who desired the same privilege . But Cardinal Fleury , like Dickens 's immortal London barber , had to draw the line somewhere , and he drew it so as to exclude the duchesses , which led to a bitter war of pamphlets and epigrams , in the course of which one pamphlet was publicly burned by the executioner ( Barbier , IL 37 and 41 ) . Much as we may regret to see young loveliness disfiguring itself with these things in the Fifth Avenue , we can find comforf in the reflection that Mr. Seward has not been obliged to interfere , nor has the public hangman earned the smallest fee in consequence of the revived fashion . Fashion is a necessity of human nature ; because , while we all desire to be pleasingly attired , not one in ten thousand of us is able to invent any article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is more universal than the wish to be well-looking ; . and the feeling is so strong that a person had almost better not be born at all than be born two feet too tall or too short , or with any other very marked personal peculiarity that can not be concealed . Byron 's morbidness with regard to his lameness was not an unusual case . Turn loose , in a large // school of rougn boys or girls , a child who has a squint eye , or a humpback , *r a red patch on its face , or who is extremely fat or lean , or tall or short , or whose clothes are very different from those worn by the rest , or who has some unconquerable peculiarity of speech or manner , and that child will suffer an acute misery of which no one can form an idea who has never experienced it . Nor is this a peculiarity of childhood . What would induce a respectable citizen of Boston to walk down Washington Street in top-hoots , or wearing a hat of 1830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stony stare of an omnibus full of female critics who have spied out something awry or antique in hcr costume ? It is a tremendous ordeal . We are so constituted that we like to be like one another ; and so general is this desire , that one of the signs of madness is an inclination to oddity in personal adornment . It is hard for us to believe in the soundness of a person 's judgment who turns his collar down when every one else turns it up , or who lets his hair grow very long when the rest of mankind have theirs cropped . It is only in these advanced days , and in these two or three most advanced nations , that there is any real liberty of choice whether we shall go bearded or shorn , and whether we shall take eveninb sustenance in a coat with a tail behind , or in one with a tail all around it . Indeed , there are circles even in metropolitan London , Paris , and New York , where a person , otherwise unexceptionable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in any other than the regulation coat . Many suppose that it is only the circles dependent upon Paris for their personal decoration , which are subject to these rigors . Not so . Nothing delivers from the tyranny of fashion but real elevation and independence of character ; and , accordingly , the most abject slaves of fashion are to be found May ? reins of the East , where Paris fashions are unknown , the changes in the shape of the ladies ' dresses , and in the mode of adorning their persons , are as frequent as with us ; and , although those changes are often so trifiinb that a foreigner would not notice them , a lady who can not follow the new mode is as miserable as a New York-servant-girl would have been a year or - two ago without . a hoop-skirt . We read in Marco Polo that it was so with the ladies of the harem countries , six hundred years ago . " A peculiar fashion of dress , " he records of one of those countries , " prevails among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their waists , in the manner of drawers , a kind of garment in the making of which they employ , according to their means , a hundred , eighty , or sixty ellsof fine cotton . cloth ; which also they gather or plait , in order to increase the apparent size of their hips ; those being accounted the most handsome who are most bulky in that part . " Paniers again ! And when the captains who sailed under Prince Henry the Navigator , first landed upon the Western coast of Africar years before Columbus commanded a ship , they discovered that the unclad beauties of Guinea were devoured by the same passion to be in the mode . " That woman among them , " writes an old translator of the valiant and talkative Cadamosto , " who has the largest breasts , has the glory of being considered the most handsome . For this purpose , each female , ambitious of this prerogative , when they attain their seventeenth or eighteenth year submit themselves to the operation of having their breasts tied around with strings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the body , and by means of daily efforts of stretching and dilation , , , ive them at length such an extension as to hang down to the navel . No greater bliss can arrive to their sex than success in this attempt . " * And a traveller - of to-day tells us that he carried with him a bountiful. among the barbarous races and classes . * Narrative of Firat Voyage of Cadamnoato to Mr. Oscanyan tells us , that in the ha- Coaat of Africa , is . The CYothes Mania . // supply of the prettiest and costliest colored beads into the interior of Africa , hoping thereby to conciliate a powerful tribe and purchase their good offices ; but when he arrived among them , he found , to his dismay , that the fashion in beads had changed , and that his were not in vogue . Colored beads were out , white beads were in . Not a negro of them , nor a negress , would look at his beautiful assortment of brilliant-hued beads , the choicest product of Birmingham ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and common white beads , which the traders had introduced . Give me a week in the Astor Library , and I will furnish an octavo volume of facts like these , showing that the desire to be in the mode is universal , and that this desire is strongest in the weakest of our species . The root of it all is , the deep and poignant shame which we experience from physical defects , a feeling most necessary and salutary . Every man wishes to be of the proper number of inches round the chest , and every woman wishes to be beautiful in form and feature . There is not a fashion now prevalent in the world , and probably never has been one , which did not originate in the desire on the part of some one to display a physical excellence , or conceal a physical defect . Nature abhors bodily insufficiency . For live years past , men have stood aghast at the fantastic tricks which ladies have played before high Heaven with their own and other people 's hair , as well as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair system , which has prevailed throughout Christendom , all originated in the fact that the hair of a certain conspicuous woman became , by incessant dressings , very thin . Those shoes , too , which have the heel near the middle of the foot , and destroy the harmony of every movement , owe their currency to a foolish and groundless superstition , that a small foot is a sign of superior lineage . Some lady whose position required her to wear fine clothes in the gaze of many of her fellow-mortals had 539 a large foot , which her obliging shoemaker strove to diminish by putting the heel an inch or two nearer the toe than it ought to have been . The trick seemed to answer the purpose , and from that time every lady in six nations , not exceptionally firm and sensible , has gone rocking on a pivot . Constantly , for the last three hundred years , ladies have been preached alt for wearing their dresses too low ; but such is the passion of human beings for displaying physical excellence , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well formed the fashion returns , and women indulge their desire to appear as lovely as nature made them . In every community of which we have any knowledge there is that one conspicuous person or class whoui the rest admire , envy , and imitate . But this elect few , who alone have much time or means to expend upon the decoration of the body , are ever striving to be as dis/inguished in appearance as they suppose themselves to be in real*ty ; and thus there is always going on a game of cross-purposes between the few and the many . The young men of New York who give their whole mind , such as it is , to the adornment and display of their persons , were glad enough to wear Alpine hats while only their own circle had them ; but the moment those hats began to be generally worn , the dandies gave theirs away , and fell back upon styles which had some little peculiarity . The Astrakhan cap , high , and without a visor , grave solace to some , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaskian aspect , as tboubh the Russians on their way home had stopped a few nights in New York to see the new piece . If the dandies succeed in ndoptin5 a kind of hat that pleases the public , more and more of the Alpines are laid aside , until they finally disappear beyond the Alleghanies , and spread tbemselves over the Valley of the Mississippi . Thus it is with all fashions . They are invented by taste or *uggested by accident ; they are adopted by the few who live but to dress ; they are taken up // 540 by the public who have only time to ask what is worn ; they are then abandoned by the ornamental class , and successively by the classes who are uneasy if they do not resemble them and , at last , they are only seen on the persons of the multitude , who buy clothes with the intention of wearing them out , and who execute that intention . Several causes have conspired of late years to stimulate our natural and commendable love of personal decoration , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many are possessed by a kind of mania for changing and multiplying their garments , and for having them made of materials needlessly expensive . Eighteen years ago , the President of the Republic of France betrayed the country which had trusted him , stole its liberties in the night , laid robber hands upon its treasury , dishonored its noblest citizens by carting them to jail inprison vans , murdered in cold blood several hundreds of innocent men and women in the streets of Paris , and transported hundreds more to a hot unhealthy region of the tropics . This was the Andersonville of usurpation . It transcended all that had ever been *done in that kind , - joining to the extreme of dastardly meanness the extreme of audacious cruelty , and being totally devoid of palliation or excuse , except that invented by the bead liar of the gang who perpetrated it . The man in whose name the deed was done appears to have furnished nothing but the lies ; the audacity , and what little courage was shown , being supplied by others . Mr. Kinglake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vol . I. Ch . XIV ) strikingly confirmed by some American narratives to which that author had not access , exhausts the subject , and avenges the human race , which is deeply injured whenever man 's faith in man is lessened by the deliberate betrayal of a solemnly accepted trust . Mr. Kinglake , I say , has avenged our outraged race ; for which , I trust , we are all duly grateful to him . Nothingremains butfor France to bring the perfidious wretch to trial for the special wrong done to her , and execute upon him the penalty to which he may be condemned . As usual in such cases , a woman was found willing to share the bed and booty of the successful robber . She was young , beautiful , well formed , and of just such a mind as to submit joyfully to spend half the day in trying on artides of wearing apparel , and the other half in displaying them to a concourse of people . It became , too , and remains an important part of her duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , by wearing a rapid succession of the most gorgeous , novel , bewildering costumes , the mere description of which has developed a branch of literature , employs many able writers , and mainly supports fifty periodicals . Here is a vain , beautiful woman , living in the gaze of nations , who has the plunder of a rich kingdom with which to buy her clothes , and the taste of a continent to devise them for her ; for to Paris the 111k of all tailors , dress-makers , milliners , and hair-dressers go from every capital in Europe . Whatever there is in France of truly noble and patriotic - and there are as many noble and patriotic persons in France as in any country - avoids the vicinity of this woman ; while around her naturally gather the thoughtless and the interested . The women in this circle imitate her as closely as women can whose husbands have not stolen the treasures of a nation ; all except one , it is said , and she is the real queen of fashion . Both these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal , as well as certain unusual charms , of which they intend the most shall be made . One is beautiful and tall . The other is ugly and short , but graceful , vivacious , and interesting . The hair of one of them growing scanty behind , all women felt the necessity of carrying a pound of horsehair under their own , and swelled out in the region of the back hair to an extent that now seems incredible . If the parting of the // hair widens , and begins to resemble baldness , then frizzing comes in , which covers up the deficiency . A few gray hairs bring powder into fashion . Other insufficiencies send paniers on their way round the world . For these women , and especially the one who figures in the centre of the group , occupy that conspicuous place to_the which for two centuries past more female eyes have been admiringly directed than to any other ; and there reside near them a band of writers who live by chronicling every new device of decoration that appears upon their persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Pall Mall Gazette finds it necessary to station an industrious member of its staff within sight of these people , for the sole purpose of telling the best women in England what clothes the worst women in France wear . I should suppose , from looking over the periodicals which publish fashion news , that there must be in Paris as many as a hundred writers who derive the whole or part of their income from describing the dresses worn in the ancient palaces temporarily occupied by the usurper and his dependants ; and many of these writers do their work so well , that their letters are a most potent stimulator of the passion for dress which is so easily kindled in the minds of the ignorant and immature . This poor woman , who is the immediate cause of the mischief , is , we are told , an anxious and unhappy being , as well she may be . She struggles to conciliate . A forced , fixed smile is ever upon her face , when that face is seen by others . In her growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beguile the people in whose sight she dwells , and on whose money she dresses . When the Hour comes , I hope she will be mercifully judged , for she has already expiated the venial sin of yielding to a temptation which only a very superior woman - one really honest and thorough-bred - could have resisted . It is probable that she now regards the wearing of those tremendous costumes merely as her contribu 54 ' tion towards housekeeping ; as though she said to her husband , " You keep down the men by muzzling the press and flattering the army , and I 11 fool the women by w*aring the most stunnin* costumes that ever struck envy to the female heart . " Then the marriage laws of France , and the universal custom of demanding a dowry with a wife , have necessitated other arrangements than marriage between the sexes ; have called into existence a large class of women who are well named the demi-monde , - a something between respectable married women and those who are wholly out of the pale of respectability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rest of the population now than they were when the loyal Barbier , indignant at the epigrams launched at Louis XV . when he established his first mistress at court , exclaimed : " Every one else keeps a mistress ; why should n't the king have one ? " The demi-monde may not be proportionally more numerous than in the year 1735 , but they have , as a class , a hundred times more money to spend . Empty head , vacant time , full purse , - these are the main constituents of the people subject to the clothes mania . Since the discovery of gold in California . in 1848 , I suppose more people have undergone a complete change of circumstances than ever before in so short a space of time . From that heavily laden marquis in England , who toils at the management of an estate yielding an income of three thousand pounds sterling a day , to the rag-pickers of the streets , we all have more money to spepd than we used to have ; and one of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfluous cash , is to go to Paris and buy pleasure with it , - pleasure being a chief product of that capital . Of course , there must be a prodigious number of semi and wholly unfortunate women there who have heaps of gold , and nothing to do but to copy or burlesque the showy women of the Tuileries . Heavens ! What a carnival of folly Tiw Clo/izes Mania . // they are holding , - those women of the palace and of the demi-monde ! That is , if we may believe our assiduous friends , the reporters of fashions . The most curious and ami*sing feature of it is , the great number of things that are now regulated by fashion . I read in one fashion-letter that American young ladies were greatly in vogue in Paris until last year ; but during the present season it has not been fashionable to have them at balls and parties , because it has been discovered that , under elegant and most costly costumes , some of them concealed an ignorance surpassing that of a servant-girl . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rage for light hair , that ladies whose hair is not of the fashionable hue tie it up into the smallest possible space , and wholly cover it with light curls , frizzles , and powder . Another informs us that the costumes of the Conspicuous Woman of France , which are sometimes chanbed four times a day , and the most expensive of which are never worn more than twice , vary in sentiment with the occasion ; so that when she attends a council of ministers , so called , she wears a dress of " a brave , reflecting tone , on which hues of steelgray meet rays of studious brown , the ensemble beinb burnished armor . " Two years ago , we are further assured , it was fashionable to be seen making caps and dresses for some poor woman 's baby ; but babies are past , and now no lady of fashion does anything with needles less elegant than " Venetian gu*pure or nettin* , " whatever that may be . Mourning dresses and mourninb customs , it seems , also vary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn at Pare-la-Chaise on the day when custom enjoins that graves shall be visited . Coffins , we are told , are again covered with black cloth " puffed like upholstery . " Indeed , if the reader will take the trouble tex look over a few of the fashion-letters from Paris , he will discover that fashion now prescribes not only every article of dress and personal decoration , but that there is scarcely anything which it does not regulate . In the course of a week or two I have gathered paragraphs telling me what cards I must use for every occasion on which cards can be supposed to come into play ; how I must be buried , if I wish to have the thing done as it should be ; what styles of tombstone are now in fashion ; what color my horses would have to be , if I had any ; whether the wheels and the body of my carriage must contrast or match ; what medicines , and school of medicine , and practitioners of medicine , it is fashionable to employ , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am notified , also , that in England , at present , the fashionable relz*ion is Ritualism . Strangest of all , I am seriously assured by the Monite r de la Mode itself , that it is now the height of fashion , not to follow the fashion , but to go to the studio of your artiste in clothes , and demand of her a creation , - a costume wholly original . " There is no woman of fashion who does not ask des confections faites exclnsivementAour elle . As soon as a thing has been seen , she wishes it no longer . " This calls to mind the advice which the author of Pelbam gave to the London dandy of thirty years ago , which was , that if he saw his most favorite , most costly , most stunning waistcoat copied by another man , he should instantly give his own away to his valet . No other course was open to a man of true ton . The solemnity with which these things are stated is sometimes extremely ludicrous . The force of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last winter in a New York paper , which notified the public that a family was in affliction from a cause both novel and distressing . An elegant bridal veil of " real point lace " had been ordered in Paris for a young lady who was to be married the next day . It had not arrived , and " the family of the bride were very much concerned , fearing that white tulle would have to be substituted . " Carlyle should have had this for " Sartor Resartus . " " Concerned " is good . // The truth is , that the two conspicuous persons in France are in a position which is both false and precarious . Being essentially histrionic persons , they employ histrionic arts , one of which is , rapid and frequent changes of costume . One of these people plays emperor , and the other plays empress ; and they have set all the fools in Christendom dressing for parts . " A remarkable toilet , " says a fa*hion ,  --  letter , " is a hunting-robe , to be worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii their saddles , but does not follow them , " The cost of all this is beyond arithmetic to compute . Never before were the treasures of a frugal and laborious people , such as the French are , wasted so wantonly . No. mistress of Louis XIV. , no titled harlot of the Regency , not Pompadour , not Dubarry , ever squandered the money of the French with such reckless profusion as the woman now occupying the apartments in which they dwelt . " The cream , of novelty , " says a late letter from Paris , " is a garland so contrived that , as the heat of the dancing - room becomes greater , the petals composing this barland open gradually , then fall into the hair , disclosing a diamond or a ruby in each . " Another : " A new fashion is , to have buttons and jewelry of the same shade as the ribbon sashes ; thus a maize taffeta is worn with amethyst , and coral jewelry with coral - colored ribbons . " Another : " The ladies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another in magnificence . " " The Empress 's toilets are all ravishing . On Sunday , at mass , she wore a blue satin trained dress , trimmed with Russian sable , with a polonaise of the same , likewise trimmed with sable , and a bonnet of iris velvet with aigrette . " This was a simple church dress . One of the evening costumes was " an apricot silk , puffed all round the bottom with apricot tulle ; flounces worked with silver , fuchsia pattern , and trimmed with Venetian fringe of white silk . Over this an immense train of white satin , soft-543 ened by apricot tulle , worked with silver fuchsias and fringe round the borders . " In this style do women of a certain mind dress when they have the plunder of a great kingdom at commancb The Princess Metternich , when she came to spend a few days at Cornpi*gne , felt it necessary to bring with her twenty-six trunks full of clothes and we read of a French bride who had sixty thousand francs ' worth of handkerchiefs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surplus money which ought to he educating France is at present chiefly wasted in disfiguring a few thousand Frenchwomen . The time was when the ladies who. led society in France had other claims to the homage of men than the clothes they wore . The time was , do I say ? The time is . The women who dress with this shameless disregara of morality and taste are , in no proper sense , leaders of the society of the country upon which they have fastened . They are not the successors of those amiable , intelligent ladies to whom Martin refers , when he says : " The ancients created conversation between men . Conversation between the two sexes , the true and complete conversation , was born in France ; and this is not one of the least of our titles to the esteem of mankind , little as we think of . it now , when we have departed so far from our former elegance of manners " ( Martin , XII . 424 ) . Nor are these dull , ignorant people worthy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There used to be in Paris , under the ancient reg4rne a few women of brilliant talents , who vi-. olated all the common duties of life , and gave very pleasant little suppers . " There can be no pleasant little suppers with persons dressed in the manner just described . No conversation is possible with a woman who has five hundred thousand francs ' worth of satin , lace , and jewels on her mind . These women are in fact purely histrionic persons , actresses , with whom a few words may be exchanged as they stand The Clothes Mania . // 544 dressed to " go on " ; but their minds are so preoccupied with their parts , their audience , and their trains , that conversation is out of the question . Happily , the play will end erelong , and then they will slink out of the stage door and go home , carrying their toggery with them . It is sometimes spoken of as a shame to the ladies of America , England , and Christendom generally , that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plundered France . Perhaps , many centuries hence , mankind will have advanced so far in moral feeling and genuine civilization , that a wrong done to any portion of the race will be keenly felt by every other portion , and a face unjustly slapped in Australia will make cheeks tingle in Greenland . At present , however , this is not the case , and most of us bear thesorrows of others with fortitude . Ladies do not generally read the newspapers ; do not as yet consciously share in the public life of the race ; do not even generally kizow how the person whose garments they copy got her insatiable little hand into the treasury of saving , industrious France ; do not see the transparent artifices by which the French are amused and flattered , while they are held down and plundered ; do not recognize in the bewildering costumes of the Conspicuous Woman a means of corrupting one sex and enslaving the other . Ladies do not think of politics when they go to Stewart 's to buy a new dress , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what is " going to be worn " by the influential ladies of their own circle . Each country has its professional fashion-makers , who adapt French patterns to that country 's climate , circumstances , and taste , and it is with these that ladies have to do . Not one lady in a million , who has ceased to part her hair , or who hides the symmetry of her forrii* in a panier , sees any connection between those acts and the politics of Europe . Let us not presume to censure th' fairer part of creation . A woman with a full purse and an empty head must dress , or do worse ; and , being tot ally unable to devise costumes herself , she must follow the fashions invented by people who have less money and more brains than herself . These fashion-makers have become in some capitals , especially in New York , a numerous and very capable class ; and they , too , have been powerful stimulators of the clothes mania . I may say , indeed , that a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , the grand object of which is to compel people to buy new garments before their old ones are worn out . I say compel ; not merely tempt them to do so by the invention of new and pleasing styles ( though that , too , is done ) , but force young and susceptible people to cast aside garments not half worn out , by making them prematurely old-fashioned . I can best explain how this is done by recurring to an article already mentioned , the stove-pipe hat , which being still worn by about one half the men in the United States , is what is styled " a leading article . " The great question which the chief hatters of this nation revolve in their ingenious minds is this : How can we make men dissatisfied with the hats they have , and fly to others which they see the dandies wear ? As many changes can be made in a hat as can be rung on those abominable " nine bells " of the arithmetics . A hat has a crown and a brim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steeple , or bell-shaped ; and that brim can be narrow , wide , curling , straight , turned down or turned up . The whole struc*-ture can be large or it can be small . Of all the shapes which this kind of hat can assume , the one most popular , the one hardest to change , is the very one which happens to be most in vogue at this . writing ( February , 1869 ) , namely , a moderate-sized bell , with a rather wide , curling brim . No shape is becoming to so many persons as this ; and hence , though the straigh**rown* and steeple crowns seldom run nio'r* than two years , // the bell , once well established , can seldom be made to seem absurd in less than seven years . Now , the trick of the hatters , as of all other fashion-makers , male and female , is this : first , to push or develop the reigning fashion , as rapidly as possible , to an extreme which savors of the ridiculous ; and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an opposite one . At present the tendency is to make hats larger , more bell-like , and with a brim of more pronounced curl . But the impulse in that direction is nearly exhausted , and the newest hats begin to look absurdly large , too hellish , and curling . The moment is at hand when a movement , more or less violent , will take place in the opposite direction . If the hatters dared , they would dart at once to a minute and natty steeple crown ; but the public , in that case , would shy , and keep on wearing the bells . The next extreme , whatever it may be , will not be reached under two years , and it will be approached by such numerous and gradual changes , that most of our hats will be considerably worn before we begin to be ashamed of them . Our tyrants will beware of gqing too fast with us ; for , after all , we can be masters if we will . We have to be deluded with the name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality the unresisting slaves of five men who keep Broadway hat-stores . The recent tight trousers illustrate the same device . They grew tighter , and tighter , and tighter , until it was perilous to go abroad , and many of our young fellows looked like Master Shallow in his young days , when , as Falstaff informs us , he resembled " a forked radish , with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife . " The moment a ridiculous extreme of tightness had been well established , our lords , the tailors , kindly shook out a reef ; and relieved us . But the tight trousers , which they had compelled us to bug , hang on their pegs unworn , or adorn the store fronts of Chatham Street . Among the ladies , the present rage is to load ever*ji article of visible 545 attire with ornament . " We know , " says the editress of our chief fashionpaper , " of a costume lately made , on which eighteen women spent two days in making the trimmino- " If the modistes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excessive ornamentation until it becomes utterly monstrous ; and then , when every wardrobe is bursting with absurdity , they will turn as short a corner as they dare , and rush to an opposite extreme of simplicity . The object of all these tailors and dressmakers is , to make us loathe our clothes while they are still as good as new . But they could not work their will upon us without the co-operation of the small class in all our cities who live only to dress , and whose one cry is , " Give us something new to wear . " These start a fashion and give it a chance to " take . " And as fortune is ever apt to favor the brave , it sometimes happens that accident aids the bold innovator who suddenly cuts off our coat tails , or takes in our trousers until we can not pick up a lady 's handkerchief . All* garments look well upon a fine form ; and there are legs which are more admirable the more distinctly they are revealed . Let but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bob-tail a few times in the view of the public , and every dandy is impatient until he has converted himself into a forked radish . And yet our fashion-makers , though they have stimulated the clothes mania , are probably the very persons who will do most to cure it . Such , at least , was my impression the other day , after going over the largest fashion-making establishment in the world . America , which is destined to try all the experiments and solve all the problems , seems to have it in charge also to teach the Northern races how to dress . When an American takes hold of a thing , he is pretty sure to give it plenty of air . He is the great Advertiser . He instinctively aims at the million , knowing well that there is little else in America but million , and knowing also that he who draws permanent tribute from the The CYotAc 's Mania . // million must devise something truly serviceable . We have in New York four establishments whose sole or chief business is to invent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions for cutting garments . The one which I visited employs sixty persons , and is about to occupy the whole of a large building , of which the rent is fifteen thousand dollars a year . The stranger is shown into one " studio , ** where a " corps of artists , " men , sit assiduous , drawing upon stone the fashion prints for men 's clothes , to which the chief tailors of the city have contributed each one suit . There I saw the coats , waistcoats , trousers , hats , neck-ties , and boots which were to be in fashion five months later ; for , as the fashion-plate is sent to subscribers in February , it has to be drawn some weeks before ; and the ingenious authors of it have to project their minds into the future , and infer what men can be made to buy in June , from what they fancy in December . Sometimes they hit it , sometimes they miss ; the public may jump at a new device , or let it alone ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being led in the way in which it is inclined to go . He is the great fashion- maker who knows best how to interpret the unconscious tendency of the public taste . In another room of this building is another " corps of artists , " women , who contrive new fashions for the ladie* , sold in the form of paper patterns , with directions for cutting attached . Now the great hits achieved in this " studio , " the patterns which sell most and longest , are such as combine with elegance the greatest number of utilities . The stay5le patterns are those which can be made easily , look well in cheap material , and harmonize with many other garments . I was expected to be surprised at the information , ( hut I was not , ) that the person in New York who has shown the greatest fertility in inventing these universal and lasting patterns is " a girl from the woods of Maine , " who never saw fashionable costume till she was a grown woman , and now earns sixteen hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered to possess . This establishment publishes an illustrated catalogue , which contains pictures and descriptions of more than a thousand garments of ladies and children 's wear , patterns of any of which , with full directions for cutting , are sold for a few cents . There appears to be a great economy of brains and labor here , - three men and four women inventing the clothes for a great part of a populous country . These " artists " are becoming independent of Paris . They take all the Paris fashion-periodicals , read the fashion-letters from that city , adopt any device that seems to them suitable to America ; but they never think of introducing a fashion merely because it has found favor with the temporary occupants of French palaces , or the demi-wives of the transient millionnaires of the Paris Bourse . It is a curious thing , too , that the magazines and weekly papers published by or for the fashion-makers are as a class remarkable for good sen seand healthy feeling . If they fill the souls of some ladies with visions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorials showing how wlonb it is to sacrifice the substantial interests of a family to the false decoration of one or two members of it . They give alluring pictures of baby 's lace dresses , - $ 150 to $400 at Stewart 's , - but they tell mothers that it is highly ridiculous to provide such costly bibs for the absorption of sour milk . One of these papers  --  and it is a paper of most excellent tone , full of capital advice and just satire - has a circulation of sixty thousand copies , and it is , therefore , compelled to give its chief attention to the promulgation of really useful patterns . It follows the law which is converting the fashion-manufactories from stimulators into correctors of mania . The universal and prompt dissemination of every new device makes it impossible for any woman to am dislinction by novel chanbes of attire ; and we already see , at grand 546 May , // parties , that a few ladies of entirely assured position avoid in their dress everything that savors of the startling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they alone cau wear without starving or stinting more important interests . Such ladies , of course , never exhibit anything conspicuous or costly in the street , and some of them even go to an extreme in the disregard of appearances out of doors . Of late , a few have gone further , and denied themselves the pleasure - to them alone an innocent pleasure - of wearing satin , velvet , and much lace . Goethe says that folly can seldom be cured by denying to it all indulgence , and recommends that , in some cases , it should be nauseated by " intoxicatino draughts . " In this way , also , the fashion-papers may be of service , aided as they are by the fearful excesses in which some of the clothes maniacs indulge . There were " receptions " given last winter in New York , which were , in the most literal meaning of the word , flOtkillg but exhibitions of wearingapparel . No lady had any other object than to display her own costume , and to scrutinize that of others ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she anything to communicate except descriptions of dresses such as we read in letters from Paris . Indeed , the mere magnitude of the dresses was such in January and February , that every lady had as much on her mind in making her way about , as the pilot of one of those magnificent Bristol steamboats has on his , when , at 5.15 P. M. , the stately craft moves majestically among the numberless ferry-boats and sailing vessels of the East River . A moment 's inattention , and smash ! the cabin is stove in . One glance at a friend who may be two or three dresses ofi and rip ! away go the gathers . In time , let us hope , such experiences as these may prove to be the nauseating drau*hts which Goethe recommends . Men 's dress is now nearly perfect . It is cheap , durable , convenient , van ous ; and it may be elegant and becom* ing in a high degree . By devoting to the subject thirty minutes per annum , - fifteen in May and fifteen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clothes which can contribute either to the comfort or the adornment of his person . A dress suit will last through ten seasons of pretty frequent parties , and still be presentable ; nor does it need any great firmness or good sense to enable a man to smile at the devices of tailors and fashion-makers , and stick to his clothes till they are worn out . As a rule , men in the United States do not dress well enough . Am illion of us ought to dress every evening for dinner , who do not , merely because we are not civilized enough . Our dirty streets and crammed public vehicles discourage dressing , and we indulge the delusion that we have not time or strength to dress after the labor of the day is done , though many mechanics do it who work ten hours a day ; and travel an hour and a half besides . With ladies , it is otherwise . Many of them have entirely run to clothes , as cucumbers run to seed . Men begin to maintain the Mahometan doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was only the few thousand ladies connected with courts and aris. * tocracies , who were subject to this kind of mania . But , at present , few women wholly escape it . In remote villages you will see foolish virgin 's in three or four different costumes on the same Sunday , and in cities you will find the wives of plain , laborious men squandering more money on a child 's dress than would maintain three sons in college . We have all become so used to witnessing this entire devotion to dress , that when , by chance , we observe indications of intellectual or unimpaired physical life in a lady who has grown up under present influences , we are startled . Twice in my life , I have fallen in love at first sight . The first time was in a bookstore in Boston , in the street 547 // 548 named after the Father of his country . I was fresh from New York , where my afternoon walk is usually up the Fifth Avenue , a street in which the Mahometan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This first love of mine was a girl of about seventeen , with a lovely bloom on her cheeks , and she wore a dress of blue something ( not silk ) with white spots in it . It was when I found out what that sweet girl had come to the store to buy that I gave way to the weakness alluded to above . She was lovely in herself , but , great heavens ! she was there buying a GAZETTEER ! Here was a young lady , aged seventeen , who took interest enough in the world she inhabited to desire a catalogue of its contents ! Amazing ! Long she hesitated , *nxbus to choose the best . Shall it be Lippincott ? Shall it be Harper ? She made up her mind at last , paid for the book , and completed her conquest by carrying it home herself . I never saw her more ; I know not her name ; but I love her still , and often have a distracting vision of her when I see " those others , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I am not Dr. Holmes or Mr. Lowell , that I have not written out my Lines to a Young Lady in a Blue-Spotted Dress ( not Silk ) whom I saw buying a Gazetteer in a Boston Bookstore . May , The other time was on the long piazza of a seaside hotel , also in New England . She was a married lady , a mother , and a writer of charming verse and prose . It had been her singular good fortune to be reared on that rockbound coast ih such a way that her growth was never checked by excessive school , nor her freedom of movement hampered by irrational dress , or by false ideas of propriety . Her father being a landlord , a fisherman , a light-house keeper , and a man of sense and information , she had plenty of boats , rocks , fishingtackle , and suggestive conversation ; and so grew up absolutely free from every one of the pernicious restraints of a defective civilization . At the same time her mind was duly nourished with honest knowledge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never spoke to her . I should not know her face to-day , if I saw it . But what instantaneously captivated my affections was the wondrous beauty of her stej5 / Just to watch the glorious harmony , the perfect concert , of her movements , - was rapture . It is this darling of my memory in her coarse blue Dio Lewis boat-dress , that I think of when I see those gorgeous ladies carrying down the steps of a fashionable house an immense armful of clothes which they have been exhibiting at a reception .
