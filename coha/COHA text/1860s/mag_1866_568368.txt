ARTICLE *fI. - MRS . SIGOURNEY . Letter8 of 3fe . By Mrs. L. II . SIGOURNEY . With an additional chapter by her daughter . New York : D. Appleton &amp;Co. 1866. l2mo. pp.414 . WHEN1*YER any person has died in our country , during the last score of years , who was of public reputation sufficiently wide-spread to justify it , or of interest to his own family circle enough to make them wish such a thing , a kind of calm and peaceful confidence has rested in our minds , that , within a brief season , a poetical obituary would appear in the public prints from the well-known pen of Mrs. Sigourney . Indeed , so general has been this confidence among the people of Connecticut , that some persons , who , from peculiar modesty or from some other reason , have desired to escape the notice of the great world after death , have been beset by a kind of perpetual fear that she might survive them , and thus , having them at a great disadvantage , might send out their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , multitudes of longing hearts have poured foi-th before her their earnest petitions , that she would give their dec*eased friends the benefit of her Muse ; and some have even requested , while in the fullness of life and vigor , that she would kindly remember themselves when they should have passed away . No one , however obscure or however youthful , has had a doubt , that even himself might , in some future day , be turned into song , or his own humble virtues made the poet 's theme . But amid all this confidence for others , has not the thought , perchance , sometimes risenwhat will be done when Mrs. Sigourney herself dies ; who shall sing her praise in an obituary sonnet ; and has not a painful doubt mingled itself with our peaceful confidence , showing that this world was not intended to be a place of perfect repose of mind ? These trying questions are now answered , for , with a fitness that must impress every soul , Mrs. Sigourney appears before us once more , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this story is not a sonnet , but a book ; as it should be , indeed , for the life that had already opened itself in a whole volume of obituaries might properly show , at its close , that it was itself one obituary volume . " Letters of Life " is the title which has been selected , doubtless because the narrative is given as if in a series of letters to one of her cherished friends . Whether they were actually sent to this friend , is a point which we are unable to determine from reading them ; but , however this may have been , they bear the most evident marks of an intention , on the part of the distinguished writer , that they should meet the public eye . In sending them everywhere throughout the land , in a printed form , the dutiful daughter has undoubtedly followed the wish , if not the command , of the departed mother . We feel , therefore , that Mrs. Sigourney herself has desired that her life might continue in this world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something of the freedom which is at times denied us in reference to the dead . With kindness and with full measure of praise we wish to speak , for we believe she lived a useful life , which was worthy of commendation for many things . But we must approach her book with all freedom of criticism , and we must be allowed the privilege of a hearty laugh , for the former is our duty in our present work , while the latter is a necessity laid upon us , both by her nature and our own . The authoress begins her first letter by saying , that her life has been " little varied by incident , " and the pleasant narrative which we read on the following pages shows most clearly the truth of this remark . Man 's life , in general , has been said by some one to consist of three great things-being born , getting married , and dying . If ever a life drew near to this simplicity , we may almost say that Mrs. Sigourney 's was that life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were out of nothing , seems to justify the undoubting trust in her powers , which was manifested by so many strangers in sending to her for poems for every occasion and on every subject . We smile , as she tells us of the letter which she once received , requesting an elegy on a young man , " who was one of the nine children of a judge of probate , and quite the Benjamin of the // family , the member of a musical society , and who , had he lived , would likely have been married in about a year , " but of whose character and life she knew nothing beyond these interesting facts . Yet as we finish this account of her own life , we hardly wonder that these few things were deemed sufficient to excite her poetic fervor , and we have a prevailing belief that the wished-for elegy can now be found somewhere among her published or unpublished works . She was born in Norwich , Connecticut ; lived there with her parents , in the mansion of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been purchased and repaired by her own father ; removed , when she was about twenty-three years of age , to Hartford , where she established and for several years conducted a young ladies ' school ; married , in 1819 , Mr. Charles Sigourney ; lived in two different houses with him during his life-time , and in one without him after his death ; and died , at the age of seventy-four , " loving all and beloved by all , " on the 13th of June , 1865 . This is the sum and substance of the book . Indeed , so little of incident is there in her whole career , that the first journey which she made from Norwich to Hartford  --  a ride of perhaps eight hours-is the subject of a lengthy description , and takes rank in the volume almost as one of the marked events of her history . We thank her for the prominence which she gives to this journey , for it carries us back in memory to the days when we were ourselves so familiar with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages that lie between these leading towns of our ancient Commonwealth . How we groaned iii prospect of that dull ride for days beforehand ; how our boyish heart felt that the jolting vehicle , on its leather springs , was the messenger coming to bear us away from the home we loved , and the dear old maiden aunt whom we loved better even than the home ; how we yielded at last , when the destined hour arrived , to the resistless fate that laid hold upon us and knowing that we should be sick and sorrowful all the way , took our place under the driver 's care ; how , as we traveled on over the dusty road , Franklin seemed ten miles away from home , and Lebanon twenty miles from Franklin , and Columbia still farther from Lebanon , and the day the longest day , except an occasional Sunday , that the world ever knew ; // how we thought Bolton hill must have turned itself completely round since we had crossed it on our last journey , so that we could never go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a slow progress , which grew ever slower ; and finally how the elms of East llartford and the spires of the city itself filled us with rejoicing , and the feeling came that nothing in this transitory world could ever induce us to enter that hateful stage *&amp;gain-except , indeed , another sight of the old ancestral home in Norwich . It all comes back to us once more , to-day , but , in the distance of years , there is something of a sort of dreaminess about it , which makes it appear more pleasing now than it once did ; and even the driver and his horses move more gracefully and rapidly in the picture , than they used to do in the reality . As we follow our authoress from page to page , we feel that a similar dreamy and , in her case , poetic haze must have gathered about her mind , as she reviewed all the past history , so that everything assumed to itself an unreal beauty before her retrospective vision . Let us accompany her in her course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her descriptions and her thoughts . In doing this , we propose in the first place to speak , at some length , of her style , and then to consider , as impartially and with as just appreciation of her as possible , her character and her life 's work . It has been always , among the circle of our acquaintance , here and elsewhere , a point of much discussion , whether Mra . Sigourney could fairly claim the name of poet . Some have earnestly maintained her right to this honor , and have compared her with Mrs. Hernans favorably . Others have , as stoutly , denied it ,  --  have thought she was only like the organ grinder , as compared with a true musician ,  --  and we have heard of one person , who even went so far as to be unwilling to go from New Haven to Hartford on the same train of cars with her , lest , if any accident befel him , she might rhyme about his unlucky fate . As for ourselves , we have hitherto ventured upon no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form one . We have no poetic talent . We had one or two distinguished ancestors , indeed , widely honored for their powers and services in many lines , who wrote poetical // works , but since no one of them ever attained higher praise than that of being " almost a poet-not quite , " we have sorrowfully searched in vain through our inheritance from them for any portion of this happy gift . There was once , also , a prominent relative of ours by marriage , who became the author of a collection of poems of a moral and religious character , and then gave them to the world in a volume , but inheritance ordinarily comes through blood alone , we believe , and we have never been able to discover in ourselves anything like his poetry . With a hopelessly prosaic soul , therefore , we have left the disputation to others , and it has gone on , without end , till the present moment . But , as we take up these Letters of Life , and read the description of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigourney must have had a poetic imagination . It so happens , as we have already intimated , that , in former years , we were quite familiar with that beautiful town , and there are around us a considerable number of persons who know the old house , and the history of the family that lived there , better man we do . And we all agree that the story displays imagination . The house , where she was born , she says , " was among the better class of New England houses at that day ,  --  spacious but not lofty , a broad hall intersecting it in the middle , with suits of rooms on each side . Its court-yard was of the richest velvet turf ; two spruce trees , in their livery of dark green , stood as sentinels at the gate , and alternate columns of fragrant eglantine and the luxuriant white rose were trained from the basement to the eaves . It was environed by three large gardens , each of which enchanted my childhood , and even now linger with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of description of these gardens , in which she has placed flowers and fruits so numerous , that our un-flowery and unimaginative mind can scarcely believe there are so many in the world . We have passed that " spacious but not lofty* ' mansion many times in the course of our life , but it never seemed to us precisely as it does here ; and we hardly suppose the majority of readers of the volume , who have never seen the place , would infer from the description , that the court-yard , with its velvet turf and sentinel trees , was , in the extreme // distance from door to gate , perhaps twelve to fifteen feet in length , or that the three environing gardens were owing to the fact that the house was located near the middle of one side of a large lot , and that the land , on either side of it , and in the rear , was so cultivated , that there was an extended place for flowers and fruits , as well as vegetables . And yet , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the simple statement of the case . A little thing , indeed , this is , to which we have alluded , but the book is made up of little things , and as this occurs on the second page , and is a sample of a large portion of the book , we quote it as proving what we have been maintaining . We think our worthy friends ) the present inmates of this ancient mansion , as they trace the glowing picture , will scarcely dream that they are reading a simple narrative , and yet , at the end of the prolonged account , the authoress begs forgiveness for its minute detail , fearing that it " may seem dry and prosaic . " With confidence we say to our doubting and unbelieving friends ,  --  Mrs. Sigourney was a poet . If this description seemed prose to her , as she wrote it , she must have been no ordinary poet . The story of the family who dwelt within the house is told much after the same  --  to her " dry prosaic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a venerable widow lady , of the name of Lathrop , one of the old New England aristocracy , whom one of the recent newspaper reviewers of this volume , bewildered doubtless by fhe glowing description , has supposed to have been a relative of the authoress , but whom the authoress does not speak of in this way ,  --  and of her own father , Mr. Ezekiel Huntley , with his family . Her father had charge of Mrs. Lathrop 's grounds , and occupied some rooms in her dwelling , " the house being admirably arranged , " - as we suppose most houses are- " for the accommodation of two fainilies . " From the first mention of these names , everything moves on so smoothly and easily and imaginatively and poetically , that one almost loses sight of the individuality of the good old widow lady , and is often at an utter loss as to whether the house , and its furniture , and its library , and everything within or without it , from " Benedict Arnold , the clerk , " to the cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do // with that venerable personage , or whether they were all alike the property of Mrs. Sigourney 's own family . Noting the words with careful accuracy , as we have done , we find , indeed , that Mrs. Lathrop , steadily though noiselessly , maintains her course as the presiding genius of the whole establishment , but , even with our careful reading , we are unable to determine the facts in every case . Whether , however , the one of the two parties or the other was the more prominent in all things , the kindly heart of the authoress appropriates them all to herself as the beautiful treasures of memory , and , we suppose , she may have never once dreamed , as she was writing , that she might make an erroneous impression upon the readers ' minds . It is really astonishing to see how rose-colored everything is , in all her description of this early home . One would think-whether the subject be the food , or the dress , or the sports , or the work of those years-it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen something of New England farmers and their manner of living , but , by some ill-chance or other , we have never found anything so near the ideal . Even the fact , that , like many other children in later times , she was made to eat what was placed before her at her meals , is described in the following language-of a different style , we are sure , from that which would have expressed the feelings of any of the boys or girls , whom we used to know , under similar circumstances : " when seated at the table , I was never asI*ed whether I liked or disliked aught that appeared there . It never occurred to me whether I did or not . I never doubted but that I should be fed with food convenient for me . ' I was helped to what was deemed proper , and there was never any necessity , like poor Oliver Twist , to ask for more . " The italics are ours . She adds , with a gleam of ordinary human feeling , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , at that time , as they have now , a considerable amount of food of not very tempting character , " it did not appear to me , from aught that I saw or heard , that the pleasure of eating was one of the main ends of existence . " The exact age at which she was , when these words were applicable to her , we are unable to determine with absolute certainty ; but it must have been somewhere between the age of four and eight or nine years , one would think , and , at that early age , // we question whether the mind of any child , except that of a fXtture poet , would have gained precisely these ideas , in precisely this form . But hers was the mind of a futur4 poet ; and even as early as the age we have mentioned , according to her declaration , thought and even poetic " thought became her friend . " Being left alone at night , from the age of three onward , to fall asleep by herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the intervals not given to sleep , " she says , " Thought talked with me . So delightful were its visits that I waited for and wooed it , and was displeased if slumber invaded or superseded the communion . For it sometimes brought me harmonies , and thrilled me to strange delight with rhythmical words . I believe the following was among its first gifts . Memory has , from the earliest childhood , kept it in her casket ; Oh King of kings I who dwell'st among Angelic heralds , hear my song . Inexplicable are Thy ways , Eternal ought to be Thy praise . ' " A new nightly visitant came with Thought , and sat in judgment on my couplets . It was Criticism . She measured the lines , and put them to her ear , like a pitch-pipe ; and with regard to this specimen , suggested that in the second line tongue ' would make a more accurate rhyme to among , ' than the word I had chosen . I examined her decision , but adhered to my original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to sleep . " Whether all this took place as early as when she was three years old , she does not distinctly say ; but , inasmuch as she adds , a few lines afterward , " As reading became almost in babyhood a necessity of existence , I was thrown upon a rather severe selection of standard authors , " and then mentions ,  --  as examples of these authors , to whose " measured dignity and even solemnity " of style and thought she had , even then , become " inured , " - Young 's Night Thoughts , Addison 's Spectator , Goldsmith 's Vicar of Wakefield , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , we suppose it must have been not long after that infantile age . If we are right in this conclusion , and if the proof of being is poet is the fact of being born so , and not made so , we think it is clearly shown , that Mrs. Sigourney was a poet . To be sure , we can not suppress the painful doubt , as to whether this story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and whether , according to the actual facts , the sleep did not come // to the baby eyes before Criticism and Thought entered the apartment , rather than after these visitors had departed . But if all this could be said of her , at that time , and this seems to be the representation of the volume , she must have been born quite unlike most prosaic children . And in this connection , we are gratified to find , that she was not only born a poet , but also born an obituary poet , for , among the books alluded to above , she specifies Hervey 's " iReflections Meditations ? among the Tombs " and Gbssner 's " Death of Abel , " as having " supplied her imagination with pleasant food . " In due season she began to attend school , and to gain all the varied acquirements and accomplishments of an education-a phrase which we feel justified in using , when we consider what she had alre*idy done before her school days commenced . The narrative runs rapidly over this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who were her teachers , and b then comes to the death of her aged friend , Mrs. Lathrop , an I the great event of the journey to Hartford already mentioned ,  - -  her " first grief and first journey . " The death of Mrs. Lathrop and her funeral are spoken of as sad events , as they might well be in the life of a young girl , who had long looked up to this venerable friend of nearly ninety with mingled reverence and affection . But we can not help being especially struck with the entire centering of all things in lierself which our authoress exhibits when she attempts to present before us these scenes . One would almost conclude that this excellent old lady had no relatives or near friends in the town , so fully does it appear as if the writer and her father and mother were the chief persons in the procession and at the services . And yet , if we are correctly informed ,  --  indeed the authoress herself elsewhere represents it in this way ,  --  the town was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every degree , the aristocracy of the place ; and they were doubtless quite prominent on this occasion . But to her thought , as the grief was her own , so the surrounding company were as nothing , and when years had carried the scene far into the past , the poetess ' mind lost sight of every one else and beheld herself as the sole sorrowing friend . The grief which overpowered her at the time of this great affliction , was the // cause of such failure of health and strength , that her parents were led to lay open her case before the family physician ; and it was his suggestion that brought about the other great event of the " first journey . " This skillful physician was Dr. Philemon Tracy , a gentleman well known by the older generation of Norwich people , if we mistake not , as a sensible , but somewhat plain-spoken and blunt person , , not likely at all to use language of a high-flown order . The case was set before him , in answer to his minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his view of what was best to be done . Of course , we do not know what he said , for we have no means of knowing , but , as we are tracing out the evidence of Mrs. Sigourney 's poetic imagination , we give our readers her own account . " After a thorough investigation , " she says , addressing herself to the friend to whom she writes , " what do you suppose was the decision in my case ? That I should be encased in soft , red flannel , and take a short journey to visit the relatives of my loved , lamented friend . " Good old Dr. Philemon Tracy , on the one hand , and the expression " eneased in soft , red flannel , " on the other , are so widely apart , that no one , we presume , who ever saw him , could doubt that somewhere between the two was the point where poetry begins . But here again the authoress shows her peculiar power , for to her this seems , not poetry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " with their excited apprehensions , might possibly , in the simplicity o* this counsel , have shared the disappointment of Naamati the Syrian , who supposed the prophet would do some great thing . " We can not believe Mrs. Sigourney 's parents , had they been directed to " encase " their child in flannel , would have been disappointed exa*tly in the same way that Naaman the Syrian was , nor do we suppose any one besides a poet would have regarded the prescription as characterizeci by simplicity . The death of Mrs. Lathrop made it necessary for Mr. HuntIcy to move into another dwelling , and he accordingly purchased one . This second house and the life in it  --  the house . we must remember , of an ordinary Connecticut farmer of tLse days-are described in the same imaginative style as that of the revered widow lady ; though , of course , there was some // what less of magnificence in the new abode . We have no space for long quotations , nor are they necessary . We select only two , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear upon the question of her poetic genius , now under consideration . Alluding to the fact that , at this period-she being now fourteen years old  --  the knitting of her father 's stockings had devolved upon l*er , she says , " To the hose destined for my father I devoted particular attention , because short breeches and buckles being essential to the full dress of a gentleman , the encasing of the lower limbs was more conspicuous than since the easier regency of the pantaloon . ! I took pleasure in making his ribbed , viz. , knitting two stitches and seaming one , which , though a slower process , rendered them more adhesive , ! and better revealed the symmetry of his well-shaped limbs . " Do girls of fourteen often think their thoughts in such language as this , or women of seventy imagine they thought them thus , when they were fourteen ? We are not very extensively acquainted with young girls of that age , but we can not believe that they do , if they are of the prose order . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor old weaving woman , whose peach trees the neighboring boys , as boys often will , attempted to plunder . " Her cap , yellow with smoke , " the authoress says , " and face deepening to a purple tinge of wrathful emotion , might be seen protruding from her casement , as she vituperated the boys , who manifested a hazardous proximity to the garden wall . Not perfectly lamb-like was her temperament , as I judge from the shriek of the objurgations she sometimes addressed to them ; while they , more quiescent , it would seem , than boy-nature in modern times , returned no rude reply . " We have spoken with reference to girls of fourteen with some hesitation , but the relation of boys to old women who owned peach trees we remember quite perfectly . We have also heard from a venerated relative , who was himself a boy in those days , concerning similar things in the time of Mrs. Sigourney 's childhood . And if any of the boys , who lived in Norwich from 1791 to 1810 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasional scenes in which they formed a conspicuous , and sometimes not very honorable part , we are sure they would have doubted their own personal identity ; while , were the old woman alluded to in this passage , to have been inquired of as to whether her face " protruded from the casement , " or whether she " vituperated the boys , " we doubt if // she would ever have imagined that any such thing had happened . The poor persecuted and tried soul , we suppose , actually put her head out of the window and scolded the urchins ; but she , unquestionably , " shrieked her objurgations " An a somewhat simple style of prose , and they , however " quiescent " they may have been before , became , as we can not doubt , quite the opposite immediately after they had heard the first shriek . In connection with this narrative of her childhood and girlhood 's life , the authoress gives a letter descriptive of the aristocracy of the olden time , which is much in the same glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading families who divided between them the glory of the town in those days  --  the Lathrops and the Huntingtons-it has much of interest , and with another letter that is devoted to the social amusements , &amp;c. , to which she was herself accustomed , quite carries the reader back to see the mode of living and daily habits of society sixty or seventy years ago . But we can not stop to call attention more particularly to these letters , for we have lingered too long already upon this portion of her life . We only remark , that our knowledge of the scenes and circumstances of the old town and of the history , leads us to feel that the authoress , in the excess of her joyous memories and poetic inspiration , has thrown a somewhat unreal charm over the simple facts , and that she has unwittingly described herself , as regards this matter , in her description of one of her caithful and excellent colored servants , who lived with her in Hartford for twenty-five years . " Some faults she had , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someti , mes overstepping the reality of circumstances . " We feel dispo'sed , however , as far as possible , to pardon the fault , for we all find the past gathering a bright halo around it , and Mrs. Sigourney has such perfect good will towards every one else , and is so full of happy recollections herself , that we are almost glad to deceive ourselves into the belief that it was all quite as rosecolored as she represents . Indeed , we have only considered this earlier section of the book as bearing upon the question of her style and poetic gift . And here would we leave the subject , only we can not refrain from inserting at this point several // other quotations from later portions of the volume , which may fitly close our argument to prove she was a poet . For example , in her description of the residence of Mr. Sigourney , on Asylum street , Hartford , just on the outer limits of the city as it then was , she has the following : " It ( the mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel walks were adorned with shrubbery , and by spacious gardens , one of which stretched downward to the fair river that girdled the domain , from which it was protected by a mural parapet . " By these closing words we suggest , though with a want of confidence becoming in one who comes no nearer to a poet than a relationship by marriage , that the authoress probably means a stone wall-quite an ordinary thing in a New England landscape , which we have , ourselves even , often seen without thinking of it as a " mural parapet . " But perhaps we never saw exactly what the authoress is here describing , and so we ought to put our remark in such a form as to say that , if she did not mean a stone wall , we have no idea what she did mean . But supposing she did mean a stone wall , how poetic is the manner in which she describes it ; - how much more charming is the impression which she produces upon the reader 's mind ! Why , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , according to this way of putting things , five gardens and at least two mural parapets . But those worthy men and women of the former generations , who lived there in so much comfort for so many years -- we are truly sorry for their ignorance-lived and died under the erroneous idea that those parapets were mere walls . What simple , ordinary people those ancestors of ours were ! We do not wonder they left us no kiheritance of poetry . Again , the authoress , in alluding to the stream mentioned in the last quoted extract , says : " At one point it exhibited a slight cascade , and at another seemed to have a lake-like termination , neither of which gave the slightest indication of the torrentfury of which it was once in a year capable , when , swollen and disturbed by the attrition of the dissolving spring-ices , ! it rushed onward like a maniac . " We have , on many occasions , seen-as many others to whom we commend this volume doubtless have-this small stream , which , to us who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem anything but a very small stream , and // we gladly confirm the testimony of the distinguished writer , that it has never , at those times , " given the slightest indication of torrent-fury . " But we were riot there , we suppose , on the appointed anniversary , and we scarcely could expcct that to an ordinary and respectful visitor from abroad , it would act " like a maniac . " Again , speaking of the grounds and the animals , she says : " Two fair cows , with coats brushed to a satin sleekness , ruminated at will , and filled large pails with creamy nectar . " Also : " Our poultry peopled their territory with a prolific zeal , and munificently cave us their eggs , their offspring , and themselves . " l The italics are ours . And again : " Snowy turkeys strutted amid the green turf , those of the masculine genus spreading their broad plumage with a peacock 's vanity . " We wonder , as we read the book , whether the noble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his grounds and among his self sacrificing and ruminating domestic animals on a pair of high stilts . The volume , unfortunately , does not give us information on this important point . On pages 273-5 , in the same chapter with the passages just cited , she has the following : " It was accordant with the rural element in the character of us both , her . self and her husband , that a portion of the family subsistence should be drawn from our own cultivated soil . This we considered both congenial to health and that consciousness of independence which is one of the pleasantest parts of a life of agriculture . " This is poetical certainly , for in prose it means-in our own case , for instance , it would mean-we concluded to get our vegetables from our own garden , instead of buying them , because they were cheaper , better , and more easily obtained than those in market . Again : " Our trees of the peach , pear and apple , apricot and cherry genus , were so exuberant in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! could they be always expended . " // will readily occur to our readers as one which they have themselves not unfrequently adopted ; quite a common and prosaic thing to their minds , no doubt . And yet here it is set forth in the following striking language : " The resource was in casting them to a class of retainers , whose name , for some reason or other , perhaps for none at all , is scarcely admissible to ears polite . " It ought to be said , however , that the authoress elsewhere defends this useful animal against the common prejudice , with kindness , indeed , but again in rather glowing words : " I could never understand why it should be an offense to delicacy to utter the name of an animal , which the Evangelists have recorded on their pages as plunging in a dense herd down a steep place into the sea , and perishing in the waters . " We have once or twice inserted an exclamation mark at the close of Mrs. Sigourney 's sentences : we think at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader 's feeling in view of the remarkable aptness and force of this reference to the New Testament . " Such treatment , " she goes on to say , " is peculiarly ungrateful in a people who allow this scorned creature to furnish a large part of their subsistence , to swell the gains of commerce , and to share with the monarch of ocean the honor of lighting their evening lamp . " " Our creed in this matter is more inconsistent than that of the Jews-for we do not hesitate to profit by his death , though we have made his life despicable . " And once again , alluding to the interior life of this noble mansion , she remarks : " Soon after our removal to this delightful abode , my husband confided to me that , from some obstructions in the course of mercantile prosperity , the inquiry su2gests itself here , whether the authoress means that Mr. Sigourney failed , but we are unable to say ; he was , evidently , obstructed , but as we have never known any merchant whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell precisely what his condition was , added to the expenses of building , which are wont to exceed their original estimate , a system of retrenchment would he expedient , perhaps imperative . Concurring with his proposition , I sought how it might best be put in force , without involving palpable inconsistency in the habitants of so costly a dwelling ; and having seen some examples of a successful union of economy with hospitality , determined to become a learner and disciple . I steadfastly set myself against waste in every domestic department , and also to prolong the existence of all garments , by repair or transmigration . " Many , if not most , of our readers , as we suppose , in their childhood , endured what they often considered the hard fate of wearing the old clothes of their parents , or elder brothers or sisters , which had been made over as new fdr themselves . IDid they ever dream that this process , which they grieved over // and the end of which they hoped and longed for as the time of beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of these garments by transmigration ? " But we forbear . If the doubter is nut convinced by all this which we have just quoted from a single letter , and by all that we had cited before , that our authoress was , indeed , gifted with poetic genius , we bid him read the book for himself ; and then if its four hundred pages do not remove all his doubts , all we can say is , that he must be in the depths of prejudice . We confess that our doubts are entirely gone , and we record the fact , with pleasure , on these pages of the New Englanderwith especial pleasure , because we once lived in Norwich , and the good poetess bewails the little appreciation of her writings in that well-remembered town . In summing up her literary career , near the close of the volume , she says : " Letters of appreciation have reached me from crowned heads-from the King of Prussia , the Empress of Russia , and the late Queen of France ; marks of favor from nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more animating , from monarchs in the realm of mind . I have felt humbled by such distinctions , as transcending my merits . Some degree of chastening counterpoise has arisen from the marked indifference of my native city , which I have loved almost with the fervor of the ancient Jews for Zion . Neither by word nor smile can I recollect that she has fostered the mental labors of the child who went out from her fair borders , leaving her heart behind . Sweet hospitalities she extends to me , but in the point where I yearn for her sympathy , or would fain lay my honors at her feet , she keeps silence . " And then she adds-evidently stumbling upon the fatal mistake of both recording and making the severest criticism ever passed upon her : " I wrote , by request ; a lyric to be sung at the anniversary of her favorite academy , which the chief musician scornfully declined to perform , and it wa* read among the j*ro*e exerci8e&amp; " The italics are our own . With especial pleasure , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a poet . We hope our course will be some slight compensation to her memory for the scornful action of the aforesaid Norwich musician , for , as he placed her lyric poem among the prose pieces , we on the other hand class her prose narrative among the works of poetry ; and speaking of them both " with a word and a smile , " we // make them the means of finally deciding the question , Which has been so long and so fruitlessly discussed . And now , having indulged ourselves in some remarks upon the style of our authoress , which our readers , we are sure , will admit the justice of , if they read the volume , we turn to the other leading question that was proposed for discussion at the outset . This question has reference to the work and character of the distinguished woman , who is at once the author and subject of this volume . It is always , after the earthly career of any person is ended , the most interesting inquiry which we can raise-what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been passing before us , and has now passed out of our sight ; what has been accomplished , and what was the hope at the end ? As we read these letters , which tell the story of the life we are now considering , we have a full and most pleasing answer to this all-important inquiry . Mrs. Sigourney 's life may almost be said to be symbolized by that journey in the Hartford stage , with its beginning and its ending , to which we have already alluded . Born and living through the period of her childhood and youth in Norwich , as we have seen , she took her course , in her early womanhood , to what she calls the semi-capital of the State , and in hartford she lived and labored to the end . The narrative of her course thus seems , as it were , to be naturally divided into two parts by this eight hours ' ride , which , though often taken , she only describes as she remembered it from the earliest experience . We have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed hurriedly over the muain events of her life in the former of these two cities . The story now carries us to her residence in the latter ; and as we speak of her work and character , we shall pass it briefly in review . She commenced her career in Hartford as the head of a small school for girls , in the establishmuent of which she was greatly assisted by the late widelyknown and highly-honored benefactor of that city , Daniel Wadsworth , Esq . The " young ladies " who attended this school , at least at the beginning of its history , were , as we judge , few in numbers , and from the families of Mr. Wadsworth 's friends . They were all , if we may make our inference // from several passages in the volume , quite young in years . But as time moved on , and her success became manifest , she enlarged her company so as to include those who were at a somewhat higher stage of development . The chapter on her " educational remembrances " is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , as it is also one of the simpler ones in its style . The proof of her skill and many qualifications as a teacher is clearly seen in the explanation which she gives of her method , as well as in the reasonable and advanced ideas of teaching which she evidently cherished . We must remember that this was fifty years ago-for she went to Hartford in 1813 or 1814  --  and was , accordingly , before the improved system of modern times in the domain of teaching had begun to be known or thought of* a system , indeed , which is full of defects , and in which everything is to a highly injurious extent , in our judgment , sacrificed to mere rules and routine , but which , beyond all donbt , as a whole is much superior to that of our fathers and grandfathers . Mrs. Sigourney was in advance of her age . She was , as we think she fully proves by her story , a valuable , inspiring , interesting , self-sacrificing , and loving ir*str**ctor ; ever considering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without at all overstraining or too early straining their mental powers . She seems to have studied continually the capabilities of each mind under her charge , and to have kept ever in view the duties belonging to the sphere of woman into which they must afterward enter . Her system of rewards and penalties , considering the age of her scholars at the first , was , as we think , a good one-not one , indeed , that could be universally adopted in larger schools or among all classes of children , but very judicious , and well calculated to secure the end in view , where the young girls were few in numbers and were all members of friendly families , arid thus almost as the children of one household . She remarks , also , upon the especial pains she took to encourage those amiable dispositions which are so essential to the true womanly character , and tells of the simple way which she determined upon to excite emulation among her pupils in regard to this matter . The votes of all the scholars were takell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the common // judgment upon the question , as to which one among them had most uniformly and perfectly manifested kindness and gentleness in all her intercourse with her associates . These votes , which were sealed ballots , were to be given , as she charged them , conscientiously , and , in such a class , doubtless they were so given ; and then the votes being counted , the one who had received the largest number was crowned by the rest as " their chosen Queen , the loved of all . " We might cite passages from this chapter , did our space allow , but it is scarcely necessary for the purpose which we have in view . Suffice it to say , that , though she is her own herald , we read this interesting letter , describing the work of her first five years in iHartford , with the feeling that she did her work well , and that she rightfully looked back upon it , over the half century that had passed , with heartfelt satisfaction . The same feeling seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better means of judging than any mere reader of the volume can have , and who trace back their own history to the early times when they were themselves her pupils ; for , year by year , for forty-five years , they met together to celebrate with their honored teacher the days of their association in the school-room , and to repeat their generous testimony to the good she had bestowed upon them . Mrs. Sigourney seems to have been born a teacher , quite as certainly , to say the least , as she was born a poet . Even in those early days , when , as we have seen , at the age of from three to six years Thought and Criticism were her nightly visitors , she tells us that there came to her mind " vivid pencilings of the delight , dignity , and glory of a school-mistress , " and that thereupon she " arranged her dolls in various classes , instructing them not only in the scanty knowledge she had herself attained , but boldly exhorting and lecturing them on the higher moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years that followed , until while she was still quite young , she began the work , and with two scholars -- the only two she was able to secure after much solicitation-she established her first school in one of the rooms of her father 's house . An impulse which retains its power so long a time , and in spite of such discourage*nents , is generally a clear indication of the fitness of the mind for that work to which // the impulse urges it . And surely , in her case , this fitness was abundantly proved in after years , by the success of her labors in Hartford which we have just set forth . As we pass on from this brief notice of her educational recollections , to consider the subsequent portions of her life , we pause a moment to refer to the suggestion which she makes , as the result of her experience and observation as a teacher , that the " love of arithmetic is not indigenous in the female mind . " She claims for herself , indeed , that it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pupils it was otherwise . We had not ourselves supposed this , which is thus given as her conclusion , to be the fact in general , but we do not know that it can be considered a very strange thing if it be so , for the slow processes of calculation may be somewhat foreign to the quickness with which woman 's mind loves to move forward to its results . As for ourselves , we are ready to say , that we have great patience with all persons , whether women or men , who do not give themselves enthusiastically to this particular study , for the great privilege and blessing of the freedom of mature years , as compared with the bondage of childhood under tutors an 'd governors , has often seemed to us largely to consist in two things-first , in the fact that it is no longer necessary to distress ourselves about punctuation , as we once did ; and secondly , in the fact that we shall never again , during our earthly pilgrimage , be conipelled to tell how long , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not run quite so fast , it will take the dog to catch the hare . We always pitied the hare when we were at school , and had no sympathy with the dog ; and now that we have long since entered on the busy work of the world , we have a sincere and almost daily satisfaction-though we confess it is not unmingled even yet with astonishinent-that most men are necessarily so oc*upied with other things , as even to be oblivious of the fact that the dog is still in the pursuit , and that some men-men too of high character and of great service to society-are in such ignorance of arithmetic as to be unable to answer this question , so perplexing , and , as it once seemed , so absolutely essential to any useful development of the mental powers . // Our authoress was now at the age of twenty-eight . She had settled in her own mind the great question of duty to remain unmarried , on account of the advancing years and consequent dependent conditioii of her parents , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the work of her life . But the future is little known to any of us , and certainly it is little known to those who are only twenty-eight . Destiny , from the beginning , had been pointing in a direction quite opposite to her thought , and of course , her thought finally turned round and pointed just where destiny ordered . " The blind archer , " as she says , " bided his time . " When the time came , he shot his arrow , and with surprising effect . We have rarely heard of a more sudden or fatal case . It seems to us , as related , beyond almost anything in real life , that has ever come within the circle of our knowledge . But we leave her to tell her own story . After having spoken of her resolutions above alluded to , and of the fact that she had resisted the offers of several clerical gentlemen , and even " fascinations of a more ambitious character , " she says : " Nevertheless as I plodded my way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most expressive black eyes sometimes encountered mine , and spoke unutterable things . They were the property of a gentleman of striking physiognomy and the elegant manners of the olden school . Their dialect might ! l not have made a lasting impression on one whose every thought and faculty were bespoken by her daily occupation ; but ere long a letter came !  --  a letter of touching eloquence and the fairest chirography . From this there was no escape . ! l It was like a grapplin*-iron , not to be evaded . Wherever I turned , its words followed me as livina creatures-an image of the wheel seen by the entranced prophet , full of eyes , that gazed wherever he went . To love-letters I had been no stranger , yet nothing like this appeal had caused such perturbation and captivity of thought . Its writer I had occasionally met in select parties , with his wife , a being of angelic loveliness and beauty , who had gone to a higher and congenial sphere . " ! We ask our readers to notice carefully this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person who surpassed the clergymen previously referred to , and scattered the serious and determined resolutions . It occurs to us that if any of these disappointed clerical gentlemen are still liviiig ,  --  ( who were not only less attractive than the predestined conqueror was , but even so far less attractive , that , between their level and his , there were others having " fascinations of // a more ambitious character , " and if they have opportunity to trace out the details of the picture of their successful rival ; which is here drawn by the one whose " slight bark , " as she says , " though sometimes veering " towards them , was yet " guided to keep its pole-star in view , " ) - they must ever hereafter have a most becomingly humble estimation of themselves . But we forbear to make further comment upon the passage , except to say that the prophet Ezekiel , we presume , never thought of such an application of his vision  --  and to protest against the publication of such a story of her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully finished her earthly career . Even if the authoress had requested its publication , we think her surviving friends ought to have interposed , for surely she could not , six months after her death , have desired it . In due season she was married to the gentleman , a portion of whose property was the pair of black eyes , and one of whose chief recommendations seems to have been his fair chirography ; and she settles down in his elegant mansion as the wife of Mr. Charles Sigourney . The story of her life as related to him seems to us to be skillfully and admirably told . The question involuntarily rises in our mind , when we come to the record of his death a long time afterward , whether the eyes had always during those years shone as beautifully and kindly as they did at first , and whether chirography had , after all , proved to be the noblest qualification of the manly life . But it is a question which finds no answer in the book , and we find ourselves asking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , in a case of so sudden , and as it would seem to us , at least at the beginning , so groundless an attachment , we can hardly escape the desire ' to know the result in after times . A woman 's love is the noblest thing in this selfish world ; for it gives itself wholly , confidingly , without a single doubt , and for all time , to the man who joins his hand with hers , and then , even if the long years that follow are but the continual proof that he is not what she thought him on her marriage day , she buries his every failing from the eyes of the harsh and curious world . We honor the woman who writes these letters , whatever may have been the ending // of the early dream . And if we smile with our readers at the story of her commencing love , it is for the reason that we can not help it ,  --  and this , not , indeed , because it is the story of her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we smile , it is with a generous feeling of true respect for the way in which the love guides the story afterward . After the account of the marriage , the chapter on " Domestic Life " gives the description of her dwelling , some passages from which we have already cited , and then relates pleasantly the ordinary daily duties of a New England housekeeper . The birth of her children , and the removal to her house of her parents , who left their old home in Norwich at Mr. Sigourney 's suggestion , filled her mind as well as her time with new cares and thoughts . For eighteen years her life passed on in this quiet way , marked , like every woman 's life , with so little that can be told of to the world , and yet with so much that is noble and pure ,  --  with so much that is full of kindness , and is quite as essential to the world 's happiness as any of the more conspicuous works on which men pride themselves . How strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every life , the richest part , and that which works its way in sweetest and gentlest influences into other lives , and helps them grow in all goodness toward the kingdom of heaven , is the part which is never opened to the world 's view-we always deceive ourselves and measure true glory only by the outward and visible things ! And so we often or always fail to honor the life of quiet service as we ought , and even lose the beautiful development of the inner soul in our all-absorbing pursuit of fame . The " Lapse of Years " - for this is the title of the next chapter-brought many changes ;  --  the change of residence , the change of circumstances , and the change of death as it came to those around her , until finally she was left alone , to work out the rest of her appointed mission and to wait for the end . These years brought her the great privilege of a visit to Europe ; great to every educated man or woman , but especially so to one who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors and poets in her own person , was thereby enabled , as she entered their own homes , to commune with // them as a kindred spirit . But the " pleasant memories " of those " pleasant lands " beyond the ocean , she says , she will not attempt to recall on her present pages , since they have been already recorded in another volume , whose title , e4ressed in these very words , makes known how greatly she enjoyed the privilege . The latest season of her life is then pictured in a letter full both of thankfulness for the past and hope for the future  --  a letter which opens with the heartiest farewell , addressed to the friend to whom she had been writing so many times , while it closes with thoughts most characteristic of herself ,  --  as hopeful and grateful as her life had been . " Behind me stretch the green pastures and still waters , by which I have been led all my days . Around , is the lingering of hardy flowers and fruits that bide the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley between seems not worthy to come into remembrance . Past , present , and future , concur like three harmonies . May their grateful ascription never end ! " The passing of the " shadowy valley between " needed the pen of another to tell its story . It was filled with gentle ministrations and the ever-returning round of daily duties , until she gradually lost the life of earth and entered upon that of heaven . Such was her work-one that was so faithfully and well accomplished , that it deserves to be spoken of with all honor by those who read her recorded history . Of her character alone it remains to say a few words . We only intend , as indeed we are only able , to speak of this as we discover it from the pages of the volume before us . Her one great weakness , as it here displays itself , seems to have been vanity . It was , however , a harmless kind of vanity , which not only was not injurious to any one else , but even was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , as it was with a prominent man , whom we knew in former years , who seemed to be free from all unkindness of feeling or jealousy , largely because he thought himself a little in advance of all others . She was not overbearing , or even exactly self-conceited in the ordinary sense . But she unwaveringly and always felt that she was the leading woman in any company , wheresoever she might be present . This was an accepted and fundamental truth of life // with her , concerning which there was neither any doubt in her own mind , nor , as she supposed , in the mind of any other . Accordingly , she felt as kindly toward everybody around her as it was possible for a human soul to feel . Why be jealous of another-why fail to take pleasure in the success and elevation of another , if the limit of such elevation be a point which is just below oneself ? It is impossible to do otherwise than " rejoice with them that do rejoice , " when the soul is perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does no harm to ourselves , for a person who is always overflowing with good will toward us and good wishes for us , to be resting in contentinent in view of his own surpassing greatness , we only smile at the rich and rosy self-approbation of such an one . We pass our own judgment indeed upon him , as we do upon every other , but we never desire to break the bubble of his vanity . We can not help thinking , however , that there was some other quality mingled in Mrs. Sigourney 's vanity , or something else closely united with it . If the book we are examining shows anything upon its very face it is artificiality of style , and we must believe that a person who could write , as the author of this book writes , must have had a certain artificial element pervading her life in no inconsiderable degree . We can easily realize how , she might have contemplated her rural mansion and fair domain with satisfaction , but we confess our inability to see how a mind of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself or to others , as she has done . Instead of living quietly on the earth , as ordinary people do , it seems to us she must have been , a large portion of the time , in the upper regions of the air , or , if we may be permitted to use , in regard to her own inner life , an expression which she applies to her domestic animals , we think she must have " leaped and luxuriated " more than most of us common mortals do . But we gladly turn aside from her weaknesses . Her kindness to all was as conspicuous as the harmless vanity with which it was connected . She had , beyond all question , a kind heart by nature . This gift had been given to her at the beginning in large measure , and it overflowed in its fullness on every // 355 side , through all the years . It is really striking to see how in terms of generous commendation she speaks of every one of her own sex , whom she has occasion P* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toucey , who is described as " having continued " from the time when she was one of the authoress ' pupils " to advance in loveliness and intellectual attainment , having been distinguished at the court of our nation , where for years her lot was cast , by those graces of manner and conversation that lent attraction to her example of piety , " to the faithful black woman who lived with her so long , and the account of whose services and excellent qualities she closes with the words- " Thus was I favored with this heart-service for a period of twenty-five years ; as long as age and disease permitted her to make any effort . Her image is still vivid before me , and I cherish it with tenderness . She was to me as my own flesh and blood . " Her early teachers are praised , almost without a word of slightest disparagement , and her chance acquaintances are represented only in the most pleasing light . With a similar feeling , when she comes to commend the successive clergymen who had ministered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended , she seems to think that all others must be likewise commended , and , with a sentence or two for each one , she shows the good will that abounds towards all . She entered the Episcopal Church because her husband was a member of it , but , unlike many others who become Episcopalians by the converting process of marriage , she did not forget that there are other Christian churches . " The longer I live , " she says , " the more inclined I am deeply to regret that those differences of doctrine and form , which must always exist , should be permitted to disturb their Christian charity who embrace the precepts of the same Gospel , and pray to dwell at last lovingly in the presence of one Redeemer , in purer light and perfect unity . " And her unaffected and warm-hearted recognition of past favors is seen in the mingled reverence and love with which she recalls the thought of her old benefactress in Norwich , as well as in the following words , wherein she make* reference to the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her success in Hartford " If the partakers of // Heaven 's bliss are interested in aught that thrills these our hearts of clay , may he inhale the perfume of that warm gratitude which the lapse of almost half a century has neither dampened nor repressed . " Her kindness was also exhibited as constantly in deeds as it was in words . She seems to have been always thoughtful in the way of little attentions to others  --  the little things that pleasantly recall friends to mind  --  and for the poor and for children she was always ready with needful and helpful gifts . From the year 1811 , her daughter remarks , " when , from her engagement as a teacher , she first had an income of her own , the plan was marked out that one-tenth of all that she received should be given in charity  --  a plan from which she never deviated throughout her life , except to enlarge the measure of her gifts . She had proved what Goldsmith calls the luxury of doing good , ' and desired , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Sigourney , as the volume presents her to our thoughts , was a woman of much strength of character ,  --  of such a combination of gentleness and firmness as adapted her for the work to which she gave her earlier years ,  --  and of such uprightness as to command the respect of those who knew her in the intimacy of friendship . The entire absence of all words of censure on the part of those who were associated with her during her long years of residence in Hartford , is the best commendation of her prudence and forbearance and charity in her own home ; while the public honors showed at the time of her burial , prove that she died in universal esteem for her private and social virtues . Two things more were noticeable in her character , and they will serve to complete our view of it . She was an enthusiastic , diligent worker in the sphere which was assigned to her , Or which she had chosen for herself ; and a joyful , trustful , thankful follower of Christ . The chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows-whatever different persons may say of the excellence of her poetry-that her 's was no idle or inactive mind , while the amusing list of requests that were presented to her from every quarter , for every kind of service , is a scarcely less convincing proof that she was always ready to // do whatever was within the limits of her power . And as for her Christian life ; from the time when , at three years of age , she says of herself that she felt no fear , since the " Father in Heaven , to whom the last words of closing day were said , seemed near , " and she " fell asleep as on His protecting arm , " until , in the closing days of her life , as she drew near to the age of seventy-five , she called to her thought the words , " In the fiuinting away of my life , I will think upon Jehovah , and He shall send forth strength for me from His Holy Temple ; " no doubt or apprehension appears to have entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of God 's gifts and of Divine beauty to her thought , and she herself seemed , as one of His own children , to be the object of His constant and infinite love . We confess that , after our hearty and good-natured laugh , we closed the volume for the last time , with a tender regard for the gifted authoress , and with a sincere joy in the confident belief that another soul had proved the truth of the eternal promise , and had entered into the great and glorious company of the ransomed ones . Our review of the volume has been like the impression produced upon us by its perusal . We laughed at first , and perhaps immoderately . The stilted and absurd style is beyond anything we have read for years . The geese are swans , mdeed , and the roses rosier than any which nature paints . It is , we are bound to say , simply ridiculous to speak of stone walls as " mural parapets , " anj the making over of old clothing as a " prolonging of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than ridiculous to use such language soberly , in letters professing to be written in the simplicity and confidence of private friendship . It is even an outrage on all p*opriety , to put forth such a book as a proper one for young writers of either sex to imitate , because the authoress was a distinguished poet . And if criticism is worth anything , or the pages of a journal like this have any purpose in the world , such a style ought to be sharply rebuked . We have laughed because we could not help it . We have set forth before our readers what they will find on every page of the volume , in abounding measure , and have tried to give them something of // our appreciation of the ludicrous element in it . But we pro- ' test once more , that we have written the earlier portion of our Article with no ill-will-with not the slightest intermingling of unkindliness in our joyous laugh . And we trust that the latter portion has been hearty and serious enough in its appreciation and approbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she did , to prove even to her own friends the truth of our protestation . We commend the volume to every reader of these pages . He will be amused by the style ; and entertained by the account of the olden time ; and charmed by the good nature of the authoress ; and softened into tenderness of soul by the story of the way in which God led her home to Himself , through all the comforts and trials-through all the joys and sorrowsthrough all the discipline and experience of a long and wellspent life . We add a single word Tuore . Mrs. Sigourney , we believe , was by no means deserving of the censure thrown upon her poetry by so many persons in our country . She was not , as we frankly confess , a poet of a very high order . She unconsciously shows , even in these Letters , the inferiority of her own poetry by her occasional introduction of brief passages from those who have written under a true inspiration . She has a sameness in all her productions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she does of the Muses . She has committed the almost intolerable evil of publishing a volume containing from fifty to one hundred obituary sonnets . In a word , she is Mrs. Sigourney . But she was one of the first among American women to venture within the poetic field ; and , while she has led the way , she deserves not only the praise awarded to a pioneer , but the praise of a fair measure of success . We think even the Norwich people might well honor their own prophet , by acknowledging her gifts ; - though , at the same time , we can scarcely believe that the " boy nature " will ever become so " quiescent " in us , as to prevent us from telling of or laughing over the melancholy issue of the encounter between her lyric poem and the scornful Norwich musician .
