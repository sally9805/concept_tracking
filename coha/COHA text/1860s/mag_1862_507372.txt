NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . No . CXL1X ,  --  OCTOBER , 1862-VOL . XXV . THE PIONEERS OF KENTUCKY . qwq trict Court for the Southern District of New York . VOT . XXV. - No. 149. - Go // qwq of the night . The same conduct was continued until Mr. C was delivered to the British authorities at Maiden . From that time he never saw or could hear of his nohie benefactor ; hut he always cherished his memory with feelings of the deepest gratitude . We think we may challenge any historian of civilized warfare to point out a more striking instance of generosity than this . Certainly a darker scene was never relieved hy a brighter gleam . There is another little incident we have heard related by a venerable lady of our acquaintance , which displays a similar forbearance on the part of an Indian ; and which we will here narrate , because it presents one of the very few instances of reciprocal forbearance on the part of the whites to an enemy who had fallen into their hands ; and , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian but a horse-thief : which latter class of criminals the settlers hated as cordially , and slew as remorselessly , as they did the former . The lady , when a girl of eighteen or nineteen , resided with her father on the outskirts of the settlements at a period when the older parts of the State had become well popu hated , and the Indians , intimidated by the frequent expeditions into their own country , had ceased to cross the Ohio in large bodies , but singly , or in small parties , prowled along the frontiers with the design rather of plundering than slaying ; seldom hdsitating , however , to take a scalp when the opportunity offered , so that the whites still thought it dangerous to move far from home without company , but at the same time regarded their cabins as perfectly secure from attack , except in very isolated situations where succor could not be readily obtained . Miss M , therefore , was in the habit of rambling fearlessly into the fields near her father 's house for the purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pony . One evening she went forth about sunset , and remained for an hour standing upon a log caressing the gentle animal , throwing her arms round his neck . stroking his face with her handkerchief , and talking to him as young ladies are apt to do with a pet of any description . Next morning , to her great grief , the pony was missing , and an examination showed that he had been stolen by an Indian . A small party , consisting of her INDIAN AND VONY. // brothers and a few neighbors , quickly started in pursuit of the robber , and late in the evening came in sight of a single young warrior standing on a log with his arm round the neck of his prize-stroking his face with a piece of cloth , and talking to him in a soft girlish voice just as he had seen the young lady doing the evening before . The pursuers , guessing the truth and moved to a most unusual degree of clemency , instead of shooting the thief down in his tracks took the pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been lying under the very log on which Miss M stood while caressing her pet . And his savage fancy bad been so much captivated by the graceful tableau that he had forborne to injure her though within arms reach for an hour , and was trying to re-enact the scene himself when his enemies came upon him . Two men , Boone and Harrod , are generally regarded as representatives of the border populations of their times , and in some superficial points they were so . But in mental power , elevation of sentiment , they were as different from the mass of their contemporaries , and as superior to them in every moral quality , as George Washington was ' to the majority , of those who aided him in the Revolutionary struggle . Except in superficial things , indeed , no great man can be a representative one ; for the very fact that he is great implies that he is exceptional , and he is only great so far as he is exceptional . Those who would find representatives of the Indian fighters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M'Intosh and Wetzel . But Boone and Harrod were remarkable for their magnanimity toward their redskinned antagonists . The latter in particular was not surpassed in this respect by any hero of chivalry . He was in every essential a knight sans pear et sans reprocke ; and his life was a true romance of the forest . Born it is not certainly known where , ignorant of letters but intelligent from observation , with a spirit as lofty and as gentle as that of Sidney himself ; he appeared among the earliest settlers of the country  --  or rather preceded them , for when Boone came first to Boonesborough Harrod 's cabin already marked the site of Harrodsburg - and , after spending his prime of manhood in protecting the lives and property without deigning to grasp the immense fortune his own enterprise had placed within reach , at last , when all around him was peace and prosperity , when an affectionate family made his home pleasant , and age was beginning to silver his jetty curls and steal the vigor from his stalwart tread-when it was natural that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he bad shown so much kindness , and honored by the commonwealth he had helped to build up-he suddenly plunged into the forest , and disappeared as mysteriously as he had come . The beginning and end of his life no man knows , nor can any one point out the spot where his cradle stood or his bones repose . Nature seldom produces such men as James Harrod . lIe was truly one of her noblemen. and art had no part in his formation . Unable to write his name , he succeeded in placing it permanently among the most beloved and renowned of his adopted State . Never seeking command , he was always called to leadership by the public voice in times of difficulty and danger . Perfectly candid and honest , he turned with disgust from the strifes and intrigues of party to the more honorable warfare with the wild beasts and wilder men of the forests . Entire personal freedom was his ruling passion ; and he indemnified himself for even the ordinary restrictions of society by indulging in long solitary excursions into the wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutely refused to wear the shackles of party-discipline and official propriety . Hence , except as Colonel of Militia , his name is not found among the dignitaries of his time-his want of education , indeed , incapacitating him for most civil employments . It was as a neighbor and friend that he was most distinguished ; and in these simple capacities he performed most of those services that have joined his name with those of Boone and Clarke , in a triumvirate which the people of Kentucky still delight to honor as the three great founders of their State . Let the best-informed historian of Kentucky tell why this man was so highly admired , and by what arts he gained so much of the people 's love : " At Harrodsburg , " says Mr. Marshall , " news was brought him that the bcidians had surprised a party four miles away and killed a man . Boys , ' said he , let us go and beat the rascals ; ' and accordingly be snatches his gun and runs at the head of his party . He hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his rifle , repairs to the forest , kills the needful supply , and presently offers it to the sufferers . A plow-horse is in the range  --  a pasture without bounds . The owner , not yet used to the woods , and apprehensive of the danger attending a search , says to Harrod , My horse has not come up , so I ca n't plow to-day . ' What kind of a horse is yours ? ' The description is given , Harrod departs , and in a little while the horse is driven up to the owner 's door . If , " continues the same author , " be who leads a party can be said to want ambition , James Harrod seems to have been free from that passion . Simple , frugal , candid , and complying , seeming to command because always foremost in danger ; utterly destitute of art he nevertheless had n party-not because he wanted it , but because it wanted him ; for whenever men are surrounded by danger they instinctively seek a leader , ea. pecially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite companion , the man in whose courage , skill , and perseverance they have the- most implicit faith . " This is the testimony of one who knew Harrod personally , and who is in general very niggardly in awarding praise to his contemporaries . Mr. Webber relates an incident of one of // Ilarrod 's solitary rambles into the wilderness which we have never seen mentioned elsewhere , and which strikingly illustrates the chivalrous character of this hero of the backwoods : Being on one occasion hotly pressed by a party of Indians he plunged into the Miami , then in a flooded state , and holding his rifle above water with one hand , and swimming with the other , succeeded in reaching the other shore untouched by the bullets which closely flew about his bead . Two of the savages as bold as himself followed , but the foremost , when in midstream , received a shot and disappeared with a stifled yell beneath the rushing waters , while the other , warned by his comrade 's fate , turned hack , and the chase was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the river a few miles below the point where this encounter had taken place , he saw something struggling in an eddy , and was not a little astonished when he beheld a naked warrior draw himself painfully upon a pile of drift-wood , where , having with difficulty fixed himself he proceeded to apply a rude bandage to his shoulder , down which the blood was flowing from a deep rifle-shot wound . Rightly conjecturing this to be the same Indian whom he had lately shot , who had contrived to save himself by clinging to some piece of floating timber , and moved by an impulse such as few white men of his time would have understood , he resolved to lend what assistance he could to his disabled adversary . But bow to approach him was the first difficulty ; for Harrod well knew that if he should present himself in the guise of an enemy the savage would not hesitate to plunge again into the stream rather than allow a foeman the honor of carrying away his scalp as a trophy of victory . Stealing cautiouslv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank a few yards from where the unconscious object of his kindness sat , he laid aside his gun , knife , and hatchet , and then slipped suddenly into view with his arms extended , in token of peace , and to show that he was without any weapon . At the first sight of him the savage started in act to plunge into the stream , hut a second glance assuring him that no immediate hostility was intended , he forbore his purpose , but remained watching with the jealous gaze of a disabled wild beast the stranger 's approach , ready at the first sus HARROD AND THE WARRIOR . // picious motion to seek death in the foaming river rather than await it at the hands of an enemy . At length the encouraging gestures and open , kindly countenance of the other convinced him that nothing unfriendly was intended , when he suffered himself to he approached . Harrod finding him almost fainting from cold and loss of blood , gently assisted him to the shore , where he dressed his hurt with a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , bore him several miles to a beautiful little cave , which he had discovered years before , and used as a lodging in inclement weather during his excursions into this region . Here he continued to feed and nurse his late foeman as long as he required such attentions , and finally dismissed him in safety to his tribe . Such was James Harrod to his friends ; and -n better test of character-such was he to his enemies . Daniel Boone , the twin-founder of Kentucky , is one of those men who are much talked about and little understood  --  or rather , greatly misunderstood . He is generally regarded as a mere rover of the woods , who fled thither to escape the contact of his fellow-men , and happened to stumble on fame by the mere accident of being the first to settle in the country watered by the lower tributaries of the Ohio , and who possessed no extraordinary powers save endurance and courage . Even his panegyrist , Governor James Morehead , in an anniversary oration at Boonesborough , cites him as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a man of no uncommon mental endowments "  --  a very striking example , indeed , if it were true ; but no man ever acquired the voluntary obedience of his fellows , and retained it for any length of time , without superior powers of some sort . Our laws may call all men equal , but a higher law forbids ; and by that eternal law was Daniel Boone invested with the office of leader of men Even among ' intelligent persons Boone has been too much undervalued ; because through a long course of national prosperity the principal business of our public men has been to talk well , and we have , in our admiration of this faculty , come to look with small respect upon that inarticulate kind of intellect which reveals itself in acts and not in words , And the consequence has been that the workers have left the conduct of public affairs to the talkers , and turned their energies into the channels of private enterprise , which accordingly show a degree of energy and success almost unknown in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its fury , and our people stand aghast at the sudden ruin of all their towering hopes ; when they see that the talkers have theorized and philosophized us almost to the giving up our pretensions to our national existence , and begin to look around for men of action to lead them through the danger , we find these leaders stepping forth from private stations to which their voiceless energies had been confined , and that scarcely one of their names has ever been a party watch-word . And this , instead of a suspicious , is really a propitious omen ; for while the work of the country lay in making great roads and other enterprises of a private nature , these men did that work ; and now , by the same law of their natures , when the great work of the nation is war and government , they come forth to do that . We have learned by a fearful lesson that mere institutions , however good , are no safeguards against personal ambition and national degeneracy ; let us pray , then , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true vicegerent on eartha great man : not a great talker-we have had enough of them  --  but a great doer . This Magazine has already given* a biographical sketch of Boone , detailing the main incidents of his life , and although quoting Morehead 's inadequate estimate of his character , presenting as a whole a fair estimate of the man . In that article the commonly accredited account of the Battle of Blue Licks is given in brief ; and the present writer , in a former paper , has alluded to this account , rather by way of illustration than with any confidence in its correctness . Indeed it always seemed to him incredible that a body of men , most of them veterans in Indian warfare , could , merely by a taunt , be so far deprived not only of their habitual caution but of common sens&lt; as to rush pell-mell into a trap whose existence had been pointed out by one who knew the whole ground , and could read the signs of an ambuscade as easily as he could a printed page . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole army into momentary insanity always seemed to us very much like one of those excuses which national pride is sure to invent in order to hide its own humiliation . At length this suspicion was confirmed by a letter that appeared in one of our later historical collections , and which , though partially suppressed by the editor , still contained enough to prove that the whole disaster was attributable , not to any rash but chivalrous impulse of outraged gallantry , but to the most commonplace and unromantic misconduct on the part of both men and officers . As this statement was said to be derived from Boone , who was in the fight ; from Clarke , who , as commander-in-chief , must have been well informed as to all its particulars ; and from Kenton , who had often conversed with the survivors of the massacre , it certainly deserves to be heard in opposition to the received account ; and when once so heard , we think there will be no doubt as to which will command the greater credit . In order to render a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to give the reader some general idea of the field on which it occurred , which , as its topographical features are very marked , may be easily done . At the place called the " Lower Blue Lick , ' the Licking River , in its general northwesterly course , encountering a spur of the great mountOctober , 18b9 , // am bed of Eastern Kentucky , sweeps sharply off to the left for more than a mile , whence , after doubling the point of the promontory , it flows back , along the further side , to a point almost exactly opposite to that of its original deflection ; and then , by another abrupt turn , resumes its general course toward the north*vest - thus forming a very elliptical " horseshoe bend . " The inclosed area was entirely occupied by a bold limestone ridge , except at its *vestern extremity , where the alluvial deposit had formed a bottom of several acres in extent . From this bottom , which was covered with coarse grass and other growths natural to such a situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and bare not only of vegetation but even of soil itself-leaving the whole surface paved , as it were , with large limestone flags , black and blistered by the sun , with only a few stunted cedar shrubs growing here and there out of the crevices . Following the crest of this desolate-looking ridge for about a mile , the road passes between the heads of two ravines which , beginning only a few yards apart , run down somewhat obliquely to the river on each side . These ravines were filled with a dense jungle of small wood ; while beyond them , instead of a rocky pavement , the surface of the hill was covered with an open forest of heavy timber , through which ran the great buffalo road . Thus the field of battle was a complete cul-de-sac , with but two outlets , one formed by the narrow pass between the heads of the ravines , the other by the ford at the other extremity of the ellipse . On the 15th of August , 1782 , an Indian army , consisting of detachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so secret that not the slightest rumor had preceded them , suddenly appeared before Bryant 's Station , a few miles northeast of Lexington . The garrison , though taken by surprise , prepared for a stubborn defense , and , at the same time , sent off a runner to Colonel Todd , at Lexington , the superior officer of the district , who at once called out the forces immediately about him , and sent warning of the attack to Colonel Boone , at Boonesborough , and Lieutenant-Colonel Trigg , at Harrodsburg , to join him as quickly as possible with what men they could gather on the spur of the moment . Trigg also transmitted the news to Colonel Logan , the senior officer of the Kentucky militia . The three parties under Boone , Todd , and Trigg , having Harland , M'Gary , and Levi Todd as mfijors , were united at Lexington on the 17th , forming together a body of between two and three hundred men , the very flower of the young commonwealth . This little army reached the threatened station early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy had raised the siege and departed about daylight , not choosing to wait an attack at that place ; hut instead of skulking off as if anxious to baffle pursuit , they had taken the great buffalo trail to the Blue Licks , probably the best-beaten road at that time in the country . This circumstance at once aroused Boone 's suspicions , which were increased , as they advanced in pursuit , by many signs which seemed to show that the savages were moving as slowly and making as distinct a trail as possible , while taking every precaution to conceal their numbers , which they accomplished so well that the veteran woodsman could only guess their force to be between three and five hundred . At length , after a march of 3 ( miles , the army reached the bank of Licking River , and for the first time caught sight of the Indians , three or four of whom were seen , on the other side , leisurely ascending the ridge . The conduct of this party convinced Boone and all the more experienced among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the pursuers over the river , and that their main body , though invisible , was not far off . A council was therefore called , in which all who chose seemed to have taken part . Boone , who had often hunted over the ground , described it minutely , particularly the situation of two ravines , and gave it as his opinion that the whole Indian force was lying in ambush at that point . He therefore advised that they should defer further operations till Logan , who was known to be hastening on , should join them with the men of Lincoln ; and then , with their combined forces , continue the pursuit , and try to bring the enemy to battle in some less formidable position , before they could recross the Ohio . This would certainly have been the most prudent course , but the Fabian policy was little admired by the borderers , and seldom practiced . Seeing , therefore , that this first plan was unacceptable both to the officers and men , and still anxious to defer the battle as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river , he next proposed that the army should be divided into two bodies , the stronger of which should march up the river and cross at another ford , beyond the mouth of the ravine on that side , thus gaining the rear of the enemy 's right ; while the other division , moving down along the northern side of the bend , should flank and uncover their left , supposing them to be posted , as he conjectured , in the ravines ; and to make sure of this latter point , he urged that scouts should first be sent out to examine the ground in both directions . The usual version is , that while Boone was enforcing this last proposition Major M'Gary broke emphatically away from the group of officers , and waving his hat , spurred his horse into the water , calling on all who were not " cowards to follow , and he would show them where the Indians were ; " when , according to M'Clung ( who has been copied by every subsequent writer ) , the whole army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thoughts of discipline or danger , and poured in one mingled mass of horse and foot through the ford , and in the same disorder ascended the bill . Mr. Marshall , the best historian of those times , says , that first one and then another followed M'Gary , until the movement was gradually communicated to the whole body , which crossed in disorder in- // deed , but with none of the thoughtless precipitation so vividly described by M'Clung . But the letter of which we have spoken represents the whole movement as made in obedience to the orders of the commanding officers , and further states that , instead of rushing heedlessly on to an engagement , the men were reduced to some degree of order before ascending the bill , and each of the three divisions assigned its particular position and duty . Of all the leaders , Boone alone seems to have understood how fatal a blunder had thus been committed . And so knowing , we can imagine his feelings when he saw that little army , composed so largely of his personal friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclosed in a trap , where victory was almost impossible , and defeat would be destruction . Still his mind continued as clear and his thoughts as unconfused as before the fatal step had been taken , and he saw that there remained one desperate hope of victory and salvation-namely , to push on , force the narrow passage between the ravines , and gain the woods beyond , thus at once gaining shelter for themselves , cutting the enemy 's line , and exposing their rear  --  a situation in which he knew neither the savages nor any other troops could he held steady for any length of time . With this hope he rapidly ascended the hill with his own men , and in a few minutes neared the desired point , which he found strongly guarded , and where the battle immediately began . Boone and M'Gary , at the head of their brave little forlorn hope , attempted to clear the strait on a run , and close with the enemy in the woods beyond . Had the number of the whites been near equal to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed . Some few , indeed , did succeed in entering the wood , but it was only to die by the tomahawk instead of the rifle . But the converging fire from a semicircle of concealed foes swept the exposed and narrow passway with such murderous effect that Boone , after having seen his son stretched dead at his feet , gave up at last the desperate attempt . A single glance told him that the rest of the army was already not only defeated hut on the brink of destruction , as he had foreseen . For the two wings , the extremities of which were to rest on the river on either side , thus occupying the whole breadth of the ellipse , having come into action wearied by a long march , and considerably disordered by the hasty passage of the stream , were met by a fire // from the ravines so accurate and sustained that in three or four minutes every field-officer except Major Todd was killed . The men , thus left without commanders , and unable to face the deadly fusillade , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen hack , still maintaining their connection with the centre , so that the line had first assumed a triangular form , and finally , when the action ceased iu the van , the entire force was disposed along the crest of the ridge in an irregular column , searched throughout its whole length and breadth by the hostile shot . This position they maintained for a while , unable to advance , yet unwilling to fly ; but their hesitancy was of short duration , for the Indians were now seen leaving the lower part of the ravines with the design of occupying the ford . The meaning of this movement was at once understood , and a panic seized the soldiers , who , leaving their wounded friends to their fate , rushed in tumultuous disorder down the hill , each thinking only of securing his own safety hy reaching the only outlet from that bloody trap before it should he closed . But many never reached it at all , and others who did perished under the hatchet before they could gain the opposite shore ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swarmed thickly round the flanks and rear of the flying crowd , striking them down at every step , and even slaying numbers in the stream itself in spite of a galling fire from some of the whites who had already gained the farther banJi . But in the midst of this rout and dismay Boone saved himself by a boldness as timely and sagacious as his former prudence . Being most deeply involved , he saw that to fly toward the ford would only be sharing the fate of the crowd who had preceded him , as the Indians could reach that point before he could . Calling around him a party of fifteen or twenty friends , they dashed into one of the ravines , and , after a short but furious haud-to*hand struggle with the Indians who still remained there , succeeded in breaking through their line and gaining the shelter of the woods , whence , by a circuitous route , they reached Bryant 's without losing a man . Such we believe to have been the true character of the famous battle of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admire most , the skill with which the Indian leader posted and fought his savage army , or the acuteness with which Boone penetrated all his plans , and pointed out the means by which they might have been baffled . But Daniel Boone was nm* only great-minded ; tbr if our conduct and feelings toward enemies form , as they certainly do , the best measure of magnanimity , then was the Kentucky pioneer one of the most noble-minded of men . The narrative of his adventures , as detailed by himself contains not one of those savage personal encounters with Indians which give so much interest to the lives of his compeers . The man , in fact , seems to have had nothing of the bully or bravo about him , and to have had a singular aversion to shedding the blood even of his enemies . Even in that touching passage of Filson 's narrative , where the veteran pioneer sums up his losses by savage hands-his two eldest sons being included in the list-he seems to feel no bitterness or anger in the melancholy retrospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those for whom he had suffered so much . Thus we see that Boone and Harrod were entirely free from one of the most characteristic feelings of their class , namely , " Indian hating ; " a feeling the strength of which we may faintly conceive by talking to one of the old pioneers who yet linger here and there in the Western country , but more vividly perhaps from the frequency of what may very properly be termed revenge monomania . Mr. Bird 's " Bloody Nathan , " and Mr. Webber 's " Silent Hunter , " whether portraits or fancy sketches , are both good representatives of a class of persons whose minds had been more or less disordered by some of those awful incidents of savage warfare which make us shudder even at the distance of seventy years , and whose mysterious modes of life and ruthless pursuit of vengeance still form the burden of traditionary tales in many regions of our State . Toward the end of the last century there lived at Vincennes a woman whose whole life had been spent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Indians ; her last husband , whose name was Moredock , had been killed a few years before the time of which we speak . But she had managed to bring up a large family in a respectable manner . Now , when her sons were growing up , she resolved to better their condition by moving " West . " The whole of Illinois was a blooming waste of prairie laud , except in a few places where stood the trading posts built a hundred years before by the French . These quiet little colonies of Normaus and Bretons , nestling here and there , supply almost the only idyllic chapters in our history , otherwise so resonant with the noise of battle and the din of progress . The lower peninsula of Illinois was not of a nature to at$ract emigrants when so much finer lands were to be found on the banks of the Great River and its tributaries ; nor was a land journey over that marshy region , infested as it was by roving bands of savages , to be lightly undertaken , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuitous way to the delightful region beyond . Hence it was usual for a company of those intending to make the journey to purchase a sufficient number of pirogues , or keel-boats , in them descend the Ohio , and then ascend the Mississippi to the mouth of the Kaskaskia , or any other destined point . By adopting this mode of traveling all serious danger of Indian attacks was avoided , except at one or two points on the latter stream , where it was necessary to land and draw the boats around certain obstructions in the channel . // To one of these companies the Moredock family joined itself-several of the sons being sufficiently well-grown to take a part not only in the ordinary labors of the voyage hut in any conflict that might occur . All went well with the expedition until they reached the rock known as the " Grand Tower " on the Mississippi , almost within sight of their destination . Here , supposing themselves to he out of danger , the men carelessly leaped on shore to drag the boats up against the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The women and children , fifteen or twenty in number , tired of being cooped in the narrow cabins for three or four weeks , thoughtlessly followed . While the whole party were thus making their way slowly along the narrow space between the perpendicular precipice on one hand , and the deep , swiftflowing stream on the other , the well-known yell of savage onset rung in their ears , and a volley of rifles from above stretched half a dozen of the number dead in their midst , while almost at the same moment a band of the painted demons appeared at each end of the fatal pass . The experienced border-men , who saw at a glance that their condition was hopeless , stood for one mo ment overwhelmed with consternation ; but in the next the spirit of the true Indian fighter awoke within their hearts , and they faced their assailants with hopeless but desperate valor . The conflict that ensued was only a repetition of the scene which the rivers and woods of the West had witnessed a thousand times before , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been baffled by the superior cunning of the red men . " Battle Rock , " " Murder Creek , " " Bloody Run , " and hundreds of similar names scatts*red throughout our land , are but so many characters in that stern epitaph which the aborigines , during their slow retreat across the continent toward the Rocky Mountains , and annihilation , have written for themselves in the blood of the destroying race . The history of Indian warfare contains no passage more fearful than is to be found in the narrative of this massacre at the Grand Tower of the Mississippi . Half-armed , surprised , encumbered with their women and children , and taken in so disadvantageous a situation , being all huddled together on a narrow sand beach , with their enemies above and on either side ; their most desperate efforts availed not even to postpone their ATTACK ON T5IE EMIGRANTS . // warning yell was heard the mangled bodies of forty men , women , and children lay heaped upon that narrow strip of sand . The conflict had ended in the complete destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined not a single survivor remained to carry the disastrous tidings to the settlements . But one such wretched survivor , however , there was . John Moredock , who having fought like a young tiger until all hope of saving even a part of the unfortunate company was lost , and who then , favored by the smoke , and the eagerness of the assailants for scalps , and the plunder of the boats , glided through the midst of the savages and nestled himself in a cleft of the rocks . Here he lay for hours , sole spectator of a scene of Indian ferocity which transformed his young heart to flint , and awoke that thirst for revenge which continued to form the ruling sentiment of his future life  --  and which raged as insatiably on the day of his death , forty years later , when he had become a man of mark , , holding high offices in his adopted State , as it did when crouching among the rocks of the Grand Tower ; and , beholding the bodies of his mother , sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself by a solemn oath never from that moment to spare one of the accursed race who might come within reach of his arm ; and especially to track the footsteps of the marauding band who had just swept away all that he loved on earth , until the last one should have paid the penalty of life for life . How long he remained thus concealed he never knew ; but at length , as the sun was setting , the Indians departed , and John Moredock stepped forth from his hiding-place , not what he had entered it , a brave , light-hearted lad of nineteen , the pride of a large family circle and the favorite of a whole little colony of borderers , but an orphan and an utter stranger in a strange land , standing alone amidst the ghastly and disfigured corpses of his family and friends , lie had hoped to find some life still lingering amidst the heaps of carnage ; but all , all had perished . Having satisfied himself of this fact , the lonely boy-now transformed into that most fearful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guiding himself by the stars struck across the prairie toward the nearest settlement on the ' Kaskaskia , where he arrived the next morning , bringing to tho inhabitants the first news of the massacre which had taken place so near their own village , and the first warning of the near approach of the prowling hand which had been for several months depredating , at various points along that exposed frontier , in spite of the treaties lately made by their nations with the Federal Government . John Moredock was by nature formed for a leader in times of danger , and his avowed determination to revenge the massacre of his friends and kindred by the extirpation of the murderous band coincided so exactly with the feelings of 587 the frontiersmen , that , in spite of his lack of previous acquaintance , he in a few days found himself at the head of a company of twenty-five or thirty young men , whose lives had been spent in the midst of all kinds of perils and hardships , and who now bound themselves to their leader by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the marauding band engaged in the attack at Grand Tower should be slain . Stanch as a pack of blood-hounds this little company of avengers ranged the frontier from the Des Moines to the Ohio , now almost within reach of their victims , and now losing all trace of them on the boundless prairies over which they roamed , unconscious of the doom by which they were being so hotly but stealthily pursued . Once , indeed , the whites came up with their game on the banks of a tributary of the Missouri , a hundred and fifty miles beyond the utmost line of the settlements ; but as the Indians , though unsuspicious of any particular danger . had pitched their camp in a spot at once easy to defend and to escape from , and as Moredock wished to destroy and not to disperse them , he forbore striking a partial blow , and resolved rather to postpone his revenge than to enjoy it incompletely . Fortune , however , seemed to repay him for this act of self-restraint by presenting the very opportunity he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovered the whole gang of murderers encamped for the night on a small island in the middle of the Mississippi . After a hasty consultation with his companions , a course of procedure was determined upon which strikingly displays both the monomaniacal tendency of the leader and the desperate ascendency he had acquired over his followers . This was nothing less than to shut themselves up on that narrow sand bar and engage the savages in a hand-to-band conflict  --  a conflict from which neither party could retreat , and which must necessarily end in the total destruction of one or the other . A most desperate undertaking truly , when we reflect that the numbers of the combatants were about equal , and that to surprise an Indian encampment was next to impossible . But John Moredock , and probably more than one of his companions , were monomaniacs , and considerations of personal danger never entered into their calculations . Revenge , not safety , was their object , and they took little thought of the latter when the opportunity of compassing the former was presented . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all sounds there had ceased , and the flame of the camp fire had sunk into a pale red glow , barely marking the position of the doomed party among the undergrowth with which the central portion of the little isle was covered . The Indians , confiding in their natural watchfulness , seldom place sentinels around their camps ; and thus Moredock and his band reached the island without being discovered . A few moments sufficed to set their own canoes as well as those of the Indians adrift , and then , with gun in hand and tomahawk ready , THE PIONEERS OF KENTUCKY . // they glided noiselessly , as so many panthers , into the thicket , separating as they advanced so as to approach the camp from different quarters . All remained still as death for many minutes while the assailants were thus closing in around their prey , and not a twig snapped and scarcely a leaf stirred in the thick jungle through which thirty armed men were making their way in as many different directions , hut all converging toward the same point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuspecting savages . But though an Indian camp may be easily approached within a certain distance , it is almost impossible , if there be any considerable number of them , to actually strike its occupants while asleep . As savages , roaming at large over the face of the Continent without fixed habitations , and relying upon chance for the supply of their few wants , they know nothing of that regularity of habit which devotes certain fixed portions of time to the various purposes of life , but each one eats , sleeps , or watches just as his own feelings may dictate at the moment , without any regard to established usages of time or place . Hence the probability of finding all the members of an Indian party asleep at the same time is small indeed . On the present occasion two or three warriors , who were smoking over the embers , caught the alarm before the assailants had quite closed in . Still the surprise gave the white men a great advantage , and half a dozen of the savages were shot down in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which suddenly broke the midnight stillness as Moredock and his company , finding their approach discovered , rushed in upon them . This fatal effect of the first volley was a lucky thing for the adventurers ; for the Indians are less liable to panics than almost any other people , and they closed with their assailants with a fury that , combined with their superior skill in nocturnal conflict , would have rendered the issue of the struggle a very doubtful matter had the number of combatants been more nearly even . As it was , the nimble warriors fought their way against all odds to the point where their canoes had been moored . Here , finding their expected means of flight removed , and exposed upon the naked sand beach , the survivors still made desperate battle until all were slain except three , - - **-  * EETURN OF JOHN MOREDOCIt. // who plunged boldly into the stream , and , aided by the darkness , succeeded in reaching the main land in safety . Twenty-seven of those engaged in the massacre at the Grand Tower had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped from the bloody trap , and while these lived the vengeance of John Moredock was unsatisfied . They must perish , and he determined that it should be by his own hand . He therefore dismissed his faithful band , and thenceforth continued the pursuit alone . Having learned the names of the three survivors he easily tracked them from place to place , as they roamed about in a circuit of three or four hundred miles . Had the wretches known what avenger of blood was thus dogging their tracks , the whole extent of the Continent would not have afforded space enough for their flight , or its most retired nook a sufficiently secure retreat . But quiet as relentless Moredock pursued his purpose , and but few even of his acquaintances knew the motive of his ceaseless journey along the frontiers from Green Bay to the mouth of the Ohio , and far into the unsettled wastes beyond the Mississippi . At length , about two years after the massacre of his family at the Tower , he returned to Kaskaskia having completed his terrible task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his girdle . Had he rested here few persons would have felt inclined to blame , while most would have applauded his conduct as being guided by the most rigid principles of poetic justice . But , alas ! human virtues , unregulated , are almost certain to degenerate into vices , the more dangeromis because so deceptive . John Moredock , although he no longer devoted his whole time to Indian hunting , never relaxed in his hatred to that people ; and when he died at the age of sixty , popular as a public officer , highly esteemed as a neighbor , and beloved as a husband and father , the ruling passion was still strong in his heart : so that his biographer could truly say that he had never spared the life of an Indian when in his power , or lost an opportunity of inflicting injury upon the detested race . And yet this man was remarkable for his mildness in his intercourse with his own people ; and though possessed of that constitutional courage that braves the most frightful dangers without a tremor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living in a state of society where these qualities were more available for the protection of a man 's person and rights than the loosely administered laws , he was never known to be engaged in a quarrel with his fellow-citizens . And yet this man , so peaceable and kindhearted in all other respects , hesitated not to murder a red man when and wherever he might meet him . While small parties of marauders were still prowling through the thick beech forests which cover the country for miles south of the Ohio River , a small station had been erected considerably in advance of the general frontier line . A few miles from this little place of refuge t*yo men , named Saunders and Smith , had ventured to build their lonely cabins about a mile apart , on opposite sides of a small stream . The Saunders family consisted of the parents , a daughter about seventeen , and a son about five years old . In the neighboring family was also a young daughter of about the same age with Mary Saunders ; and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own age and sex , became very intimate , and were in the habit of exchanging frequent visits unattended by any male protector , without much fear of danger , as the path from one dwelling to the other lay with its whole course visible from the doors of both . On one of these visits Mary Saunders had remained later than usual ; but as no signs of lurking enemies had been reported in the vicinity for some time , she felt no hesitation about returning alone , although twilight was already setting in , and set forth gayly upon her journey , promising-according to their established custom on such occasions  --  to notify her safe arrival at home by singing a snatch of a favorite song , which , amidst the profound silence of that secluded neighborhood , could easily be heard over the intervening space . Her friend , whom a vague fear still rendered uneasy , watched till her form disappeared in . the dark shadows of the lower valley , and then stood listening long and anxiously for the promised signal . But it never came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound was heard such as would certainly have accompanied any act of violence , so that she finally turned away , partially relieved of her apprehension , but remarking that it was strange that Mary Saunders had forgotten to give the accustomed signal on reaching home . But poor Mary Saunders had not reached home ; and her parents , supposing that she had determined , as often before , to remain with their neighbors all night , were not alarmed at her absence . When , however , on the morrow she failed to make her appearance , this feeling of security gave place to doubts and a fearful misgiving-which a visit to their neighbors converted into a certainty-that their child had fallen into the hands of some prowling band of savages . The alarm was quickly spread , and long before noon the bereaved father , at the head of a resolute party of sympathizing friends , was straining forward on the track of the captors . It was a chase which many a parent in those times had followed with an aching heart , knowing well that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a slight degree less certain , than that which a failure to overtake the fugitives involved . For the Indians never hesitated to kill their prisoners when a recapture seemed imminent . So it proved on this occasion ; for , after following the trail until late in the evening , the half-maddened father found his daughter tomahawked and scalped by her brutal captors-not because they feared an immediate rescue , but apparently in cold blood , as the atrocious deed had evidently been committed several hours before the arrival of the pursuing // party . And here the poor mangled girl had ' lain during all these long hours . But she was still able to recognize her father as he knelt beside her , and to recount every thing that had befallen her since she had parted with her friend the preceding evening . It seems that she had sauntered carelessly along until she approached the stream and entered the shadow of the grove of small trees that bordered its banks . Here , becoming somewhat more watchful , she thought she heard a sound resembling stealthy footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures gliding among the trees on the opposite shore ; but so dimly defined against the obscure light of the opening beyond that she could not distinguish whether they were those of human beings or of deer , which she knew frequented the meado*vlike bottom at night . While pausing to assure herself on this point , she was softly and firmly , but not rudely , seized by several pairs of strong arms , and before she could utter a single scream a cloth was bound tightly over her mouth , and then , without an instant 's delay , she felt herself borne away at a rapid pace toward the deep forest . After traveling until all danger of discovery was past , they encamped for the night , closely guarding their captive , but otherwise treating her with gentleness . Early the next morning they again set forth rapidly toward the Ohio , intending to put that barrier between themselves and the pursuit which they knew would be made as soon as her capture became known . The strength*and endurance of the border maiden was such as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to fail , and she was no longer able to keep pace with the rapid flight of her captors ; although with trembling limbs and panting breath she strove to do so , warned by the increasing impatience of the savages , and knowing well the penalty should her weariness too much delay their progress . As long , therefore , as her limbs would uphold her she continued to reel forward , hoping that the noon halt would enable her to hold out until her friends should come up . But when the hasty meal was dispatched , and the savages ready to set forth , she found herself unable to move . After a hasty consultation the chief-a stern , sullen-looking barbarian-approached , and MUCDER OF MARY SAUNDERS . // by signs ordered her to sit down . Believing that he intended an outrage worse than death , she refused to obey ; but in this she probably did him injustice , ' for , to the credit of the red men he it said , there is scarcely one single instance of their offering such violence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in her forlorn condition . Again the command was given more emphatically , and again obedience was refused . Exasperated by such resistance , he grasped his tomahawk , and shaking it threateningly before her , he fiercely reiterated his order in such broken English as he was master of . The hapless maiden still refused . But though she had courage enough to choose death rather than dishonor , she had not enough to enable her calmly to face the approach of the latter ; and therefore threw her apron over her head , which was instantly cleft by the hatchet of the brutal savage . Then , as she sunk at his feet , he tore the scalp away , and , without taking pains even to see that she was dead , departed with his band , leaving her still breathing on the spot where she had fallen . Thus she was found by her distracted father , to whom she related the foregoing particulars , and in whose arms she died before reaching home . But of all who mourned for Mary Saunders none mourned so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excess of whose childish brief threatened for a time to overpower his reason . Had his situation been similar , his life , like that of John Moredock , would probably have been devoted to a ceaseless vengeance , and his name become famous along the borders as an Indian slayer . But before he reached manhood the frontiers had been extended hundreds of miles toward the north and west , and an Indian had become almost as much a curiosity in Central Kentucky as a Malay or an Arab ; so that his hostility , though undiminished in virulence , remained a mere barren sentiment in his own heart , or proved its existence only by a bitter curse whenever the detested-name was mentioned in his presence . But even in the careless seasons of youth and early manhood the memory of that sweet face which he had worshiped in infancy never grew dim , though the grave in the orchard ( beside which those of his father and mother had also been made ) was left to the care of strangers when he wandered forth , a lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing West . Twenty-five years after the murder of Mary Saunders a deputation of Shawnees ( whose diminished tribes had been removed from their old seats on the Miami to the West ) , returning , from an embassy to Washington , happened to stop in one of the flourishing towns then springing up on the Mississippi . After supper , when the inmates of the hotel where they lodged , together with many of the inhabitants of the city , were assembled in the dining-hall , it was proposed that the wild warriors should entertain the company with some of their war and hunting dances . To this they readily consented , and a space was cleared in the middle of the floor for the ceremony . The first who presented themselves were young braves who had seen but little of actual warfare , and their songs were confined principally to the narration of their exploits in hunting the wolf and buffalo . When all these had finished the oldest chieftain of the band arose . He was a man of gigantic stature , with a countenance naturally stern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it was covered . Unlike those who had preceded him , his song - which consisted of a sort of recitative chant in broken English , with a pantomime accompaniment almost as expressive as the words-referred not to adventures of the chase or to little combats with other enfeebled tribes on the prairies , but to the great actions of former days , when the Shawnees , Delawares , and Wyandots were mighty nations , and maintained a doubtful struggle with the Long Knives for the dominion of the " dark and bloody land . " And the old man 's eye gradually kindled with all its youthful fire , and his voice grew shrill and piercing , as he recalled the memory of those prouder days , and recounted the numbers of pale faces he had slain , and painted with fearful distinctness the scenes of carnage in which his savage heart had delighted . Surprise , fight , massacre , and torture , with all the wiles and stratagems of Indian warfare , the stealthy approach to some isolated cabin , the sudden onset , the yells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible reality that made the blood of the spectators run cold in their veins , and caused manj* to turn shuddering away from so vivid a representation of what the pioneer fathers had suffered so short a time before . Soon , however , their attention became partially diverted by the conduct of one of their own number , whom many recognized as a young physician lately settled in the place , who had at first seemed to regard the ceremony with a contemptuous indifference , but was observed to become suddenly attentive , pressing forward into the front ranks , where he stood with suspended breath and straining eyes gazing eagerly upon the savage tragedian , who had just begun the narration of a new adventure , at the remembrance of which his own feelings seemed to be wrought up almost to a pitch of frenzy , while his actions , which had before been sufficiently earnest , grew more and more violent , until they became so terrifically wild and excited that most of the ladies left the room , unable longer to endure the spectacle which began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told how , many winters ago , when his nation was in all its glory , he had led his young men across the beautiful river against the border settlements of the white people in Kentucky . How , while they lay in ambush , a young maiden came gliding timidly along in the darkness , casting fearful glances on every side and starting at every rustle of the leaves on the trees or in the gras // at her feet , like a fawn which dreads the wolf when driven by thirst to seek the stream . How he himself lay upon his face so close beside the path that he felt her garments hrush him as she passed . How the a-frighted captive struggled in his arms like a quail in the talons of a hawk , and strove to scream for help , stretching her hand despairingly toward her father 's cabin as they bore her past into the forest ; and how , when encamped , the maiden slept not , but wept and prayed to the white man 's Manitou cofitinually . Then , unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano of passions he was kindling in the bosom of one of his hearers , he began to enact the closing scene of the adventure , representing with wonderful histrionic art the characters of victim and murderer alternately , as the exigencies of the story required . Now with brandished tomahawk assuming the stern and menacing mien of the one , and anon exhibiting all the alarmed and despairing attitudes of the other ; his voice and gestures becoming yet more wild and startling as he approached the final catastrophe . At length , throwing his blanket over his head , he cowered for an instant almost to the floor , like one who dreads but can not avoid a stroke ; then suddenly springing to his full height , with a face convulsed with rage , he seemed to deliver a furious blow , while at the same moment a yell of devilish significance pealing through hall and corridors of the house announced the accomplishment of the brutal deed . But before the appalling sounds ceased to vibrate from his lips , the young gentleman who had been watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage if not as loud , had cleared with a bound the intervening space , and seizing the barbarian by the wrist , buried the blade of a hunting-knife again and again into his panting breast before any of those present could interfere even by a word to prevent him . And then , as the savage sunk without a groan at his feet , the homicide , still grasping the dripping weapon , turned to the horrified company , . and proceeded calmly to explain the motives of his conduct , which to a Western audience at that period seemed perfectly satisfactory-for the slayer was George Saunders , and thus strangely had he discovered his sister 's murderer and avenged her death . these statements , and assert that there was not ten years ' difference in the time in which artillery was used by the principal powers of Europe .
