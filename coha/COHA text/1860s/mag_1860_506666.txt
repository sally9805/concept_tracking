BEDS AND TABLES , STOOLS AND CANDLESTICKS . IlL STILL MORE ABOUT THE LIVING-ROOM . HARDLY any piece of furniture is more troublesome to bring into harmony with the conditions of our modern room than the book-case . And one may well despair of bringing any help to those who are puzzling themselves over the problem . If a man be a large student and a great accumulator of books , necessity solves the problem for him . He takes a room to himself lines the walls with shelves , and covers all his available space with books . But that is not our problem . We want to have our books in our living-room , and we want pictures , and " objects , " and furniture , and comfort , too . We want our books , not necessarily as Leigh Hunt said he liked his , " where he could lean his head against them , " but in close companionship , and where we can get at them easily , and where we shall be often tempted to get at them . Cut No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , and it is a way that is by no means the invention of the owner of this particular book-case , but one that has found favor with many another lover of books . The present example was made to fit into a certain room where it was fondly hoped it would remain for a half-dozen May-days or so at the least . But it has since found itself at home in two other rooms , and , on the whole , shows itself a man-of-the-world in accommodating itself to what it finds at hand . It is made of plain white pine , brought to a good surface and shellacked , and its third year finds it with a most beautiful color , only distinguishable from satin-wood by a richer tone . It is twelve feet six inches long , the top and bottom being each one piece , and it is about three feet high . The bottom of the lowest shelf is four inches from the floor , and the ends run up nearly five inches above the top , and are connected by a strip at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low wall of protection for whatever may be set upon the top of the book-case , and " finishes " it , as the slang phrase is , at once usefully and handsomely . This book-case is divided into four by three upright partitions , on each side of which slots are sunk for the ends of the shelves to rest in , these shelves being plain boards all of the same thickness , of course , and , what is unfortunately not " of course , " sliding in and out with perfect ease , whether weighted with books or not , and each one fitting like a glove into any two of the one hundred and four slots that it may be necessary to slide it into . I have found this way of supporting the shelves a very good one , and it is an additional point in its favbr , when once its practicalness has been admitted , that it looks well , the front ends of the slots , in which no shelves rest , showing black , and alternating with the uncut portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design , but which , when the work came to be executed , rewarded the designer for having tried to solve his problem of shelf-support in a straightforward , natural manner . Cut No. 2 will explain this little detail to the eye . This book-case will hold easily four hundred books ; nearly five hundred , if ordinary small octavos and duodecimos are to be accommodated  --  the lesser number , if one hundred and odd of them are large octavos and folios . Moreover , the shelves being a foot deep , as many more books or pamphlets* that are not to be discarded , but are only wanted semi-occasionally , can be ranged behind the other books and pamphlets . The top of such a book-case as this will be found an excellent place on which to set many useful and ornamental things that find their natural home in the living-room , and which yet , under ordinary circumstances , are apt to be in the way . It may be consecrated to the utilities or to the ornamental , or , as is best , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no favor . Here , at one end , is the convenient Japanese chest of drawers without doors , made of unlackered wood , a capital hold for writing paper , envelopes , etc. , or for small precious objects that one likes to have at hand , and yet which must not be left about . In the other corner next the window is the favorite cast , too small for a pedestal , but lifted here to a convenient height and safe from all ordinary accidents , whether from four-footed cats in fur , or from two-footed cats in petticoats wielding dusters and feather whisks . Between these there is room for many pretty and curious things , to say *othing of drawings or photographs in passe-par/out that one does n't care to hang up , but which can be easily set a-tilt against the wall , and lightly moved or changed at // will ; and it will be wise not to allow this tempting shelf to become too crowded , for it is a capital place to rest a book for momentary reference . Abundant room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it has been tried , it will hardly be given up ; and a third advantage , all the wall space above three feet from the floor left free and unincumbered for whatever use can be made of a wall . The books , with their various bindings and their varied shapes , make a handsomer wainscoting than can be else designed , and one that gives force and richness to the decoration of the wall above . In the arrangement of this wall , dignity should be aimed at , by giving up the field to one or two large objects-large , I mean , in proportion ,  --  and putting in the remaining space such things as will harmonize with them or set them off . And this will be found a good rule for decorating our walls in general ; there is too great a tendency to spot the wall all over with little things-little pictures , little brackets with little vases or figurines , confusing the eye , and making it impossible to enjoy any one thing out of the whole pimply lot .

The architect in planning the house put in a " Library , " as of course , and what is a library without " books ? " The library was not made for the books , but the books were bought because there was a library . A library without books would be as unmeaning as a cellar without wine . There are many tricks played in the matter of wine ; profound talk of " green seal " and " yellow seal " and other mysteries , and cobwebs and dust added to bottles that will not grow old as fast as our knowing-ones in wine can drink it up ; but the wine , whether good or bad , whether really out of one 's own cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " can not escape being tried . The books , on the other hand , in the so-called " library " may not be books at all , but only backs of books glued on to bits of wood ,  --  an artifice by no means uncommon . But , whether so , or only books never read because unreadable , or books in editions and bindings too costly to be used or lent , the book-case that holds them may as well be protected by doors , and locked up with a lost key . No . I. *WHAT DO YOU READ , MY LADY ? " // For lovers of books , however , a house without books is no house at all ; and in a family where books make a great part of the pleasure of living , they must be where they can be got at without trouble , and , what is of more importance , where they can share in the life about them and receive some touches of the humanity they supply and feed .

DETAIL OF NO . I. his flattened palm . The young girl runs over them with her eye , and taps a little here and there with a rosy reflective fingertip , then draws out one that promises , or one long known , and saunters with it to the favorite reading-place . For all who enjoy them , use them , depend upon them , the books are there at hand ; not shut up , like clothes in a wardrobe , or silver in a chest , but free to the hand like the basket of apples or the pitcher of water on the sideboard . There are " practical " objections in plenty against the use of doors for book-cases . They stick ; the key is always lost ; they hide the sight of some of the books when the door is of glass , and when they are solid , how is one to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors are opened they are awkwardly in the way , and if there are children or young people in the house , they are sure to be left open , and to be run against . But , after all , my chief objection to doors on book-cases is , that they are inhospitable , and hinder close acquaintance . To have to ask for a key , or even to open a door unlocked before we can put our hand on a book , or look the shelves over to find one that suits us , is as bad as having to tug off a glove to seize a friend 's hand . And what is more like a true friend than a book-case filled with real books ? " Dust ! " says Martha , as she reads this . " What a place for dust such a book-case as yours must be ! " It is true that dust does collect , but not much , if reasonable care be taken , and if the books are often used , and , at any rate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of the two evils , rather to be chosen than the danger of not using the books at all ; of having the family grow up without the habit of reading books , consulting them , seeking refuge in them . These habits , early and naturally formed , have more to do with culture than might be thought . The young people go to school or college , and hear lectures on English literature , or study books on the subject , and they come away with few ideas and little knowledge . Then , as they go out into the world , they come , perhaps , to think they would like to know something more , or perhaps they feel the need of knowing more , and so attend lectures , or listen to readings , to get in a hurry what they need . But knowledge got in a hurry is as poor stuff as leather tanned the new way , or kiln-dried timber , or bread made with baking-powders , or any of the modern substitutes for the old-time methods of time and patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , or any other literature , is to grow up with it , to ' summer and winter with it , to eat it , drink it , and sleep with it , and this can never be if the book-case that holds the books in the house we grow up in has doors that lock . If we must cover our books , for fear of dust , a curtain is all that can be allowed , . and a curtain is little less troublesome than a door . I am not sure that a curtain is not more troublesome than any door . To be as little in the way as possible , it should be of some thing silk , and should slide with metal rings on a metal rod as lightly and easily as can be contrived , and , after all this trouble , , the amount of dust kept out will be found to be but small . Besides , a curtain hides the books from sight , and one might as well hope to be warmed by a fire he could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up behind doors or curtains . // 49 ' Glass doors have this to say for themselves , that they do give some glimpse of what is behind them , and show a little hospitality . Some years ago , in an exhibition of furniture held in London , there was a book-case made , I believe , by Mr. Burges , the architect , which was closed by a curtain ; but this was a small affair , and so not liable to the objections that would hold against closing a book-case , such as is shown in the first illustration of this chapter , with curtains running along the whole front , or even along each division . This was only , in fact , a square box with shelves , set up on a table , and with a curtain hung across its front . The curtain was of plush , if I remember ; but that was not a good material , and all the effect obtained might have been got as well by using silk . It hung by rings from a wire that was stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that when it was drawn it showed the whole of all the shelves and all the books . The book-case was made of plain wood , and painted with some good decoration on a red ground , and the curtain was of a gold yellow cut on a red ground . In the upper left-hand corner of this square of plush there was embroidered a beehive , and the bees were flying back and forth inastraggling line between their hive and the lower right-hand corner . In the upper righthand corner might have been written some motto  --  a line from Milton : " They at their flowery work do sing , " or the like . This was a pretty piece of furniture to hold a hundred books or so , small copies of favorite authors that one likes to have at hand , and , being meant for a parlor piece , a little more elegance was admissible than would have been fitting for a work-aday book-case . We feel a little pity sometimes for the Roman bookish people who had no books , properly speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrolls are unmanageable things . But there 's in habit , and the Japanese to-day , who make great use of scrolls ( though they also have books in plenty ) , know how to use them , unrolling them and rolling them at the same time , as they read them or study their pictures . But there was one advantage in the Roman scrolls ,  --  they were not heavy , and when they moved about they put them into a box like a bandbox , setting them up on end , so that a considerable number of volumes could be carried about on their journeys without adding inconveniently to their baggage . Our books , however , are too heavy for any such arrangement , and a very few add seriously to the weight of a trunk . This is sometimes an inconvenience : when one is taking a long journey , it is pleasant to have books , and they are the one thing not to be had . Cicero , our school-boy readers will remember ,  --  if we are fortunate enough to have them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other things , because they can go into the country with us . If he had not been too " swell " for such a condescension , he might have carried a small library with him in his hand , as one of us might carry a hat-box . This , by the way . My point is , that the books in a house  --  the books the family is to be fed on-ought to be made as accessible as possible . There will often be a few books , rare editions in costly bindings , that are to be locked up and not to be exposed to promiscuous handling ; but these are really not books-they are bric-*-brac , curios , and no true lover of books would care to have many of them in his possession . Mr. Burges 's " curtain " suggests the remark that a delightful field is open to women , one in which they would be sure to find pleasant employment , and where certain faculties they have peculiar to their sex would be exercised and made useful . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 3 CURTAINS HUNG BY NOD AND RINGS . // women will cry at once . " Embroidery , do place , the arts of embroidery have been you say ?

Some of the ladies belonging makes bold to confess he was not thinking of any of these unhappy productions of misplaced womanly labor when he spoke of embroidery .

There is no such waste of time , money , and patience as the worsted-work and embroidery to which our ladies give up so much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't useful , and it stands much in the way ot educating the eye and the general taste . Of course girls will always make slippers and smoking-caps for young menat least I hope so ; they enjoy making them , and the young men are not what I take em for if they do n't enjoy getting them . There is no reason whatever why these things should not be well designed ; but they never will be so long as the girls are so wanting in taste as to put up with the patterns they find in the shops . I suppose , however , if the young men and maidens were not so easily pleased , or had a taste of their own , there would be a supply of patterns to meet a more exacting demand . So long as people are in the infantile state of mind that is pleased with little imps and devils careering over slipper toes , or chasing one another along a lambrequin , or with foxes ' heads and tails , hunting-caps and whips , or with any out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be hoped for . But the advice to take up embroidery did not have reference to little love-and-friendship tokens of the cap-and-slipper tribe . It was intended to apply to more serious works , such as coverings for furniture , hangings for doors or walls , and the like . Since things took a turn in England , and the arts of furniture and house decoration began to interest artists and architects , and the new doctrine found a sacred poet to father it and save it from sinking into trade and comn*on to the families of the house of Morris , Marshall &amp; Co. , have distinguished themselves by the beauty and originality of their designs , and no less for the excellence of the workmanship ; and they have become important members of the business , their work and their taste having not a little to do with the success of the enterprise .

I believe that , in fact , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much of the enthusiasm for it among them date hack to the rise of the Ritualistic Revival there ; but it has found a wider field since then , and a more rich development in the service of household art . Besides , most of the ecclesiastical decorative work was conventional and copied , cramped in its expression and pinched to the uses of a narrow creed . But , working in the service of human love and feeling , the artist was free to express herself and follow the flight of her own fancy . The result has been , that many works of embroidery are produced to-day in England which show the old skill and taste to be still alive , and only waiting for the opportunity of exercise . We have had but few beautiful works in this sort produced here , partly because there has been no social movement that caused the art to revive naturally , partly No. * .

There is much interest felt of late among the young people in this matter of embroidery , but most of them are hampered by the difficulty of making a start . It is almost inevitable that we should be thrown upon the Japanese for our first hints and instruction ; their art is so perfect as decoration , their methods so varied , and their materials suited to every subject and belonging to our own time , and we so rich in its productions . Other art is strange to us-belongs to other times and to modes of life that once were those of men of our own world , but now outworn and laid aside . The Japanese live in moon-land ; their ways are not ours , and it is impossible for us to put ourselves into sympathy with them . But their art comes out of themselves , and they are producing it now in our day on the models they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the antique time . And therefore it has a vitality for us , and knocks at little secret doors in our own natures and gets some sort of response , though , for the most part , it is but the wind whistling through the key-hole . Still , if a woman can enjoy it , if it attracts her , the will do well to study it and base her embroidery upon it . But it ought to be done with a constant reference to nature , and it is better to fail in putting our own observation into silk and worsted , than to succeed in working up into painful perfection Mrs. German Something-or-other 's conventionalities of design and eye-scratching colors . In my last month 's chapter I touched upon the subject of curtains , but merely with a word . Next to carpets , there is no subject that comes so near to all women 's housekeeping hearts as curtains , and there is no subject that bothers them so much . And they are for the most part , rude and unfeeling as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving the troublesome problem . They are all agreed that cornices are indispensable , and the upholsterers and furniturepeople , finding this an easy and expensive way of suiting their delightfully troublesome clients , would go on putting up cornices for them till doomsday , and assuring them that there is no other way . Now , a " cornice " ought never under any circumstances to be thought necessary in a private house . In fitting up concert-rooms , ball-rooms , and public places , where a certain frigid formal suggestion of domestic hospitality is to be given , it might , perhaps , be allowed ; but only a commonplace designer , a sort of misfit architect , would try to get off with such a substitute for design . I suppose " cornices " for curtains to have come to be thought necessary when " cornices " for rooms began to be " the thing " everywhere . And there is as much necessity for one as for the other . What is the use of a curtain ? Part of its use is its usefulness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comfort it gives . It is useful to shut out the light and to keep out the cold air , and , as in all our household decoration , usefulness is the first thing to be secured , we must consider first how these two ends are to be gained . To get all the light we may ever , at any time , want from a window , we must be able to have the whole glass clear ; to draw curtains , if there be curtains , completely away from the glass , and keep them well to either side . Now , if there is a cornice , the curtain is either nailed to it ( on the inside ) , or it runs with rings on a rod that is stretched across the cornice on the inside . If it be nailed to the cornice , so that it only opens in the middle , it can never be so drawn as to give us all the light we may need . And , if it slides on a rod , there is no need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOOK FOR HANGING PICTURES . // reason why the rod should not be shown and acknowledged . I may say just here , that " cornices " are almost always very troublesome to take down and to put up ,  --  the services of an upholsterer 's man or men being necessary ,  --  and are a constant source of expense , for no end whatever , except to give the upholsterer pleasure . Here the housekeeper cuts in with , " But then , sir , the room looks so bare without cornices . ' And , how are we to support our lambrequins without their aid ? " Well , I will be down upon lambrequins presently , and give them a gentle piece of my mind ; but first let us see whether it is inevitable that the room should " look bare " without the cornices . That it does look bare , as a rule , I will admit , but that is the fault of the room . Our rooms are so universally without harmony in their fitting-up , and the walls are so rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the people , that we come to depend upon the furniture to give us some color and sense of solidity . If the carpet , walls , and ceiling of a room were once treated as a whole , and brought into proper harmonious relation , we should find that the room would not only look well with fewer and smaller pieces of furniture , but that taking out one or two things would not make such a difference as it does now . The only sensible way to support curtains is by rings running on a brass rod . The mechanism of this is shown in cut No. 3 . The rings remain upon the rod , and the curtains have long hooks of wire sewed to their upper edge , which hook into eyes soldered to the edge of the rings . With a step-ladder , a child can unship the curtain in a jiffy , and put them up in less than no time , and the upholsterer 's yearly bill be easily shorn of two items at least . The rod rests upon two brass stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , and that need never come down . Nor need the rod and rings come down , for that matter ; and , as they are made of burnished brass , they only need the dusting they can get with the long-handled feather whisk . The rods are sold , or ought to be sold , by the foot . They come of different diameters , and a button screws on at either end to cover the openings , and prevent dust and animated nature from seeking shelter in the hollow tube . Perhaps No. 7 . " HAIL ! CALM ACCLIVITY , SALUBRIOUS SPOT ! " // we can gratify the average woman by admitting that the real use of these buttons is to take off the " bare " look from the rod . We must consider , before settling upon the rod , what are the dimensions of our room . We knew a lady who teased her husband into discharging a servant because she was so tall as to be out of proportion to their house , and a curtain-rod may easily be too large for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye will tell her whether a rod is too large or too small for the work it has to do , and she has only to choose what suits her case . The rod should look as if it could support the curtain , not merely be able to support it . Here , as in many cases , the eye has to be considered . Hanging curtains by rod and rings is the good old way , and its elegance , as well as utility , has always commended it to artists and people whose tastes in great things prove they may be trusted in small matters . It is not to follow Mr. Ruskin in his fetich worship of the old Hebrews , to say that , as the curtains of the Jewish Tabernacle were hung by rods and rings , we may think well of that fashion , but only because it is plain from the descriptions that both the earlier Tabernacle and the later Temple were intrinsically beautiful structures . The Italian painters were always hanging their curtains in this way , as the reader may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar example . But a dozen others come to my mind , and several in Diirer besides . The curtain in the " Sistine Madonna " is hung , not upon a rod , but upon a wire ; and neither the means by which it is suspended , nor the way it hangs , is to be commended , for so heavy a curtain should have been hung from a strong rod , and it should have been drawn aside , not looped up . But there is a hint in the hanging of this curtain we may make use of in our own practice , and that will sometimes be found to add just the touch that was wanted to reconcile us to curtains in a room where curtains may have threatened to be in the way . The wire on which the Raphael curtain hangs sags a little near the middle , as is natural , seeing what a weight depends from it . This lets in the light from the top , and , without puz No. 8 . A HARBOR OF REFUGE* // qwq pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molded lintel of the window . Indeed , perhaps this is as good a way as can be devised for securing something of what is unconsciously sought to be gained by the device of a " cornice . " If the lintel be well designed , and with good moldings , and then not left staring white , but brought into tune with the rest of the wall and curtains themselves , it will do all in effect that the " cornice " could have done , and without - interfering with the play of the curtains as we move them on their rods . Cut No. 5 shows curtains hung across an arched doorway , taking the place of the sliding-doors , which , however , are still there , to be shut when necessary , which is but seldom . Here there can be no doubt as to the desirableness of hanging the curtains , not across the architrave of the door-way ( the arch being a mere supposed ornamental cutting off the corners of the square , and not a real arch ) , but in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . A BIT leaving the whole arch open for light and air . This again in practice is heavy .

The color ought to would be required if the curtain had been go with the room , but ought not to domihung from a rod stretched above the top of neer or lead the rest ; indeed , nothing ought the door along the architrave . to do that in a room ; but if the tone of the // room be accented anywhere , it should be by something small ,  --  a vase , a cushion , a bit of tapestry , not by any large piece of furniture , nor by any large space of wall or drapery . The decoration of the curtain by bands across the stuff ; not by vertical stripes , has everything to recommend it-oriental usage ( almost always a sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always to be reckoned on to produce its pictorial effect , since the bands can not be hid , no matter how many folds the curtain makes . But stripes are continually being concealed in the folds , or else cut in two , and so their value lost or impaired . With all the varieties of stuffs that are in the shops to-day , a woman with ingenuity and an eye ought to have little difficulty in getting handsome curtains without too much money , and at not too high a price . Give up the cornices and the lambrequins ,  --  awkward additions to any window , nine times out of ten ; give up fringes and borders , and straps by which to hold the curtains back , and you can then throw the whole weight of your purse upon the main stuff of your curtains and the bands they are to be crossed with . Any lady who can trim her own hat can trust herself to lay bands of harmonious color across the ground-work of her curtains . These should be separated one from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color affecting another . The Cottiers , and Morris , Marshall &amp; Company of London , have been very successful with these banded curtains , and the laces and fringes they make are most beautiful in execution and in texture , and telling in design by virtue of their quaint simplicity . It must be admitted that curtains made up of these bands and laces on a ground of soft woolen stuff though most delightful to the eye and to the touch , are far from cheap ; but it is not necessary , even for the enjoyment of the eye , to have the costliest ; and there are simple combinations enough to be made . But the most beautiful ought to be seen once to get the eye in tune . How to hang our pictures is the next worry after curtains , and yet the way out of this wood is as clear or clearer than the other . Our plaster walls are not made for driving nails into , and they are easily defaced if we try to drive nails into them without the aid of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with his hammer and we set him at tapping the wall like a woodpecker to find the solid places by the sound , and then put in his nails at a venture . And then we are the slaves of the studding timbers , and our pictures must hang where they will , not where we will . The first device for getting more liberty was that of fixing a permanent brass or iron rod along the upper part of the wall just under the cornice , and hanging the pictures from that , moving them back and forth till we had them where we wanted them . But this has a clumsy look and a mechanical , and suggests the notion that we are taking advantage of an accidental gas-pipe to suspend our pictures from . We want something simpler and less obtrusive than this , which is only suited to a public hall ; and what seems to just hit the mark , is a strip of wood shaped as described in cut No. 6 , and nailed along the wall at any height desired . Ordinarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornice ; but this depends upon the height of the room . If the room is a very lofty one , by fixing the strip some distance below the cornice , we avoid the monotony of a number of cords or wires spreading over the wall , and we can utilize the space thus left between the strip and the cornice by hanging there some casts , or pieces of armor , or objects of any kind that will bear being hung above the level of the eye . Very few things do bear this-I mean , of things that are of a size to bring into our houses at all ; but there may be such , and while we should like to have them on the wall of our living-room , we do not want them to drive things away that need nearer looking at . No picture ought to be hung higher than the height of the average human eye when the owner of the eye is standing . It is the almost universal rule in our houses to hang pictures much above this level , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait , or if it have human faces in it , its eyes should look as nearly into ours as possible ; and if there be no such simple guide , perhaps a good rule will be to have the line that divides the picture horizontally into equal parts level with the eye . If one starts in hanging pictures with the determination to place them so that they can be easily seen and enjoyed without stretching the neck the least , or stooping the body , he will be pretty sure to do well . In remote farm-houses and country taverns we often see pictures , particularly portraits , skyed as high as if their owners had been Academy Hangers , and the painters young rivals of a new school . I suppose the reason is that the simple-hearted owners think a picture such a precious thing , it ca n't be hung too // 499 qwq room can be made to look small by being overcrowded with furniture , or by having the walls covered with a multitude of small pictures , engravings , and objects , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shelves . And by reversing this way of treating a room , a small room may be made to look almost large , and at any rate will tranquilize the eye and mind instead of fidgeting it . Have nothing in the room in the way of furniture that is not needed-that has not a real use , whether for work or play ; and hang nothing upon the walls that does not need a wall to show it , and that is not worth being shown . One trick of our time I should like to have a word with , and that is , the habit of over-ornamenting everything . It is not merely that we over-ornament ; where ornament is advisable at all this is a natural enough qwq be had from lines well thought out ; the agreeableness of unbroken surfaces where there is no gain in breaking them ; harmony in color , and , on the whole , the ministering to the satisfaction we all have in not seeing the whole of everything at once ,  --  these considerations the makers of our furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have utterly ignored , and the strife has long been , who shall make the loudest chairs and sofas , and give us the most glare and glitter for our money . Just as I had written these deprecating words , I took down my overcoat from where it had been hanging , and , as the loop hesitated a little about slipping off ; I gave a closer look at the hook . It was as ill adapted to its use as the maker could contrive ; cut out apparently from a thick sheet of brass with a dull chisel , the edges left as sharp as the tool would allow , so as to give the loop every opportunity to fray and cut itself free , and each of the branches armed with a little round at the end so as to prevent your getting your coat off in a hurry . However , as a make-weight for all this want of consideration for the utilities , the flat sides of the hook ( which , to tell truth , was cast , and not cut out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely pretty pattern , so that if you had plenty of leisure , or if your coat should detain you some seconds in getting it off the hook , you could improve the time in studying " how to apply art to manufactures . " The dirty people , too , who amuse themselves and make clean people miserable by squirting tobacco-juice over their own and other people 's floors , must be touched now and then , for even they have sensibilities hid deep beneath their thick skins , by the perception that somebody cares even for them , when they see what taste is expended on the decoration of the spit-boxes which they are all the time engaged in making ineffectual efforts to hit . Pretty Greek meanders and guilZc'ches encircle the sacred little vessels , and neo-Greek medallions enshrine heads = of pretty women , and we see how good a thing it is to introduce Art into every-day life , and to disseminate it widely in order to elevate the masses . Even in so small a thing as this strip of wood on which our pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of ornament . Remember that ornament can not be produced without time and money , and it is as foolish as it is wrong to waste these by investing them where they bring no return . These picture strips are sold in all our picture-frame shops , and the hooks that belong with them are sold with them . Instead of being contented with a good strong line for the profile , such as is shown in our cut , and with a simple strong hook just fitted for its work , the dealer supplies us with a strip of roughlooking wood , " ornamented " on the front with moldings out of all proportion to the size of the strip . The hook that holds the picture-cord is of unpolished brass , left rough as it came from the founder 's mold , . but " ornamented " for all that , by being made an exact counterpart of the molding on the stick . Nothing is gained , either for looks or for utility , by all this fussing . The " ornament " is not of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and the hook has no better grip for being shaped to fit the molding . It is very well to have thought of the simple device , but if the deviser had No. * . SCREEN , FROM A stopped when he had JAP . PICTURE-BOOK , calculated strain , leverage , and resistance , and been content with making both strip and hook capable of doing all that was to be required of them , he would have produced a much more comely looking contrivance . When the wall space has been divided horizontally into bands agreeably proportioned , so much for the wainscot or for the band of color that answers for wainscot , so much for the frieze or the band of color that answers for frieze , then to my thinking the pictures hung upon the intermediate space , the wall proper , look best hung in a continuous line rather than irregularly , some higher , some lower . As they are sure not to be all the same size , enough irregularity will be secured by following the suggestion // that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , if an exact symmetry be not insisted upon , but the pictures hung with reference to where they individually look best and can be best seen , we shall find the whole room will look the better for this reasonableness . There is one advantage this way of suspending pictures by a hook resting upon a strip has over the usual way  --  the picture can be easily unshipped in case of need . No doubt many valuable pictures have been destroyed by fire in consequence of the cord by which they were hung refusing to leave the nail or hook from which it was suspended . The writer knows of one very beautiful portrait by Copley  --  a portrait of a lovely woman painted by the artist for his own pleasure-which was burned up with the house it adorned , because no knife was at hand to cut the cord that held it , and it could not be untwisted from the old hook that held it . The hook we recommend can be displaced in a moment if needed , but I still think it better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so as both to get rid of the too much cord , and to have the hook within broomstick-distance. it is just as easy to hang a picture by a single line of cord as by two lines diverging from the point of suspension  --  the common way . A very large or long picture should be hung by a cord at each end , each cord depending from its own hook . These vertical lines are much more agreeable to the eye than the diverging lines , and make a useful contrast to the horizoiftal lines of the wall division . But I do n't think the means by which a picture is suspended ought to be concealed , or kept at all . out of sight . There ought to be a cord that not only is , but that seems to be , sufficient for its work . And it is our fault if we can not make these cords harmonize with the wall on which they are to appear as lines . Cuts Nos. 7 and 8 were drawn for me by Mr. Lathrop , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment of rooms in country-houses in the upper story , or in what is sometimes called the Mansard , where the outside wall on one or two sides slopes inward , following the line of the roof . Cut No. 4 is a corner of the room above the room two ends of which were shown in the January number of ScRIBNER , cuts No. 6 and 7 . The building was once the carriage-house of a dwelling of which the oldest portion was built in the second half of the last century . The carriage-house was contemporary with this oldest portion , and was built , after the sensible fashion of those times , with stone walls two feet thick . The lower room is about nine feet high , and the loft above was floored with thick oak planks resting on beams of oak . At a later day this loft was con*'erted into a billiard-room ; the roof was raised and supported on brick walls carried up on the outer edge of the thick stone walls so as to leave half their depth available for a shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the ends being differently treated . The stone wall is cased with wood , and the brick plastered wall above it is lathed and plastered , and the result is not only that a pretty decorative effect is produced , but that we gain two substantial points in comfort . No. 12 . PARLOR FIRE-PLACE . No. 13 . , SNUGGERY FIRE-PLACE. // First , we are pushed out by the stone wall so far into the room that we ca n't bump our heads against the ceiling . Then we get a most useful and handy shelf along the two sides of the room , which takes the place of a dozen tables . And a third advantage is that we get a good piece of perpendicular wall on which to hang pictures , a mirror , casts , etc. , etc . Nobody who has not seen it can have a complete notion of what a comfortable , cozy and picturesque result this arrangement produces . In its origin it was purely accidental ; but it would be a good thing to copy , and seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating these rooms with sloping sides . The second cut , No. 8 , is another solution of the same problem ; but this belongs to a modern-built house , and the owner , who was not the builder ( if he had been , such a thoughtful architect as he is would bave left no flaw nor botches in his work ) , has been obliged to take things as he found them . The sloping ceiling starts from a point nearer the floor in this instance than in the other , leaving just room enough to put some low bookshelves against the upright portion in one place , and a sort of deep cupboard against it in another . In the corner an easel serves the purpose of a wall , and supports a watercolor drawing ( and in this case what a lovely , tender specimen it is of the beloved old master , Hill ) ; while in front of the easel such a comfortable , low , roomy Chinese bamboo chair invites us to its embraces , that we ca n't get nearer to the sloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have devised such a combination of luxury as this chair ? A low platform beneath the seat slides out on easy rollers , and we have a lounging seat . The back is lowered to a lower angle , and we have a bed ; while the two flat , capacious arms , long and broad , and just the right height , are a library shelg a writing table , a dining table , or a rest for the chess-board . And all so quietly managed and so free frow fuss ! There 's a shop in Broadway where a harmless young man is employed to exhibit a newly devised chair , in a window , to the well-known crowd that wanders up and down the street , from morn to dewy eve , with nothing to do but to look at other people working for a living . This . young man , who certainly earns his living , goes through an immense deal of exercise in showing off his chair . He shoots it out into a bed , makes it up with imaginary bedclothes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he has a nightmare dream , and springs up as if he were shot , and gives the cogs another wrench , and makes the bed into a table , which he sets out with china and eatables , regardless of cheapness . The inventor having forgotten to provide chairs for the company , the eating the banquet has to be dispensed with , and the young man , joyful at his escape from an indigestion , dances abo.ut , turns more cogs , and applies himself , by means of his tongue and a lead pencil , to doing up a great deal of correspondence , still with no chair to sit on , at a writing desk that has been made by upsetting the dinner table and turning the bed inside out . There is , in fact , nothing that ca n't be made out of that piece of furniture ; but , although the young man comes up smiling after every gymnastic feat , the spectators seem impressed with the fact that the advantages of the chair are dearly bought at such a sacrifice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next window-show . All that was pretended to be accomplished by this elaborate machinery is done without effort and without loss of time by this simple cheap Chinese chair , and with far more comfortable results . Light cushions are easily added , and , covered by tasteful womanly hands , make the chair more easy to the invalid or old person , who has more leisure than the most of us to enjoy it ; but the well person does not need such additions , for the bamboo makes a sufficiently soft and springy seat . The owner of this sky parlor and of its belongings has found a use for Japanese scrolls that shows boxy fit they are for decoration , and yet that to use them for this purpose does not oblige us to fix them permanently on the walls . One end of the roll lies on the book-case or cupboard under the sloping roof , and being held in its place by a book or bronze laid in front of it , the other end is carried up and fastened at the angle where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two scrolls in the drawing are decorated with colored figures on a gold ground , and they light up the corner of the room very cheerfully , and so take off from the stiffness of the ceiling-angles , giving , though quite unintentionally , something of a tent-like expression to the room . Of course , it would not often be desirable to use the scrolls in this way ; but rooms roofed like this are common enough , and this hint may help some one who does not know how to use the sloping wall . // In our small New York  --  or why not say our small American-rooms , since a large room is certainly the exception ? - in our small American rooms , then , we want to leave the floor as free as possible , and to put on the walls whatever can be conveniently given to their keeping . The Moorish gun-rack , cut No. 9 , which Mr. Lathrop has copied from the photograph of one of Regnault 's pictures , " The Guardian of the Harem , " an Algerian subject , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the shelf above it , a most convenient hat-and-umbrella-rack for the entry ; but , of course , its pleasantest use would be to support some choice arms on the rack , and vases , or casts , on the shelves . With the Turks and Algerians these shelves are common enough , and they are painted all over in bright , harmonious colors ; flowers and ornaments on a blue or green-blue ground  --  the same sort of decoration that is seen on their camphor trunks , and on cradles and family chests and cupboard doors in Germany . If it could only be done well by our ordinary painters-if they had the natural eye and feeling for it which even these rough Turks and rude Fatherland peasants have , we could get a little more color and cheerfulness into our rooms . But we are driven for anything of this sort to the most expensive places , and whatever we get there is a luxury , and we have to watch over our purchases and our dearly bought decorations as if they were croupy children . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging-shelves , or 6tag*res , as we like to call shelves in French . They sometimes have little cupboards below the shelves in which frail objects of curiosity , or beauty , or both in one , can be kept under lock and key . This clearing of the floor and so making up someWhat for the scrimped rooms we most of us have to live in , is a point of no little importance in relation to comfort , and yet it is one we seldom give much thought to . The tendency is to crowd our rooms beyond their capacity , by which we make ourselves very uncomfortable , and destroy the value , as decoration , of many pieces , and their real usefulness as articles of furniture . What with easels , chairs not meant for use , little teetery stands , pedestals , and the rest of the supernumerary family filling up the room left by the solid and supposed useful pieces , it is sometimes a considerable test of one 's dexterity and presence of mind to make one 's way from end to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance was as nothing to it . In such an enterprise these unfortunate people are much to be pitied ( they are all men , of course ) , whose feet are not only too large for the work they have to do , but are unmanageable besides , and always throwing out to right and left , and getting their owner into scrapes . A New York parlor of the kind called " stylish , " where no merely useful thing is permitted , and where nothing can be used with comfort , is always overcrowded ; things are bought from pure whim , or because the buyer does n't know what to do with her money ; and as the parlor is only used on what are called state occasions , what would be the good of having easygoing , comfortable things in it ? So everything bought for show goes there ; and as the temptation to New York rich people is to be all the time buying things for show , the inevitable result is , that in time the intruding camel crowds out the occupant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five wood-cuts that have been lost like little Bo-peep 's sheep , and are just now come up cheerfully huddling together , at the very tail-end of time . Cut No. io is of a writingdesk , which looks plain enough ; but the eye of faith can enjoy its solidity , the elegance of its moldings , and the dead luster of its black surface relieved here and there with mahogany-red or russet details . No. ii is a good hint for a screen , out of a Japanese picture-book ; the stand is framed together and decorated with a painted pattern , and the screen itself is made of breadths of some prettily patterned material hanging loose by rings from the topmost rail . These strips are sexved together at the top , but near the bottom they are allowed to part , and the decorated framing of the screen shows between the openings . Nos. 12 and 13 are specimens of the small grates I spoke of in a former article , as promised us by the Cottiers . They are now come , and are even better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the patterns , and some of his prettiest poetry has got itself mixed up with this cast-iron work , and is quite at home there .
