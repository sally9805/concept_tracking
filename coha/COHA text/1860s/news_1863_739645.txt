txt The important question , whether liberated slaves can be made to work as hired laborers , is being tested pretty extensively in Lower Louisiana . It has been discovered that the slaves within the parishes exempted from the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation are virtually emancipated by the fact that they are within our military lines ; and as they amount to many thousands , and their former masters have very generally remained on their plantations , the latter , under the advice and with the cooperation of Gen. BANKS , have held consultations among themselves , and come to terms with their ex-slaves , as to their future relations with each other . No general plan has been adopted , each planter making such terms with the negroes as he finds convenient or possible . Our New-Orleans correspondent gives , this morning , a copy of the rules which have been drawn up by an old citizen of Louisiana for the management of his plantation , the labor on which is performed by his freed slaves ; and their practicability is confirmed by an efficient negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work any gang of negroes successfully . The rules provide that the negroes shalt labor the usual number of hours , and receive about their usual supplies of food ; but besides this , they are to get wages , averaging from $3 to $10 a month  --  one-half of it at the end of each month , the balance at the end of the year . Various punishments are prescribed for bad conduct , and rewards tor good conduct  --  such as will appeal to the sensibilities , instincts and interests of the negro . The rules are in the main excellent , and if equally good ones have been adopted and are rigidly enforced on the other plantations , we do not see that anything better could be desired for the Louisiana or any other negroes . The plan is the best that has been adopted in any of those parts of the South occupied by our army  --  as no military supervision or interference is called for . The working of these , free-neerci-labor schemes will be watched with great interest .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
