txt Earl RUSSELL , in his recent speech to the House of Lords on the rescinding of the Reciprocity Treaty , entered upon a defence ot the conduct of England , against several of our charges against her . The first one to which he referred was the complaint which has been urged , that she hastened to grant to the rebels belligerent rights , as soon as she heard of the breaking out of the rebellion . We /lave complained that this act of hers was an unfriendly one , was done with undue haste , and indicated a disposition incompatible with the relations which had existed between England and this country . Earl RUSSELL 'S defence on this point is , that on learning that the President of the Unites Slates had declared the coasts of the Southern States to be under blockade , he consulted with the Lord Chancellor , Lord CAMPBELL and the law officers of the Crown as to the course to be pursued , and he says : ? Lord CAMPBELL declared , as we all supposed he would do , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to regard the blockade on the part of the United States as the exercise of a belligerent right ? and as belligerent rights can not be confined to one party , but are usually exercised against somebody else , our advisers told us that we were entitled to recognize the existence of belligerent rights on the part of both of the combatants , and to declare Her Majesty 's neutrality between the two parties  --  and this . accortaIngly , was the course which we recommended . " Admitting , for the sake of the argument , the correctness of the law , as laid down by the Lord Chancellor , it 1. vill be noticed that it only goes to the extent of holding that England was " entitled " to recognize the existence of belligerent rights on the part of the rebels  --  not that she was required to do so . The Lord Chancellor could hardly have gone so far as that . Now , all the world knows that a man or a nation may act in. a very unfriendly way , and yet do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house catches fire , your neighbor is uefloubtedly entitled to devote all his time nod labor to getting Water ready to save his own house , if it catches , and not help you put out the fire on your roof . But if the danger to his house is very slight , so that he could just as well not help you , his act may he nevertheless an unfriendly one . Especially may you be justified in deeming it such , it you find him rejoicing to see it burn , and dilating upon the rilproved prospect which he will have from his windows when your house is out of the way . In fact , our complaint has been rather that England 's action was unfriendly than illegal . And whether it was unfriendly or not does not depend merely upon whether England was entitled by national law to do as she did . If , on looking over her past history , we find that in similar cases her action has been different , we may well ask her what is the cause of the difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may well infer that inasmuch as she has made a difference against us , it sprang from some reason not compatible with good will and good neighborhood . And it will be noted that Earl RUSSELL gives no other reason whatever for England 's course , than that she was " entitled " to pursue it . Now there are at least three instances , in which , under similar circumstances , Eng . land 's course of action has been entirely different . In May , , 1828 , the Prince Regent of Portugal declared a part of the coast of Portugal to be under blockade . The British Foreign Office probably consulted with the legal advisers of the Crown , and if so it received similar views of the law to those expressed by Lord CAMPBELL , unless these latter must be held to be new views , and England was doubtless as much " entitled " to recognize belligerent rights as belonging to the insurrectionists in Oporto in 1828 as to the rebels in Charleston in 1861 . But the British For-eign Office contented itself with sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyds , that British ship-owners might govern themselves in accordance with this state of blockade . Later in the year a similar blockade was announced of Funchal , in Madeira . But there was no recognition of belligerent rights by England . Again , in 1830 , when a rebellion arose in the Netherlands and the King had declared " the coast of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , belonging to the province of South Flanders , together with the ports thereof , as well as the ports of Antwerp and Ghent , " to be in a state of blockade , there was again no recognition by England of these insurrec tionists as belligerents , but only a notice again from the Foreign Office of the existence of the blockade . Why was it that England acted so differently in our case ? We could hardly expect E trl RUSSELL to give a true answer to the question , but every one feels that it was not because she was any more " entitled " to recognize our rebels as belligerents than those of Portugal or Holland , but in cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wcs quite willing to see it succeed . A. d was because of the prevalence ot this feeling among the governing classes of England , that E try RUSSELL says " the course ot neutrality afloice.1 was received with favor , and cem invaded itself to the country as the nigh : course to take .
