A PINCH OF SALT . " Salt is good . " - *vt . Mark ix . 50 . Tim servant of the great chemist Berzelius was once approached by one of his countrymen with the question , " What is that chemistry , by which they say your master has made himself so famous ? " " I will tell you , " was the ready answer . " First , I have to fetch all manner of things in large vessels ; then he pours them into bottles , and at last into quite small phials ; when he has done that , he pours them all once more into two big buckets , which I carry out and empty into the river . That is chemistry . " The popular idea of the science is not much clearer in our day . The name conjures up , in many minds , a large laboratory* with quaint retorts and vile smells , or at best a huge factory sending forth clouds of disgusting smoke . In many a lively imagination the chemist is still surrounded by stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's admirable etching , and his labors are looked upon with timid admiration and doubtful wonder ; for the alchemist has not yet entirely faded away into a myth , and the Black Art has still its votaries in our midst . Few among us are really aware how deeply and practically the chemist ' * science affects our daily life and contributes to our happiness upon earth . And yet he has a duty to perform which ranks but little below the very highest that falls to the lot of man here below . He is the self-appointed guardian of the indestructible part of our globe . Man glories in his absolute sway over all Nature , whose gifts he employs for his pleasure , and whose creatures he treats as his vassals . But his dominion is of short duration , and soon Nature resumes her own sway again , unimpeded by his hand . He wrests massive rocks from her bosom , and tears gigantic trees from their ancient homes , and changes them into houses and palaces and ships ; he digs into the bowels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useful tools , or he transforms even the worthless sand and the shapeless clay into costly wares of brilliant splendor . But a few years pas away , and his beautiful handiwork changes in shape and in color ; a century more , and they crumble into ust . His magnificent temples , his lofty walls , his graceful bridges , his proud in numents that wer to give immortality to his name and his deeds-they all succumb , sooner or later , to the silent but unfailing efforts of Nature to r claim her own children . What the waters of the ocean and the winds of heaven have left undestroyed , falls under the unseen attacks of frost and rain and heat . A worms fe d under the green turf on hi body , fearfully and wonderfully made though it was , so tiny lichens and minute mosses consume , little by little , his beli ks and his pyramids . Diminutive seeds* flying uns en thr ugh the air , come and nestle in the cracks and crevices of his castles and palaces , and strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while treacherous ivy sends its tendrils into every cleft of the ruin* . Insects , creeping about by night , undermine the foundations of c lossal tructures , and animal-life teems crc long among the d*bri8 of his loftiest edifices . The trees he has planted and the animals he has raised , return to the dust from whence they sprang ; the wood he has carved with cunning craft , decays into impalpable powder ; the metals he has wrought into shapes of wondrous beauty , are eaten up by rust , and the very stones he has piled up in lofty structures , are consumed l* wind and weather . And whither go all these fading , fleeting elements , which thus continually pass from his sight , and return , as he calls it , to the bosom of their mother // Nature ? The chemist alone can answer the question ; for he alone watches them forever , and never for a moment fails to trace them to their new home , though they assume , with Protean power , a thousand new forms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marvellous changes . But his power is greater yet . For this knowledge of the eternal duration of the elements in nature endows him with a power that might almost be called creative ; for though he may not absolutely produce them out of naught , like the one great Creator above us , he can at least make them assume the form which he wishes . He can take the dust , that seems worthless , and endow it with priceless value ; lie can gather impalpable powder and hardly perceptible vapor , and bid them combine in a form that shall rejoice our eye by its beauty , and prove itself a blessing like few others to all mankind . One of the most striking instances of this power is the manner in which his science transforms an unsightly gift of nature into the most precious boon that man receives at her hands  --  a little gray substance into a priceless crystal , far more valuable than all the most costly jewels he possesses , and indispensable to his very existence upon earth . This precious treasure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far down in the darkest recesses of the earth , in times when fierce fires raged below ; and there it has lain for thousands of years , along with countless little grains of like shape , never seeing a beautiful flower by its side or hearing the sweet notes of a bird as it sings of spring and budding love . Its ancestors were two strange beings , that have but quite lately become known to us : a metal with a silver sheen and a gas of yellowish-green color . The former is perhaps the oddest of its kind . Other metals are heavy and hard ; this is so light that it swims on the water , and so soft that it can be cut with a knife and kneaded with the hand . Other metals resist all impressions from without ; this is so yielding that if exposed for a little while to damp air , it oxydizes quickly and changes into a white powder ! While its near cousins , gold and silver , sink quickly to the bottom of a vessel filled with water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnome of the mountains , and the little silvery globes , in which it is ordinarily seen , swim merrily for a while on the surface . But after a few moments , they begin to glow and to shine like liquid fire , and now perform a dance so weird and wild that it startles us by its strange , fantastic figures . The smooth surface of the water becomes the well-polished floor of a ball-room , on which the bright pearls of shining metal perform their quaint dance like enchanted princesses dressed in silver robes . If you attempt to hold the lovely little dames by force , they know at once how to escape from your violence and to regain their liberty . A beautiful bluish flame begins to surround the little globules , and a few moments after the metal has vanished . No trace is left , and only the peculiar smell of the water betrays their secret : they have sought refuge in the friendly element , and water , the stanch enemy of fire from of old and ever ready to conquer it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magicians to burn , for a little while , in a bright , flickering flame , before it could afford them a new home and safe shelter . Nor is the other ancestor of the tiny grain less odd in its nature . While every other substance on earth has some shape and form of its own , by which it may be known , and even water , though ever changing and restless , never fails to fashion itself in lovely globules , Chlorine has no form or substance of its own . Like a prince of the air , it passes unheeded through the atmosphere , visible only as a faint , yellowish-green vapor . You catch it and imprison it in a glass , you compress it by all the means at your disposal with terrible force , and at last it comes down , reluctantly , in the shape of a bubbling liquid . But relieve it for a moment of the enormous pressure , and it rises instantly again as a vapor , and escapes from your grasp . // Unfit to be breathed by man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momeats , it yet is not merely fatal to life , but has its good use in the wonderful household of nature , where every atom finds its noble vocation , and serves its great though often unseen purpose to the glory of the Most High . Chlorine has been endowed with a truly wonderful power of combining with all other elements without exception , and hence becomes of vast importance to the chemist and the manufacturer . But it serves us most faithfully where danger threatens us most nearly , and carries oft ; with unfailing fidelity , the death-bringing gases of wells and neglected cellars , and purifies our sick-rooms and hospitals . These two strange beings , the flitting gas with its repulsive color and fatal breath , and the quaint metal whose merry dance forces water to turn into fire , scel* each other , throughout nature , with unceasing longing . And yet , whenever they meet , they embrace each other only for a moment , and for their own destruction . The bright silvery substance has no sooner been breathed upon by the foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that remains of the two is a tiny crystal of white color and silvery sheen . You examine it closely , and von find that it resembles a hollow cube ; every minute particle of the grain is clear and transparent , like the most perfect of crystals , and it is only when many are lying close to each other that the broken rays of linht give them a pure , white hue . The poisonous power of chlorine and the fiery nature of sodinm have utterly disappeared , and in their stead man is presented by his beneficent mother Nature with a little grain of salt , without which his life would be a burden and happiness upon earth forever out of question ! Fortunately , Nature is as bountiful as she is wise , and hence the indispensable grain of salt is provided by her with such a lavish hand , that it may be found in immense quantities all over the earth . The land hides it in its dark eaves , and holds it forth in large shining masses on the surface ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave to the bottomless abyss . For the unsightly grain , little noticed by careless man , and taken as a matter of course by most of us , is the great guardian of health throughout our world ; without it the waters of the earth would soon stink with corruption and all flesh would be foul with decay ; without it the plants would no longer deck the land with their beauty , and man would die a death of misery and unspeakable horror . Hence , the mercy of the Creator has scattered it broadcast over our domain , and we have but to stretch out our hand to gather the precious gift from on high . Far away , in Eastern Europe , the traveller comes upon a long , low range of hills , stretching from east to west , which enclose , with their soft outlines and well-wooded slopes , a lovely valley , dotted here and there with smaller hills and little knolls . A cluster of low but well-kept houses lies towards the opening , from which he approaches the plain , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a busy scene to which he comes , and men are moving briskly about through the narrow streets and the countless paths that lead over the common . They wear a strange costume of sombre black , and have thick leather aprons tied on behind instead of in front ; but they look cheerful and happy , and many a merry song and sweet carol is heard far and near . The traveller engages one of these men , who all greet him with a pious wish for his soul 's welfhre , to show him the way into the mysterious world below , of which he has heard much ; and soon lie finds himself arrayed in a white blouse and black velvet cap , such as are kept ready for visitors , at the mouth of a shaft which seems to dead down to the very bowels of the earth . When his eye has become somewhat better accustomed to the dim light of the candle stuck in his hat , he notices that wooden rails are laid all the way down the gentlyinclined plane ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hobby-horse of our happy // childhood . The miner sits down before him ; the horse- a sausage , it is called in local parlance-starts with alarming swiftness on the smooth , oiled rails , and his right hand , armed with a stout , leathern gauntlet , grasps frantically the rope that runs along the wall , to check the painful velocity . At last the two horsemen are stopped , by reaching a piece of level ground , and the traveller finds himself in a vast , subterranean corridor , cut out of the live salt . Huge blocks of the precious material are lying about , some colorless , some shining in beautiful though subdued blue ; the roof rises high above him , and looks gray and grim in the dim light , and on his right the vaulted ceiling rests on gigantic pillar* , in which each tiny grain shines brightly and sparkles as the light falls upon it ; and yet they all hold so firmly to each other that there is no danger of their ever giving way and proving faithless to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work ; they attack the mountain-side by cutting out immense blocks in the shape of huge casks ; then water is poured down the furrows , and allowed to remain standing there a few days , so as to soften the rock ; at the proper time wedges are driven in , which soon swell in the water and blast out , as it were , without further help from human hands , the great blocks in the desired form . As the traveller wanders on through the long dark passa*es , with statues in niches and holy images at the corners , he passes large vaulted rooms , dark caves , and huge recesses , that seem to have no end , and at times he comes upon stairs , cut in the rock , which he has to descend cautiously , so smooth and slippery ' is the material of which they are formed . Every now and then he sees , at a distance , a bell-shaped shaft , from the top of which hangs a frail ladder , free in the air , swaying and swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetually ; and he looks with wonder *and fear at the poor miner , who trembles and crosses himself piously , as he sets foot on the slim rounds and descends slowly into the apparently unfathomable darkness below . All of a sudden he sees bright lights before him , and , dazzled and surprised , he enters a vast cathedral , the walls of which shine and shimmer all around in fanciful , flitting lights , as the light of torches and candles fall upon the bright masses of salt ; there is the altar with its colossal cross , and at the side the organ and choir ; here also statues and images abound on all sides , and even human worshippers , kneeling down in silent adoration , are cut out in the yielding material . He has little relish , perhaps , for the vast ball-room , with its orchestra on high and its brilliant chandeliers , glittering and glistening like the fairest of crystals , and bedchambers with ocking couches ; for the whole upper world is repeated here below in grotesque caricature . Gradually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left , and at last the traveller is forced to bend , until he fairly creeps along on all fours . But suddenly he sees before him a fairy scene : dark waters , sparkling bright in the light of torches fastened to the glistening walls . Like a vast black mirror , the subterranean lake , silent and motionless , stretches far into the endless darkness . Never has wing of bird dipped its feathers into the mysterious water ; never has a breath of air ruffled its placid , patient surface . Like walls of iron , the rocks of salt rise all around in grim solemnity , and hold the restless element bound in eternal silence and peace . The scene is beautiful , and yet fearful in its utter loneliness and death-like stillness . A few shells and dd*ris of marineplants are found on the banks of the black tarn , but they belong to generations as old as the Deluge . No life has ever been known to grace the lake . Only ages and ages ago , when the waters that now rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the mountain-side , they bore with them the tiny houses of friendly animals ; and in their wanderings through the hidden depths of the earth , carried them with them to their silent home . At the further // end , to which the traveller is rowed in a crazy punt , a little chapel rises , unpretending and unhonored , and yet of great import . It is devoted to the memory of the pious wife of one of Poland 's early kings , to whom Heaven vouchsafed , in 1252 , the boon of bestowing the knowledge of these wondrous treasures on her impoverished subjects . She was afar off in Hungary , the legend says , and hearing there of the fearful suffering of her native land , she wa ordered , by her patron-saint , to east a precious ring , which she most valued of all her trinkets , into a deep well . She did it in simple faith , and , when she returned to her home at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains , some peasants brought her a piece of rocksalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of no value in itself , but , oh wonder ! in the heart of the transparent mass her ring lay imbedded . She understoo* the revelation from on highordered search to be made for more of the shining substance , and thus were discovered the great mines of Wieliczka , which have ever since been a source of greater wealth than the richest mines of gold or of diamonds . Beyond the little chapel the work begins once more , and miners are seen busy loosening vast lumps of salt from the parent mass , blasting the less pure material with powder , and cutting out the more valuable blocks carefully with chisel and chipping-knife . Others harness the twelve horses , that are kept below and have never seen the light of heaven , to rude sledges , on which the blocks are drawn to the foot of the shafts , that lead up to the world above ; while still others are opening new passages or propping up dangerous places with large wooden pillars . With a feeling of pity for their hard work and thankfulness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , returning their friendly greeting , and gladly beholds once more , as he rises to the top of the shaft , the bright light of day and the fresh air of the earth above . Thus the salt is found crystallized in large beds and boulders , stowed away between layers of clay and limestone , in more or less regular shapes , and then called rock-salt . Nearly every part of our globe is endowed with vast deposits of the kind . Bergen in Norway , and Cardona in Spain , vie with each other in the abundance of their supply . In the latter place , a huge mountain of almost pure salt rises clear and sheer from the plain , the whole mass shining brilliantly like a glacier in the sunlight , or glittering in a thousand hues and shades , when day fades away . The salt here is so hard that it has to be blasted , like real rock , with gunpowder , and the chips are worked up by skilful hands into snuff boxes , crosses , and rings . Norwich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than seventy-five miles long ; Salzburg proudly bears the name of its staple product ; and Mexico and Persia , the East and the , Vest , are all full of ample supplies , which , by God 's providence , have been laid up in store fer many generations to come . Not in all parts of the world , however , is salt found so pure as to be fit for immediate consumption . Generally it is mixed up with clay and sand , and then has to be purified by the aid of water . Man leads the purifying element down to the beds of rock-salt , allows it to dissolve as much as it is capable of holding , and then raises it , by vast pump-works , once more to the surface of the earth . In vast kettles and pans , beneath which huge fires burn day and night , the brine is then evaporated , and white crystals of salt remain , pure and unadulterated , at the bottom and on the sides of the vessels . In other regions Nature is even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water down to the depths in which salt is hidden . Large rivers beneath the ground are led , by the hand that holds the earth in its grasp , over extensive deposits of salt , and then break forth as saline springs at the side of the mountain . Thus there is near Minden , in Prussia , a well nearly two thousand feet deep , which holds a water , the temperature of which exceeds // 717 250 R6aumur , and which is , below , continually dissolving large blocks of salt , in order to gush forth above and bring the precious gift up to the surface . Germany boasts of not less than eighty such valuable springs ; and our own country is most richly endowed in like manner , so that the two States of New York and Virginia could supply , if need be , the whole of the Union with the salt they require . Brilliant as it appears in the shape of rock-salt , and pleasing as are the waters of saline springs to the eye , salt yet presents itself , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words can describe the horror of the vast salt-plains , which here and there interrupt the beautiful carpet that covers the surface of our earth . Thus there is a vast district in South America , extending over more than twenty thousand square miles , which forms one enormous group of desolate mountains , intersected with vast deserts , saline swamps , and dried-up salt-lakes . Currents of hot air meet here from all parts of the compass , and with such vehemence and persistent fury , as they rise incessantly from the heated , steaming soil , that no clouds can be formed and no rain can fall from the ever-serene sky . Even more fearful yet is an endless , lifeless plain in the heart of Persia , so sterile and accursed that even saline plants do not thrive here ; but the salt itself , as if in bitter mockery , fashions its crystals in the form of stems and stalks , and covers the steppe with a carpet of unique vegetation , glittering and glistening like an enchanted prairie in the dazzling light of the Eastern sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broken and vegetation is favored by night-dews , a few straggling herbs and grasses appear ; but they are saturated with salt and soda , the sap tastes bitter and salty , and stalks and leaves alike are covered with a thick incrustation of salt , as if with impalpable powder . They afford no nutriment to the herds , and soon give way again to the genuine salt-desert , where shepherd and flock alike find their death . For here a light , loose sand rules supreme , now treacherously quiet , but sure to engulf the heedless herdsman who puts his foot on the glistening surface , and is swiftly sucked in by the tricky soil ; and now rising in large , deep-red clouds , which fill the valleys and level the ridges , till every landmark is effaced , and the whole vast region resembles a petrified ocean of blood-red waters . Who can describe the bitter , mournful disappointment of the thirsty traveller , who sees , at last , afar ofl the web come glittering of waters , and hastens , with renewed vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! For as he approaches , the fairy spectacle strikes him with wonder and sad misgivings . In the midst of the brown , desolate plain , a vast level sheet of pure white stretches far and near ; he draws nearer , with faltering , doubtful step , and sees , at last* to his horror and dismay , that what he fancied a basin of coo , refreshing water , is nothing more than a white crust of salt . Or , it may be , he descends , with cager expectation , the steps hewn in the precipitous walls of an ancient crater in South America , of which Darwin tells us , in order to reach the little circular lake , embosomed among rugged fields of lava , and fringed with a border of bright-green , succulent plants . As he looks down from the immense tuft crater , he sees the water clearly , and fancies his ear even discerns the pleasant splash against the modest beach ; but when he reaches the lake and dips his parched lips into the liquid , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brackish , and unfit for the use of man . Other travellers tell us of the sad fate of black slaves who work in the saltplains of the Sahara , collecting the salt from the surface , hundreds of miles away from the nearest oasis , and sure to perish by hunger and thirst , if the caravan that is to bring them food and water should lose its way in the desert or fall into the hands of merciless robbers . Even Europe is not free from these unfortunate places , which seem to bear the curse of Sodom and Gomorrah , and // have become what Zephaniah threatens , " a breeding of nettles , and salt-pits , and a perpetual desolation . " Here nothing grows but impoverished looking plants , with pale , bluish-green color and faded blossoms , which give to tbe region an air of overwhelming monotony and ghastly sterility . The burning rays of the sun are mercilessly reflected from the white crust of salt , which covers the soi , with such fierceness , that the eyes are unable to bear the unearthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge cracks and crevices , burned , as it is , to the core , and but rarely refreshed by scanty rain or nightly dew . How did these desolate lakes originate , and whence come the bubbling springs , which so industriously bring up to their master the salt he needs for his life ? The question , for a long time , defied the wisest among men ; but modern science has solved the riddle , at least with regard to the latter . We know now that the water that comes in the shape of snows and rains from the skies and of the dew distilled near the surface , slowly but surely finds its way , through the porous crust of the earth , down to the interior of mountains and far below the level of plains . It stops not till it meets with a layer of firm rock , which prevents it from sinking still lower ; and here , on the unyielding stone , it forms , gradually , subterranean lakes ; the waters are not at rest yet , but silently and steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and thus they become saturated , now with sulphur or salt , and now with minerals of every kind . When man discovers such a spot , he sinks a shaft to the basin below , and at once the waters , relieved of the pressure , leap up in wild joy at their return to the bright light from which they came , and rise as high , once more , as the place where they first entered the earth . Science tells us , of course , that there must ever be found , near such springs , large beds of salt ; and this has led , of late , to most valuable discoveries of immense deposits in Germany and in France . The origin of extensive surface-beds of salt , such as are found in the vast steppes near the Caspian Sea and the Aral , high above the surrounding country and far beyond the reach of supplies from a distance , is less clearly understood . Some believe that they are the beds of ancient oceans , from which the water has gradually evaporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This explanation may apply to the Siberian salt-plains , which , like the Sahara , were no doubt once the bottoms of great oceans , drained by some fearful upheaving of the ground or the breaking down of gigantic walls , which formerly held in the waters of the enormous inland lakes . But with regard to others , None can reply-all seems eternal now . The wilderness has a mysterious tongue , Which teaches awful doubt . Others think that the salt , which now glistens on the surface , once lay buried far below , and was raised , by volcanic upheavings and fiery eruptions , in the shape of boiling brine ; the waters then evaporated , or were carried by rivers into the sea , and the salt remained spread out on the low bottom of the steppes . But this theory would hardly account for the strange fact , that the salt on these immense plains actually grows there ; it is no sooner removed by the hand of man , than it begins to reappear , and ere long the crust is close and compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desert of Dankali in Abyssinia , where , for four days ' journey , nothing is seen but a rank vegetation of apparent plants , with their stems and leaf-stalks , all of salt , and where no effort to clear the soil ever makes the slightest impression . The same has been observed near the Salt Lake of Utah and on the banks of the Mingo Lake in Texas , where the crust of salt is so thick that it can be removed in large blocks , and yet no diminution is ever observed . Where neither masses of rock-salt , nor waters holding large quantities of salt , provide for the wants of man , he knows how to force the very plants that delight , like him , in the precious boon // of nature , to furnish him all he desires . For it is not the miner alone who goes down into the deep of the earth to search for salt , but plants also send down their roots , draw up the saltwater , and deposit the proceeds in beautiful crystals in their cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain in their delicate tissues a certain quantity of salt , especially in the stems and the branches , and leave it behind in their ashes , when they are burned . Some cereals require it , therefore , for their satisfactory growth , and much salt is sown on the broad lands of England and the fields of China ; others , like asparagus and flax , do not thrive at all without such aid . But the growth which surrounds salt-springs and the plants that love to dwell on the seashore , delight in the little grains ; even the lofty cocos-palm sends its large oval fruit adrift , to seek some briny stra*d , where it may find a rich soil and abundance of salt ; and the careful husbandman of those regions , when planting the nut that is to give him his daily bread , drops a handful of salt into the hole , to which he confides the gigantic seed-corn . Here and there , in favored lands , you see a vast , marshy meadow , spread out in beautiful luxuriance before your eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close by one of these groups of low , spreading trees , where the soil almost imperceptibly rises into a little knoll , there gushes forth a clear , powerful spring , and forms , at its very birth , a large , circular basin , filled with transparent water . A rivulet runs from it slowly but steadily , wanders , a.s if enjoying the luxury of leisure , through level meadows , saturating the porous soil on the right and the left , and at last falls , at the edge of the high tableland , with merry laughter , into the lower plain , to bring its modest tribute to the large river below . There are other meadows scattered over the plateau , but not one of them can boast of the bright flowers and waving grasses which here bud and olossom forth in unwonted richness . Thousands of purple asters peep out with their bright eyes , set in golden yellow , from the midst of dense clumps of reeds ; luxuriant plantains overshadow a host of minor plants of strange and uncouth appearance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strewn with an abundahee of small white flowers . Further on , a quaint salicornia appears , in large patches ; its long-linked stem looks as if it would burst , filled , as it seems , to overflowing with exuberant sap , and in the axes between the branches , lurk countless diminutive blossoms of bright yellow . Even the grasses and reeds which cover the marshy ground , when more closely examined , prove to be entirely different from all that grow on adjoining lands . The flocks of birds who have left their homes in the far north , and now , with swift wings , move southward to more genial climes , might fancy they beheld here , once more , the shores on which they last sought rest and repose . For here are the same flowers which they saw there , near the downs ; the same lowly herbs that love to be bathed daily in the briny waters , and the same reeds that grow there within reach of the unfailing tides . For it is a salt-spring which here wells up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any other outlet , has here formed a lake , and furnished food to an exuberant vegetation . It is from these saline plants , growing now near the shores of the ocean , and now far inland around merry springs , that large provisions of salt are won by the aid of fire . The soda or barile of commerce , comes almost exclusively from the ashes of the saltwort , a plant of grayish green color , with stems , a foot long , thickly set with prickly hair , and with uncouth , swollen-lool*ing leaves , ending in sharp , pointed thorns . The Arabs hardly knew what a blessing they bestowed upon mankind , when , upon settling in Spain , they brought with them not only their merino sheep , their cotton and sugar-cane , but also the unsightly saltwort , from which they already // knew how to obtain the soda of our day . Another salt-plant , the leafless glasswort , is eaten as a salad in England and the whole north of Europe ; but the most curious of them all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This strange-looking plant is a treasure to the inhabitants of the Canary Islands , who raise it in large fields , pull it up when ready for use , burn it , and drive a most profitable trade with the soda they obtain from the ashes . It is , however , not the water only which gives us salt , but we owe it also at times , to the benevolence of fire . For , although the beautiful crystals do not become volatile till they are heated to a white glow , they are still not unfrequently found among the strange medley of substances thrown out by volcanoes . After an eruption , the cracks and crevices of Mount Vesuvius are often cov*red with a thick crust of salt , and the surface of petrified streams of lava appears , at times , from the same cause , as if thickly strewn with white powder . In 1822 , the salt cropped out in such very large masses , that the greedy Government of Naples laid an embargo on the treasure , and obtained through its own workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crater . The same takes place occasionally at the foot of Mount Hecla , in Iceland , and the indnstrious peasants . carry whole wagon-loads to their fields and their houses . Such is the history and the home of the precious little grain , which the world , from the beginning , has looked upon with a feeling akin to awe and reverence . For while deeply grateful to the Giver of every good and perfect gift for the tiny crystal , on which life itself is dependent , men have ever felt that it was endowed also with a dread power of final destruction . The ancients had no doubt that salt was a direct gift of the gods , and hence they joined it , symbolically , to every sacrifice offered on holy altars ; and Moses ordained that " every oblation of thy meat shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from the meat-offering : with all thine offering thou shalt offer salt . " The Aztecs of Mexico had a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese celebrate , to this day , an annual feast in honor of him who first introduced it into general use ; and the old Egyptians , when they performed the rites of their great festival in honor of Neith , the mother of life , filled the lamps of their temples with salt as well as with oil . Miraculous powers , also , seem to have been attributed to salt , from olden times ; for the Hebrews used to rub new-born children with it , partly from a belief , sanctioned by Galen , that this hardened and strengthened their skin , and partly from faith in its special blessing . Hence the prophet Ezekiel reproaches the stubborn people , by saying : " Thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all ; " and even the early Christians adhered to the old usage , for they initiated young converts into the mysteries of their faith by placing salt in their mouth , as they did with infants at the time of their baptism . It was but natural , therefore , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in connection with treaties and compacts to render them more binding . The Old Testament is full of allusions to this ancient usage , and Moses already speaks of " a salt-covenant forever before the Lord unto thee and unto thy seed with thee . " Its power to protect against corruption lent its symbolic force to stipulations even among infidels , and few such compacts were made without a plate of salt being placed ready at hand , from which each of the contracting parties eat a few grains , instead of swearing and oath . The Arabs of our day still enter into the most sacred treaty of friendship with each other by pushing a piece of bread , strewn with salt , into each other 's mouth , and then call it a " salt-treaty . " The ancestral salt-cellar , that played so prominent a part in the household of // ancient Romans , was , in like manner , the great symbol of the union , that bound the members of a family to each other . Scarcely less general is , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the productiveness of the soil ; and thus it became , very early , already the symbol of sterility also . Jeremiah cursed Judah , by condemning it " to inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt-land , and not inhabited ; " and the terrible fate of Lot 's wife has left the curse vivid in the memory of men . For the same reason , when Abimelech had destroyed the city of Sichem , and rased its walls to the ground , the place where it had stood was sown with salt , not in order to make it sterile , but as a sign that it should remain waste forever . Even the Middle Ages employed the dread symbol ; and the great Barbarossa , after taking rebellious Milart , and destroying its beautiful buildings , ordered the plough to be passed over the city , and then salt to be strewn on the spot , leaving only the churches unharmed , " for the greater glory of God . " On the other hand , salt makes " unsavory things " palatable again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became usual to speak of it as a symbol of that sagacity which uses apparently worthless matters for a good purpose , and employs words of trifling import in themselves with great effect . This was the first meaning of Attic salt ; hence , also , St. Paul writes , " Let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how to answer every man ; " and the Saviour Himself calls His disciples " the salt of the earth , " as men by whose instruction and example their brethren are to be taught and saved from condemnation . All this worship of salt as a divine gift , this veneration of its sacred character , and this dread of its destructive powers , centre , however , in the simple fact , taught by modem chemistry , that salt is the great regulator of the health of the world . Without it , the seas would be impure and the land a desolate scene VOL. xi. - 46 of destruction ; man would not be able to live , and the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would no longer be seen . The little grain of salt , at which we hardly glance , is thus of vital importance in the great household of nature . But it shares the fate of all indispensable things by which we are surrounded : habit makes dull the sensibility of our senses , and with it the activity of thought that depends on such impressions . Only what is rare and unusual attracts our attention , though it have but an outside brilliancy and useless beauty . The sparkling diamond is sure of admiration ; set bright gold , it is esteemed above all things , and serves to enhance beauty , to display our wealth , or to symbolize supreme power . The unattractive twinsister , black coal , has to do hard work in the kitchen , the workshop , and the factory , like a true Cinderella ; and yet on coal , and not on the diamond , rests the true wealth of a nation , the foundation of happiness for countless millions . Thus it is with the tiny grain of salt ; rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their table , and enjoy it with every thing they eat and drink , but few ever inquire whence it came , and what accident or what necessity brought it there . And yet , let it be missing but for a single day , and how we would suffer ! We all know that the ocean is snlt , and that without it neither animal nor plant could live in the vast basins of the earth . But it is less generally known that the amount of salt in different seas is not the same , but steadily decreases in the direction from the equator to the poles . Scoresby tells us that , of European seas , the Mediterranean holds most , the Baltic least ; so that the fishermen of the north have to send for the salt they need in preserving their fish , to the more favored regions of the south , and salt becomes a patron of active trade . The Atlantic Ocean , again , has more salt than the Pacific , and the Polar Sea least of all . With the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better able to bear heavy yessels // on its broad shoulders , changes , of course , also the degree of density ; and as water is naturally desirous to restore the equilibrium , there follows a constant flow to and fro ; so that salt here appears as the great motive-power , which causes the currents of the sea ! These again , in their turn , bestow warmth on Western Europe , mix the differently heated waters of the ocean so as to protect the life that teems in them against cold , and favor the sailing of trade-ships . Thus climate and temperature , winds and currents , navigation and the fertility of coast-lands , all depend on the presence of the little pinch of salt ! Far better known is the fact that man , like all animal life , can not exist without salt , but must miserably perish , so that among the most terrible punishments , entailing certain death with fearful suffering , that of feeding criminals with saltless food was not uncommon in barbarotis times , and prevailed , to our disgrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . Animals , deprived of salt , lose their hair , become lean and hideous to look at , and die a death of unspeakable suffering . The reason is simple . A man , weighing a hundred and fifty pounds , carries in him at least one pound of salt ; it constitutes five per cent . of the solid matter of his blood , and an almost equal proportion of all the cartilages of the body , and the bile contains soda as a special and indispensable element in the process of digestion . If the salt , then , be withdrawn , or the ounce which every one of use daily loses , by perspiration and other means , be not replaced , digestion is arrested , the bony part of our frame is not rebuilt , the eye loses its brilliancy , and the whole system breaks down . Hence the craving of man and beast alike for the precious grain . Pliny but expressed the necessity of its use for life , when he said that all the loveliness and joyousness of life could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rulers of the world were not slow in taking advantage of this fact , by taxing the indispensable gift of na ture . Five hundred years before Christ , already , the mythical king , Ancus Martius , established , at the mouth of the Tiber , a saline , under the control of the state ; and at a later period the censor Livius earned the name of Salinator , by raising the duty on salt . From distant China to the west of Europe , every Government learned to treat salt as one of the regalia ; and not many years ago , poor French peasants were still cruelly punished if they dared draw a bucket of water from the great ocean , in order to secure the few grains of salt it con-tained ! As vegetable food is both unpalatable and little nutritious unless accompanied by salt , herbivorous animals everywhere delight in its use . The wild buffalo and the deer , as well as our domestic cattle , enjoy it with evident relish ; and the Alpine herdsman , like the Gaucho of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at certain places , by depositing small quantities of salt at regular intervals . When the eager huntsman , in Southern Africa , is in search of rare sport , he hides himself at a favorite salt-lick , and is sure to be amply rewarded ; and the cunning chamois-hunter of the Alps prepares his way , years ahead , by cautiously placing a handful of salt in accessible spots , until even those sagacious animals are beguiled , by their greediness , and finally fall into the hands of their enemy . Even here , however , man shows his strange superiority over lower beings ; for while animals , without exception , love salt with equal fondness , the desire among men differs essentially . Nations who live largely on animal food , value it naturally less than those who prefer a vegetable diet . Thus Mungo Park speaks of certain tribes in Southwestern Africa , who never take salt by any chance , and adds that even Europeans , travelling in their country , never feel the want of it . The same disregard prevails in the colds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their food without a particle of salt . On the other hand , there are Indian tribes , true vegetarians , who consume it in large 0 // quantities , so that the children are seen sucking pieces of salt like sugar . In certain portions of Africa , he is deemed a rich man who can afford eating salt with his food ; in the mountains of the South , small pieces of it circulate as money , and on the Gold Coast a handful of salt will purchase two serviceable slaves I A nicer distinction , yet , is the wellestablished fact , that the active races require salt more imperatively than the passive races ; and this , iu connection with the refined instincts of the body , explains , no doubt , the startling difference between the Gaucho of South America , who hardly knows what salt is , and the intelligent son of European races , who could not live a fortnight without his accustomed supply . How wonderful , then , that the presence of a " pinch of salt , " a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the condition of animal and vegetable life on our earth ! Truly , not only is man fearfully and wonderfully made , that his physical life and the activity of his heaven-born mind should depend on the little white crystal , but great are the works and wondrous is the wisdom of Him , who , from His throne on high , orders alike the heavenly bodies in their unmeasured space , and the invisible grain of salt in the bowels of the earth and the deep of the sea !
