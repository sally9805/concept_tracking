ART . VII . - 1 . The History of the Religious Movement of the Eighteenth Century called Methodism : considered in its different Denominational Forms , and its Relations to British and American Protestantism . By ABEL STEVENS , LL . D. Vols . I. , II . New York : Canton and Porter . 1859. 2 . Harper 's Magazine for July , 1859 . Article , John Wesley . So rapid has been the growth of Methodism in America , that , like the volcanic mountains of Mexico , which recent eruptions have thrown up from the plain , it still amazes us by the figure it makes in our geography . An aged clergyman of another denomination , Rev. Mr. Waldo , late Chaplain to Congress , remarked at the dedication of a Methodist Episcopal Church in Poughkeepsie , a few weeks ago , that he remembered the time when there was no Methodist Church in the land . Now we see a sect numbering eight millions of adherents , divided into six distinct denominations , comprising nearly two millions of adult communicants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay preachers , who support themselves by secular business and preach as they may find or make occasion . Born in a College , Methodism has from the beginning favored the cause of popular education . Discouraged at the outset of its career in America by the burning of two Colleges successively in Maryland , it made no further attempt of importance in this direction until 1824 , since which time it has founded two hundred Academies and Seminaries of high grade , including a dozen or more Female Collegiate Institutes ; two Theological Schools ; and more than thirty Colleges , in which more than two thousand young men are pursuing substantially the same course of study and discipline for degrees as is required in Harvard and Yale . In all these institutions special attention is given to the religious culture of the pupils ; and indeed , more than half of the professors and teachers are ordained ministers of the Gospel . What a solution have we here of the problem of the efficacy of the voluntary principle in supporting religion ! When the Constitution of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion in a country becoming rapidly , yet sparsely , overspread by a population , native and immigrant , in circumstances unfriendly to the maintenance of Divine worship , many wise men in this nation and in Europe predicted the downfall of the republic . It is an axiom in politics , that no free government can long be maintained without a basis of intelligence and morality in the masses of the people ; and yet this experiment of democracy on the largest scale was to be made without any recognition of religion in the Constitution , except in guaranty of its " free exercise " ! These fears are still entertained by European writers . " In one important respect , " says Mr. Alison in his History of Modern Europe , " America differs entirely from any state in Christendom , or indeed any state that ever before existed in the world . It acknowledges no state religion , and no public funds whatever are provided for the clergy or religious instructors of any denomination . " " If nothing else , " he concludes , " existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeds of its mortal distemper are to be found in the want of any provision for the gratuitous religious instruction of the poor : the very circumstance which ; with the admirers of their institutions , is the most ceaseless subject of eulogy . " The publication of Dr. Baird 's Religion in America , in several European languages , is likely soon to dispel these evil omens , and to let future historians know , that such has been the efficacy of the voluntary principle , in every denomination , that State after State has followed the example of the general government , and abolished the last vestige of a religious establishment . The Methodist Episcopal Church , a discarded offshoot of the English Church , which started into being but little before the independence of the United States , has kept pace with the growth of the republic , sending forth its itinerants with every wave of emigration that rolls toward the Rocky Mountains , and spreading its network of districts , circuits , and stations over the whole land . It has made itself systematically a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has greater resources for the religious instruction of the poor - slaves , immigrants , Indians , // and indigent white natives - than could be found in the entire English Church , were it transported with its revenues to this country . As much might be said of more than one other of the leading sects , whose surplus energy has swept beyond the boundaries of this country to the isles of the Pacific and the continents of the East . In England , Methodism is less conspicuous , because to a great extent it has been absorbed in the Establishment , from which the Wesleys , Whitefield , Fletcher , and the most influential of the early preachers , never wished the United Societies to be separated , believing as they did that the English Church is Apostolic in her doctrine and ritual , and in time , by the grace of God , might be revived , through the adherence and faithful labors of those who were interested in their enterprise . This has been accomplished in a large measure ; but the progress of time has gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Church , and they are classed with the Dissenting Churches , of which they constitute by far the most numerous and influential sect . The two volumes of the able work whose title is given at the head of this article , bring the history of Methodism throughout the world down only to the death of John Wesley . The view it takes of Methodism as a revival of the primitive spirit of Christianity , must , we think , receive general assent . The necessity of such a revival at the beginning of the last century , in the British empire , is vividly painted in the opening pages of the first volume . The Protestant Reformation , initiated by royal decree , was at first merely an ecclesiastical revolution , not a moral and spiritual renovation , which it indeed made possible ; but the entanglement of the Church with the state provoked an extreme and violent dissent , resulting in civil war and the overthrow of the monarchy . The reaction , and restoration of the ungodly king and court , prostrated the spirituality of religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Establishment and of the Dissenters in a formal and lifeless coudhion . The peculiarities of Christian doctrine and the manifestations of earnest piety had become objects of popular contempt , and , in study and preaching , natural religion was substituted by // WESLEYAN METHODISM . the clergy for the revealed word of God* Infidelity of every shade and shape , mostly springing from the sensual philosophy of Locke , was in fashion among scholars and men of speculative minds , and the masses of the people were to a great extent in a state approaching barbaric ignorance and degradation . To this deplorable picture of the times , observers from every rank in society give earnest and pathetic testimony . Watts , Harrison , Guise , and Bishops Butler , Leighton , and Burnet , all unite in the lamentation . Archbishop Secker remarks of the age , " as its distinguishing character , " that " such are the dissolutions and contempt of principle in the higher part of the world , and the profligacy , intemperance , and fearlessness of committing crime in the lower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become absolutely total . " Watts calls upon all Churchmen and Dissenters who have the cause of God at heart , to come to " the recovery of dying religion in the world . " This gloomy tendency of the times to heathenism met its first marked reaction in the department of elegant literature . " It is worthy of remark , " says Dr. Stevens , " that one of the most interesting departments of English literature of the last century owes its birth to the alarm that the better disposed literary men of the age took at the general decline of manners and morals , and the attempt to check it Though these writers aimed at first more at the correction of the follies than the sins of the times , they grew serious as they grew important . It is curious to observe their increasing severity , as they obtained authority by time and popularity . Steele , from a long and various study of the world , painted with minute accuracy its absurdities . Addison , with a style the most pure and a humor mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and to shed the radiance of genius on the despised virtues of Christianity . He rescued Milton from the neglect which the sublime religious character of his greAt epic had incurred for him from the degenerate age . Pope satirized , in some admirable critiques , the literary follies of the times . Berkeley attacked , with his clear logic and finished style , the sceptical opinions which were then prevalent ; most of his articles are on Freethinking . ' Johnson , the great moralist , ' stood up , a giant , to battle with both hands against all error and irreligion , whether in high places or in low places . These writings exerted an influence upon the tastes and morals of the age ; but it was comparatively superficial . " - Vol . I. pp. 23-25. // This genial tendency of the best literature was but as the mild radiance of the moon , and wholly insufficient to break up the dismal winter of the times , which craved the direct and fiery beams of a tropical sun . There was intense need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reaches up and takes hold of supernatural aid , - of " power from on high , " - of " a baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire . " How happy it is for us that we have in a permanent form the original records of our divine religion , out of which it may spring up afresh in some clear , candid , vehement mind , and be thence communicated to others , diffused in all its first purity and vigor amidst the scenes of its late neglect and decline , and poured forth into regions beyond and far remote ! This is the story of Methodism . A boy descended from clerical ancestors of free and independent minds , himself endowed with an energetic and imperious will , a clear , logical understanding , a constructive genius , a wakeful conscience , and a warm heart , with a lithe , wiry , and enduring physical frame , from the first dawn of intelligence under the guidance of a mother whom lie resembled , who in her maiden thoughtfulness in the house of her enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up dissent from the religion of the state , - such a youth was bent upon finding out for himself , as an individual soul , the reality and truth of the Christian religion , that he might experience its full benefit , make trial of it in life , and recommend it by example and doctrine to all the world . He had every advantage of domestic and public education , and a mind on which no culture was lost ; and when he arrived at manhood , lie found himself in the eager pursuit of personal religion . Long and violent was the struggle . He plunged into the depths of humiliation and self-denial ; devoted all his leisure , and all his earnings not required to sustain nature , to charity ; crossed the ocean to 6arry the Gospel to savage heathen ; went with bare feet as an encouraging example to the poor boys under his tuition ; lay out at night in his pastoral excursions , and was covered and his hair fastened to the ground by the frosts of the morning . He inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian duty or privilege , watched the developments of character of 16 * // those professing piety , especially in trying emergencies ; followed docilely and thoughtfully such advice as met his approval ; and above all pondered deeply , prayerfully , and continually the word of God . " To candid , reasonable men , " he says , in the Preface to a volume of his sermons , " I am willing to lay open what have been the inmost thoughts of my heart . I have thought I am a creature of a day , passing through life as an arrow through the air ; I am a spirit come from God , and returning to God ; just hovering over the great gulf : till a few moments hence , I am no more seen . I drop into an unchangeable eternity ! I want to know one thing , the way to heaven ! how to land safe on that happy shore . God himself has condescended to teach me the way ! for this very end he came from heaven . He hath written it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ! At any price give me the book of God ! I have it , - here is knowledge enough for me . Let me be homo unius libri . ' Here then I am , far from the busy ways of men , I sit down alone : only God is here . In his presence I open , I read this book : for this end , to find the way to heaven . " The Bible is not a revelation , if such an inquirer could not arrive at the truth ; and yet , so encumbered was he with the prejudices of education and of learning , that what one differently affected would find out in a week or a day , ho could not discover to his own satisfaction until he was near thirty-five years of age . " I went to America , " he says in his journal , " to convert the Indians ; but oh ! who will convert me ? " An ingenious writer in a recent number of Harper 's Magazine has joined Southey , Coleridge , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; but who is so likely to know as Wesley himself whether he was at this time a Christian ? When the sea swept over the ship that was bearing him to America , threatening to engulf it , he saw that the simple-hearted and pious Moravians , men , women , and children , went on singing with composure , and even with rapture , while lie was filled with dismay and alarm ; - not with the instinctive dread of disaster and death , which the most devout heart may not always suppress , but with anxiety in respect to his relations to God and the eternal salvation of his soul . He said : " I have a sin of fear , that when I 've spun My last thread , I shall perish on the shore . " // No reasoning from his past life of prayer , and consecration , and devotion to good works , could appease the fatal anxiety which oppressed his spirits ; and that not only in the storm and amidst imminent trials merely , but habitually . No doubt Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God ; for he was perfectly sincere in all his endeavors to please God , and his subsequent mature views on the subject of salvation forbade him to think that he would have been lost if he had perished at sea at that time . Yet this might be said of many honest and devout heathen , and of other persons of pure moralitynot under the influence of the Gospel , who are faithful to the light they have . But Christianity is a life , the main element of which is love to God , attended with and inspired by a happy evidence of acceptance with Him . " Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not " that a man must be " born of the Spirit , " and that " every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God " ? What poor , sincere , earnest John Wesley wanted , to make him a Christian , was the inspiration of the love of God in his soul . This he obtained , as he pa* thetically describes in his journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther 's great Biblical discovery of justification and sanctification by faith alone . It brings the sad heart of Wesley to light and joy . A spark from the Reformation of the sixteenth century kindles the revival of the nineteenth . " In the evening I went to a house in Aldersgate Street London , where one was reading Luther 's preface to the Epistle to the Romans . About a quarter before nine , while he was de*cribing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ , I felt my heart strangely warmed . I felt I did trust in Christ , Christ alone , for salvation ; and an assurance was given inc that he had taken away my sins , even mine , and saved me from the law of sin and death . I by an to r*iay with all my might for those who had , in a more especial manner , despitefully used me , and persecuted me . I then testified openly to all there , what I now first felt in my heart . " Such is Wesley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitefield experienced the same change about the same time , and in the same way , though independently of each other ; and there are millions of mcmi now living who can trace in it the exact counterpart of their own experi // Jan . WESLEYAN METHODISM . ence . It is the key-note to the whole movement . It was this that created the sudden and extraordinary interest in the preaching of Whitefield and the Wesleys . It was this that excited the opposition of the formal Churchmen , and turned the zealous reformers out of the pulpits of the Establishment to proclaim in the fields and highways to the thronging and excited populace , " Ye must be born again . " Without this they would have accomplished no more for the cause of religion , in their subsequent career , than they had accomplished before . They might have made themselves a seven days ' wonder for their excessive zeal ; but they would not have set the nations on fire . This view of the subject is taken by all the Methodist historians . Dr. Stevens remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , after twenty-five years , as he elsewhere informs us , of religious solicitude and struggles , did he , by a clearer apprehension of the doctrine of justification by faith , find rest to his soul , and feel himself at last authorized to preach that blessing to all contrite men , from his own experimental proof of its reality . But had he not faith before ? Doubtless he had . At another time he declared that he had , but that it was the faith of a servant ' rather than of a child . " - Vol . I. p. 105 . This distinction is an important one , and may be easily illustrated . It is not , as the writer in Harper 's Magazine supposes , a distinction of degrees , but of kind , - a distinction belonging to the realm of the affections . A mind under the dominion of reverence , fear , and the moral sentiment , is very different from one which , in addition to all these , is moved by personal love for God . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , and may cherish toward him all proper sentiments , except the very one which should be uppermost in this relation ; but how different is she from the happy wife whose heart is the home of conjugal love ! Many a good woman has a kindly regard for the children of strangers whom she has adopted , but maternal love can be given only with maternity . So , no man can say , " Abba , Father I " Dear Father I "  --  but he that is born of God . Another aspect of this new experience of Wesley , which // he afterward called the direct witness of the Spirit , is controverted by the same writer . Mr. Wesley believed and taught that the Holy Spirit , at the time the penitent sinner obtains pardon through faith in Christ , conveys a direct impression of it , and of his adoption ; which becomes the motive , the rational cause , of the new-born affection of love ; - in contradistinction to the doctrine that the heart finds itself mysteriously possessed of the love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This last-named indirect witness of the Spirit , or rational inference from the character , he admitted and insisted upon as a necessary and indispensable corroboration of the direct witness of the Spirit ; for without it the enthusiast might take some hallucination of his excited mind as a Divine impression . But he preferred to call it the testimony of our own spirit , both as being the conclusion derived from our altered affections toward God and man , and in conformity with the language of inspiration , which indicates two concurrent testimonies , - " the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit . " To refute the doctrine of the direct witness of the Spirit , this writer refers to the passage we have quoted from Wesley 's journal , and adds - " It is singular enough that Mr. Wesley 's account of his own experience is clearly discordant with his theory of the Spirit 's witness . While we read from Luther on the Galatians , ' says he , I felt my heart strangely warmed . ' These words can not be mistaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness , but religious comfort animating his heart ; not a bare testimony to the intellect , but a kindled and * , lowing affection , the first token of what he then conceived to be his conversion . In a word , it was this Scriptural and last evidence of the new life , the love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost . ' " Here the writer seems to contradict his first theory , that Wesley did not at this time receive " the new life , " and then he takes the new life as evidence of itself . But the difficulty is to know how Wesley could have had this " religious comfort animating his heart , " this " love of * " a kindled and glowing affection , " without any new evidence of his acceptance with God to inspire the new emotion . It is true , God can add miracle to miracle , and cause a heart to glow // with love without a previous motive ; but it is more reasonable to suppose that , whatever susceptibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it into action through some appropriate conviction of the intellect . All this appears in the short account which we have quoted , though it is not there placed in logical order ; for he " did trust in Christ " in a manner beyond his former confidence , " an assurance was given him that his sins were pardoned , " and at the same time he " felt his heart strangely warmed . " Moreover , a spirit of love and forgiveness toward his enemies sprang up in his soul . How natural is all this , upon the supposition of the direct witness of the Spirit ! Whether this be a doctrine of Christianity need not here be argued . It is a distinctive feature of Methodism , and the secret of its popular power . As miracles not only furnish direct evidence of the Divine origin of our religion , but answer the collateral purpose of impressing on the mind the personality of God , as distinguished from the ordinary forces and laws of nature ; so the direct witness of the Spirit , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of God in the Church to the mind of the believer , and makes the simplest services and rites of religion , like the wheels of the chariot which the prophet saw by the river Chebar , instinct with a life and power not their own , " for the spirit of the living creature was in them . " A Church that holds this doctrine has no need of a splendid ritual , or grand organs , or stained windows to let in a dim religious light , or the Gothic arch lifting the imagination to heaven , to keep alive the spirit of devotion , and to bring the sinner to God . It is this doctrine that makes the simple Methodist class-meeting a scene of rapture , and turns the log-cabin of the prairie into the very vestibule of heaven . Another doctrine of Wesley is not only objected to by the same writer , but even treated with derision by him . " Of all the doctrines taught by Wesley , none has given greater offence than what he called Christian perfection . And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a remarkable power of clarifying his thoughts , and making them clear to others , he is here sadly at fault . He used the word perfection because he found // it in the Scriptures , but declined the prefix , sinless . He maintained that man in his present state is subject to ignorance and weakness , and involuntary transgressions of the Divine law , which he did not conceive to be sins in the proper sense of the word . These frailties he thought might consist with what he called perfect love , or a perfect conformity to the first great commandment , the fulfilment of which is substantially thc fulfilment of the whole law . Meanwhile , for slight omissions of duty , and for duties imperfectly done , there is continual need of the atonement , and the prayer , Forgive us our trespasses . ' The difficulty with all who have taken offence at this doctrine lies in comprehcnding the consistency of a statement that seems self-contradictory , - an imperfect perfection , a given quantity less than itself ; a living without sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for sin . It is like asserting a circle with the properties of a triangle . The plain truth is , that the word perfection , according to Wesley 's own admission , is applied to a less than total sinlessness , and where to fix the limit would puzzle the skill of Duns Scotus , who determined the exact number of spirits that could dance on the point of a cambric needle ! " The objection to this doctrine is , that it is indefinite and selfcontradictory . It takes not much of a theologian to discover that the Scriptures take for their standard of human nature and human conduct a law which was made for a perfect humanity , and that everything in man , whether intended or not , which is contrary to that law , is called sill ; for " sin , " says St. John , " is the transgression of the law . " Hence , all men are in this sense regarded as sinners , as death is represented as the legal consequence of that state . " All die ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , which should leave a person short of complete conformity to the law , in anything which that law would require of perfect humanity , would render it improper for a theologian to call him " sinless . " Yet as perfection , like unity , is a relative term seldom used in an absolute sense , a person might be regarded as perfect , who had attained to such a degree of grace as to consecrate himself wholly to God . With still greater propriety he might be called perfect , if , in addition to this purpose and principle of perfect obedience , he had attained to such a degree of love to God as to make it a ruling passion of his nature , controlling all its other passions and impulses . Now , every Christian is perfect in this first degree ; for Christ 's disciple must , at the // outset , " forsake all that he hath . " Wesley taught that the higher degree is attainable in this life , and he called it " Christian perfection , " " perfect love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not imply absolute or " Adamic perfection , " - the perfection of an unfallen and perfect humanity for which the law was originally made . Nor is there such an indefiniteness here that we need call any of the old Schoolmen out of their graves to enlighten us . Does not every unconverted man know that his passions war with his conscience , and often bring him into subjection ? Does not every converted person know that his religion , especially the love of God , comes to the aid of the conscience , and giv*s him in turn dominion over his passions , so that he does not practically obey them ? Is he not frequently distressed , however , by the conflict , and does he not feel himself degraded , though not guilty , by the presence and power of passion , and sigh for such a degree of moral strength as shall keep his soul in peace ? What then ? If he shall have his religious feelings intensified , and especially the love of God greatly increased , will he not find that harmony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know that every temper and passion of the soul falls freely into the train of a master passion ? If gold were God , then every miser were entirely sanctified . Surely it is reasonable for every good man to expect a pious habit of soul , as the result of proper endeavors , and it would be proper to call it " entire sanctification , " or " Christian perfection . " The points in which Wesley differed from Lady Huntingdon and the Calvinistic Methodists show an opposite phasis of Wesleyan theology , and present the agency of man in redemption and in the Christian life , in a peculiar and interesting light . The Calvinistic controversy was a painful crisis in Methodism , and resulted in a permanent separation of the Arminian and Calvinistic parties . It is a delicate subject to handle ; but Dr. Stevens has treated it with discrimination , and in a spirit of catholic justice and kindness , which is truly refreshing . . Wesleyan Methodism will not be understood unless the feature of it here exhibited is profoundly considered . We quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference of 1770 , held in London - // " We said in 1744 , We have leaned too much toward Calvinism . ' Wherein ? " 1 . With regard to man 's faithfulness . Our Lord himself taught us to use the expression , and we ought never to be ashamed of it . We ought steadily to assert , on his authority , that if a man is not faithful in the unrighteous mammon , ' God will not give him the true riches . ' " 2 . With regard to working for life . This also our Lord has expressly commanded us . Labor ' ( Ergazesthe ) , literally work for the meat that endureth to everlasting life . ' And in fact every believer , till he comes to glory , works frr as well as from life . " 3 . We have received it as a maxim , that a man is to do nothing in order to justification . ' Nothing can be more false . Whoever desires to find favor with God should cease from evil , and learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for repentance . ' And if this is not in order to find favor , what does he do them for ? " Review the whole affair . " 1 . Who of us is now accepted of God ? He that now believes in Christ , with a loving , obedient heart . " 2 . But who among those who never heard of Christ ? He that feareth God and worketh righteousness according to the light he has . " 3 . Is this the same with he that is sincere ' ? Nearly , if not quite . " 4 . Is not this salvation by works ' ? Not by the merit of works , but by works as a condition . " 5 . What have we then been disputing about for these thirty years ? I am afraid , about words . " 6 . As to merit itself of which we have been so dreadfully afraid : we are rewarded according to our works , yea because of our works . How does this differ from for the sake of our works ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works deserve ' ? Can you split this hair ? I doubt , I cannot. " 7 . The grand objection to one of the preceding propositions is drawn from matter of fact . God does in fact justify those who , by their own confession , neither feared God nor wrought righteousness . ' Is this an exception to the general rule ? It is a doubt whether God makes any exception at all . But how are we sure that the person in question never did fear God or work righteousness ' ? His own saying so is no proof ; for we know how all that are convinced of sin undervalue themselves in every respect . " 8 . Does not talking of a justified or sanctified state tend to mislead men , - almost naturally leading them to trust in what was done in one moment ? Whereas we are every hour and every moment pleasVOL . XC. - NO. 186. iT // ing or displeasing to God , according to our works , - according to the whole of our inward tempers and our outward behavior. ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " As a whole , it might have been better guarded , and doubtless would have been , had Wesley apprehended that it was to be so extensively and polemically discussed . Its doctrine , as obviously intended , is wholesome and Scriptural . " To give satisfaction as far as possible to his Calvinistic brethren , Wesley , at a subsequent Conference , signed * " Declaration , " in which , without retracting his opinions expressed in the minute , he explained that he had not in any wise meant to teach justification by works as contradistinguished from the doctrine of salvation through the sole merits of Jesus Christ . This produced but a temporary lull in the storm , which very soon burst forth anew with redoubled violence . In the controversy Fletcher took the leading part on the side of Wesley , and exhibited a rare combination of polemic zeal and Christian urbanity . As in the case of Melancthon and of John , the beloved disciple , his benignant temper cast an angelic charm upon the stormy aspect of the times . The sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , by original sin , mankind was lost in Adam and restored by Christ to a new probationary state , in which all would have the free offer of salvation ; but God , foreseeing that all would , through a depraved disposition , neglect the offer without constraining influences , or effectual grace from Heaven , decrees to send to a certain number that grace , and infallibly to secure to them final salvation . The moment that grace reaches them they are regenerated , and repent , believe , and love as the natural consequence . They may resist these gracious influences and fall , but grace will finally prevail and effect their salvation . On the other hand , it was contended that Christ died for all , * . and his grace not only secured a probationary life to all , but on terms with which the grace potentially imparted enables all to comply , in order to pardon and regeneration . If a man is born in a heathen land and hears not the Gospel , he will be saved if he obeys the dictates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs the duties which the light he // has reveals to him . The light and favoring impulses of conscience are from Christ , and by his grace all the freedom and moral power requisite to obey the monitions of conscience are bestowed . When Christ is preached a new duty is presented , namely , faith in him ; and the performance of this duty is made the indispensable and the all-sufficient condition of pardon for the past , and of the reception of additional grace to inspire the love of God and to enable the soul to discharge the duties which grow out of the new relations to God and man made known and ordained by Christianity . In this view grace alone lays the foundation of man 's probationary life , and provides power to perform all the conditions of present and final acceptance with God ; and yet upon this platform of free grace there is work for man to do , and merit attached to that work . The paradox is solved by simply considering grace as giving man scope for duty , and rewarding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the fruitage of grace . The term " gracious ability " is now familiarly employed to designate the moral power given to man , through the Mediator , to comply with the conditions of salvation . It is a term for which , in its technical sense , the Methodist Episcopal Church is indebted to Rev. Dr. Wilbur Fisk . He employed it in his Calvinistic controversy to distinguish the congenital endowment of grace from the " natural ability " of the New Haven theology , and the " moral inability " of the Old School . Every man has ability to do all that is required of him for salvation , but it is not natural ; it is of grace . Since the Calvinistic controversy , Methodistic theology has been settled in all its principal features . It has had no reaction toward Calvinism , but has rather tended the other way . The term " initial justification " has lately come into use to express the opinion that the infancy of the race , though possessed of depraved tendencies , as judged by the perfect law originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that account , and infant baptism is retained to signify this absolution , with the title of its subject to regeneration and the baptism of the Holy Spirit , if he dies before reaching a self-determining age , or if , arrived at years of accountability , he does not voluntarily reject the overtures of // divine grace . In the light of the doctrines of " initial justification " and " gracious ability , " it seems that Methodism does not regard this as a doomed world , but as a saved world , in which no one is lost who does not throw himself out of the ark of salvation . It does not , however , ignore the terrible fact , that , like the generations before the flood , the greater part of mankind are in rebellion against the law and the grace of God . Still , it believes that this need not be , and looks hopefully to a coming time when the scene shall be reversed . The principal dogmatic discussion within the Methodist body has been on the subject of the Trinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on the sonship of Christ . At one time a great blaze was kindled in the British Conference . Dr. Adam Clarke held that the term " son " was expressive merely of the incarnation of the second person of the Trinity ; but Richard Watson contended that it was an expression of the eternal generation from the Father . Watson 's Institutes , an elaborate and learned treatise , in three volumes , on the evidences , doctrines , and institutions of Christianity , is now recognized as the most genuine standard of Methodism next to Wesley 's Sermons . " It is the doctrine of the Divine Paternity , " he writes , " which preserves the Scriptural idea that the Father is the fountain of DeitN , and as such the first , the original , the principle . Certainly he must have read the Scriptures to little purpose who does not perceive that this is their constant doctrine , that of Him are all things ' : though the Son is Creator , yet it was by the Son that the Father made the worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself has declared that he lives by the Father , ' and that the Father has given him to have life in himself , and that can only refer to his Divine nature , nothing being the source of life in itself but what is divine : a view which is put out of all doubt by its declaration , that by the gift of the Father the Son bath life in himself , as the Father has life in Himself . ' But when the essential paternity of the Father and the correlative filiation of the Son are denied , these Scriptural representations have no foundation in fact , and are incapable of interpretation . " The term Son ' at once preserves the Scriptural character of the Father , and sets up an everlasting barrier against the Anna heresy of inferiority of essence ; for , as Son , he must be of the same essence as the Father . " // This view is unfolded and argued by interpretations of Scripture , sustained by citations from the standard authorities in the Protestant and IRomish Churches , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be claimed by Unitarians that the supremacy of the Father is conceded by this doctrine ; and that in the highest of all senses He only is God . Nor can any other answer be made than that this superiority is that of order , and not of substance or essential attributes . This controversy adds another illustration to the oft-repeated remark , that human language must be ever inadequate to express , and the human mind to conceive of , the mode of existence of a divine and infinite nature . On this subject revelation can give us only an approximate idea ; and to insist on a logical definition of the symbolical terms employed , and to draw out of them a logical conclusion , is absurd . It is as if we should approach a painting , and measure its colors and figures by square and compass . In that way we should very soon pronounce the greatest work of art a monstrous caricature ; for we should find the shrubbery and rocks in the foreground greater than the lofty mountains and the grand old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till we stand in the focus of the perspective , the scene bursts upon us in all its glorious reality . To that stand-point , before the revelation of God , we may approach without ever reaching it . Meanwhile let us not despise sacred paradoxes , but receive them humbly and thankfully , as the nearest approach that heavenly natures can make to us in this world . We would not be understood , however , to discourage the keenest investigation and discussion of these subjects . Conducted with proper philosophical and Christian liberality , the occupation of the mind on these themes tends powerfully to purify , subtilize , and expand it . The problem is to find a formula which is agreeable at once to reason and to Scripture . No interpretation can stand which is contradictory to reason ; but a statement that reason would approve may be Scripturally groundless . And let us not be too confident in the exercise of reason . Most men would at first thought declare that the proposition that two lines may approach each 17* // other forever without ever meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this absolutely and undeniably certain . Decided as the Methodists from Wesley down have been in their doctrinal opinions , no subscription to dogmas was required as a condition of membership in the United Society of Mr. Wesley ; and though an abridgment of the Thirtynine Articles was prepared by him as a suitable creed for the American organization , and adopted by the Methodist Episcopal Church , yet a specific subscription to it has never been required of any but ministers . A general soundness in the faith has been made , by a recent General Conference , a condition of full membership . This , however , would not extend beyond the " Apostles ' Creed , " as contained in the formula of baptism for adults , and to which few believers in the New Testament would hesitate to subscribe . The ecclesiasticism of Wesley was peculiar , and becomes interesting in the view now taken of Methodism as a revival of the spiritual life of Christianity . It is significant of that fact . John Wesley had no idea of schism ; his societies were outgrowths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate . He died in full communion with the English Church , and until a recent period the United Societies in the British empire remained mere societies . Nor have they at any time formally proclaimed their independence , though by degrees they have come to style themselves Churches , and the Conferences have assumed the right of ordination with the laying on of hands . In this country the Revolution led to a different course of events . Having repeatedly applied in vain to Dr. Lowth , Bishop of London , to ordain certain of his assistants to administer the ordinance in the societies fast multiplying in the Colonies , Mr. Wesley , satisfied in his own mind by thorough examination that the right of ordination was vested in the presbytery , took occasion of the independence of the United States , which ruptured both the political and ecclesiastical ties of the empire , to provide for the independent organization of his societies in the United States as a distinct Church . In doing this he endeavored as far as possible to transfer to the new American Church the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abridgment of the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion and the Prayer-Book , including the ritual for consecration of Bishops , Presbyters , and Deacons , for the administration of Baptism and the Lord 's Supper , for the service of Matrimony , and the Burial of the Dead . He added to this a collection of psalms and hymns . In pursuance of this plan , assisted by presbyters of the English Church , he ordained Rev. Thomas Coke , LL . D. , a presbyter of the Established Church , to be Superintendent of the United Societies in America ; and Messrs . Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vesey as elders . The preachers in America assembled in Baltimore on Christmas day , 1785 , and cordially adopted the plan of Mr. Wesley , accepted Dr. Coke as Superintendent , and elected Rev. Francis A sbury to be Joint Superintendent . They directed his ordination in the form prescribed by Mr. Wesley , first as Elder , and then as Superintendent ; and he was ordained accordingly by Dr. Coke . The Church was styled the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Methodist Episcopal Church and her junior sister , the Protestant Episcopal Church , of America , on the question whether Mr. Wesley intended to make Dr. Coke a Bishop . The chief evidence to the contrary is a letter from him , in which he chides Francis Asbury rather facetiously for allowing himself to be styled a Bishop . Dr. Stevens devotes a chapter to this question , and with conclusive logic settles it beyond any reasonable doubt . He shows that Wesley objected not to the office , but only to the name , on account of its prelatical associations . As he styles , in the ordination service , the priests or presbyters simply Elders , so he styles the bishops Superintendents , the new terms meaning the same as the old , but having the merit of being free from unpleasant associations . The American Methodists understood him well , but preferred the term Bishop , because it was Scriptural in our revered English translation . That Mr. Wesley intended to constitute Dr. Coke a Bishop is evident from his ordaining him with all the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , lie being already an ordained priest or presbyter of that Church ; from the ordination services for the use // of the American Church , copied and abridged from the British Church services ; from his omitting to invite his brother Charles to the ceremony , because he knew it would offend his High-Church principles , and awaken a storm of opposition ; and from his subsequent defence of his course , by arguments drawn from Lord King 's treatise and other works , which take the ground that the right of ordination is vested in the Presbyters . Instead of complaining of the Methodist Episcopal Church as schismatical , might not Churchmen better consider whether , upon their own principles , the separation of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the assumption of orders were not justifiable as a necessity ? Hooker has admitted , that if a portion of the Church were thrown upon a distant continent or island , where they could form no connection with the main body of the Church , it would be perfectly proper for them to extemporize all the orders and ordinances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , and on a very large scale , as time has shown ? The Protestant Episcopal Church would , as we think , do an act of historic justice , and reflect honor upon herself , by acknowledging the Methodist Episcopal Church . There is no other way in which the breach can be healed ; for there is not the slightest consciousness of the invalidity of their ordination in the minds of the Methodist clergy , and it is preposterous to expect that so great a community will ever agree to a union by a reconsecration of the ministry . More vital questions than these are likely hereafter to engage the attention of the Methodist Church . At this moment the relation of slavery to the Church is exciting the deepest interest . The particular question is whether a rule shall be passed to exclude slaveholders from the Church . At its organization in 1785 , a rule was adopted requiring all members to emancipate their slaves , some immediately , and all within five years ; but this met with so much opposition in its execution , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution was suspended . " The rules , however , against the traffic in slaves , and forbidding official members to hold slaves where the law allows emancipation , have in some form continued // to this day . A violation of this rule by Bishop Andrews led to his suspension from his office in 1844 , and this resulted in the secession of the greater part of the Church within the slave States . The churches on the borders remained firm in their attachment to the Methodist Episcopal Church , and the confidence which the major part of the Church had in their antislavery principles made them contented to leave the subject of slaveholding by the members to the local administration . But within a few years dissatisfaction has taken place , and as the Church is fast extending her borders again over the slaveholding region , the sentiment has arisen , that it is necessary to pass an exclusive rule , and so to prevent any further entanglement with the evil . The objection to such a rule is , that it is without Apostolic precedent . Methodism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of God , and a doubt on this point lies at the basis of the opposition to the exclusive measure . The main answer to this objection is , that the circumstances of the Apostolic Church were different from ours ; that there was no need of a specific edict againt slaveholding because the principle of Christian love was effectual in its operation against the oppression of a brother in any relation , and that hence the relation was but nominal . But now the pre- . posterous right of one man to own another as property , so contrary to the iiituitions of reason and conscience , as well as to the general principles of the New Testament , is defended by Christians . Hence , it is now deemed necessary to do by authority of the General Conference what Paul said in the case of Philemon and Onesimus he had power from Christ to do , if the mere hint of a pastor and old friend was not sufficient : " I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin that which is convenient . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances , transcended the letter of the Gospel , as , for example , in its general rules forbidding " the buying and selling of men , women , or children with an intention to enslave them , " and " the buying or selling of spirituous liquors , or drinking them , except in case of extreme necessity . " The rule in respect to intemperance is universally respected ; and the time is near at hand when the spectacle // will be exhibited of the largest Church in the land free from all complicity with slavery . Thus we have taken an interior view of Arminian Methodism as it now is , more particularly in the United States . Those who are interested in the subject will find ample satisfaction in Dr. Stevens 's able and thorough work . Of all the histories of Methodism this is the most complete . The author has made a most thorough research ; nothing has escaped him ; every event seems to have passed in thoughtful review before his mind . His picturesque grouping of contemporaneous incidents , and his lifelike sketching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His plan is eminently original and comprehensive . He sees the subject in its true light , and traces it in all its branches . His view of Calvinistic Methodism will be new to many who are familiar with Wesicyanism . His style is pure , easy , and elegant . An air of truthfulness is stamped on the whole narrative . There is a rare mixture of ardor , even to enthusiasm , with a cool and candid judgment . The author keeps back no unpleasant facts . He is not afraid to relate " the strange noises " of the parsonage , nor the physical convulsions which sometimes attended the excitements of religious assemblies ; but he looks on these things as a philosopher , who knows the weaknesses and mysteries of human life . The portraiture of Wesley 's character is the most admirable exertion of his genius . It is truly sublime . Of all the great benefactors of England this man with us must ever stand foremost . His greatness was not that of the speculative philosopher , but of the daring and determined experhnenter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to make the world see as lie does . He was a great worker , and God gave him long life to consummate all his plans , and to leave them in full and successful operation on a worldwide scale . A sketch of Dr. Coke , as specially related to American Methodism , and as a good specimen of the style of the work , will appropriately close this article . " It is an interesting coincidence , that , while the Conference was thus anticipating and prayerfully preparing itself for its later and unrivalled missionary achievements , there sat in its midst , for the first time , the // marvellous man , small in person but gigantic in energy , who was to found and represent for years its great foreign enterprises , and to die sublimely at last as a sacrifice for them . Thomas Coke , LL . D. , was born at Brecon , Wales , 1747 , the only child of wealthy parents . In his seventeenth year he became a Gentleman Commoner of Jesus College , Oxford . On entering upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wavered under the fashionable infidelity , which then infected the University , and , to no small extent , the cultivated circles of English society . The writings of Sherlock had relieved his doubts , but had not led him to evangelical views of Christianity . He pursued the labors of his parish , nt South Petherton , Somersetshire , in deep religious anxiety , and with so much earnestness as soon to excite the curiosity of his parishioners . His church became crowded , and as its vestry refused to furnish it with a gallery , he erected one at his own expense . Maxfield , Wesley 's first lay preacher , had an interview with him , and led him to more spiritual views of religion . Visiting a family in Devonshire , he found among its laborers an untutored but intelligent Methodist , a class-leader of the rustics of the neighborhood . He sought this good man 's conversation , and was surprised at his knowledge of divine truth . The nature of faith , justification , regeneration , and the evidences which attend them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergyman found he could be instructed by the unlettered peasant . They not only conversed , but prayed together . The educated divine obtained from the lay Methodist his best knowledge on the profoundest subjects , and acknowledged that he owed him greater obligations , with respect to the means of finding peace with God and tranquillity of mind , than to any other person . ' " The alarming charge of Methodism was soon spread against him . lie preached without notes , appointed evening meetings in various parts of the neighboring country , and while preaching at one of them received the peace of God which the rustic class-leader had described to him , and his heart was filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory . ' He was now more zealous and more irregular ' than ever ; he introduced the singing of hymns among his people , and preached Arminianism ; for a brother clergyman had put Fletcher 's Works into his hands , and with Coke , as with thousands of others , they refuted the doctrine of limited salvation . He was admonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rector , and threatened by a mob among his parishioners . He was at last chimed out of the church the next Sunday he preached in the street , near the church doors ; on the following Sunday he again took his stand there , and was about to be assailed with stones , collected for the purpose ; he escaped without // harm only by the courageous kindness of a young gentleman and his sister , who stood close to him , and whom the rabble respected too much to injure . On the day that he left his parish to cast in his lot with the Methodists , the bells were rung and hogsheads of cider were brought out for the free use of the mob . Petherton celebrated , as a jubilee , its deliverance from a Methodist curate , ' but it gave to the world a man who was to rank second only to Wesley in the success of Arminian Methodism , and to be the first Protestant bishop of the New World . In 1 77G Wesley , while in Somersetshire , writes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on purpose to meet me . I had much conversation with him , and a union began then which I trust shall never end . ' Wesley had looked in his old age to Fletcher as his successor in his great work : the Vicar of Madeley , however , was too feeble in health , and too retiring in his habits , to accept the vast responsibility . Coke seemed now raised up as a substitute . His appearance on the scene at this period can not but strike us as one of those notable providences which characterize the early history of Methodism . Whitefield had stirred the conscience of England and America for it ; Wesley had legislated it into organic vigor and durability ; Charles Wesley had supplied it with a rich psalmody ; Fletcher had just settled its theological system ; but , now that Wesley was growing old , he needed a coadjutor in its administration ; the field had enlarged beyond his largest expectations ; the time had come for great foreign plans ; and the American IRevolution was rendering necessary an American organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants . He became as indefatigable a traveller and preacher as Wesley himself : for some years he visited Ireland annually , and presided in its Conferences ; he traversed England , Scotland , Wales , and America . He was especially the foreign minister of Methodism . He possessed a zealous and vivacious spirit , which nothing could damp , but which caught inspiration from discouragements , and , like the impeded flood , grew stronger by obstructions . He had marked defects , but was one of the most interesting characters in the history of the Methodistic movement , - an example of ministerial zeal worthy of universal admiration and imitation . His stature was low , his voice effeminate , but his soul was as vast as ever dwelt in a human frame . Though he became the first bishop of Methodism in the United States , he found not in a diocese coextensive with the new republic room for his energies . Actuated by an impulse which allowed him no rest , he was perpetually contriving new measures for the extension of the cause which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of ordinary abilities , would have entitled him to the name of fanatic ; but he was one of those rare // spirits whose greatest conceptions and schemes are the legitimate products of their energies . He crossed the Atlantic eighteen times at his own expense . Until his death , he had charge of the Methodist missions throughout the world . He founded the negro missions of the West Indies , which have exerted an important influence on the history of those islands . They included fifteen thousand members at the time of his death . He visited his missions , spent almost the whole of his patrimonial fortune in their support , preached for them , and begged for them from door to door . The missionary spirit was with him as a burning fire shut up in his bones , ' and during his life it was not deemed necessary to organize a missionary society among the Wesleyans , for he embodied that great interest in his own person . When a veteran of almost seventy years , we shall see him presenting himself before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Conference objected on account of the expense , when , offering to pay the charges of the outfit himself to the amount of thirty thousand dollars , he prevailed over all objections , and embarked with a small band of laborers . He died on the voyage , and was buried in the sea ; but the undert*iking succeeded , and the Wesleyan East India missions are the result . It has been justly asserted that , except Wesley , no man was ever connected with the Methodist body who contributed more to extend the blessings of Christianity among mankind . His colleague in the episcopacy of the American Church would not allow of even this exception ; a minister of Christ , ' said Asbury , when the news of his death arrived , a minister of Christ , in zeal , in labors , and in services , the greatest man of the last century . ' Wesley used to say that Coke was a right hand to him . It was a noble sentiment recorded by him , at sea , on his first voyage to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can : I want the wings of an eagle and the voice of a trumpet , that I may proclaim the Gospel through the east and the west , the north and the south . ' There is genuine sublimity in the end of this flaming evangelist . Such a man belongs to no locality , he belongs to the world ; though dead , without a grave , his influence has been widening daily over the earth , and it was fitting that he should be buried in the ocean , whose waves might sound his requiem on the shores of all lands .
