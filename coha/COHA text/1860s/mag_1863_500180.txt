CONTINENTAL MONTHLY : DEYOTED TO LITERATURE AND NAT JONAL POLICY , VOL. 111. - FEBRUARY , 1863. - No . II . OUR NATIONAL FINANCES . Gun national finances are involved in extreme peril . Our public debt exceeds $720,000,000 , and is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury , on the 1st of July next , at $1,122,297,403 , and on the 1st of July , 1864 , at $1,744,685 ,  - -  586 . When we reflect that this is nearly one half the debt of England , and bearing almost double the rate of interest , it is clear that we are approaching a fatal catastrophe . Nor is this the most alarming symptom . Gold now commands a premium of thirty-two per cent. , as compared with legal tender treasury notes , and , with largely augmented issues , must rise much higher , with a correspondent increase of our debt and expenditures . Indeed , should the war continue , and there be no other alternative than additional treasury notes , they will , before the close of the next fiscal year , fail to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt exceed several billions of dollars . This would result from an immense redundancy and depreciation of currency , and from the alarm created here and in Europe , as to the maintenance of the Union , and the ultimate solvency of the Government . Indeed , our enemies , at home and abroad , the rebels , and their allies in the North and in Europe , already anvoL. iir. -9 nounce impending national bankruptcy and repudiation , and there are many devoted patriots who fear such a catastrophe . That the danger is imminent , is a truth which must not be disguised . Here lies the great peril of the Government . It is not the rebel armies that can ever overthrow the Union . It is the alarming increase of the public debt and expenditures , and the still more appalling depreciation of the national currency , that most imperil the great Republic . And is the Union indeed to fall ? Are we to be divided into separate States or many confederacies , each warring against the other , the sport of foreign oligarchs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country and of mankind ? Can we yet save the Republic ? This is a feaiful and momentous question , but it must be answered , and answered Now . Inaction is syncope . Delay is death . The life of the Republic is ebbing fast , and the approaching Ides of March may toll the funeral words , It is too late ! What then must be done to avert the dread catastrophe ? Action , immediate and energetic action , in the field // and in Congress . Winter is the best season for a campaign in the South . On-on-on with the banner of the Republic , by land and sea , and with all the reinforcements , from the Ohio and Potomac to the Gulf . On , also , with the necessary measures in Congress to save our finances from ruin , arrest the depreciation of our national currency , and restore the public credit . We are upon the verge of ruin . We are hanging over the gulf of an irredeemable paper system , and its spectral shade , repudiation , is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save us ; but what of the next ? Would they , if they could ? Who can answer ? Can they , if they would ? No I no ! It will then be too l*tte . Never did any representative assembly encounter so fearful a responsibility as the present Congress . Each member must vote as if the fate of the Union and of humanity depended upon his action . He must rise above the passing clouds of passion and prejudice , of State , local , or selfish interests , into the serene and holy atmosphere , illumined by the light of truth , and warmed by the love of his country and of mankind . His only inquiry must be , What will save the nation ? The allegiance to the Union is paramount , its maintenance the supreme law , ' the le legum , of highest obligation , and he who , abandoning this principle , follows in preference any real or supposed State policy , is a secessionist in action , and a traitor to his country and mankind . Should the catastrophe happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infamy ; and , if he be snatched from oblivion , his only epitaph will he : here lies a destroyer of the American Union . He did not destroy it by bullets , but by votes . He did not march against it with armed battalions ; but , a sentinel , he slept on the post of duty , and-his country fell . What , then , can Congress do ? They can consider at o this great financial question , uninterrupted by any other measure , until there shall have been action complete and decisive . But two months more remain of the session . Not another day nor hour must be lost . All admit that something must be done , and done quickly . What then is the remedy for our depreciated and depreciating national currency ? The Secretary of the Treasury anticipated the disaster , and proposed a remedy in 1861 . II gave his bank plan then my earnest and immediate support . Well would it have been for our country if it had then been adopted , and gold would not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's experience and deliberation , the Secretary reitcrates his former recommendation , with words of solemn import , and arguments of great force . His is the chief responsibility . To him is mainly intrusted the custody of the public credit . His is now the duty of saving us from national bankruptcy . At such a time , I would differ from him on such a question , only on the clearest convictions , and then only upon the condition that I had a better plan as a substitute , and that mine could become a law now , and be carried now into practical execution . If all this could not be done , I would support the plan of the Secretary , as all admit that delay or inaction is death . If my words be too bold or earnest , let them be attributed to my profound conviction that the American Union is in extreme peril , and that its downfall involves the final catastrophe of our country and of our race . Let no man talk of a separation of the Union in any contingency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed treason . Let none think of constructing separate nationalities out of the broken and bleeding fragments of a dismembered Union . No ; far better that our wrecked and blasted earth should swing from its orbit , disinte* grate into its original atoms , and its place remain forever vacant in the universe , than that we should survive , // with such memories of departed glory , and such a burning sense of unutterable infamy and degradation . Fallen - fallen- fallen ! from the highest pinnacle to the lowest depth , to rise no more forever ! What American would wish to live , and encounter such a destiny ? And why fallen ? From a cause mori* damning than our fate . Fallen , let the truth be told , as history would record , because faction was stronger than patriotism , and the degenerate sons of noble sires extinguished the world 's last hope , by basely surrendering the American Union to the foul coalition of slavery and treason . This rebellion is the most stupendous crime in the annals of our race , and its projectors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are doomed to immortal infamy . With its demoniac passions , its satanic ambition , desecrating the remains of the slain , making goblets of their skulls , and trinkets of their bones , this revolt is a heliograph of iDahomey , and Devildom daguerreotyped more vividly than by Dant6 or Milton . The plan of the Secretary is clear , simple , comprehensive , practical , and effective . It is the plan of an uniform circulation , furnished by the Federal Government to banking associations organized by Congress , securing prompt redemption by the deposit of the same amount of U. S. six percent . stock in the Federal custody , the principal and interest of this stock being payable in gold . This plan , with me , is a necessity , and not a choice . It is the plan of the Secretary , and not mine , and is therefore supported by me from no vanity of authorship . Nay , more , it required me to overcome strong prejudices against any bank circulation , and especially any connected in any way with the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Secretary , that the proposed connection of the banks with the Government is not political , and attended with none of the formidable objections to the late Bank of the United States . Ever since 131 the bank suspension of 1837 , I have been a bullionist , and sustained that doctrine in the Senate of the United States , and as Secretary of the Treasury . The act establishing the independent treasury in 1846 , was drawn by me , avowedly as a specie receiving and *pecw circulating ' institution , and to restrain excessive issues by the banks ; but it is impossible now to carry that system into practical execution . The suspension of specie payment by the banks and the Government , has been forced by the enormous expenditures of the war , and the sub-treasury , which never was designed for the custody or disbursement of paper , has been so far virtually superseded . In acceding now , as in December , 1861 , to the Secretary 's plan of a bank circulation , I must be understood as having changed my views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield to the great emergency , which renders the support of the war and of the Union paramount to any question of coin or currency . The national disbursements for the present and succeeding fiscal year , as stated by the Secretary , together with his remarks on that subject , supersede the necessity of any further argument in proof of the absolute impossibility of specie payments now by the Government . We are compelled to resort to paper , and the only question is as to the character and extent of the issue . It is my opinion that we should limit this paper currency , as far as practicable , that it may be as little depreciated now as possible ; so that when the rebellion is crushed , the banks and the Government may resume specie payments at the earliest moment . I favor the plan of the Secretary mainly because , by arresting depreciation , it would furnish a currency approaching specie now more nearly than can be accomplished in any other way , and because , when the war is over , it provides the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to specie payments . An irredeemable // paper currency dissolves contracts , violates good faith , and its history here and in Europe is a record of financial ruin , bankruptcy , and repudiation , of frauds , crimes , and demoralization , which no friend of his country or race can desire to witness . The issue of treasury notes as a legal tender was favored by me as a necessity , superinduced by the rebellion , and as a substitute for the present bank issues . Such notes would be depreciated much less when made a legal tender , and , to that extent , our expenditures would be diminished , and specie payments could , therefore , be resumed eventually at a much earlier period . Why , then , it is asked , not continue and extend that system , rather than adopt the plan recommended by the Secretary ? Because , Congress refusing to prohibit a bank circulation , such increased issues of treasury notes would cause a further great depreciation of such notes , to that extent augment our expenditures , and postpone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now commands a premium of thirty-two per cent. , payable in treasury notes ; but , if such issues be increased one half , they would fall to fifty per cent. , and , if doubled , to at least sixty per cent . below specie . At the last rate , if our yearly expenditures , paid in paper , reached $700,000,000 , this would command but $280,000,000 in gold , thus subjecting the Government to a loss of $420,000,000 per annum , and at thirty-two per cent . discount , $224 ,  - -  000,000 per annum . These notes , it is true , bear no interest , which at six per cent . on $280,000,000 , would save $16 ,  - -  800,000 a year . But as under the Secretary 's plan ( hereafter developed ) the Government would only pay an annual interest of four per cent . on this loan , the saving would only be $11,200,000 . Deduct this interest thus saved from the $420,000,000 of increased annual expenditures , arising from such depreciation of treasury notes , and the result is a net loss of $408,800,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such redundant and depreciated currency . Surely , such a system would soon terminate in bankruptcy and repudiation , repeating the history of French assignats and Continental money . Nor is it the Government only that suffers from such a disaster , but the ruin extends to the people . There is no law more clearly established than this : that the currency of a country bears a certain fixed proportion to its wealth and business . If we expand the currency beyond this proportion , we violate this law , and will surely suffer the terrible penalties of this disobedience . This law is so certain and invariable , that , if the expansion beyond this proportion should be even in specie , the result would still be disastrous . This was illustrated during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella , when Spain , having opened the virgin mines of America , brought the precious metals in countless millions within her limits , and restricted their exportation by the most stringent penalties . And what was the consequence ? Mr. Prescott , of Boston , tells us in his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the silver quarries of Zacatecas and Potosi were jealously locked up within the limits of the Peninsula . ' The golden tide , which , permitted a free vent , would have fertilized the region through which it poured , now buried the land under a deluge , which blighted every green and living thing . Agriculture , commerce , MANEFACTTJRES , every branch of national industry and improvement , languished and fell to decay ; and the nation , like the Phrygian monarch who turned all that he touched into gold , cursed by the very consummation of its wishes , was poor in the midst of its treasures . ' Such was the effect of violating the law which regulates the ratio of money to wealth ; such the consequence of a superabundant currency , even in specie . The result was that Spain , which had been the most prosperous nation of Europe , // and whose products and manufactures had supplied the markets of the world , lost nearly all her exports , and was forced to resort to the prohibitory system . The cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of making and sailing ships , became so high in Spain , from her superabundant currency , that she was unable to compete with any other nation , was reduced to poverty , and never began to recover until Spain changed her system , encouraged the exportation of the precious metals , and thus brought down her superabundant currency and inflated prices , and thus enabled Spanish industry to supply the markets of the Peninsula and of the world . ' Then , the distinguished historian tells us , the precious metals , instead of flowing in so abundantly as to palsy the arm of industry7 , only served to stimulate it , the forel*4 intercourse of the country was everyday more widely extended ; ' the flourishing condition of the nation *was seen in the wealth and population of its cities , ' etc . It is a redundant currency , even if gold or convertible into gold , that produces these evils , although depreciation adds to the disaster . What is the effect here of a redundant currency , is ascertained by reference to our exports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed here in 1836- ' 7 rose to $168,233,675 , being largely more than double what they were in 1832 ( $76 ,  - -  989,793 ) , and nearly double the consumption , per c pita , which was $5.61 in 1832 , and $10.93 in 1836 . This was our great year of a redundant , although still a convertible currency , when our imports consumed exceeded our exports of domestic produce , $61,662,733 ; and so enhanced was the cost of living and production here , that we actually imported breadstuffs that year of the value of $5,271,576 . ( Table 1 , Coin . and Nay . ) Our bank currency that year was as follows : Circulation , $149,185 ,  - -  890 ; deposits , $127,397,185 ; circulation and deposits , $276,583,075 ; loans , $525 ,  - -  115,702 . ( Treasury Report , 1838 , Doc . 79 , tables K. K. ) The legitimate result of this expansion of loans and currency was the great bank suspension of May , 1837 , and general bankruptcy throughout the country . Now our bank circulation in 1860 was $207,102,477 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $460 ,  - -  904,606 ; loans , $691,495,580 . ( Table 34 , Census of 1860 . ) Yet our population in 1860 was more than double that of 1837 , and our wealth ( the true barometer , mar king the proper rise and fall of our currency ) had much more than quadrupled . ( Census Table 35 . ) The proportion of the currency to wealth in 1837 was more than double the ratio of 1860 . It was not the tariff that produced the suspension of 1837 , for it was much lower in 1860 , than at the date of the bank suspension of 1837 . By Treasury Table 24 , our total exports abroad of domestic produce , exclusive of specie , from the 30th of September , 1821 , to 30th June , 1861 , were $5,060,929,667 ; and , in the year ending the 30th June , 1860 , were $316,242,423 . At the same rate of increase from 1860 to 1870 , as from 1850 to 1860 , our domestic exports exclusive of specie in the decade ending the 30th June , 1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace continued and the currency been no more redundant in proportion to our wealth than in 1860 . But with a redundant and depreciated currency our exports must have been reduced at least one fourth . What would be the effect on every branch of our industry , may be learned by looking at Treasury Table 40 , showing our domestic exports for the year ending 30th June , 1861 . These exports were , of the products of our fisheries , $4,451,515 ; of the forest , $10,260,809 ; of agriculture , exclusive of cotton , rice , and tobacco , $100,273,655 , and of our manufactures , $35,786,804 . This was mainly from the loyal States . Now if the foreign markets for our products are re // duced only one fourth by the effect of a redundant currency , inflating here the cost of production and of living , the result would be most disastrous to our industry . The reduction would be equal , as we have seen , to $125,000 ,  - -  000 per annum , and $1,250,000,000 in the decade . Our imports would be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corresponding ratio . Supposing the average rate of duties of the present tariff to be equal to 40 per cent . ad valorem , this would make a difference in our revenue from customs of $500,000,000 *thedecade , and , includinginterest not compounded , $635,000,000 . And here I deem it a duty to say to the financial portion of our peace party , especially in New York , that our redundant and depreciated currency , with our failure to crush the rebellion , and a consequent dissolution of the Union , would make repudiation inevitable . We are forced , then , by a due regard to our material interests , as well *s by the higher obligations of honor *nd duty , to subdue the revolt and restore the supremacy of the Government in every State . This we can and must do . It is due to our country and to the world . It is due to the wounded and mutilated survivors of the bloody conflict , and to our martyred dead , murdered by the foulest treason , and in the accursed cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been poured out in vain . It is a question mainly of money and persistence . Our armies can and will conquer the rebellion , if we can and will supply the sinews of war . Our success is much more a financial than a military question . As regards the result , the Secretary of the Treasury holds now the most important post in this contest : he is the generalissimo ; and as he is right on this question , and the fate of the Union is involved , I deem it my duty to give him my earnest and zealous support . Ruinous as must be the effect of a redundant and depreciated currency upon all industrial pursuits , the injustice to our gallant army and navy , regulars and volunteers , would be attended with extreme peril . Upon their courage and endurance we must rely for success . We have pledged to our brave troops , who are wounded or dying by thousands that the Union may live , such pay as to enable them while fighting our battles to make allotments of portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their absence . We have promised pensions also . These are all solemn pledges on the part of our Government , and our faith is violated if this pay or these pensions are reduced . But there is no difference between a law directly reducing this pay and these pensions , and the adoption by Congress of the policy of a redundant and depreciated currency which will produce the same result . Every vote then in Congress for such a policy , is a vote to reduce the pay and pensions for our troops , and to annihilate the allotments made by them for the support of their families . What effect such a policy must have on our troops and the maintenance of the Union is but too palpable . It is disbandment and dissolution . Every such vote is given also to reduce the value of the wages of labor , and for increased taxation , to the extent , as we have seen , of $408,800,000 per annum . It is a vote also to reduce our exports and revenue from customs , to paralyze our industry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote against the war , for repudiation and disunion , and hence every disunionist will oppose the plan of the Secretary . To what extent this redundancy and depreciation will go , by enlarged issues of legal tender treasury notes , we may learn from the fact that the banks substitute them for coin for the redemption of their paper . Now , just in proportion as the issue of treasury notes becomes redundant and depreciated , will the bank circulation , redeemable in // such notes , augment and depreciate also . This is the law of bank circulation as now forced upon us by Congress . It is the law of redundancy and depreciation . If this policy is adopted by Congress , an enlarged issue made of treasury notes , and the plan of the Secretary discarded , our bank and treasury note circulation , with the war continued , will very largely exceed one billion of dollars before the close of the next fiscal year , and both will be depreciated much more than sixty per cent . Thus , if we should enlarge our issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made the basis of bank issues , in the ratio of three to one , our total paper circulation would be $2,000,000,000 , such treasury notes inflating the bank issues , and both depreciating together . And yet this is the currency in which it is proposed to conduct the war and the business of the country . The banks alone , by excessive loans and issues , would grow rich apparently , on the rule of their country . But there would be a terrible retribution . The result would be general insolvency and repudiation , the debts due the banks would become orthiess , and they be involved in the general ruin . It is then the interest of the banks to sustain the Government and the Secretary , and to transfer their capital to the new associations . This is especially the case with the New York banks , which , under a provision of their State constitution , HAVE NO LEGAL ExISTENcE . When repudiation and bankruptcy become general , the cry , like that of a routed army in a panic flight , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old and a new court party , especially under our miserable system of an elective judiciary ; and the banks be crushed by wicked legal devices , as they were in the West and Southwest in 1824 and 1838 . Referring to bank issues , the Secretary says , in his last report : It was only when the United States notes , having been made a legal tender , were diverted from their legitimate use as a currency , and made the basis of bank circulation , that the great increase of the latter began . ' At the present depreciation of these treasury notes , it is better for the banks , by one third , to redeem their circulation in these notes , rather than in specie ; and they need keep only one dollar of treasury notes for three of bank circulation . This is the policy forced upon the banks by Congress . But the more redundant and depreciated this currency becomes , the easier will it be for the banks to provide the basis of redemption , and expand their circulation in the ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank currency for each dollar of treasury notes held by them . Thus it is that the enlarged issue of treasury notes necessarily increases the bank circulation , in the ratio of three to one , and thus also , that the circulation of bank and treasury notes becomes redundant and depreciated . Under such a policy , every bank then , however loyal its stockholders or officers , becomes a citadel , whose artillery bears with more fearful effect upon the Government than all the armies of the rebellion . This will soon become obvious , and the odium will rest upon the banks , their officers and stockholders . But the real responsibility will be with Congress , who , by such a system will have arrayed the banks in necessary and inevitable hostility to the Government . Such , we all know , is not the intention of Congress ; but as this result will necessarily flow from their measures , upon them , in the end , will fall the terrible responsibility of the disaster . It is this appalling condition of our finances that gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention . But if Congress will adopt the policy of the Secretary , they will render certain the triumph of the Union , and the rebels , from despair and exhaustion , must soon abandon the contest . // We have seen how dreadful is the disaster which the banks would bring on the country by pursuing the present system , and how terrible the odium to which they would be subjected . But now let us look at the result , if the plan of the Secretary is adopted . The new banks would become fiscal agents of the Government . Their circulation would be uniform , furnished by the Government , and based on U.S. stocks , the principal and interest of which would be payable in gold . The interest of labor and capital , of the banks , the Government , and the people , would for the first time become inseparably united and consolidated . This is a grand result , and fraught with momentons consequences to the country . Every citizen , whether a stockholder of the banks or not , would have a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the people , would have this interest , not merely as holding the notes of the banks , which would become our currency , but because the banks would hold the stock of the Government , would have loaned it in this way the money to suppress the rebellion , and thus have saved us from a redundant and depreciated currency , from inevitable bankruptcy and repudiation , and have prevented tbe overthrow of the Union . Each bank would then become a citadel over which should float the flag of the Union , for each bank would then become a powerful auxiliary for the support of the Government and the overthrow of the rebellion . The bill divorcing the banks and the Government was drawn by me , as Secretary of the Treasury , in 1846 , to enlarge the circulation of specie , and restrain excessive issues of bank paper . I go for the reunion now , as proposed by the Secretary , to enable the Government to effect loans upon their stock , to prevent a redun*lant and depreciated paper currency , with a correspondent increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war is over , to resume specie payment at the earliest practicable period . I was for restraining excessive paper issues then , and so am I now , as far as possible . I carried into full effect then the divorce of the Government and the banks , against a terrible opposition from them and the great Whig party . I made the divorce complete , a vinculo matrimonji : so now I would make the union complete , so far as proposed by the Secretary , for the interest of the banks and the Government would be united , and just as you strengthened the banks and increased their capital and profits , would you fund more and more treasury notes , and save us from the ruin of a redundant and depreciated currency . The Secretary proposes to make these banks depositories of treasury notes , received by the Government for all dues except customs . This is well ; for to use the sub-treasury to receive and circulate treasury notes , is against the object for which it was created . Such deposits should be secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely increase the demand for this stock . During nearly my first two years as Secretary of the Treasury , the public moneys were deposited by me in the State banks , secured by United States and State stocks , and there was no loss . Nor , indeed , was there any loss or default by any officer , agent , or employe of the Treasury Department during my entire term of four years , notwithstanding the large loans and war expenditures . Disbursing officers should also deposit with the banks , and pay as formerly by checks on them , with the same guarantee by them of U. S. stocks . how far , and to what extent , and under what special provisions the gold received for customs might be deposited with these banks , may be the subject of discussion hereafter . If this system were adopted in its entirety , the process of absorbing treasury notes would commence at once , and also a correspondent rise in their market // value . The system of loans and funding saved England from bankruptcy during her long wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as loans , in the usual way , except at ruinous discounts , for any large amounts , are impracticable , we are left to the alternative of the Secretary 's system , or bankruptcy , repudiation , and disunion . I have another suggestion to make as regards these notes furnished by the Government to the banks , secured by U. S. stocks . These notes are guaranteed not only by the stock of the Government , but , in addition , by the whole capital and property , real and personal , of the banks , and a prior lich on the whole to the Government , to secure the payment of these notes . These notes are receivable by the Government for all dues except customs . These notes are a national currency , furnished by the nation and secured by its stock . These notes then , as in England , should be a legal tender in payment of all debts , except by the banks . As the banks can redeem these issues in legal tender treasury notes , these issues of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the banks . There is another reason why this currency should be made a legal tender . Our two last suspensions of specie payments by the banks , viz. , in 1857 and in 1860 , were based upon panics , yet they had the same disastrous effect , for the time , as if arising from short crops , overtrading , or a currency greatly redundant . Such panic convulsions are caused mainly by the call for the redemption of bank notes in specie , based on the fear of suspension and depreciation . But if such notes , as in European government banks , were a legal tender , except by the banks , such panics would be far less frequent here , and less injurious . The present system , as compared with that of Europe , discriminates most unjustly against our country . As a general rule , the American creditor can not demand gold from the foreign debtor , but such foreign or domestic creditor could always demand gold from the American debtor . This discrimination has produced here the most disastrous consequences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our whole banking system requires radical reform . We have had eight general bank suspensions under our present bank system , many of them continuing for years , and producing ruin and desolation . Under our present system , to talk , as a general rule , of well-regulated banks , is to talk of a well-regulated famine or pestilence , or of a well-regulated earthquake or tornado . And even the few banks that are claimed to be well managed , have no appreciable effect on the system . It is the system that knows no uniformity or security , and never can have , as now organized . That a system so perilous and explosive , should have even partially succeeded is proof only of the intelligence and integrity , generally , of the bank officers and directors , but no recommendation of the system itself . The want of uniformity as to commercial regulations , led to the adoption of our Federal Constitution ; and yet we have no uniformity as to money , which represents commerce and effects its interchanges . In this respect , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have thereby so weakened the Government as to have invited this rebellion . Indeed , the State banks in the revolted States were the main auxiliaries of treason and secession , and supplied , to a vast extent , the sinews of war . By Census Table 34 , there were in 1860 , 1,642 banks , incorporated by thirty-four States , with no uniformity of organization , issues , or security . Thus is it that the States have usurped the power to regulate commerce and currency , and to emit bills of credit , in defiance of the prohibition of the Federal Constitution . The Egyptians abandoned their folly after seven plagues ; but we have had // eight bank convulsions , and yet we adhere to the wretched system . I believe it was slavery caused the rebellion , but , in the absence of powerful aid from the Southern banks , the revolted States could never have maintained so prolonged a contest . Organized as now proposed , these new banks , and all who held their notes , must have sustained the Government . Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace , large armies and navies to preserve the Government . But necessary as these may be , they would not be more important than the system now proposed as a security for the preservation of the Government . My last suggestion is , that as regards all such United States loans , as during the war shall become the basis of this system , the time of payment shall be made twenty years instead of five , so as , with the modifications above proposed , to insure the cooperation of the banks , and the success of the system . As this plan is deemed essential to save our finances , to suppress the rebellion , and maintain the Union , why incur any hazard on such a question as this ? In all our wars , including the present , we have issued bonds running twenty years to maturity , and the bonds , redeemable in 1881 , are scarcely at par . Why , then , issue a stock of less value , which may fail to accomplish the great object , when a better security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed by the Secretary , against a fixed interest of six per cent . on a great debt , for twenty years , ' if it can be avoided ; but I also concur in that portion of his report in which he says : No very early day will probably witness the reduction of the public debt to the amount required as a basis for secured circulation . ' To that extent , then , would I enlarge the time for the maturity of the bonds . Surely , if this be necessary to secure the cooperation of the banks , and the capital of the country , there should be no hesitation . Even if the system , based only on the bonds of short date , should ultimately succeed , the loss , in the interim , from a redundant and depreciated currency , would far exceed any benefit derived from the substitution of five-twenties for twenty year bonds . By Census Table 35 , our wealth in 1850 , was $7,135,780,228 , and in 1860 , $16,159,616,068 , the ratio of increase during the decade being 126.45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1870 would be $36,583,450,585 , and in 1880 , $82,843,222,849 . Surely , then , at these periods , it would be much easier to liquidate this debt than in 1867 . But , were it otherwise , the immediate gain from decreased expenditures , arising from funding more rapidly our treasury notes , thus rendering our currency less redundant and depreciated , with the revival of the public credit , and its immediate happy influence , North and South , here and in Europe , would far more than compensate for any contingent advantage arising from short loans . Our twenty years ' loan is now barely at par , and the five-twenties below par . The difficulty of inducing bank and other capital to invest hundreds of millions of dollars under the new system is very great . Is it wise to commence the effort , confined to our weakest securities , now below par ? Besides , considering the old and new debts , and constantly increasing responsibilities , is there any prospect that we will have liquidated all these before the end of five years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doubtful , and a contingency so improbable , we ought not to risk the fate of a measure on which depends the safety of the Union . But if we could pay off the five-twenty loan held by the new banks , is it prudent to assume that so many hundred millions of capital will be withdrawn from the present banks and other business for investment in the new banks , which may cease at the end of five years by payment of the bonds ? The change from the old to the new banks // may involve some loss at first , but , if the system may be arrested at the end of five years , just when profits might be realizing , the plan could scarcely succeed . When the Secretary first proposed this system in December , 1861 , he probably would have succeeded with the fivetwenties , in the condition at that date of the public credit . But the disastrous fall of our securities since that date , seems now to require bonds of a higher value . I would then provide a twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the new bank circulation . But it is not a six , but only a four per cent . twenty years ' loan that is proposed , by deducting one per cent . semi-annually from the interest of the bonds made the basis of this bank circulation . This deduction would only be a fair equivalent for the expenses incurred by the Government in furnishing the circulation , for the release of taxes , for the deposit of public moneys with these banks , for making their notes a legal tender , and receiving them for all dues except customs . The tax on all other bank circulation should be one and a half per cent . semi-annually , secured by adequate penalties . If , under this system , during this stupendous rebellion , involving the existence of the Government , with armies and expenditures unexampled in history , the Secretary ( as , with the aid of Congress and the banks , I believe he can ) should secure us a sound and uniform currency , and negotiate vast loans , running twenty years , at par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum , he will have accomplished a financial miracle , and deserved a fame nearest to that of the first and greatest of his predecessors , the peerless Hamilton . The bill organizing the new system , presented in Congress by Mr. looper last summer , is drawn with great ability , and it is much to be deplored , that ( with some amendments ) it had not then become a law , when it could have 139 been much more easily put in operation , and would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars to the Government . But the fifty-fifth section of that bill provides that all the banks organized under it are to become depositaries of the public moneys , ' excepting those in the city of Washington . ' Why this discrimination I If there be any place where banks , organized under a national charter , issuing a national currency , and receiving national deposits , should be encouraged , it is here . With no discrimination against them , such banks would be established here with considerable capital . And why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such banks here , and thus defeat , to that extent , the success of the system . It is here , if anywhere , that such banks should receive the public deposits , where they could be constantly secured from day to day under the immediate supervision of the Government . Besides , the only effect of such a discrimination would be to drive such banks to Georgetown , Alexandria , or some other speculative site outside the city or District . This city has just been consecrated to freedom by Congress , and it is hoped that , in commencing its new career , no discrimination will be made against it . Indeed , I think it would be wise in order to insure the success here of the new system , to allow the district banks organized under this law to receive the same rate of interest as is permitted in New York . I have contended , during the last fourth of a century , that all State bank currency is unconstitutional . This rebellion will demonstrate the truth of that proposition , and the question ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . This , it is true , might require some of those Judges , if then living , to change their opinion on some points ; but this has been done before , and even on constitutional questions ; and State banks will fall before judicial action , as well // as nullification , State allegiance , secess1on , and the whole brood of kindred heresies . A republic which can not regulate its currency , or which leaves that power with thirty-four separate States , each legislating at its pleasure and without uniformity , abandons an essential national authority , and this abdication has furnished one of the main supports of the rebellion . With nothing but a national currency , the revolted States never could have successfully inaugurated this war , and we must deprive them in all time to come of thisterrible ally of treason . To permit the States to provide the circulating medium , the money of the country , is to enable them to furnish the sinews of war , and clothe them with a power to overthrow the Government . With only such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government to these banks , organized by Congress , and based on the deposit in the Federal treasury of United States stock , the rebellion would have been impossible . Our Government was so mild and benignant , that we deemed it exempt from the assault of traitors ; but this revolt has dissipated this delusion , and warned us to provide all the safeguards indicated by experience as necessary to *naintain the Union . Among the most important is the resumption by the Government of the great sovereign function of regulating the currency and giving to it uniformity and nationality . Such was clearly the intention of the Constitution . The Government has , by the Constitution , the exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several States . ' But commerce is regulated mainly by money , and by it all interstate and international exchanges of products are made . If the currency is redundant , prices rise , exports are diminished ; and the reverse follows with a contracted circulation . But banks inflate or restrict the currency at their pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and revenue . But they also destroy or depreciate the money of the Government , and deprive it of a vital power . Thus , the nation issues treasury notes , and makes them a legal tender : the banks immediately make such notes the basis of bank issues , in the ratio of three to one , and the whole currency necessarily becomes redundant and depreciated ; and thus this essential power of the Government is controlled by the States , and , for all practical purposes , annihilated . Chief Justice Marshall , in delivering the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States ( 4 Wheaton 193 ) , said : Wherever the terms in which a power is granted to Congress , or the nature of the power require that it should be exercised exclusively by Congress , the subject is as completely taken from the State Legislatures as if they had been forbidden to act on it . ' Now , it has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States ( 9 Wheaton 1 ) that , this power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the water , that it includes intercourse and navigation , and vessels , as vehicles of commerce , that it includes an embargo which is prohibitory , that this power is nxcuiSIVELY vested in Cono'ress ' and no part of it can be exercised by a State . ' Now , the question , whether the notes of a State bank , issued on the authority of a State , and designed to circulate as money , conflicts with this clause of the Constitution , has never been decided by the Supreme Uourt of the United States . This is a new and momentous question , never yet adjudicated by the Supreme Court ; but how they would now decide that point , with the light thrown upon it by this rebellion , I can not doubt . The Government also has the sole power to lay and collect duties , which shall be uniform throughout the United States , ' and the States are prohibited from exercising this authority . But this power also is in fact controlled // by the banks , and the revenue from imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can modify or repeal tariffs at their pleasure , for , they have only to inflate the circulation , and prices rise here to the extent of the duties , and the tariff becomes inoperative . Of all the branches of our industry , the manufacturing is injured most by a redundant currency , limiting our fabrics to a partial supply at home , and driving them from the foreign market . Give us a sound , stable , uniform currency , sufficient but not redundant , and our skilled , educated , and intelligent labor will , in time , defy all competition . But the banks , as now conducted , are the great enemies of American industry . The Government has also the sole power to coin money , regulate the value thereof , ' etc . But the banks now regulate its value by controlling prices , by substituting their money for coin , and by expelling it from the country at their pleasure . Recollect , these powers over commerce and money are exclusive , not concurrent , so adjudicated , and the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them altogether from the States . The conceded fact that these powers are exclusive , proves that the States can not , by any instrumentality , directly or indirectly , control their exercise . An exclusive authority necessarily forbids any control or interference . But there are express prohibitions in the Constitution as well as grants . That instrument declares that no State shall emit bills of credit . ' The State itself can not emit circulating paper : how then can it authorize this to be done by a State corporation , which is the mere creature of a State law ? The State can not authorize its Governor to issue such paper : how then can it direct a cashier , deriving all his power only from a State law , to do the . same thing ? Quifacit per alium , facit per se , and this fundamental maxim of law and reason is violated when a State does through any instrumentality , created by it , what the State can not do itself . It is true that a majority of the Supreme Court of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky did not violate that clause of the Constitution forbidding States to emit bills of credit , ' but Justice Story , in his dissenting opinion , said : When this cause was formerly argued before this court , a majority of the judges who then heard it were decidedly of opinion that the act of Kentucky establishing this bank was unconstitutional and void , as amounting to an authority to emit bills of credit , for and on behalf of the State , within the prohibition of the Constitution of the United States . In principle , it was thought to be decided by the case of Craig v. the State of Missouri ( 4 Peters 410 ) . Among that majority was the late Chief Justice Marshall . ' This decision , then , in the case of the Bank of Kentucky , is overthrown , as an authority , by the fact that it was against the decision of the Supreme Court in a former ease , and against the opinion of a majority of the court in that very case before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court in the Missouri case ( 4 Peters 410 ) , Chief Justice Marshall defined what is that bill of credit which a State can not emit . He says : If the prohibition means anything , if the words are not empty sounds , it must comprehend the emission of any paper medium by a State Government , for the purpose of common circulation . ' And he also says : Bills of credit signify a paper medium , intended to circulate between individuals , and between Government and individuals , for the ordinary purposes of society . ' That the notes of the Bank of Kentucky came within this definition and decision , is clearly stated by Justice Story . In that case also it was expressly decided , that if the issues be unconstitutional , the notes given for the loan of them ARE VOID . It is said , however , // that the bills are issued by a bank , not by the State ; but the bank is created by the State , and authorized by the State to issue these notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Marshall , in this case , And can this make any real difference ? Is the proposition to be maintained that the Constitution meant to prohibit names and not things ? ' On this subject , Justice Story says : That a State may rightfully evade the prohibitions of the Constitution by acting through the instrumentality of agents in the evasion , instead of acting in its own direct name , is a doctrine to which I can never subscribe , ' etc . I am conscious that Justice Story also said in the same case , arguendo : the States may create banks as well as other corporations , upon private capital ; and , SO FAR AS THIS PROHIBITION IS cONcERNED , may rightfully authorize them to issue bank bills or notes as currency , subject always to the control of Gongress , whose powers extend to the entire regulation of the currency of the country . ' It will be observed , that Justice Story gives no opinion as to whether the issues of such banks are constitutional , whether they conflict or not with the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only says ( and the limitation is most significant ) , they do not violate the prohibition as to bills of credit ( from which I dissent ) ; but he does declare that to Congress belongs the entire regulation of the currency . ' Now this power must rest on the authority of Congress to regulate coin and commerce . But these powers , we have seen , were not concurrent , but exclusive ; and , in the language of Chief Justice Marshall , in delivering the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court in the case before quoted from 4 Wheaton 193 , as to any such power that should be exercised exclusively by Congress , the subject is as completely taken from the State Legislature as if they had been forl4dden to act on it . ' All then who agree that Congress has the entire regulation of the currency , ' must admit that all banks of issue incorporated by States are unconstitutional , not because such issues are bills of credit , but because they violate the exclusive authority of Congress to regulate commerce , coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question has never been adjudicated by the Supreme Court , yet , if their decision in fourth and ninth Wheaton is maintained , such bank issues are clearly unconstitutional . It is clear , also , whatever may be the case of bank issues* based only upon private capital , ' or , in the language of Judge Story , if the corporate stock , and that only by the charter , is made liable for the debts of the State , such issues do violate the prohibition against bills of credit . Such bank issues , then , as are furnished and countersigned by State officers , acting under State laws , and are secured by the deposit with the State of its own stock , are most clearly unconstitutional . In No. 44 ( by Hamilton ) of the Federalist , the great contemporaneous exposition of the Constitution ( prepared by Hamilton , Madison , and Chief Justice Jay of the Supreme Court of the United States ) , it is said : The same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium instead of coin . ' Such was the opinion of the two great founders of the Constitution ( Hamilton and Madison ) , and its first judicial expositor , the eminent Chief Justice Jay . Justice Story quotes and approves this remarkable passage , and says that the prohibition was aimed at a paper medium which was intended to circulate as money , and to that alone . ' In his message of December 3 , 1816 , President Madison , referring expressly to a bank and paper medium , said : It is essential that the nation should pos // sess a currency of equal value , credit , and use , wherever it may circulate . The Constitution has entrusted Congress exclusively with the power of creating and regulating a currency of that description . ' This rebellion proves the awful danger of State violations of the Federal Constitution . The rebellion is the child of State usurpation , State supremacy , State allegiance , and State secession . And now the Government is paralyzed financially , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to State banks , depreciating the currency , and State banks based on State stocks . The Government wishes a currency , not redundant , and to borrow money to save the Union . But one State says , we have placed all our surplus money in State banks , and another State ( as in the case of New York ) says , we have based the circulation of these banks , mainly on our own State bonds , and you must do nothing which will injuriously affect their value . It is true the Union is in danger , but are not the credit of State banks and State bonds of higher value than the Union ? The State first , the Union afterwards . Our paramount duty is to our State . and that to the Union is subordinate . Why , this is the very language of rebellion-the echo of South Carolina treason . But it is not the language of the Constitution , which declares that " This Constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land : and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . " The supremacy then , is with the Federal Constitution and laws ; otherwise there could be no uniformity or nationality . And does New York suppose that she can tear down the temple of the Union , and that the principal  |p11-lar  which supported the arch will stand firm and erect ? No ! if the Union falls , New York will only be the most conspicuous among the broken columns . But New York knows that the path of interest is that of honor and of duty . It is the Union only that has made her great . It is the concentration by the Union of interstate and international commerce in her great city , that was consummating its imperial destiny . Before the Union of 1778 and 1787 , New York city was the village of Manhattan : destroy the Union , and she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trident of the ocean , the sceptre of the world 's commerce would fall from her grasp , and London be left without a rival . Deprive the Government of the power to regulate commerce , and the fall of New York will be as rapid as her rise . Each State then , as before the Constitution , would control its own commerce , and the railroads and canals of New York would cease to be the vehicles of the trade of the nation and of the world . Each State , as under the old Confederacy , would force cornmerce into her own ports by prohibitory or discriminating statutes . No , when New York takes from the Union the exclusive control of commerce , she commits suicide . One uniform regulation of commerce , and one uniform currency , are more essential to the prosperity of New York than to that of any other State . New York represents interstate and international commerce . There are concentrated our imports and exports , and there three fourths of our revenue is collected . There , if the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation and of the world . If the rebellion succeeds , the separation of the East and West is just as certain as that of the North and South . Discord would reign supreme , and States and parts of States become petty sovereignties , mere pawns , to be moved on the  |p0-  // litical chess board by the kings and queens of Europe . As New York has derived the greatest benefits from the Union , so would she suffer most from its fall . It is New York to whom the Union transferred the command of her own commerce , and ultimately that of the world . It is New York to which England looks as the future successful rival of London , and it is New York at whom England chiefly aims the blow in desiring to overthrow tue Union . The interest of New York in the price of bank or State stock is insignificant compared with her still greater stake in the success of the Union . Indeed , if the Union should fall , State and bank stock and all property will be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if the war continues , we have seen that a redundant and depreciated currency would increase our expenditures $408,800,000 per annum . This would require a like addition to our annual tax , of which the share of New York would be over $50 ,  - -  000,000 , and the share of every other State in like proportion to its population . By Treasury Table 35 , the stocks , State and Federal , held by the New York banks in 1860 , was $29,605,318 , the circulation $28,239,950 , and the capital $111,821,957 . Thus it appears that the increased tax to be paid annucdly by New York , as the consequence of a redundant and depreciated currency , would be nearly double her whole bank circulation , and that thirteen months of this increased tax to be paid by the nation , would largely exceed the whole capital of all the banks of the United States in 1860 . ( Census Table 35 . ) These are the frightful results of an irredeemable , redundant , and depreciated currency . Such a course , on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of an individual who wishes to buy largely on his own credit and paper , but depreciates it so much as to compel him to pay quadruple prices , the result being bankruptcy and repudiation . There is great hope in the fact that New York takes no contracted view of this great question . She knows that her imperial destiny is identified with the fate of the Union . Realizing this great truth , she has more troops in the field than any other State , she has expended more money and more blood than any other State to suppress this rebellion , and she will never array State stocks or State banks in hostility to the safety of the Union . And what of Pennsylvania , that glorious old Commonwealth , so many of whose noble sons , ent off mostly in the morning of life , now fill graves prepared by treason ? Is she to become a border State , and her southern boundary the line of blood , marked by frowning forts , by bristling bayonets , by the tramp of contending armies , engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is New England to be re-colonized , and the British flag again to float over the chosen domain of freedom ? What of the small States , deprived of the secured equality and protective guarantees of the Constitution , to be surely crushed by more powerful communities ? What of the West ? Is it to be cut off from the seaboard , and rendered tributary to the maritime power ? What of the States of the Pacific ? Are they to lose the great imperial railways destined , under the Union , to connect them with the valley of the Mississippi and the Atlantic ? But alas ! why look at any of the bleeding and mutilated fragments , when all will be involved in a common ruin ? May a gracious Providence give us all , the wisdom to discern what is best for our beloved country , in this her day of fearful trial , and tue courage and patriotism to adopt whatever course is best calculated to save us from impending ruin !              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
