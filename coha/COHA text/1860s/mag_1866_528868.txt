WERE THEY CRICIFQETS ? ABOUT seven years ago , ( it is possible that some of my readers may recall it , ) the following paragraph appeared in the New York daily papers - " MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE . - A young man named George Snyder left the residence of his parents in Thirty-Third Street , last Friday evening , without his hat , and taking nothing with him but the suit which he was wearing ( dark doeskin pants , and invisible-green coat ) , and has not yet been heard from . It is feared that he has wandered , in some sudden mental derangement , off the wharves . Any information which may lead to his discovery will be gratefully received by the distressed par ents . " No information was ever received until the 1st of April last , when the missing man himself returned to his father 's house , as mysteriously as he went , and was welcomed as one risen from the dead . I am that George Snyder , and propose to give now a brief account of that strange going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the excitement of listening to the narrative of the great events which had taken place in my native land during my absence would allow me , in preparing for publication a history of my observations , made during the six years ' absence ; but of this history I can now give merely an outline . On the night of my departure , November 5 , 1858 , I was sitting in my own room , studying Gauss 's " Theoria Motus " ; and , as was often the case with me , I grew so absorbed in the study as to lose all consciousness of outward things beydnd the limits of the single page before me . I had forgotten the time of night , - nay , I could not have recalled the time of my life , whether I was in college or had graduated , whether I had entered on my profession or was preparing for it . My loss of the sense of space was as absolute as my loss of the sense of time , and I could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , or in my room in Wentworth Hall , or in my office in Jersey City . I only knew that the page , illuminated by a drop gas-light , was before me , and on it the record of that brilliant triumph of the human intellect , the deduction of a planet 's entire orbit from three observations of its position . As I sat thus absorbed , my attention was partially diverted by a slight tapping , as if upon the very table upon which my book was resting . Without raising my eyes from the page , I allowed my thoughts to wander , as I inquired within myself what could have produced the noise . Could it be that I was thus suddenly " developed as a medium , " and that the spirit of some departed friend wished to communicate with me ? I rejected the thought instantly , for I was no believer in modern necromancy . But no sooner had I mentally decided that this was not the true explanation than I began to feel my right hand tremble in an unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pencil which I had been loosely holding . Then suddenly , upon the paper on which I had been occasionally filling out the omitted links in Gauss 's mathematical reasoning , my hand , against my will , legibly scrawled , " G*pernicus , " - upon which a renewed tapping was heard upon the table . I sprang out of my chair , as one startled out of sleep , and looked about the room . My full consciousness of time and place returned , and I saw nothing unusual about my apartment ; there were the books , the chairs , and even the table , standing in motionless silence as usual . I concluded that my late hours and excessive concentration on my studies had made me nervous , or else that I had had a dream . I closed the book and i866. 397 // prepared to go to bed . Like schoolboy whistling to keep his courage up , I began to talk aloud , saying : " I wish Copernicus would really come and carry me off to explore the solar system ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Davis has done . " I tremble even now as I recall the instantaneous effect of those words . While I was still speaking , all earthly things vanished suddenly from my sight . There was no floor beneath me , no ceiling above , no walls around . There was even no earth below me , and no sky above . Look where I would , nothing was visible but my own body . My clothing shone with a pale blue light , by which I could peer into the surrounding darkness to the distance , as I should judge , of about twenty or thirty feet . I was apparently hanging , like a planet , in mid-ether , resting upon nothing . Horrible amazement seized me , as the conviction flashed through me like an electric shock that I must have lost my reason . In a few moments , however , this terror subsided ; I felt certain that my thoughts were rational , and concluded that it was some affection of the optic nerve . But in a very few seconds I discovered by internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irregular , and accelerating motion . Awful hofror again seized me ; I screamed out a despairing cry for help , and fainted . When I recovered from the swoon , I found myself lying on a grassy bank near a sea-shore , with strange trees waving over me . The sun was apparently an hour high . I was dressed as on the preceding evening , without a hat . The air was deliciously mild , the landscape before me lovely and grand . I said to myself : " This is a beautiful dream ; it must be a dream . " But it was too real , and I said , " Can it be that I am asleep ? " I pinched my arms , I went to the sea and dipped my head in the waters , - t was in vain ; I could not awake myself because I was already awake . " No ! " Ireplied , " you are notawake . " Do you not remember that saying of Engel , that when men dream of asking April , whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ? But I said , I will apply two tests of my own which have often , when I was dreaming , convinced me that I was asleep and thus enabled me to awake . I gathered some pebbles and began to count them and lay them in heaps , and count them over again . There were no discrepancies between my counts ; I was awake . Then I took out my pencil and memorandum - book to see whether I could solve an equation . But my hand was instantly seized with trembling , and wrote without my assistance or guidance these words : " I , Copernicus , will comfort your friends . Be calm , be happy , you shall return and reap a peculiar glory . You , first of the inhabitants of Earth , have visited another planet while in the flesh . You are on an island in the tropical regions of Mars . I will take you honte when you desire it , - only not now . " It would be in vain for me to attempt to recall and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message created . I sat down upon the grass , and for a time was incapable of deliberate thought or action . At length I arose and paced up and down the turf , staring around upon the changeless blue of the seaward horizon , the heaving swell of the ocean , the restless surf fretting against the shore , and the motionless hills that rose behind each other inland , and lured the eye to 2 distant group of mountains . The coloring of sea and land was wonderfully fine ; both seemed formed of similar translucent purple ; and despite the excited state of my feelings and the stupendous nature of the words which I had just seen written by my own pencil , I was impressed with a sense of grandeur and of beauty which presently filled me with faith and hope . I assured myself that the spirit to whom permission had been given thus to trafisport me from my home was as kind as he was powerful . He had set me down in a beautiful country , he had promised to return me home when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I concluded that he Were t/*ey Crickets ? // wished me to think calmly over the question before asking to return . And why , I added , should I be in haste ? Copernicus , if it be he , promises to comfort my parents , - the island looks fertile , - if I find no inhabitants , I can be a new Robinson Crusoe , - and when I have explored the island thoroughly , I will ask this spirit to carry me back to New York , where I shall publish my observations , and add a new chapter to our knowledge of the solar system . I walked toward the mountains , among strange shrubs , and under strange trees . Some were in blossom , others laden with fruit , all in luxuriant foliage . As I walked on , the scenery becan*e more and more charming ; but I saw no signs of man , nor even of birds , nor beasts . Beautiful butterflies and other insects were abundant ; in a little stream I saw minnows , and a fish elegantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the brook , occasionally a frog , startled at my approach , leaped from the bank and dived into the water with a familiar cry . I wandered on until I judged it to be nearly noon , and , growing hungry , ventured to taste a fruit which looked more edible than any I had seen . To my delight I found it as delicious as a pawpaw . I dined on them heartily , and , sitting under the shade of the low trees from which I had gathered them , I fell into a reverie which ended in a sound sleep . When I awoke it was night . I walked out of the little grove in which I was sheltered , that I might have a clearer view of the stars . I soon recognized the constellations with which I had been familiar for years , though in somewhat new positions . Conspicuous near the horizon was the " Milk Dipper " of Sagittarius , and I instantly noticed , with a thrill of intense surprise , that the planet Mars was missinb When I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had only a dim remembrance in my mind of having rambled in the fields and fallen asleep on the grass ; but this planet missing in the constellation Sagittarius recalled to me at once my miraculous position on the planet Mars . Here was a confirmation unexpected and irrefragable of the truth of what Copernicus had written by my hand . The excited whirl of thoughts and emotions thus revived banished sleep , and I walked back and forward under the grove , and out on the open turf gazing again and again at the constellation in which , only two days before , I had from the Jersey City ferryboat seen the now missing planet . At length Sagittarius sank behind the mountains , and the Twins arose out of the sea . With new wonder and admiration I beheld in Castor 's knee the steady lustre of a planet which I had not known before , - an overwhelming proof of the reality of my asserted position on the planet Mars . For as this new planet was exactly in the opposite pole of the point whence Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth seen as a planet from that planet which had now become my earth ? You may imagine that this new vision excited me too much to allow sleep to overpower me again until nearly daybreak . When I awoke , the sun was far above the waves . I breakfasted upon my newly tasted fruit , and resumed my journey toward the mountains in the west . An hour 's walk brought me to the spot where I first saw the inhabitants of the island . I shall never forget a single feature of that landscape . The mingled delight at seeing them , and astonishment after iookin* a few moments at them , have photographed the whole scene to its minutest details indelibly upon my memory . I had ascended a little eminence in the principal valley of a brook , ( which I had been folloWing nearly from its outlet , ) when suddenly the mountains , of which I had lost sight for a time , rose up before me in sublime strength , no longer of translucent purple , but revealing , under the direct light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreground , were lofty black cliffs , made darker by being seen lying in their own shadow . On my left , green hills , in varying i866. 399 // forms , stretched almost an interminable distance , varying also in their color and depth of shade . At the foot of the cliffs , in full sight , but too distant to be distinctly heard , the brook leaped along its rocky bed in a successio*i of scrambling cataracts , until it was in a perfect foam with the exertion . I sat upon a stone , gazing upon this valley , calmed , soothed , charmed with its beauty , and was speculating upon the cause of the ruddy purplish hue which I still noticed in the landscape , as I had the day before , when I heard a choir of half a dozen voices , apparently on the nearest cliff ; joining in a Haydn-like hymn of praise . I drew nearer to the spot , and soon satisfied myself that all the sounds proceeded from one man sitting alone on a projecting rock . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he produced such a volume of sounds , and delighted with the beautiful melody and exquisite harmony of his polyphonous song . When he ceased to sing , I stepped out in front of him and hailed him with a hearty " Good morning ! " XV hat was my astonishment to see him instantly unfurl a prodigious pair of wings , and fly off the rock . Hovering over me for a little while , evidently as much astonished at me as I at him , he flew away , and presently returned with a companion . They alighted near me , and began , as I thought , to sing , but in a very fragm entary way . I afterwards found that they were in conversation . I spoke to them , and , concealing my fears , endeavored by various signs to intimate my friendly disposition . They were not very backward in meeting my advances ; and yet I soon discovered that , although they were two to one against me , they were as much alarmed as I ; whereupon I became greatly reassured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild fruits , and they had begun , by dumb show , and beckoning , and the utterance of soothing sounds , to invite me to accompany them . We proceeded slowly , for they could not be satisfied in their examination of me , nor I in my examination of them ; and yet we rather preferred to keep out of each other 's reach . Two points in them chiefly attracted my attention . One was their prodigious wings , which they folded into a very small compass when they walked . The other was their peculiar language , not being any articulate speech , but only the utterance of vowelsounds of musical quality , which seemed to come from several voices at once , and that not from the mouth , but , as I then thought , from all parts of their bodies . At length we reached a charming arbor , into which they conducted me . This arbor was built of some sort of bamboo or cane , woven together into a coarse lattice-work , the roof being made of the same and covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it an arbor , because the latticed sides were covered with flowering vines , of great variety and beauty . Within were bamboo seats and a table , whose material I afterward discovered was the dried leaves of a gigantic flag , flattened and made hard by a peculiar process of drawing them between joints of bamboo , somewhat as cane is pressed between rollers . Upon the table were numerous manuscripts , written , as I afterwards learned , on a paper made of the same flag . These manuscripts were removed , and a repast set on the table by servants , as I then took them to be , who brought it in from an adjoining arbor ; but I found afterwards that they were members of the family , and that the relation of servant and master was not known among the inhabitants of the island . When these new members of the family first came to the arbor in which I and my two captors , as they considered themselves , were sitting , they started back , terrified at my appearance ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter . This further encouraged me in the faith that they were a timid and inoffensive people . Their noonday meal , of which they gave me a part , ( although they did not invite me to come to the table with them , ) gave me still greater assurance , since I found // 1866.1 it composed wholly of fruits and cereals . After their dinner , during which it was evident that they were engaged in a very lively discussion of their visitor or captive , some of the family flew away , and in the course of an hour returned , accompanied by half a dozen others , whom I afterwards found were the most learned naturalists of my captor 's acquaintance. , I was invited by pantomime to walk out into the open air , and of course accepted the invitation . Never was there such a Babel of musical tones as that which assailed my ears while these six learned - ( what shall I call them ? since their own name is not exoressibie by the letters of any alphabet ) - learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild and inoffensive appearance of the people , and the evident kindness mingled with their curiosity , had entirely disarmed my suspicions , and I as gladly showed them what I could do as I vatched to see their habits . The whole afternoon was passed in exhibiting to these strange beinus all of the various gaits and modes of motion and gymnastic exercises which I had ever learned . After supper my captor led me to a separate arbor , and pointed to a bed of soft , white straw , upon which I immediately stretched myself , and he retired . Presently I arose and attempted to go out , but found that he had fastened the door on the outside . It was not pleasant to find myself a prisoner ; but that subject was instantly driven from my mind as I looked out through the lattice and saw Sagittarius , with no signs of the planet Mars . I returned to my straw ; and , after the excitement of the day had subsided , I fell asleep and slept until after sunrise . My captor soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . When I had eaten freely , he allowed me to wanner at will , setting first a boy on top of my arbor , apparently to watch that I did not wander out of sight . I walked about and found that the homestead of my captor consisted of seven arbors in a grove of fruit-trees , with about a dozen acres of corn adjoining . This corn is a perennial , like our grass , and a field once planted yields in good land fifteen or twenty crops with only the labor of gathering . It then becomes exhausted , and the canes are burnt at a particular season , which destroys the roots , and prepares the ground admirably for fruittrees . There were no stables about the place , and there are no horses nor cows on the island , - indeed , frogs and toads are the highest vertebrates known there . About the middle of the forenoon , my host , or captor , came , guided by his boy , who , flying from arbor to arbor and from tree to tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought with him seven others , bearing a hammock through the air , four flying on either side , and lowered it near me in the field . He then made signs to me to lie in the hammock . It was with some difficulty that I persuaded myself to risk it ; but I thought at last that , after coming safely from the Earth to Mars , I would not shrink from a little excursion in the atmosphere of that planet . I laid myself in the hammock , and soon saw that the seven friends of my host were as much afraid of taking it up as I had been of getting in it . However , they mustered courage , and , spreading their wings , raised me up in the air . I was , I suppose , a deal heavier than they expected ; for they set me down upon the top of the first knoll in their path , and set me down so suddenly that I was aware of their intention only by being dashed against the ground . I sprang up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winged bearers folded their wings , and lay panting on the turf . They had not taken me a halt-mile . When they were rested , my host motioned to me to resume my place ; and the eight again bore me , with more deliberate stroke , a full mile before dropping me again . But they were so much exhausted , and took so long to rest , that I suggested , by signs and motions , that I should rather walk ; and so for the next mile they carried the empty hammock , flying very slowly , while I walked rapidly , or ran , after them . When , in my turn , I became exhausted , // they motioned me into the hammock again . In this way , partly by being carried and partly on my own feet , I at length reached an immense arbor , in which several hundred of these creatures were assembled . It was the regular day of meeting for their Society of Natural History . One of our part ) ' first went in , and , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to my captor , who beckoned me to follow , and led me in . I was placed on a platform , and he then made a polyphonous speech , without a consonant sound in it ; describing , as I afterwards learned , the history of my discovery and capture , and going into some speculations on my nature . Then the principal men crowded about me and felt me , and led me about the hall , until , what with the landings of the hammock and the handling of these sons of Mars , I was sore and wearied beyond expression . At length I was taken to a small arbor , where I was allowed to rest and to take food . The Society then , as I have since been told , held a long discussion , and finally appointed a committee to examine me , observe my habits , and report at the next regular meeting . There is no moon at Mars ; but the regular meeting was on the twenty-eighth day following ,  --  the seven notes of music having given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hammock , ( which was built for the use of the infirm and aged , but the weight of these creatures is scarce half that of men , ) and sixteen of them carried me back to my captor 's homestead . That night I fell asleep before it was dark enough to see the stars , and assure myself , by a glance at the Milk Dipper , that it was not all a dream ; but I awoke before daylight , and gazed through the l.kttice at the Twins , and at the Earth , shining with steady lustre upon Castor 's knee . I will not weary the reader with details from my journal of each succeeding day . The committee came day after day and studied me . They induced me to lay aside part of my clothing that they might examine me more minutely , especially about the joints of the ankle , the knee , shoulder , and elbow ; and were never weary of examining my neck and spinal column . I could not talk to them , and they had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toads ; wherefore , at the end of four weeks , they reported " that I was a new and wonderful gigantic Batrachian " ; that " they recommended the Society to purchase me , and , after studying my habits thoroughly , dissect me , and mount my skeleton . " Of which report I was , of course , in blessed ignorance for a long , long while . So my captor and his friends took the kindest care of me , and endeavored to amuse and instruct me , and also to find out what I would do if left to myself , - taking notes assiduously for the memoirs of their Society . I can assure the reader that I , on my part , was not idle , but took notes of them with equal diligence , at which imitation of their actions they were greatly amused . But I flatter myself that , when my notes , now in the hands of the Smithsonian Institution , are published , with the comments of the learned naturalists to whom the Institution has referred them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . My own view of the inhabitants of Mars is that they are Rational Articulates . Rational they certainly are , and , although I am no naturalist , I venture to pronounce them Articulates . I do not mean anything disrespectful to these learned inhabitants of Mars in saying that their figure and movements reminded me of crickets : for I never have watched the black field-crickets in New England , standing on tiptoe to reach a blade of grass , without a feeling of admiration at their gentlemanly figure and the gracefulness of their air . But what is more important , I am told that Articulates breathe through spirades in the sides of their bodies ; and I know that these planetary men breathe through six mouths , three on either side of the body , entirely different in appearance and character from the // seventh mouth in their face , through which they eat . In the volumes of notes which will be published by the Smithsonian Institution as soon as the necessary engravings can be finished , will also appear all that I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the strict limitation , to which I was subjected , of bringing to Earth nothing but what I could carry about my own person. * I was , myseli* particularly interested in investigating ' * the Martial language , which differs entirely from our terrestrial tongues in not being articulate . Each of the six lateral mouths of these curious men is capable of sounding only one vowel , and of varying its musical pitch about five or six semitones . Thus , their six mouths give them a range of two and a half or three octaves . The right - hand lowest mouth is lowest in pitch , and gives a sound resembling the double o in moon ; the next lowest in pitch is the lowest lefthand mouth , and its vowel is more like o in note . Thus they alternate , the highest left-hand mouth being highest in pitch , and uttering a sound resembling a long ec . The sound of each of the six is so individual , that , before I had been there six months , I could recognize , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six mouths . But they seldom use one mouth at a time . Their simplest ideas , such as the names of the most familiar objects , are expressed * The strangeness of my adventures will be so apt to breed incredulity among those unacquainted with my character , that I add some certificates from the highest names known to science .

Closely allied ideas are expressed by the same phrase uttered a different mouth , and so with a different vowel - sound . But most ideas are complex ; and these are expressed in the Mavortian speech by chords , or discords , produced by using two or more mouths at once . A few music types will illustrate this , by examples , better than any verbal description can do . * *- *- -* * -. i*iz A tree . Fruit . A fruit- A fruit- Do . in Do . in A dead tree . tree in leaf leaf fruitleaf. and and tree . blossom , fruit . The signification of these chords is by no means arbitrary ; but , on the contrary , their application is according to fixed rules and according to resthetic principles ; so that the highest poetry of these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest music ; while the utterance of base sentiments , or of fustian , becomes ; by the very nature of the language , discordant , or at best vapid and unmelodious . It will readily be imagined that I was a very long while in learning to understand a speech so entirely different in all its principles from our earthly tongues . And when I began to comprehend it , as spoken by my new friends , I was unable , having but one mouth , to express anything but the simplest ideas . However , I had Yankee ingenuity enough to supply in some measure my want of lateral mouths . My captor daily allowed me more and more freedom , and at length permitted me to wander freely over the whole island , simply taking the precaution to send a b@y with me as a companion and guide , in case I should lose my way . In one of these rambles I discovered a swamp of bamboos , and by . the aid of my pocket-knife cut down several and carried them home . Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a sort of small organ , a very rude affair , with , Were i/icy Crickets ? // 404 six kinds of pipes , six of each kind . A bamboo pipe , with a reed tongue of the same material , or even one with a flute action , was not so sw*t in tone as the voice of my friends ; but they saw what I was trying to do , and could , after growing familiar with the sound of my pipes , decipher my meaning . The astonishment ' of my captor and his family at finding that their monster Batrachian could not only express simple ideas with his one mouth , but all the most complex notions by pieces of bamboo fastened together and held on his knees before him , was beyond measure . From this time my progress in learning their speech was very rapid ; and within a year from the completion of my organ I could converse fluently ' with them . Of course , I had not mastered all the l*tricacies of their tongue , and even up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere learner ; nevertheless , I could understand the main drift of all that they said ; and what was equally gratifying to me , I could express to them almost anything expressible in English , and they understood me . My life now became a very happy one ; I became sincerely attached to my captor and to his family , and was charmed with their good sense and their kind feeling . I flatter myself also that they , in their turn , were not only proud of their Batrachian , but grew fond of him . They showed me more and more attention , gave me a : *seat at their table , and furnished me *With clothes of their own fashion . I *mw*t confess , however , that the openings on the sides for their mouths , and on the back for their wings , were rather trooblesome to me , and occasioned me sevetal severe colds , until I taught them to *rnake my vesture close about my chest . *Ahen visitors came to their house I was*always invited to bring out my orga*n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding me ; but with the family I conversed With perfect ease , and they iatei*preted Lor me . I found that the April , universal theory concerning me was , that I came from beyond a range of mountains on the nearest continent , beyond which no explorations had ever been made . Concerning my mode of crossing the steep and lofty barrier on the continent , and the deep , wide strait which separated the island from the mainland , they speculated in vain . I humored this theory at first , as far as I could without positive statements of falsehood , for I knew that , if I told the truth , it would be abs*lutely incredible to them ; and I did not reveal to my Martial friends my own terrestrial , to them celestial character , until just before my departure . But my psychical character perplexed them much more than my Loological . It seems that these islanders had been accustomed to call themselves , in their own tongue , " rational animals with sentiments of justice and piety , " - all which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a simple harmonic progression of four full chords. * But here was a Batrachian , - one of the lower orders of creation , in their view ,  - -  from whom the Almighty had withheld the gift of a rational soul , who nevertheless appeared to reason as soundly as they , - to understand all their ideas ,  - -  not only repeating their sentences on his bamboo pipes , but commenting intelligently on them ; and who not only gave these proofs of an understanding mind , but of a heart and soul , manifesting almost Mavortian affection for his captor 's family , and occasionally betraying even the existence of some religious sentiments . Was all this delusive ? Did this Batrachian really possess a rational soul , with sentiments of piety and justice , or only a wonderfully constructive faculty of imitation ? Reader , in your pride of Caucasian blood , you may think it incredible that such doubts should haVe been entertained concerning a man whose father is from one of the best families in Holland , whose mother is descended from good English stock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , B , E , whence the creatures might be called Eades. // exhibits sufficient intelligence to write this narrative ; but nevertheless such doubts were actually entertained by a large proportion of the inhabitants of the island . Not only did the members of their Society of Natural History become warmly interested in the discussion , but finally the whole population of the island took sides on the question , and debated it with great warmth . The area of their country is about the same as that of Great Britain ; but as they have no law of primogeniture , nor entailment of estates , nor hereditary rank , they have no poverty and no over-population ; all of the inhabitants were happy and well-educated , all had abundant leisure , and all were ready to examine the evidence concerning the wonderful Batrachian that was said to have come ashore on the eastern side of their island . But alas ! even in this well-governed and happy community , not every man 's opinion was free from " error , nor every man 's temper free from prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a parrot-like imitation of their speech accused those who held that I was really rational of the crime of exalting a Batrachian into equality with " rational animals with sentiments of justice and piety " ; and the accused party , after a little natural shrinking from so bold a position , finally confessed the crime , by acknowledging that they thought that I was at least entitled to all the rights of their race . Here was the beginning of a feud which presently waxed as hot as that between the Big-Endians and the Little-Endians of Liliput . I have no doubt in my own mind that the temper displayed in this controversy sprang partly from causes which had been in operation for many years before my visit . Somewhere about the middle of the last century , ( I am speaking now of terrestrial dates , translating their long years and odd numeral scale into ours , ) a colony from the mainland had settled at one end of their island , and were still living am9ng them . These continental men differed somewhat in figure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusky hue , while the islanders ' wings were distinctly purple in their tone . These colonists were looked upon by most of the islanders as an inferior race , and there had been very few cases of intermarriage between them . These few cases had , however , led to some earnest discussions . Some maintained that it was only a want of good taste in a Purplewing to be willing to marry a Duskywing , but that it was not a thing forbidden by morality or to be forbidden by law . Others maintained that such intermarriage was against nature , against public order and morality , and should be prohibited . Nay , some went so far as to say that these Dusky-wings Were intruders , who ought to be sent back to their native continent ; that the island was the Purple-wings ' country , and that the Purple-wings should have absolute control over it , and ought not to suffer any other race to participate in its advantages . This division of opinion and feeling concerning the Dusky-wings , although deep and earnest , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island were very* hospitable and polite , and they refrained to a great extent from showing their prejudices against the colonists . But my arrival gave them an opportunity of saying with open frankness many things which , although said concerning me , were meant and understood as referting to the immigrants from the continent . The Duskywings themselves said but little ; they were quiet , inoffensive , affectionate people , who were somewhat wounded occasionally by the scorn of a Purplewing , but simply went on minding their own business , and showing kindness to all persons alike . The aborigines of the island , outnumbering the others by twenty to one , discussed me and my position with eager warmth . On the one hand , it was argued that I was a Batrachian , - of a high . species , it was granted , but still only an animal ; that , if I really had reason and sentiments , they must be of a low order ; . // that certainly I had no social nor legal rights which their race were bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by right of discoYery , and he had absolute rights over me as a chattel ; that he might sell me or use me as lawfully as he could sell or use clothing , food , or books ; that he might compel me to work for him ; and that he even had a right to poison me ( as they poisoned troublesome insects ) whenever he was tired of the burden of my support , or wished to study my anatomy . On the other hand , it was maintained that the fact of my being a Batrachian had no bearing on my moral rights , and ought not to have upon my social and legal rights . The capacity which I had for understanding the moral law and for feeling injustice gave me a claim to j , ustice . Whoever has the moral sense to claim rights is by that very endowment vested with rights . " The true brotherhood between us rational animals , " said this party , " is founded in our rationality and in our sentiments of justice and piety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although belonging to the lower orders of animal nature , partakes with us of reason and of the sentiments of justice and piety . He is therefore our brother , and his rights are as sacred as our own . He is the guest , and not the chattel , of the family who discovered him . To sell him or to buy him , to force him to labor against his will , to hold his life less sacred than our own , would be criminal . " Of course I knew nothing of all this until I had been there for several years , and acquired a tolerable familiarity with their speech . Indeed , it required a considerable time for the feud to arrive at its highest . But at length party strife concerning me and concerning the relative superiority of the two races rose to such a pitch , that I seriously feared lest I should be the innocent ause of a civil war in this once happy island . Moreover , I saw that my presence was becoming a source of serious inconvenience to my host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I could not doubt ; but neither could I doubt that it was unpleasant to them to have old acquaintances decline any further intercourse with them because they had allowed a Batrachian to sit at table with them . Very reluctantly I decided that I would ask Copernicus to restore me to my own family on Earth . First I broke the matter cautiously to my host , and explained to him confidentially my real origin and my intended return . He was astonished beyond measure at my revelation , and I could with difficulty persuade him that I was not of celestial nature . We . talked it over daily for several weeks , and then explained it to the family , and afterwards to a select circle of friends , who were to publish it after my departure , and give to the whole island their first notions of terrestrial geography and history . Finally , I decided upon a night in which I would depart , and at b*l-time bade the family good by . At midnight I filled my pockets and sundry satchels with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minerals , etc. , and , han , ,  - -  ing these satchels on my arms , called on Copernicus to fulfil his promise . Instantly all things disappeared again from my view ; I was floating with my satchels in mid-ether , and fell into a trance . When I awaked , I was in my father 's house in New York . How long the passage required , I have no means of determining . The present brief sketch of my life upon the planet Mars is designed partly to call attention to the volumes which I am preparing , in conjunction with more learned and more scientific cottaborateurs , for immediate publication by the Smithsonian Institution , and partly for the gratification of readers who may never see those ponderous quartos . I will only add , that , since my return to Earth , I have never been able to obtain any information either from Copernicus or from any other of the illustrious dead , except through the pages of their printed works .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
