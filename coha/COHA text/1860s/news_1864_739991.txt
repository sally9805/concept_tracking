txt The battle of Friday last was a much more serious affair , both in its original conception , its actual character , and its final consequences , than we had been led to believe from the brief dispatches heretofore given to the public . The intention really was that it should be the decisive battle of the campaign . The movements of the preceding days , cul. minating in the possession of Cold Han bor ? an important strategic point  --  had drawn our lines close in front of the Chickahominy , and reduced the military problem to the forcing of the passage of that river  --  a problem which , if solved in our favor , would decide whether Richmond could be carried by a coup de main , if a decisive victory should attend our or , whether operations would settle down to a siege in form . The great struggle did not result in a success ; and though the enemy 's lines were carried and temporarily held at two important points , oul assaulting columns were finally compelled to abandon them . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into so brief a space of time  --  ten terrible minutes in the early dawn developed on the part of the enemy such strength both of position and force as to carry conviction that any victory that could here be achieved would be purchased at too great a cost . All that matchless valor directed by consummate skill could do , was done ; but it was in vain . In falling back , however , the army was far from abandoning all the ground it had gained . It held and stills holds tho enemy with unrelaxing clutch . Even ROW , our lines are in many places within fifty yards of the enemy 's works on the Chickahominy , and while it is not clear how Gen. GRANT can again make an advance on his immediate front , it will be equally difficult for LEE to make his escape . The situation is such that there will necessarily now be very important movements on the part of our army . We present to the country this morning a very full view , military as well as popular , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentleman who has photographed in this journal so many of the great operations of the war . It is of the deepest interest to the army and the general public .
