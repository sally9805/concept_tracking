PREFACE . From his astonishing intellectual and practical capacity , the rapidness of his rise , the grandeur of the historic position he seized , the career of Napoleon offers a high theme for poetic presentation . But the great events whereof he was the originator and the pivot are too near to us to be imaginatively detached from the prosaic realism of history . This detachment is necessary for poetic idealization . Genuine poetic idealization is but a finer setting forth of fact , a more luminous presentment of truth . For tragedy an historic foundation is the best . As the poet can not invent history ( his counterfeit of it would be soulless and unsubstantial ) , he must handle reality with poetic imaginativeness , and thus beautify history while interpreting it . Further , to obtain free poetic play history requires to be compressed , fore-shortened , exhibited , as it were , in a panorama of peaks , its spirit reproduced through its supreme moments . A period must be distilled and then rembodied in the personages who created it . The flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personages with whom , from nearness of time , we are so familiar as we are with Talleyrand and Murat and Joseph Bonaparte and Metternich and Castlereagh and their compeers . Even the colossal Napoleon is somewhat belittled by our closeness to him . Familiarity , in such cases , breeds poetic contempt . Poetry refuses to deal directly with these prosaic palpabilities . She can not transfigure them through her golden veil . And yet , the men and the epoch are so full of life and significance , that with lively signals they beckon to the poetic dramatist . In the following pages an attempt is made to reproduce dramatically Napoleon and his crowded vivid career , to give the essence of a momentous epoch , under a thin disguise to portray the features of the period and the character of its gigantic protagonist . 1868 .

BORINI . BORINI . Zorasi ! ' T is yourself ! Three years fly fast . ZORASI . ZORASI . You never counted days in banishment , Or you would know , Borini , how time creeps When soul and body dwell on opposite shores . BORINI . BORINI . With you they ' ve met again , happier herein Than many of your friends , for whom the breach Will last till doomsday . ZORASI . ZORASI . That dread term is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst Was quenched in daily blood , while good men crouched , And in Heaven 's face the bad shook their red fists . Our country smiles once more . BORINI . BORINI . There is some change . ZORASI . ZORASI . Some ! why , when last I saw her , pale she was From self-consumption , hacked with foreign steel , And her whole function threatened with arrest . Now , ruddily life laugheth in her veins , And flames her eye toward worsted adversaries . BORINI . BORINI . Aye , Death has moved his court , and now his craft Plies through the cannoneer ' stead of the headsman . ZORASI . ZORASI . You speak as though of man 's prosperity The sharpest foe were death , and foremost actor On the world 's stage , playing the tyrant 's part . Not with rude willful terrors armed is Death : No tyrant he , but gentle servitor To Nature , when forth from his viewless couch She summons him to crop her pendent harvest . But when confusion mocks the forms of order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to impel his ravenous shafts , And man , grasping God 's awful attribute ,  --  A token this of his enfranchisements ,  --  From Justice ' seat rains death ; then general dread O'ercomes the world , and hearts of iron quail , Trembling to feel heaven closed above their heads , And earth given o'er to godless solitude ; For even then ' t is not to die men fear , But ' t is to hold their life on mortal sufferance . Ordnance shot off at a distance . What may this be ? BORINI . BORINI . The voice of Brangonar , Who almost weekly to the capital Sends greeting thus . ZORASI . ZORASI . Another victory ? BORINI . BORINI . Another and another . ' T is a sound So common grown , men 's ears have ceased to gape . ZORASI . ZORASI . Th ' astounded world talks but of Brangonar . Even in that wild corner of the globe Where I have sighed , men spell his name with wonder . Fame is his captive , and , proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By repetition of his cannon 's roar . BORINI . BORINI . Here comes her loudest trumpeter : you 'll hear How he will blow this news into our ears . ZORASI . ZORASI . Is ' t not Alardo ? BORINI . BORINI . Aye , that is his name . The man ,  --  such as he was ,  --  hath ceased to be . What ' s called Alardo , is of Brangonar The leg or tongue , or any other part Whereof great Brangonar may need the service . He has it here of proper nimbleness , Dissevered from himself , and thus can send A kick or kiss by post where'er he list . ZORASI . ZORASI . How men do change ! I recollect Alardo : He seemed a man of honorable motions . BORINI . BORINI . Men never change : they merely grow . Enter Alardo . ALARDO . ALARDO . Zorasi Welcome  --  a hearty welcome . ZORASI . ZORASI . Thanks , Alardo . ALARDO . ALARDO . Fortune would make amends , choosing to-day To reinstall you in your forfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BORINI . BORINI . Not yet . What prisoners ? How many thousands slain ? ALARDO . ALARDO . Men have no breath to-day to count the means , The end so busies them with wonderment . A total rout , millions of tribute , peace , Three provinces new-gathered in our bounds , And the first fruit and instant benefaction Of these our latest , loftiest achievements , Is the return unto his Capital Of the achiever and high benefactor , Renownd Brangonar . He comes to-night . My greetings to you both . Pardon my haste , I must go share and feed the general joy . You ' re young , Zorasi , and the times are bounteous : Farewell . Exit Alardo . BORINI . BORINI . You look amazed : you are yet green . You must learn faster , if you ' d overtake The brazen meaning of the headlong time . Know where you are , and waste no thought in wonder . This metal-tongued Alardo has the tune : Set you your will to his loud pitch , and thrive . For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go and read the faces of the crowd . Exit . ZORASI , ZORASI , alone . Is this my greeting to my long-lost home ? Doubts flood upon my heart and drown its joy . Is Brangonar a fear-fraught conqueror ? Oh , woe ! when dread is leashed to triumph 's car . Is this he whom I ' ve wrestled with at school ? Whom I ' ve seen glow at talk of liberty ? Borini is a satirist : belike . He sees askant . But this glib-tongued Alardo ; His speech is ominous .  --  Dearest Evoya , My happy thoughts had blazoned thee in smiles For this day 's meeting . Now my heart is sad To think of fears that visit thine . But thou Being troubled , the more timely is my coming . Exit . Scene II . A Room in the House of Riordo . Riordo , Carlan , Tesafo , Catalba . RIORDO . RIORDO . Strike we not now , and he ' s beyond our reach . Already is the future darkened by his bulk , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let we the hour go by , And our hereafter is a hopeless void , And we , or slavish instruments or naught ; For , stride he one step higher , and he stands So close begirt he 'll baffle all assailment . And then , farewell to manhood 's privilege , Th ' inspiring joys of liberty farewell : Farewell to generous hope that lavishes Honors and might to who will boldly mount : Farewell the shaping thoughts that make the bliss Of busy man who builds his morrows freely ; For despots snatch each morrow from the heart , Sternly predestining the daily life , That men cease bounding towards the coming day , But draggle in their pre-doomed nothingness . TESAFO . TESAFO . Were it but sure , that having overleapt His prostrate corpse , we could then repossess Our lost dominion , ' t were not much , to brave Th ' immediate danger of the enterprise . RIORDO . RIORDO . Who can be certain even of a day ? Could foresight pierce so keenly into time , No land would gasp beneath tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To grossness ne'er could swell ; and such as we , Who now deliberate the dangerous means To do our country service , would not need In her behalf to pawn our heads , but spend Contented lives , through wisdom 's vigilance . We ' re born to dangers and uncertainties , Which only resolution can disarm . Courage plucks from the future its worst fears , And turns hard doubts to ductile certainties . TESAFO . TESAFO . He being cut off , in these hot times ensues Fiery contention for th ' inheritance , Wherein courage , that is not backed by strength , Were a rash friend more perilous than gainful , Thrusting us on a stormful ocean , where , Being ballast-light , we should make helpless wreck . What are the means to breast the foaming surge The bloody fall of Brangonar will lift ? RIORDO . RIORDO . We strike at usurpation , which being down , Each shall be free to repossess his own . If still each man must quarrel for his right , Would you not rather so , than have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d rather spend My life in fighting for my rights than live Berobbed of them a month . We ' re near that now . The wills of many are absorbed in one : Men are again fast learning how to kneel : The free in thought are pressed for room to act : A soldier 's sword glitters above our heads . And we who ' ve given our treasure and our blood To have no King , are threatened with a tyrant . TESAFO . TESAFO . An enterprise so big with consequence Would be well pondered . We partake your fears , And will anon confer with you again . Exeunt Tesafo and Catalba . RIORDO . RIORDO . Impertinent nobility ! How well Its shallow thoughts befit its foolish hopes . I 'm almost sorry that I broke to him The hardy project . With what fluency ,  --  As though the current of his mind upbore them ,  --  The words , dominion and inheritance , Rolled from his tongue . These empty people live On dreams begotten by an ancient surfeit . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think they were its blaze . For though , so soon as power herself had cleansed , Drenching with blood , the plague-spots of corruption , She cast th ' incestuous weaklings from her bed , Yet can they not believe themselves divorced , But walk as brim with scorn ,  --  such force hath custom Upon the imaginations of the weak ,  --  As though they still paced o'er the breasts of men . CARLAN . CARLAN . And yet , they 'll stoop so low , the despot 's foot Besmears their curvd backs to reach the throne . They 'll serve a master to be lords themselves , And sell their freedom to enjoy dominion ; Bearing the yoke , so they may smack the whip . Mark how these two will soon be noted slaves , High prominent in Brangonar 's new gang . Out of our fears they fashion hopes . RIORDO . RIORDO . Well , let them : More sudden than their rise shall be their fall . Exeunt . Scene III . A Room in the House of Brangonar . Evoya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current fears . EVOYA . EVOYA . I try to think them false , and to persuade me They are but shadows which the backward time , So black to all , casts on a woman 's heart . ' T is vain : the thoughts I send in quest of hope Never return , and thus ,  --  like a sieg 'd town Whose desperate foragers are always ta'en ,  --  Each effort for relief but leaves me weaker . I will be strong to-day , if not in hope , At least in joy ; and should be strong in hope , For thou art here , with whom I ' ve scarcely dared To trust a thought that peered into the future . Methinks I was not wont to be despondent , And thou being come I will be so no more . ZORASI . ZORASI . When I am near to thee I have two strengths . To-day I feel as I could dare the worst , And outface danger in his hottest rage . And thou , I ' ve seen thee brave thy brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hushing the billows of his willful wrath . EVOYA . EVOYA . The wrath I would again as freely front . What drew those billows from their haughty height Was the strong charm of love . That spell is broken : Poor Brangonar now loves naught but himself . That ' t is that daunts and makes me dread the worst . We have had scenes : this unto you alone . The gentle Jesola , his wife , hath wept . ZORASI . ZORASI . Her brother , loved Lovro , how doth he ? EVOYA . EVOYA . Lovro hopes too much : his nobleness Would throw its sunshine in the darkest breast . But here he is . Enter Lovro . LOVRO . LOVRO . Zorasi ! ( embraces him ) welcome home ! Most welcome . Much we need our better men , To seize , among the possibilities That press them on th ' impassioned reeking day , Those most enheartened with humanity . Time hath been long in travail with a brood Of men so fiery new , they make events Of such far drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress her laggard self In prodigies . EVOYA . EVOYA . A spawn of tainted Time Are they who late have ruled , or rather , wrecked us . They undid but to be themselves undone . LOVRO . LOVRO . They did far more than they undid ; and when They were themselves undone , this was the work Of what had first by them been done . They taught ,  --  And ' t was a manful lesson ,  --  how to cut The rot away that had for centuries Gnawed at a sorrowing Nation 's core . Themselves Grew quickly foul ; and then they fell as swift As they had struck . But first they did a work That can not be undone , a mighty work . Their death gave life . Their death was forwardness , It was not retrogression . EVOYA . EVOYA . Would it had been ! LOVRO . LOVRO . The past comes never back . Can you refold The apple in its blossom ? or unbuild The majesty of manhood 's puissant frame , And shrink it to an infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As make your food of mouldiness . ZORASI . ZORASI . But still , Events and men repeat themselves at times . LOVRO . LOVRO . To those who only read their surfaces They seem to do so . History ,  --  to Peoples Within whose blood ripens the finer juice Whence are distilled life 's higher essences ,  --  Is an unfolding  --  Enter abruptly Brangonar . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Max is come , Lovro . I ' ve bid him speak with you . Let this affair Be closed . We will not have these petty strokes Thrust from the bygone to deflect our gait . The past be done with : ' t is not in our reach : ' T is dead . We live , and ' bout us howleth life . ' T is much that by the present we are stayed , We whose far swoop at the great future strikes , The burnished , fair , the undistaind future .  --  Let this be done at once : he waits to see you . Exit Lovro . ZORASI . ZORASI . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not ? EVOYA . EVOYA . Brother , this is Zorasi . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Ha ! I remember  --  yes  --  Captain Zorasi ? You were deported for the affair of Sarnec . It might have been much worse : you had strong friends . The Colonel of your regiment  --  a brave And loyal soldier  --  died but yesterday . Take you his post , and be as true as he . I know your courage and your skill .  --  No thanks : Thanks should be kept for things unmerited . Evoya , I would have some speech with you . Exit Zorasi . I do not have , Evoya , from my kin That kindly aidance which should grace the ascent They all are mounting on my single leap . Greatness and power and the reluctant gaze Of th ' envious world , that veils its stealthy sight At the first swing of genius ' flashing sceptre ,  --  All this is close to their upstretching grasp . ' T is little that I ask . Concert I ask With my prophetic plans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep rifted road I swiftly build with th ' engines of my invention . Something to me they may be : I to them Am all . I lift them to the stately heights Of circumstance , whence they , enfreed , shall wonder At the lean belt where they now grope unknown . My dreams are worth more than their noon-day senses . To you , my chosen sister , I impart Some of my soaring mind . You can conceive What they can not . Help them to see the greatness That hovers near them . Happy words from you Will be a light to them .  --  No answer now . To-morrow I will speak with you again . Kisses her forehead . Exit Evoya . I must have tools . Most men are dull or false ; And if you win one competent to seize A nimble onward thought , and drive it home Through shattering act straight to a sure success , This ableness undoes his agency : He plies to make of you a tool for him . Of my own blood there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much will ; This not enough ; another is not swift ; One is too scrupulous ; too venal one . The women all by love are ruled . Evoya Is most like me ; but she hath women 's whims . Her brain is not yet dry of girlish fumes , Vapors , with the dear self sweet-scented soft , That in dim incense steep th ' unchastened eye . So long hath boiled within her swollen veins This passion for Zorasi , ' t is herself : Her blood is all of his one color dyed . Capable he is , and brave , and resolute ; But troublesome with supersubtleties , And poor . E'en could I break this foolish bond , ' T were certain loss of her . That were a loss I ill can bear ; for she will serve me if ,  --  And ' t is a burly if ,  --  if I serve her . I 'd serve them all , would they but help me serve them . If they could bask , but for an hour , with me In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the big-eyed brood that quickens there They would not know , they could not even see . Daily I hug them closer to my soul ,  --  Which feeds them and by them in turn is fed ,  --  These secret nurselings in my breeding brain , Vast progeny of thought , to which my will Must be the midwife , startling this old world With a new history . Enter in haste a courier , booted and spurred . Ha ! Sesto ! what news ? SESTO SESTO ( handing a despatch ) Rulesti has retreated . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . In good order ? SESTO . SESTO . Unbroken order , without loss . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . ' T is well . I looked for this . Sesto , go take your rest . I 'll talk with you anon . Exit Sesto . This is the bane Of power : its instruments have not its soul . Retreated ! An advance and victory Lay couched within the circuits of the ground For one who had the vision to espy them . He asks more cohorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Alardo . How now ? Is the pear ripe ? ALARDO . ALARDO . And ready to be pluckt . The Council Six Are met for business , and will swift resolve Your deposition . This from Tesafo I ' ve learnt , who , with his friend Catalba , will Absent him from the meeting . Can you count Upon Lovro ? BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . As on you . ALARDO . ALARDO . I doubt him . It matters not : he is alone . The rest , Riordo , Carlan , and Trifone , are Compact against you , and in special pay They hold two legions sure . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Whose chiefs are mine . The Council , then , of Six is shrunk to three . Of this triumvirate Riordo rash Would be the Csar . I could let them rise , Then bring them down .

This is the question we to-day must solve . CARLAN . CARLAN . To-day , this very hour ; for Brangonar , Strong in the sinews of ambitious will , And daily stronger in the selfish love Of a triumphant soldiery , hath now His hand upon the hilt , with faithless sword To carve a despot 's brutal diadem . TRIFONE . TRIFONE . Our function 's fullness he hath disallowed , Hath played the chief where he was subaltern , Levied wide contributions , ' gainst the law , Spurned our decrees , and from their clean intent Our orders wrenched with contumacious will , Sole wielding proud the dues of sovereignty . RIORDO . RIORDO . Wherefor with dangerous disobedience ' bane  --  Defiant of the State 's authority  --  He stands attainted . Thence , I move he be To-day deposed .

Let us be one with him , Not dare him with abrupt hostility . His is a rightful power , as well as ours . United we might hold the world in awe , For its great betterment . CARLAN . CARLAN . My voice , like yours , Riordo , is for instant deposition . TRIFONE . TRIFONE . And mine . Enter Brangonar . RIORDO RIORDO ( confronting him ) . How come you here ? You are deposed . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . You are deposed . RIORDO . RIORDO . What ho ! Without there ! Guards ! Enter three or four soldiers . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Arrest these three , and let them be safe guarded . LOVRO . LOVRO . Soldiers , hold off ! BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Who dares withstand my act ? LOVRO . LOVRO . Justice and the dread majesty of law . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrest you , saving one ,  --  yourself . Unsay that heinous word : ' t is not yet act . If you descend , you fall to rise no more . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Soldiers , do you your duty . Take them hence . Exeunt the soldiers with the three . Lovro gazes after them a moment , then walks to the Council-table and seats himself . BRANGONAR BRANGONAR ( approaching him ) . Lovro  --  Know you what you do , Lovro ? LOVRO . LOVRO . Know you what you have done ? You do not know : Men see not wrong for inward turbidness . Were every act to th ' actor luminous With its whole nature , he would feel its being So in the core of his , that false and bad Would hideously themselves demonstrate bare , And the quick soul , with its then insight sure , Would shun corruptive contacts , as the hand Its waste from fire , the blood decease from frost . You know not what you ' ve done ; for if you did , Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read its lengthening scroll , ghastly with blood , Ghastlier with every freedom 's quivering death , With most unholy hopes all apoplexed , The vision would the temporal senses blast , Swiftly dismember your incorporate being , The soul escaping to securer home , To leave its clay here cold upon the ground . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . These bubbles of the brain , these emptinesses , Are transient toys , and have no driving pith . Blow them if ' t be your humor ; but alone . You will not help me : hinder me you shall not . LOVRO . LOVRO . Can emptiness be emptier than this , Rising . For you to deem that me you can command ? How much you lack for the sublimest part ! How much for the full making of a man ! None other can command my speech , my act . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR . Beware , beware , Lovro , how you thwart me . LOVRO . LOVRO . Go you the way you ' ve chosen : I go mine . Exit . BRANGONAR . BRANGONAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men visionary range so high , the thoughts They chase mount so to vague imaginations , They can not stoop to give their words effect In action . Action needs directness clear , Marriage ' twixt thought and clean accomplishment . When thought has not the body for fulfillment , Or doing lags behind its partner 's spring , Best purposes grow lame and impotent . Lovro ever chases fleeing hopes . He thinks men better than they e'er will be . In times like these such men are dangerous ; For passions heated must be bound in moulds , And not have room to spread and flame at large ; For so , their untamed fiery virtue shoots To conflagration , that consumes itself , And choicest building stuff to ashes turns .

Ha ! to the stricken foe That sound is not more fearful than to me . EVOYA . EVOYA . To-day it heralds peace . Shall we not hope That home will now be nearer to his heart ? JESOLA . JESOLA . For him there is no peace . For me no more Can there be peace on earth . To me he ' s lost . As he ascends he seems further from me .

Brother , is it not hard that I to-day , Alone of all this festive capital , Must feel dejected ? CHILD . CHILD . I do wish papa Would stay away  --  he makes mamma so weep . LOVRO . LOVRO . Dear sister , thine is a sore discipline : A woman 's dearest , deepest part  --  to be A blessing to her husband  --  is denied thee ; For Brangonar hath not the love to know What daily heaven on earth may be for man In the calm home where waits for him a wife . But thou , dear Jesola , hast still a heaven In that mild breast where nestles warm thy child . I sometimes almost think unhappiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little selves too much our goal , Thus tying us to ever-shortening tethers .

Great schemes I have , Schemes whose accomplishment will maze the world , Uplift myself , my country and my friends To heights undreamed of by the common thought .

Your tongue is beyond salve : it needs the knife . Exeunt all but Curio . Men be of three classes . First , those that are whole fools ; and these make up nine tenths of the world . Second , those that are half fools , like myself ; and we make the other tenth . The third class be they that are neither whole fools nor half fools , but are downright wise . They that were here be of the first class : they know not how to speak , nor how to hold their tongues . O ! what a pity that men are not witty , Sings .

Hunger eats into a man 's brains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men shall die without disease , And lawyers live without their fees , When watch-dogs smile and jailors sleep , And dice and cards are buried deep , When tongues shall be our swords in battle , And women have grown wise by tattle , When flatterers shall have lost their meed , And liars be of no more need , When children shall not fear a witch , And when contractors grow not rich , When honest men shall serve the State , And grain no more intoxicate , When Kings are dead and buried all , And Priests have gone the self same track , Then shall we get up from the fall , Adam and Eve will then come back , Then will the earth be in its prime , Then shall we have a right good time , For then the Devil will be quite dead , And every man be fully fed .

This ambient enmity you can disarm , If you are wise and wary , and will be Symmetrical to an adjusted whole . Daily you root ye deeper in the hearts Of your new peoples , whilst th ' unborrowed force , That set you on these swift-subjected thrones , Grows hourly greater : and when the vast schemes , That lie already accomplished in my brain , Shall burst in act , so broad will be that force , We to the world may bid defiance full .

Knew I not how to meet disaster 's shock , I had been long since crushed . This is bad news ; But in a month I 'll make it be forgotten . Keep secret , both of you , to-day these tidings . Exeunt Alardo and Sesto . If aught could baffle my proportioned plans , It were these Islanders . Where'er can float A ship there gleams their flag .

My turn Will come again , when still a mightier shake He smiling shall have giv'n his dreadful urn . " Life is a flimsy dream , soon to be over " : Thus in my youth dejection spake through me .

My populous fields , my swarming towns call out , Wild-clamoring through the thousand-throated voice Of legions new , afire to be enranked .

Mimicries of th ' unsubstantial Are these regalities , this flimsy pomp , These Imperialities . Too much I ' ve made My strength the servant of my weaknesses .

Men hate the good :  --  but many , many love them . And some love me : too few , too few . Not so : My soldiers love me  --  they are not a few .

And my shriek waked me . LUSKY . LUSKY . Sire , no ghosts were they , But fleshly women here around you . Hark !

Go , find better use For your thin breath than darting stings at me . To work , as best ye can . Your friends have died , And so shall you . To all death cometh once .
