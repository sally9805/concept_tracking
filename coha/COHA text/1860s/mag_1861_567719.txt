txt the difficulty and the real question at issue . Any one who is acquainted with the laws of human nature , certainly any one familiar with history , must know that the rebellion which is now in progress is not the work of a day . The triumph of the Republican party , in the election of Mr. Lincoln , is not the cause of this great uprising ; at most , that event is only an occasion , artfully chosen , as a signal for concerted action . We must go much farther back to find the key to a conspiracy which , in magnitude and corruption , holds a foremost place among all rebellious plots against an established government . We shall look in vain for a complete revelation of the scheme by which the Constitution was to be overthrown , until all who are engaged in the execution of the plan are removed from the stage of action , and their private papers , now guarded with scrupulous care , have descended to the hands of those who have no occasion to conceal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the faces of the conspirators , and the world will now and then obtain glimpses within the lurking-places of treason . Already some of the materials for this thorough understanding of the great secession movement are in our hands , and a careful study of their contents scems incumbent upon all who would know what it is that we are fighting for , and who care to form a just opinion of the terms upon which a settlement is possible . It has been very common since the hostilities broke out to hear the remark that there should be no peace till the cause of the war was removed ,  --  but we are sorry to believe that there are many persons among us who suppose that the threatened attack upon Washington was the cause of our springing to arms at the North , and who would now be ready to sign a treaty of peace with the self-styled " Confederate States , " provided they will " lay down their arms and disperse . " We expect to hear in the approaching extra session of Congress a new proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to make the North believe that some fresh concessions to the Southern States will heal the breach and make us once more a united nation . It is these considerations which have led us to examine with some care the writings of distinguished and influential Southerners , that we may look at the present agitations from their point of view . As might naturally be expected , we begin with the writings // of John C. Calhoun . With his position as a staternan of acknowledged power , but , for the most of his career , of sectional and not national aims , every one is familiar . The older generation are also well acquainted with the specious arguments by which he maintained a pernicious and exaggerated doctrine of State Rights , and achieved for himself an unenviable distinction as the " Great Nullifier . " But younger men , who wish to understand how the dogma of secession , so false and so revolutionary as it seems to us , can be upheld under the guise of loyalty , and how nullification can be advocated in specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do well to examine the writings of Mr. Calhoun . They will find them to contain the seed which , under the favoring climate of South Carolina , has produced two rare harvests within a single generation , *nullification and secession . They will discover that abstract theorems propounded by Mr. Calhoun , were adopted from him by men far inferior in logical powers . Driven , perhaps , to accept his conclusions because incompetent to detect the fallacy on which they were based , such men have since worked out in practical results his metaphysical statements and have arrayed the South in arms against the government of the nation . We particularly recommend the perusal of the " South Carolina Exposition " of 1828 , as it is printed from the manuscript of Mr. Calhoun , in the last volume of his works ,  --  together with his Addresses to the People of South Carolina , prepared in 1831 , and to the People of the United States , prepared in 1832 , both of which are contained in the same volume . It is well known that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time , was the Tariff . In these discussions Slavery was alluded to only in an incidental manner . Aggressions on slavery , abolitionism , interference in any way " with the peculiar institution , " were then unknown . No charges on this score are lisped against the North . A mere question of finance was the occasion of nullification . On that issue alone was set forth the doctrine that our country is not a nation but a league , that the Constitution is not a union but a compact , and that any state has the exclusive right to judge for itself whether or not the compact is violated , and if so to take such means of redress as seems to her good . How such views were met by the argument of Mr. Webster in his golden days , and by the not less cogent arguments of General Jackson , everybody knows . By an examination of this passage in the // history of the government , it will be seen that the position then taken by Mr. Calhoun , years before the anti-slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained , and which is now held by those in the southern states who care to have a show of right and reason to justify rebellion . There is reason to believe that the ambition of Mr. Calhoun to become President of the United States , exerted a strong influence , perhaps more than he himself was aware , on these opinions of his , respecting the relations between the North and the South , and that this in itself is enough to account for the change in his views respecting the constitutionality of a protective tariff . It is certain that he was disappointed not to receive the nomination of his friends for President in the election of 1825 , and his disappointment was aggravated by the ultimate election of a Massachusetts man , not indeed by the people , but by the House of Representatives . The executive chair , which , except for a single term , had been occupied by Virginians from the foundation of the government , was then transferred to a Northerner . Mr. Calhoun was well aware of the growing prosperity of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent labor . lie recognized in the election of John Quincy Adams , a sign that its growth would henceforward be more and more manifest in the councils at Washington . Having up to that time been a national man , he became in the highest degree sectional . Having previously voted in favor of a protective tarifl he now became a free-trader . Opposed in his views and frustrated in his purposes , it was now that he announced the doctrine , till then unheard of ; that no allegiance is due to the Government of the United States , but only by every citizen to the government of his state . Between such a doctrine of State Sovereignty , and that which was held by the framers of the Constitution , the distance is immeasurable . We will not consider it in this place . Though first to advocate , Calhoun did not first avow the doctrine of State Sovereignty . This credit , we are told on good authority , belongs to the well-known Dr. Cooper , President of Columbia College , South Carolina , a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a materialist in philosophy , and a free thinker in religion . In 1828 , at the close of an after-dinner speech in which he had referred to the injustice which had been rendered to the South , he exclaimed , " The time has now come for South // Carolina to calculate the value of the Union . " His words fell like a thunder-bolt on the assembly . All were amazed , almost all were indignant . But the edge of the wedge had been entered , and successive blows were soon to drive it deeper . Cautiously , but surely , secretly , but with assiduity , Calhoun and Cooper , and those who were associated with them , from that day forward , began to plot for the severance of the North and South , and the phrase " calculation of the value of the Union , " then first introduced , became so popular that even its origin was soon forgotten . It was not our purpose to analyze or review the writings of Mr. Calhoun . We have referred to them in order to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in arms to subdue , was advocated and promulgated by that distinguished representative of the South , long before the later agitation of the subject of slavery had disturbed the councils of the nation . Shortly after " Nullification " was put down by the strong hand of Gen. Jackson , a very remarkable book was printed in Washington , entitled " The Partisan Leader . " The author was so well aware of the treasonable character of the work , that he not only concealed his own name , but that of his publisher , and without naming on the title page the true year of publication he affixed to it a date twenty years in advance . Instead of reading " Printed by IDuff Green , 1836 , " ( as was the fact ) , we accordingly read , " Printed by James Caxton , 1856 . " A reprint of this work has recently been made by a firm in New York ; but the copy which we have read is one of the original issue , bought soon after its publication and duly enrolled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public library to which it belongs , " the Brothers in Unity " of Yale College . We are thus precise in our statement , because the contents of the book are of such a character that many persons have questioned whether the story is not a recent fabrication , and its reputed publication , in 1836 , an advertiser 's card . The author of this prophetic novel , for such is the character of the work , was Beverley Tucker , Professor in William and Mary College , Virginia , a political writer of acknowledged ability , and the staunch friend of Mr. Calhoun . He was a man of influence and reputation , and unquestionably did much to infect the present generation in Virginia with the corruption of secession . In this curious book we find foreshadowed events which have // lately come to pass . The work is in the form of fiction , and is incomplete ; - two parts only having been given to the public . But it contains enough to establish the assertion that those who were sufficiently sagacious to trace the doctrines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of their acceptance , the dissolution of the Union . The events recorded in the story are supposed to have occurred at the close of Mr. Van Buren 's third term as President , and at the beginning of his fourth . He is the only distinguished personage referred to by name ; but those who were familiar with the public men at Washington , when the book was first printed , could detect , with certainty , many other living characters , disguised under other names than their own . The grievances of the South are represented as having reached such a hight that the cotton states have formed " a confederacy* ' independent of the Union . Virginia has been prevented from throwing herself on the side of the South by a strong constitutional party , and has consequently become the battleground on which the national troops are aiding the Union men to oppose the advocates of secession . Washington is threatened by the advancing forces of the South . The officers of the army are wavering in their allegiance , and sophistical arguments are brought forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Virginia ; and in case of her difference with the United States , sole allegiance is due to the Old Dominion . Cotton is believed to be king , with rice and tobacco for prime ministers ; and strenuous efforts are successfully made to secure from England , out of interested motives , a recognition of the new confederacy . The North are represented as corrupt and cowardly . The slaves are pictured as contented , and devoted to their masters . Such are some of the parallels between the projected and the actual state of things . More remarkable , however , than these coincidences , is one great contrast between the prophecy and the fact . The occasion of secession , in the novel , is not slavery , nor abolitionism . Here , as in the writings of Mr. Calhoun , we find only incidental reference to " the peculiar institution , " - none at all to interference with it on the part of the north . The national government is represented as having become monarchical and despotic in the hands of President Van Buren and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed as the obnoxious manifestation of the national power . The South appears to have " calculated the value of the Union , " and to have ascertained , by some process which we might expect would puzzle even a professor of the higher mathematics , that a dependence upon England was better than a continuance of the government bequeathed to us from our fathers . From the works now noticed we proceed to a brief examination of the memoirs of General Quitman , almost the only biography which the press has given us of one prominently engaged in the execution of the scheme to establish a Southern Republic . The speeches and state papers of Mr. Calhoun present the doctrine of secession with all the plausible philosophy of a man of affairs . The romance of Mr. Tucker embodies , in the garb of actual occurrence , the sagacious prophecy of a man of letters . The correspondence of General Quitman shows us what a man of arms was disposed to do for putting in practice the philosophy of the one , and for bringing to pass the prophecy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those most heedless in the defense of the South , General Quitman was a northerner by birth-his father being the Rev. Dr. Quitinan , a distinguished clergyman of Rhinebeck , on the Hudson . The son , about the time of his majority , removed to Mississippi , and identified himself with the concerva of that state , succeeding to one and another high office in the gift of the people . His services in behalf of Tens , when it was at war with Mexico , and his subs . pent gallantry in the war between the United States and Mexico , made him popular through the country as a military hero , while his avowed adhesion to the Calhoun doctrines of state sovereignty , in the extreme form , caused him to be early singled out in the South as an appropriate leader in the coming conflict with the North . He died in 1858  --  and his letters , with other biographical materials , were given to the public in 1860 , by Mr. 3 . F. H. Claiborne . The memoirs have attracted , for one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The public have been too much absorbed in watching living and dangerous traitors last year and this , to bestow a great deal of time on such as are no longer able to do any harm . To understand , however , those who are now in the front of the rebellion , it is quite worth while to read the career of one who was actively engaged in upholding , by his letters and speeches , the doctrines // of secession , now advanced by the bayonet and sword , and who , if his life had been continued , might now be holding the post and awaiting the doom of another Mississippian , the actual chief of the new " Confederacy . " We have not room enough to give even a sketch of General Quitman 's life . His ambition seems to have been to be to the State of Mississippi what Calhoun was to South Carolina . In powers of reasoning , and in statesmanship , he was immeasurably inferior to the leader of the nullification conflict ; but what he lacked in intellectual accumen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and military reputation . Mr. Calhoun 's opposition to the Union was the tariff . Secession , on that ground , being exploded , a new occasion for a violation of the constitution was found in the anti-slavery agitations of the North . It made no difference that the North had never interfered with slavery in any one of the southern states ; it was enough that there had been free discussion of its evils , and a growing determination to adhere to the doctrines of the founders of the government , and do all that was possible under the constitution to prevent the extension of " a moral , social , and political evil . " In 1850 , the passage of the Compromise Act gave as much offense to the extreme men at the South as to the anti-slavery men at the North . The fugitive slave law was not more odious to New England than was the admission of California as a free state , to the pro-slavery advocates in South Carolina and Mississippi . Then began to work the machinations for dissevering the Union , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Upon all the plottings from that time onward till his death , the memoirs of Quitman throw a most important light . The letters which General Quitman received from prominent Southerners , as given in his life , are quite as curious as his own . When it became evident that the free states were to be increased by the accession of California , the disunionists of the South began to conspire as to which of the states should lead the rebellion . Governor Seabrook of South Carolina , then writes to Governor Quitman of Mississippi , that " there are satisfactory reasons why South Carolina should move cautiously in this matter , " and ask what Mississippi will do . There are other almost amusing illustrations of the reluctance of the Palmetto State to take the lead in the contest . " A burnt child dreads fire . " having received a // favorable response from Quitman , Seabrook continues to discuss the ways and means by which secession may be brought about . Under date of October 23d , 1850 , he writes from Charleston , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet he believes that " the great cause would receive a fatal blow should this state South Carolina attempt to take the lead , " and he hopes accordingly that " Mississippi will begin the patriotic work and allow the Palmetto banner the privilege of a place in her ranks . " General Quitman appears quite willing to go forward as far as South Carolina could desire ; but a fear that the South were riot ready to unite , or that there was as yet no occasion which would justify in the eyes of the world so mighty a revolt , or that the accession of Mr. Fillmore to the Presidency , and the subsequent compromise measures , would add too much strength to the Union feeling , seems to have prevented him from actually venturing on open hostility to the national government . The connection of Quitman with Lopez , was one of the important connecting links in the chain of conspiracy . While yet Governor of Mississippi , he gave so much encouragement to the proposed invasion and conquest of Cuba , that he was indicted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vigorous measures which were taken by the governments of Spain and of the United States to put down the fillibusters of that day , proved to be a severe check upon the conspirators of the Southern Confederacy . Cuba has always been essential to their scheme of a Mediterranean Eiupire on the shores of the Mexican Gulf . It is the key-stone of their arch . On account of his complicity with Lopez , General Quitman expected to be arrested , and was advised to resist by Hon. Jacob Thompson , in a letter dated September 2d , 1850 , from which we make the following extract . Says Mr. Thompson , " When the President of the United States commands me to do one act , and the Executive of Mississippi commands me to do another thiiig inconsistent with the first order , I obey the Governor of my State . To Afississippi I owe allegiance , and because she commands me I owe obedience to the Uuited States . Bat when she says I owe obedience no longer , RIGHT OR WRONG , come weal or woe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobey her behests is in my conscience treason . " These are the words of one who , seven years afterwards , was appointed by James Buchanan to a seat in the Cabinet , as one of the Chief // Executive Officers of the United States . A letter from General Q uitman to Colonel John S. Preston of South Carolina , dated March 29th , 1551 , is of so much significance that we make from it an extended extract : " I believe , then , from present indications , that Mississippi , if her propositions are not promptly acceded to , will invite her neighboring sister states to form with her a new confederacy . She may , from her weakness and the inconvenience of her position , withhold the final act until one of her immediate neighbors shall also be willing to join her . She will not , probably , even if redress and guarantees be absolutely refnsed , venture to secede alone . Many of her boldest and staunchest Southern-rights men would not advise separate secession under any circumstances . A few with myself think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate secession . I concur with you in the opinion that the political equality of the slaveholding states is incompatible with the present confederation as construed and acted on by the majority , and that the present union and slavery can not coexist ; but I fear that these momentous truths have not yet become fully impressed upon the public mind in the South . In the cotton states such sentiments prevail and are growing ; but there are some indications of their existence in Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Kentucky , and Missouri , and although , to some extent , avowed in Texas and Louisiana , they are frowned down by most of their public men as treasonable and revolutionary . There is , then , no present hope that a majority of the slaveholding states will unite in any effective measures for curing the evils . It is vain to look for it or to expect it . On the contrary , the measures proposed to be adopted in some of the states , particularly Virginia , of a system of petty hostilities within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedies , but would really increase the evil . There is no hope whatever of united action beyond the cotton states . " For my part , I have long ceased to look beyond the cotton states for any united action , unless the North should pursue aggressions so madly and indiscreetly as to shock good taste , and insult pride as well as violate justice . Indeed , I fear that the frontier states-I mean those bordering on the free states-will never abandon the present Union , however great its oppressions , unless rudely driven from it by the North , or forced to choose between a Southern and a Northern confederacy . There is even danger , in case of the assembling of a Southern congress , that Virginia , uniting with the other slaveholding states now disposed to submit , will attempt to force upon us some new compromise ' to preserve the shadow of the Union when the substance is gone . There is danger , too , except in those states in which proposed state action keeps up agitation , that the public sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states will become blunted by time and acquiescence , until it will be very difficult to arouse the people to a proper estimate of the extent of the danger which threatens them . While it is true that in some of the states , particularly Alabama , Florida , and Louisiana , much discontent with the late action of Congress prevails , and the spirit of resistance is extending itself among the people , yet nowhere , except in South Carolina and Mississippi , is it proposed to act authorita // tively on these questions . To those two states alone , then , can we look to any efficient action . The latter is not yet fully prepared for final action ; she has less capital , is younger and weaker than the former , and has no seaport . The former should , then , take the lead , and fearlessly and confidently act for herself . This would prevent practical issues from her neighbors . Mississippi would , I feel assured , take position by her side , and soon all the adjoining states would follow her example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the slaveholding states , or even a majority of them , out of the question : that there is not even a present prospect of the cotton states authoritatively taking joint action . I feel , therefore , convinced that no effective measures will be taken of the states separately . The time and energy of the states would be wasted in fruitless contests about the proper remedy , and differences of opinion on this point would defeat any action at all , even though all the consulting states should favor some remedy . If , therefore , the people of South Carolina have made up their minds to withdraw from the Union at all events , whether joined by other states or not , my advice would be to do so without waiting for the action of any other state , as I believe there would be more probability of favorable action on the part of the other Southern states after her secession than before . So long as the several aggrieved states wait for one another , their action will be over-cautious and timid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold , and must present practical and simple issues . There is , therefore , in my opinion , greater probability of the dissatisfied states uniting with a seceding state than of their union for the purpose of secession . The secession of a Southern state would startle the whole South , and force the other states to meet the issue plainly ; it would present practical issues , and exhibit everywhere a wider-spread discontent than politicians have imagined . In less than two years all the states south of you would unite their destiny to yours . Should the federal government attempt to employ force , an active and cordial union of the whole South would be instantly effected , and a complete Southern confederacy organized . All these results are problems which the future alone can solve . - Vol. ii , pp. 125-127 . Already " the future " is " solving " the problem , and the world will soou understand the result . We might give many pages of extracts equally significant ,  --  but we recommend the whole book to the perusal of those , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame for the evils of civil war . They will see that for years the lovers of power in the South , and the advocates of slavery extension , have feared that the free institutions of the North would leave them far behind , and they have left no argument untried to persuade the South to regain in a seperate Confederacy the prestige which they were losing in the Union . The biographer of General Quitman makes the following comparison between the South and New England . It seems unaccountable that any one can know so much and be so foohish ,  --  ean // see so well and reason so 111 ,  --  and can fail to acknowledge that it is the institution of slavery itself and not the tariff , nor the increase of Northern wealth and power , nor any New England hostility to slavery , which has depressed the South . Says Mr. Claiborne : " New England is our opposite in everything . A black and wintry sky frowns upon a sterile and rock-bound soil . Her forest , compared with ours , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and capital , are indispensable there to production . Nothing comes spontaneously or kindly ; and with all the caressing and pampering. sbe never produces enough for her own consumption . Her factories would stop , and her operatives starve but for the fleecy staple and the cereal crops of the South . Winter binds up her water power , and her rivers and canals , four months in the year ; and the cost of fuel , much of which is brought from the South , diminishes the profits of her steam-machinery . She relieves herself every year of a redundant population by sending South for a living thousands of her stoutest-bodied men , and other thousands tempt seas the most remote , leaving at home a large majority of females and consumers . " Yet in despite of all this annual expenditure of capital and productive labor , she is ahead of us in the career of prosperity . Her population multiplies faster . She has ten school-houses where we have one . She has whole navies of merchantmen and lines of steamships . Where are ours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks , and in the English funds . She buys from us our staples to sell them again , transformed into starch , maccaroni , arrowroot , biscuit , whisky , brandy , rum , candies , snuff , prints , cambrics , Lowells , and a thousand other fabrics , under the protection of a principle which gives her a decided advantage in our markets over the foreign manufacturer of the same articles . And , under the system , she grows richer and richer , and more importunate and more exacting every year ; and in the same ratio we become poor , and more cringing and more timid . " Our revolutionary fathers rose in arms , at the hazard of property and life to resist a tax not half so unjust and oppressive . A single obnoxious law overthrew the administration of John Adams , a statesman burnished with the lustre of the Revolution , and surrounded and supported by its ablest and bravest instruments . The legislative action of Virginia alone more than once rolled back the tide of federal aggression that threatened to submerge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now so much are we accustomed to encroachment-so drilled to act as hewers of wood and drawers of water ' for the North-so much absorbed and distracted by their war on our institutions , which under the most insidious professions , they continue to wage , that we scarcely see , or , if seen , we dare not denounce the colossal evil which has so long pressed us to the ground . We see , and we are ready to resist , the flaming brand that fanaticism levels at our institutions , but we do not perceive that the raorxcrivx 5Y5TEM is a fiend , in the shape of a trusted domestic , who drugs our food and our cup , and slowly , but surely , drains away our vitality . " This monster haunts us like a phantom in all the occupations of life ; is a tax // July , on our laboi and on our pleasures ; drives us from our fields , and like the obscene birds of Virgil , pollutes even our feasts . " Professing loyalty to the Union-which implies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the government supports a system which effectually strengthens the party it proposes to rebuke , and cripples the party it promises to defend . There is just this difference . The abolitionist would rob us of our slaves ; the government will let us retain them , but contrives to diminish the profits of their labor , well knowing that thus the institution itself is sapped . So they each accomplish , by different means , the same end , the ruin of the slaveholder. " pp. 187-189.
