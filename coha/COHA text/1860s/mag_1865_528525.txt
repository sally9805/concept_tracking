ATLANTIC MONTHLY . A Maga*iize of Literature , Art , and Politics . VOL . XV . - FEBRUARY , 1865. - NO . LXXXVIII. * OUR FIRST GREAT PAINTER , AND HIS WORKS . ON the 8th of July , 1843 , Washington Aliston died . Twenty-one years have since gone by ; and already his name has a fine flavor of the past added to its own proper aroma . In twenty-one years Art has made large advances , but not in the direction of imagination . In that rare and precious quality th' works of Allston remain preeminent as before . It is now so long ago as 1827 that the first exhibition of pictures at the Boston Athenieum took place ; and then and there did Allston first become known , to his American public . Returned from Europe after a long absence , he had for some years been living a retired , even a recluse life , was personally known to a few friends , and by name only to the public . The exhibition of some of his pictures on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , having once felt the strange charm of that genius , but recalls with joyful interest the happy hour when he was first brought under its influence ? I well remember , even at this distance in time , the mystic , charmed presence that hung about the " Jeremiah dictating his Prophecy to Baruch the Scribe , " " Beatrice , ' ? " The Flight of Florimel , " " The Triumphal Song of Miriam on the Destruction of Pharaoh and his Host in the Red Sea , " and " The Valentine . " I was then young , and had yet to learn that the quality that so attracted me in these pictures is , indeed , the rarest virtue in any work of Art , - that , although pictures without imagination are without savor , yet that the larger number of those that are painted are destitute of that grace , - and that , when , in later years , I should visit the principal galleries of Europe , and see the masterpieces of each master , I still should return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unique in Art . I have also , since that time , come to believe , that , while every sensitive beholder must feel the charm of Allston 's style , its intellectual ripeness can be fully appreciated only by the aid of a foreign culture . Passing through Europe with this impres*ion of Allston 's genius , in the Venetians I first recognized his tindred ; in Venice I found the school in which he had studied , and in which Nature had fitted him to study : for his eye for color was like his management of it , - Venetian . His treatment of heads Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1865 , by TICIcNOR AND FIELDS , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts . // has a round , ripe , sweet fulness which reminds one of the heads in the " Paradiso " of Tintoretto , - that work which deserves a place in the foremost rank of the world 's *nasterpieces . The great praise implied in this comparison is justly due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inimitable . Without any appearance of labor , all crudeness is absorbed ; the outlines of objects are not so much softened as emptied of their color and substance , so that the light appears to pass them . The finishing is so judicious that the spectator believes he could see more on approaching nearer . The eye searches the shade , and sees and defines the objects at first concealed by it . The eye is not satiated , but by the most artful means excited to greater appetite . The coloring is not so much harmonious as harmony itself , out of which melodies of color play through the picture in a way that is found in no other master but Paul Veronese . As Allston himself expressed it , he liked to echo his colors ; and as an echo is best heard where all else is silence , so the pure repose of these compositions gives extraordinary value to such delicate repetitions of color . The effect is , one might say , more musical than pictorial . This peculiar and musical effect is most noticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and symphonies . They run up the scale , beginning with the low-toned " Moonlight , " through the great twilight piece called " After Sunset , " the " Forest Scene , " where it seems always afternoon , the gray " Mountain Landscape , " a world composed of stern materials , the cool " Sunrise on the Mediterranean . " up to the broad , pure , Elysian daylight of the " Italian Landscape , " with atmosphere ftdrof music , color , and perfume , cooled and shaded by the breezy pines , open far away to the sea , and the sky peopled with opalescent clouds , trooping wide on their celestial errands . Of this last landscape the poetic merit is as great as the artistic excellence is unrivalled . Whoever has made pictures and handled colors knows well that a subject pitched on a high key of light is vastly more difficult to r*ianage than one of which the highest light is not above the middle tint . To keep on that high key which belongs to broad daylight , and yet preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest degree difficult ; but here it is successfully done , and again reminds us of the Paul Veronese treatment . Though a quiet picture , it is full of brilliancy . It represents a broad and partly shaded expanse , full , also , of light and sweet sunshine , through which the eye travels till it rests on the distant mountain , rising majestically in grand volcanic forms from the horizon plains . The sky is filled with cloudy veils , floating , prismatic ; some quiet water , crossed by a bridge which rests on round arches , is in the middle distance ; and a few trees near the foregrod*nd form the group from which rises the stone-pine , which is the principal feature in the picture , and gives it its character . As I write this , I fear that any reader who has not seen the picture to which I refer will immediately think of Turner s Italian landscapes , so familiar to all the world through engravings , where a stone-pine is lifted against the sky as a mass of dark to contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the picture . But such effects , however legitimate and powerful in the hands of Turner , were not in Allston 's manner ; they would ruin and break the still harmony which was the law of his mind and of his compositions . Under this tree , on the path , fall flickering spots of sunshine , in which sit or stand two or three figures . The scarlet and white of their dresses , catching the sunshine , make the few high notes that cause the whole piece to throb like music . There is aTho a large Swiss landscape , possessing in an extraordinary degree the pure , keen atmosphere , as well as the grand mountain forms , of the Alpine spaces . To look on this piece exhilarates as does the sight of the Alps themselves ; and it strikes the // 3 ' eye as a shrill trumpet sound the ear . This landscape , a grand antithesis to the last described , marks a great range of power in the mind that produced them both . But Allston was not a landscapepainter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in excellence . They are poetic in the truest sense ; they are laden with thought and life , and are of " imagination all compact . " They transport the beholder to a fairer world , where , through and behind the lovely superficies of things , he sees the hidden ideal of each member , - of rock , sea , sky , earth , and forest , - and feels by a clear magnetism that he is in presence of the very truth of things . We now come to a class of Allston 's pictures which are known chiefly , perhaps only , in Boston . They are justly prized by their owners as possessions of inestimable value ; they are the works that more than others display his peculiar genius . I allude to certain ideal heads and figures called by these names : " Beatrice , " " Rosalie , " " The Bride , " " The Spanish Girl , " " The Evening Hymn , " " The Tuscan Girl , " " Miriam , " " The Valentine , " " Lorenzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Roman Lady , " and others ; and I shall give a short description of the most important of these , sometimes in my own words , and sometimes in those of one who is the only writer I can find who has said anything distinctive about the works of Allston . I refer to William Ware , who died in the act of preparing a course of lectures on the Genius of Allston , - a task for which he was well qualified by his artistic organization , his long study of Art , and his clear appreciation of Allston 's power . In these smaller ideal pieces Allston seems to have found his own genius , so peculiar are they , so different from the works of all other masters , and so divine in their expressive repose . I say divine in their repose with full intention ; for this is a repose , not idle and voluptuous , not poetic and dreamy , but a repose full of life , a repose which commands and controls the beholder , and stirs within him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces consist of heads and fit , - ures , mostly single , distinct as individuals , and each a heaven of beauty in itself . The method of this artist was to suppress all the coarser beauties which make up the substance of common pictures . He was the least ad caj5tandum of workers . He avoided bright eyes , curls , and contours , glancing lights , strong contrasts , and colors too crude for har.mony . He reduced his beauty to her elements , so that an inner beauty might play through her features . Like the Catholic discipline which pales the face of the novice with vigils , seclusion , and fasting , and thus makes room and clears the way for the movements of the spirit , so in these figures every vulgar grace is suppre%sed . No classic contours , no languishing attitudes , n6 asking for admiration ,  --  but a severe and chaste restraint , a modest sweetness , a slumbering intellectual atmosphere , a graceful self-possession , eyes so sincere and pure that heaven 's light shines through them , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a presence . Perhaps the two most remarkable and original of the pieces I have named above are the " Beatrice " and the " Rosalie . " Of the " Beatrice " there has been much discussion whether she could have been intended to represent the Beatrice of Dante . To me it appears that there is nothing like that world- and heaven-renowned lady in this our Beatrice . She sits alone : one sees that in the expression of her eyes . Her dress is of almost conventual simplicity ; the colors rich , but sober ; the style flowing and medheval . She has soft brown hair ; soft , velvet-soft , brown eyes ; features not salient , but rounded into the contours of the head ; her whole expression receptive , yet radiant with sentiment . The complexion of a ten der rose , equally diffused , gives an indescribable air of healihful delicacy to the face . The expression of the whole // figure is that of one in a very dream of sentiment . Her twilight eyes see without effort into the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces . The sentiment of this figure is so powerful that by its gentle charm it fastens the beholder , who gazes and can not withdraw his eyes , wondering what is the spell that can so hold him to that face , which is hardly beautiful , surely without surface beauty . I once hearct a person who was unaccustomed to the use of critical terms say of these creations of Allston , " Here is beauty , but not the beauty that glares on you " ; and this phrase , so odd , but so original , well describes the beauty of this Beatrice , who , though now transfigured by sentiment and capable of being a home-goddess , does not seem intended to shine in starry circles . But for the beauty of execution in this picture , it is unsurpassed . It is in this respect like the most beautiful things ever painted by Raphael , - like the Madonna del Cardellino , whose face has light within , " luce di dentro , " as is the expressive Italian phrase , - and is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raphael , in the collection of the late Baron Kestner at Rome . Visiting the extremely curious and valuable gallery of this gentleman , the Hanoverian Minister at Rome , after making us begin at the beginning , among the very early masters , he led us on with courteous determination through his specimens of all the schools , and made us observe the characteristics of each school and each master , till at last we rested in the last room , where hung a single picture covered with a silken curtain . This at last , with sacred and reverent ceremony , was drawn aside , and revealed a portrait by Raphael , - the portrait of a lady , young and beautiful , and glowing with a tender sentiment which recallect to my remembrance these heads by Allston , not alone in the sentiment , but in the masterly beauty of the painting . M. Kestner told us he supposed the picture to be the portrait of that niece of Cardinal Bibbiena to whom Raphael was betrothed . The picture had come into his possession by one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . At a sale of pictures at Bologna , he told us he noticed a very ordinary head , badly enough painted , but with very beautiful hands , - hands which betrayed the work of a master ; and he conjectured this to be some valuable picture , hastily covered with coarse work to deceive the emissaries of a conqueror when they came to select and carry off the most valuable pictures from the galleries of the conquered city . He gave his agent orders to purchase it , and when in his possession a little careful work removed the upper colors and discovered one of the most beautiful heads ever painted even by Raphael . Though it may and will seem extravagant , I am satisfied that there are several heads by Allston thal*.would lose nothing by comparison with this admirable work . Indeed , though M. Kestner 's picture is a portrait , it is a work so entirely in the same class with the " Beatrice , " the " Rosalie , " the " Valentine , " and some other works of Allston , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rosalie " is different from " Beatrice . " She seems listening to music ; and so the little poem written by the author , and recited by him when showing the picture newly finished to his friends , describes her . The face indicates , not a dream of sentiment , like that of " Beatrice , " but rather a rapture . She is " caucxht on a higher strain . " She is a creature as passionate as tender ; more like Juliet than like Miranda ; fit to be the love of a poet , and to reward his song with the overflowing cup of love . In this figure also beauty melts into feeling . The composition of color is masterly ; in the draperies it is inlaid in opposin6 fields , by which means the key of the whole is raised , and the rising rapture of expression powerfully seconded . Did I not fear to insist too much on what may be only a private fancy , I should say that these colors reverberate like some rich orchestral strain of music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady might he the mother of the Gracchi , so stately and of so grand a style is she . But she is a modern , for she reads from a hook . She might he Vittoria Colonna , the loved of Michel Angelo , so grave , so dignified is her aspect . The whole figure is reading . A vital intelligence seems to pass from the eyes to the hook . Nothing tender in this woman , who , if a Roman , takes life after the " high Roman fashion . " The beauty and perfect representation of the hands should he noticed here , as well as in the " Rosalie " and " Beatrice . " " Triumphal Song of Miriam on the Destruction of Pharaoh and his Hosts in the Red Sea . " This is a three-quarter length figure . She stands singing , with one hand holdin6 the timbrel , the other thrown aloft , the whole form upborne by the swelling triu4rlphal song . I hardly know what it is in this picture which takes one hack so far into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern ; the face is not entirely of the Hehrew type , hut the tossing exultation seems so truly to carry off the wild thrill of joy when a people is released from bondage , that it is almost unnecessary to put the words into her mouth , - " Sing ye to the Lord , for He hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea . " This figure is dramatically imaginative . In looking at it , one feels called on to sing triumphal songs with Miriam , and not to stand idly looking . The magnetism of the artist at the moment of conceptio npowerfully seizes on the beholder . " The Valentine " is described by William Ware * as follows . " For the Valentine ' I may say , though to some it may seem an extravagance , I have never been able to invent the terms that would sufficiently express my admiration of that picture , - I mean , of its color ; though as a whole it is admirable for its composition , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works and Genius of Wasl*-zug-/on Ails/on . Boston : Phillips , Sampson , &amp; Co. 1852. 33 for the simplicity and naturalness of the arrangement . But the charm is in the color of the flesh , of the head , of the two hands . The subject is a young woman reading a letter , holding the open letter with both the hands . The art can go no further , nor as I believe has it ever gone any further . Some pigments or artifices were unfortunately used , which have caused the surface to crack , and which require the picture now to be looked at at a further remove than the work on its own account needs or requires ; it even demands a nearer approach , in order to be well seen , than these cracks will permit . But these accidental blemishes do not materially interfere with the appreciation and enjoyment of the picture . It has what I conceive to be that most rare merit , - it has the same universal hue of nature and truth in both the shadows and the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the great cross to the artist . The great defect and the great difficulty , in imitating the hues of flesh , lies in the shadows and the half-shadows . You will often observe in otherwise excellent works of the most admirable masters , that , the moment their pencil passes to the shadows of the flesh , especially the halfshadows , truth , though not always a certain beauty , forsakes them . The shadows are true in their degree of dark , but false in tone and hue . They are true shadows , but not true flesh . You see the form of a face , neck , arm , hand in shadow , but not flesh in shade ; ' and were that portion of the form sundered from its connection with the body , it could never be told , by its color alone , what it was designed to be . Allston 's wonderful merit is , ( and it was Titian 's , ) that the hue of life and flesh is the same in the shadow as in the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flesh in shadow . The shadows of most artists , even very distinguished ones , are green , or brown , or black , or lead color , and have some strong and decided tint other than that of flesh . The difficulty with most seems to have been so insuperable , that they cut the knot at a single // 34 blow , and surrendered the shadows of the flesh , as an impossibility , to green or brown or black . And in the general imitation of the flesh tints the greatest artists have apparently abandoned the task in despair , and contented themselves with a correct utterance of form and expression , with well - harmonized darks and lights , with little attention to the hues of Nature . Such was Caravaggio always , and Guercino often , and all their respective followers . Such was Michel Angelo , and often Raffaelle , - though at other times the color of Raffaelle is not inferior in truth and glory to Titian , greatest of the Venetian colorists : as in his portraits of Leo X. , Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , though he had the genius for everything , for c*lor as well as form , yet one may conjecture he found color in its greatest excellence too laborious for the careful elaboration which can alone produce great results , too costly of time and toil , the sacrifice too great of the greater to the less . Allston was apparently never weary of the labor which would add one more tint of truth to the color of a head or a hand , or even of any object of still life , that entered into any of his compositions . Any eye that looks can see that it was a most laborious and difficult process by which he secured his re*sults , - by no superficial wash of glaring pigments , as in the color of Ruhens , whose carnations look as if he had finished the forms at once , the lights and the darks in solid opaque colors , and then with a free , broad brush or sponge washed in the carmine , lake , and vermilion , to confer the requisite amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in solid color from beginning to end , by a painful and sagacious formation , on the palette , of the very tint by which the effect , the lights , shadows , and half-shadows , and the thousand almost imperceptible gradations of hue which bind together the principal mass. : *es of light and shade , was to be produced . " here Mr. Ware undoubtedly errs in attributing the success of Allston 's flesh tints to the use of solid color alone . Such effects are not possible without the aid of transparent colors in glazing ; but it is the judicious combination of solid with transparent pigments , combined not bodily on the palette , but in their use on the canvas , that gives to oil-painting all its unrivalled power in the hands of a master . Allston was accustomed to inlay his pictures in solid crude color with a medium that hardened like stone , and to leave them months and even years to dry before finishing them with the glazing colors , which worked in his hands like magic over such a well-hardened surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure solidity of appearance , richness of color , unity of effect , and atmospheric repose and tenderness enveloping all objects in the picture . Many of his unfinished works are left in the first stage of this process , showing precisely how far he relied on the use of solid color ; and by comparing the works left in this state with his finished pictures , one may see how much he was indebted to the use of transparent glazes for the beauty , tenderness , and variety of color in the last stages of his work . In 1839 there was an exhibition in Boston of such of the works of Allston as could be borrowed for the occasion . This was managed by the friends of the artist for his benefit . The exhibition was held in Harding 's Gallery , a square , well-lighted room , hut too small for the larger pictures . It was , however , the best room that could be procured for the purpose . Here were shown fortyfive pictures , including one or two drawings . There was something peculiarly happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On entering , the presence of the artist seemed to fill the room . The door-keeper held the door , hut Allstori held the room ; for his spirit flowed from all the walls , and helped the spectator to see his work aright . This accompaniment of the artist 's presence , which hanb s a bout all truly artistic works , is disturbed in a miscellaneous collection , where jarrin* influences contend , and the worst pictures outshine // and outglare the best , and for a time triumph over them . But in this exhibition no such disturbance met one , but rather one was received into an atmosphere of peace and harmony , and in such a temper beheld the pictures . The largest picture on the walls was " The Dead Man restored to Life by touching the Bones of the Prophet Elisha . " This is a great subject , greatly treated , full of power and expression . The next in size was " Jeremiah dictating his Prophecy to Baruch , the Scribe . " This picture contains two figures , both seated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be seen from a distance , though its perfect execution makes a nearer view desirable also . If it were seen at the end of some church aisle , through arches , and with a good light upon it , the effect would be much enforced . It is a picture of extraordinary expression . The Prophet , the grandest figure among the sons of men , with those strange eyes that Allston loved to paint , - eyes which see verities , not objects , - is looking not upward , but forward , not into space , but into spirit ; with one hand raised , as if listening , he receives the heavenly communication , which the beautiful youth at his feet is writing in a book . The force and beauty of this work are unsurpassed . It is a perfect picture : grand in design , perfect in composition , splendid in color , successful in execution , and the figures full of expression , - for the inspiration of the Prophet seems to overflow into the Scribe , whose attitude indicates enthusiastic receptiveness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be named , admirable . The other pictures in this collection , with the exception of the large Swiss landscape , were of cabinet size . Some of them have been already described in this paper . I will give Mr. Ware 's description of " Lorenzo and Jessica , " and of " The Spanish Girl . " Mr. Ware says : - " But perhaps the most exquisite examples of repose are the Lorenzo and Jessica , ' and The Spanish Girl . ' These 35 are works also to which no perfectioa could be added , - from which , without loss , neither touch nor tint could be subtracted . We might search through all galleries , the Louvre or any other , for their equals or rivals in either conception or execution . I speak of these familiarly , because I suppose you all to be familiar with them . The first named , the Lorenzo and Jessica ; ' is a very small picture , one of the smallest of Allston 's best ones ; but no increase of size could have enlarged its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lovers sit side by side , their hands clasped , at the dim hour of twilight , all the world hushed into silence , not a cloud visible to speck the clear expanse of the darkening sky , as if themselves were the only creatures breathing in life , and they absorbed into each other , while their eyes , turned in the same direction , are turned upon the fading light of the gentle , but brilliant planet , as it sinks below the horizon : the gentle brilliancy , not the setting , the emblem of their mutual loves . As you dwell upon the scene , your only thought is , May this quiet beauty , this delicious calm , , never be disturbed , but may The peace of the scene pass into the heart ! ' In the background , breaking the line of the horizon , but in fine unison with the figures and the character of the atmosphere , are the faint outlines of a villa of Italian architecture , but to whose luxurious halls you can hardly wish the lovers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that bank . It is all painted in that deep , subdued , but rich tone , in which , except by the strongest light , the forms are scarcely to be made out , but to which , to the mind in some moods , a charm is lent , surpassing all the glory of the sun . " The Spanish Girl ' is another example to the same point . It is one of the most beautiful and perfect of all of Mz ; Allston 's works . The Spanish girl gives her name to the picture , but it is ' one of those misnomers of which there ' are many among his works . One who looks at the picture scarcely ever looks Our First Great Painter , and , kis Works . // at , certainly cares nothing for , the Spanish girl , and regards her as merely giving her name to the picture ; and when the mind recurs to it afterwards , however many years may have elapsed , while he can recall nothing of the beauty , the grace , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which her presence is a mere inferior incident , is never forgotten , but remains forever as a part of the furniture of the mind . In this part of the picture , the landscape , it must . be considered as one of the most felicitous works of genius , where , by a few significant tints and touches , there is unveiled a world of beauty . You see the roots of a single hill only , and a remote mountain-summit , but you think of Alps and Andes , and the eye presses onwards till it at last rests on a low cloud at the horizon . It is a mere snatch of Nature , but , though only that , every square inch of the surface has its meaning . It carries you back to what your mind imagines of the warm , reddish tints of the Brown Mountains of . Cervantes , where the shepherds and shepherdesses of that pastoral scene passed their happy , sunny hours . The same deep feeling of repose is shown in all the half-developed objects of the hill-side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the warm , motionless haze that wraps sky , land , tree , water , and cloud . It is quite wonderful by how few tints and touches , by what almost shadowy and indistinct forms , a whole world of poetry can be breathed into the soul , and the mind sent rambling off into pastures , fields , boundless deserts of imaginary pleasures , where only is warmth and sunshine and rest , where only poets dwell , and beauty wanders abroad with her sweeping train , and the realities of the working-day world are for a few moments happily forgotten . " " The Flight of Flori mel " is an upright landscape . Florimel , on a white horse , is rushing with long leaps through the forest . The horse and rider are so near the front of the picture as to occupy an important space in the foreground . The lady , in her dress of beaten gold , with fair hair , and pale , frightened face , clings with both hands to her bridle , and half looks back towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite beauty . The tender white and pale yellows of the horse and rider show like fairy colors in a fairy forest . The whole is wonderfully light and airy , flickering between light and shade . The forest has no heavy glooms . The light breaks through everywhere . The forms of the trees are light and piny ; the red soil is seen , the roots of the trees , the broken turf , the sandy ground . All the colors are delightfully broken up in the mysterious half-light which confuses the outlines of every object , without making them shadowy . Such a picture one might see with half-shut eyes in a sunny wood , if one had more poetry than prose in one 's head , and were well read in the " Fai*rie Queen . " " A Mother Watching her Sleeping Child . " This is a very small picture , remarkable only for its tender sentiment and delightful coloring . The child is nude ; the flesh tints of a tender rose , painted with that luminous effect which leaves no memory of paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a small landscape , with something of the Indian Summer haze ; and a solitary horseman trotting across the foreground with an indifferent manner , as if he would soon be out of sight , wonderfully enhances the quietness of the scene . " Isaac of York . " This head of a Jew is powerfully painted , warm and rich ; as also are two heads called " Sketches of Polish Jews , " which were painted at one sitting . " A Portrait of Benjamin West , late President of the Royal Academy , " has all the most admirable qualities that a simple portrait can have . " A Portrait of the Artist , painted in Rome , " is very interesting , from the youthful sweetness of the face . " Head of St. Peter " is a study for the head of St. Peter in a large picture of the Angel delivering Peter from Prison . In this large picture , lately brought from England to Boston , the // head of the angel is of surpassing beauty , and makes a powerful contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flooded with the light which surrounds his heavenly deliverer . " The Sisters . " This picture represents two young girls of three-quarter size , the back of one turned toward the spectator . In the Catalogue is a note by the artist , who says , - " The air and color of the head with golden hair was imitated from a picture by Titian , called the Portrait of his Daughter ,  --  butnot the character or the disposition of the hair , which in the portrait is a crop ; the action of the portrait is also different , holding up a casket with both hands . The rest of the picture , with the exception of the curtain in the background , is original . " Now this is a very modest as well as honest statement of the artist ; for both the figures seem perfectly original , and do not recall Titian 's Daughter to the memory , except as an example of a successful study of Titian 's color , which I believe all are permitted , nay , recommended , to imitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite true , that this picture is less Allstonian than the rest , which makes his explanation welcome . It was undoubtedly painted as a study , and was not an original suggestion of his own mind , as almost everything he has left evidently was , - if internal evidence is evidence enough . Allston himself said , that he never painted anytbing that did not cost him his whole mind ; and those who read his genius in his works can easily believe this statement . " The Tuscan GirL " This is a very lovely little picture . It is not a study of costume , but a picture of dreamy girlhood musing in a wood . The sentiment of this charming little picture is best described in a little poem with which its first appearance was accompanied , and which opens thus : - " How pleasant and how sad the turning tide Of human life , when side hy side The child and youth begin to glide Along the vale of years : The pure twin-being for a little space , With lightsome heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not for tears I " 137 I will not occupy any more space with describing the pictures in this unique collection . All were not brought together that might have been . One very remarkable small picture , called " Spalatro , or the Bloody Hand , " was not with these . Its distance from Boston probably prevented its being risked on the dangers of a lon , , journey . There are several pictures by Alls*on in England . Of these I can not speak , as I have not seen them . Of one , however , " Elijah in the Desert , " Mr. Ware gives so striking a description , that I will quote nearly the whole of it . " I turn with more pleasure to another work of Mr. Aliston , even though but few can ever have seen it , but which made upon my own mind , when I saw it immediately after it was completed , an impression of grandeur and beauty never to be effaced , and never recalled without new sentiments of enthusiastic admiration . I refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a large picture of perhaps six feet by four . It might have been more appropriately named an Asian or Arabian Desert . That is to s*ty , it is a very unfortunate error to give to either a picture or a book a name which raises false expectations ; especially is this the case when the name of the picture is a great or imposing one which greatly excites the imagination . What could be more so than this , Elijah in the Desert , fed by Ravens ' ? Extreme and fatal was the disappointment to many , on entering the room , when , looking on the picture , no Elijah was to be seen ; at least you had to search for him among the subordinate objects , hidden away among the grotesque roots of an enormous banyantree ; and the Prophet , when found at last , was hardly worth the pains of the search . But as soon as the intelligent visitor had recovered from his first disappointment , the objects which then immediately filled the eye taught him , that , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophet , he had found more than a Prophet , a landscape which in its sublimity excited the Our First Great Painter , and his Works . // imagination as powerfully as any gigantic form of the Elijah could have done , even though Michel Angelo had drawn it . It is meant to represent , and does perfectly represent , an illimitable desert , a boundless surface of barrenness and desolation , where Nature can bring forth nothing but seeds of death , and the only tree there is dead and withered , not a leaf to be seen nor possible . The only other objects , beside the level of the desert , either smooth with sand or rough with ragged rock , are a range of dark mountains on the right , heavy lowering clouds which overspread and overshadow the whole scene , the roots and wide-spread branches of an enormous banyan-tree , through the tortuous and leafless branches of which the distant landscape , the hills , rocks , clouds , and remote plains are seen . The roots of this huge tree of the desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descend , and root themselves again in the earth , then again.rise , again descend into the ground and root themselves , and so on , growing smaller and smaller as the process is repeated , till they disappear in the general level of the plain , or lose themselves among the rocks , like the knots and convolutions of a huge family of boa-constrictors . The branches , which almost completely fill the upper part of the picture , are done with such truth to general Nature , are so admirable in color , so wonderful in the treatment of their perspective , that the eye is soon happily withdrawn from any attention to the roots , among which the Prophet sits , receiving the food with which the ravens , as they float towards him , miraculously supply him You forgot the Prophet , the ravens , the roots , and almost the branches , though these were too vast and multitudinous to be overlooked , and were , moreover , truly characteristic , and dwelt only upon the heavy rolling clouds , the lifeless desert , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misty outline of the horizon , . where earth and heaven became one . The picture was , therefore , a landscape of a most sublime , impressive character , and not a mere representation of a passage of Scripture history . It would have been a great gain to the work , if the Scripture passage courd have been painted out , and the desert only left . But , as it is , it serves as one further illustration of the characteristic of Mr. Allston 's art , of which I have already given several examples . For , melancholy , dark , and terrific almost , as are all the features of the scene , a strange calm broods over it all , as of an ocean , now overhung by black threatening clouds , dead and motionless , but the sure precursors of change and storm ; and over the desert hang the clouds which were soon to break and deluge the parched earth and cover it again with verdure . But at present the only motion and life is in the little brook Cherith , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sublime , after all , is better expressed in the calmness , repose , and silence of the Elijah , ' than in the tempests of Poussin or Vernet , Wilson or Salvator Rosa . " " Belshazzar 's Feast . " Any criticism of Allston 's works would be very imperfect which did not speak of his " Belshazzar 's Feast , " - because , though the picture was never finished , it occupied so large a part of the life and thou hts of Allston , that it demands some mention . It had been an object of great interest among Allston 's friends before it had been seen by one of them . It was intended by him to fulfil a commission from certain gentlemen of Boston for a large picture , the subject of which was to be chosen by himself . A sum of money was also placed at his disposal with the commission , in order to secure to him leisure and freedom from . care , that he might work at his ease , and do justice to his thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his genius which was felt by those friends who knew him best . The picture was begun , went forward , and was nearly completed , when an important change in the structure of the work was determined on , and un // dertaken with great courage . As often unfortunately happens in such cases , the interruption to the flow of thought was fatal to the success of the picture . It was laid aside for many years , but was , the work actually in hand at the time of Aliston 's death . When , after that event , his studio was entered hy his nearest friends , and the picture so long guarded with jealous reserve was first seen , it was round to he in a disorganized , almost chaotic state . But though fragmentary , the fragments were full of interest . Man*r passages were perfectly painted , and the whole intention was full of grandeur and beauty . But a picture left in that state should never have been publicly shown . Deeply interesting to artists , and to those familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder to those who go to an exhibition to see finished pictures , and who do not understand those which are not finished . With this work such persons could have no concern . Yet , hy what appears a great error of judgment , this worse than unfinished picture was made the subject of a public exhibition , though in a state of incompleteness which the artist during life would not permit his nearest friend to behold . And as if this violation of his wishes were not enough , a stolen and travestied copy soon appeared , and was heralded by placards , on which the words " Great Picture hy Washington Allston " were seen in letters large enough to he read across the street , and on which the words " Copy of " were in such very small type that they were unnoticed , except hy those who looked for them . This copy went to other cities , and gave of course a most erroneous impression of the great painter 's genius . Among the half-finished pictures found in the studio of Allston after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These seemed so valuable , and their condition so perishable , that it was thought best to have them engraved . This was undertaken by a friend and admirer of the artist , Mr. S. H. Perkins , who arranged the designs and superintended the enb aving , and published the work with the aid of a partial subscription and at his own risk . The brothers Cheney engraved the outlines , and with peculiar skill and feeling imitated the broadly expressive chalk lines by combining several delicately traced lines into one . These outlines and sketches were published in i8*o . There are , first , six plates of outlines from heads and figures in a picture of " Michael setting the Watch . " Thi picture must have been painted in England , and is unknown here except by these outlines . From these alone great strength of design might be inferred . There are , besides , " A Sibyl , " sittin* in a cave-like , rocky place , the eyes dilated with thought , the mouth tenderly fixed ; the cave is open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most characteristic works of Allston , had it been painted . " Dido and *neas . " Then four plates from figures of angels in " Jacob 's Dream . " This is a picture painted in England for Lord Egremont , and is mentioned in Leslie 's Recollections , by the editor of that work , in a minor key of praise . Then comes the outline of a single figure , " Uriel sitting in the Sun . " This picture was also painted in England . As Allston was fond of referring to it , and describing the methods he used to represent the light of the sun behind . the angel , as if he felt satisfied with the result , it may be inferred that the effort to do so difficult a thing was successful . The sun was painted over a white ground with transparent glazings of the primary colors laid and dried separately , thus combining the colors prismatically to produce white light . The figure of the sitting angel is grandly original , - of the most noble proportions , and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust . Then come three compositions , with many figures ,  --  " Heliodorus , " " Fairies on the Seashore , " and " Titania 's Court . " These show as much power in composition as the single figures do in design . The " Fairies on the Seashore " is an exquisitely graceful design , both in the 1865.1 39 // figures and the landscape . It is a perfect poem , even as it stands in the outline . A strip of sea , a breaking wave , a rocky island , and on the beach begins a stream , of fairies , diminishing as it curves up into the sky . The last one on the shore seems lingering , and the next one to her draws her upwards . The design when painted would have had the lower part of the picture in the shadow of night , and the coming morn in the sky , the light of which should be caught on the distant figures up among the clouds . " Titania 's Court* ' is in a moonlighted space in the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coining out of the depths of the wood and off its rocky heights , hand in hand , - a flow of graceful figures . On the right side of the picture sits Titania , served by her Indian page , who kneels before her , holding an acorn-cup . This page is delicately differenced from the fairies by his straight hair , his features , Asiatic , though handsome , his girdle and bracelets of pearls , and a short striped skirt about his loins . The fairies all have flowing drapery or none , and features regular as Greeks . Two little figures in the air above Titania 's head are fanning her with butterflies ' wings others are bringing water in shells and flower-cups ; others playing on musical instruments . This is better than most pictures of this often-painted subject , because in it fancy does not override imagination , but helps and serves it . Another design was in chalk , on a dark canvas , of a ship at sea in a squall . This is wonderfully imitated in the engraving , - even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the waves in a rolling sea were never better caught in all their subtle force . The clouds have great suggestions .. There is a figure of " The Prodigal Son , " from a pencil drawing ; and a " Prometheus , " also from a pencil sketch . Allston seemed equally *t home in drawing powerful figures in action , or delicate dreamy figures in repose . He had the true imaginative power which realizes and understand* all natural forms . We have thus given a few words of description to some of these remarkable pictures . We do not hope to convey any idea of them to those who have not seen them , for a picture is by its very nature incapable of being described in words . That which makes it a picture takes it out of the sphere of words . Neither do we attempt to analyze the genius of this great painter . We can enumerate some of his artistic qualities his power in color , so creative ; the still , reposeful spirit of his creations , reminding one of Beato Angelico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and above all , that greatest crowning merit , that his works are , almost without exception , vitalized by an imaginative force which makes them living presences . Such effects are not produced by talent , however great , by culture , however perfect , but by a mind which is a law to itself , - in other words , a genius . Such , and nothing less , was Washington Allston.
