Main text FOR THREE MALES . ( The Drunkard , TOM , must be dressed rather shabbily , and his nose must be reddened ; JOHN , as a respectable working-man , and LOVE-DROP , with a cigar . ) JOHN .  --  Well , Tom , how are you ? I have not seen you for a long time . TOM .  --  I am not very well . JOHN .  --  What is the matter with you ? TOM .  --  Why , I do n't exactly know . I feel very weak and languid , as well as thirsty and miserable . I suppose I must go and get another pint or two to set me all right . JOHN .  --  A pint or two of what ? TOM .  --  Of the very best beer . JOHN .  --  Can you tell me what your beer is made of ? TOM .  --  No . JOHN .  --  Water , treacle , poison , and a little putrefied vegetable matter . TOM .  --  I do n't care ; it 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before . JOHN .  --  How much did you take ? TOM .  --  About half a dozen pints , more or less . JOHN .  --  That must be a very queer way of taking medicine ; six pints in a day ! But please tell me how you felt after this large dose . TOM .  --  I felt as if everything was upside down , myself included ; and every now and then the ground would seem to jump up and hit me on the head . I felt as if I could fight anybody , and was very proud of trying to walk both sides of the path at once . JOHN .  --  Your medicine operated very curiously ; but did it cure you ? TOM .  --  Yes , that it did for the time . JOHN .  --  But how did you feel the next morning ? TOM .  --  This is the next morning , and it was only last night I tried the experiment , and I have already told you how I feel ; but I omitted to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose to-day , because I am very light in three places . JOHN .  --  Where are they ? TOM .  --  My stomach , my head , and my pocket . JOHN .  --  So , after you have tried your miraculous medicine , you find the effects are , firstly .  --  it removed your malady for the time , only for it to return with increased violence ; secondly .  --  it rendered you incapable of governing yourself ; in plain terms , you were drunk ; thirdly  --  it created a desire to return again to the so-called medicine ; fourthly  --  it made you light in the three places you have mentioned . Now I want to have a word with you about this drink . You were at one time fond of argument . TOM .  --  Well , talk away then , only do n't be long over it , for I am as thirsty as a herring . JOHN .  --  You do n't seem to care much about the matter ; but first ask me some question , for I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Did not Solomon say a pint of beer was a good thing for a working-man ? JOHN .  --  No . TOM .  --  Then did n't somebody tell Timothy to take a drop of gin for his stomach 's sake ? JOHN .  --  Not exactly that either ; but is there anything the matter with your stomach ? TOM .  --  It 's rather empty , that 's all . JOHN .  --  Then what do you think is the best thing to fill it with ? TOM .  --  Why , some beer , to be sure . JOHN .  --  Can you tell me what becomes of the beer after you have drank it ? TOM .  --  It fills up my stomach , and answers the purpose of a good dinner . JOHN .  --  How much do you think your stomach is capable of holding ? TOM .  --  I have read in some books , when I was young , about two pints . JOHN .  --  Then what a foolish man you must be , to try and get six pints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that before . JOHN .  --  Do you not see that a pound of bread would usefully fill your stomach , while the injurious beer is immediately absorbed into your system ? TOM .  --  It 's of no use talking to you ; you 've been better educated than I have ; but when I have been to the Half Moon and got primed , I will come back and talk to you . But in the mean time , here is Mr. Lovedrop  --  he will soon settle you . ( Exit . ) ( Enter LOVEDROP . ) LOVEDROP.  --  Well , friend John , how are , you ? JOHN .  --  In the very best of health . How are you ? LOVEDROP.  --  Oh , pretty well , except a light bilious headache ; but say , I have heard you are a teetotaler ! JOHN .  --  I am a teetotaler , and I am proud of it . LOVEDROP.  --  The more fool you to join such a set of enthusiasts ; you may as well condemn the whole system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . JOHN .  --  All great men were enthusiasts in the particular branch of science or art that they excelled in Newton , Hunter , Davy , and others . The proper meaning of the word is " man in earnest . " The case you state about navigation does not apply to the subject ; drinking intoxicating drinks is not necessary , may be done without altogether , and their use is highly dangerous to the community ; while navigation is both necessary and useful . LOVEDROP.  --  I contend that the little drop I take does me no harm . JOHN .  --  Define your term ; how much is a little drop ? LOVEDROP.  --  Three glasses in a day . JOHN .  --  That would amount to above one thousand glasses a year ; rather a large drop . LOVEDROP.  --  Did not Christ make wine at the marriage feast in Cana ? JOHN .  --  Yes ; but you can not prove that it was intoxicating wine ; on the contrary , we have evidence to prove that it was not so . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little boy was making a speech , and occasionally quoted texts of Scripture , when a crusty old bachelor got up and inquired sneeringly of the boy , if Christ did not make wine at the marriage-feast ; the boy replied that he was too young and the gentleman was too old , as well as too ugly , to get married ; that if they only drank wine at their marriage-feasts , there would not be much danger of their ever becoming sots . LOVEDROP.  --  Did not Noah get drunk ? JOHN .  --  And do you believe he was any the better for it ? on the contrary , he was much the worse , and if a wise and good man like Noah could not withstand the temptation , how much more likely are you to be borne down before it ? LOVEDROP.  --  There is no danger of my falling into the temptation . JOHN .  --  Yes there is , a very great danger ; do you know a single drunkard who at one time had the remotest idea of ever becoming what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate with drunkards , which is not the case . I drink in moderation , because it helps to support the government , you see . JOHN .  --  It must be a poor government which can not get along without that drink which causes such crime , poverty , and wretchedness as is everywhere visible . Both government and society lose by it in the end , for if the sale of strong drinks were utterly and forever prohibited by law , three-fourths of the jails and work-houses would perish with them . LOVEDROP. - But what would become of the distillers and saloon proprietors ? JOHN .  --  What do they deserve to be done with , who sell out that liquid curse which destroys sixty thousand men in a year ? LOVEDROP.  --  But they are respectable members of society , and must be done something with . JOHN .  --  Let them turn farmers and cultivate the ground , and learn to use its products to a better purpose than to make drinks which proves the curse of the country . LOVEDROP.  --  The teetotalers do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine Law , and prohibit the sale ; they ought to try to get individuals to give up , and in time the whole community would become moderate . JOHN .  --  Why do n't you join us then , and show us a more excellent way , instead of swelling the ranks of the enemy ? Your argument would apply with equal force to the law against stealing and other vices . LOVEDROP.  --  When I get into company they will have me drink , and besides I like it and it seems to do me good ; I ca n't give it up . JOHN .  --  Ca n't ! You ought to be ashamed to say so . I have given it up , and if you ca n't I am a better man than you . As to the drink seeming to do you good , your bilious headache is a case in point . Half the ills that flesh is heir to may be traced , directly or indirectly , to the use and abuse of stimulants . LOVEDROP.  --  Why , my dear sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases ? JOHN .  --  Very few cases indeed can be cited where it does good . You know that the medical profession is now rapidly discarding its use as a medicinal agent ; and as a beverage it is now pronounced hurtful , debilitating and full of misery in the future to every man who imbibes the accursed thirst for ardent spirits . LOVEDROP.  --  I will think upon what you have said , but I am afraid it 's no use at my time of life . JOHN .  --  It 's never too late to mend ; but I see you are like many other moderates ; your judgment says , abstain , but your palate says , I like a little drop . LOVEDROP.  --  Well , I ca n't stop any longer , so good-bye . JOHN .  --  Good-bye ; but think of what I have told you , and attend our meetings .
