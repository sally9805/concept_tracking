RECOLLECTIONS OF A GIFTED WOMAN . FROM Leamington to Stratford-onAvon the distance is eight or nine miles , over a road that seemed to me most beautiful . Not that I can recall any memorable peculiarities ; for the country , most of the way , is a succession of the gentlest swells and subsidences , affording wide and far glimpses of champaign-scenery here and there , and sinking almost to a dead level as we draw near Stratford . Any landscape in New England , even the tamest , has a more striking outline , and besides would have its blue eyes open in those lakelets that we encounter almost from mile to mile at home , but of which the Old Country is utterly destitute ; or it would smile in our faces through the medium of those way-side brooks that vanish under a low stone arch on one side of the road , and sparkle out again on the other . Neither of these pretty features is often to be found in an English scene . The charm of the latter consists in the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully kept plantations of wood , and in the old and high cultivation that has humanized the very sods by mingling so much of man 's toil and care among them . To an American there is a kind of sanctity even in an English turnip-field , when he thinks how long that small square of ground has been known and recognized as a possession , transmitted from father to son , trodden often by memorable feet , and utterly redeemed from savagery by old acquaintanceship with civilized eyes . The wildest things in England are more than half tame . The trees , for instance , whether in hedgerow , park , or what they call forest , have nothin0 wild about them . They are never ragged ; there is a certain decorous restraint in the freest outspread of their branches , though they spread wider than any self - nurturing tree ; they are tall , vigorous , bulky , with a look of age-long life , and a promise of more years to come , all of which will bring them into closer kindred with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sapling upward ; and if they endure long enough , they grow to be traditionally observed and honored , and connected with the fortunes of old families , till , like Tennyson 's Talking Oak , they babble with a thousand leafy tongues to ears that can understand them . An American tree , however , if it could grow in fair competition with an English one of similar species , would probably be the more picturesque object of the two . The Warwickshire elm has not so beautiful a shape as those that overhang our village-street ; and as for the redoubtable English oak , there is a certain Joha-Bullism in its figure , a compact rotundity of foliage , a lack of irregular and various outline , that make it look wonderfully like a gigantic cauliflower . Its leaf , too , is much smaller than that of most varieties of American oak ; nor do I mean to doubt that the latter , with free leave to grow , reverent care and cultivation , and immunity from the axe , would live out its centuries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobler and more majestic specimen of a tree at the end of them . Still , however one 's Yankee patriotism may struggle against the admission , it must be owned that the trees and other objects of an English landscape take hold of the observer by numberless minute tendrils , as it were , which , look as closely as we choose , we never find in an American scene . The parasitic growth is so luxuriant , that the trunk of the tree , so gray and dry in our climate , is better worth observing than the boughs and foliage ; a verdant mossiness coats it all over , so that it looks almost as green as the leaves ; and often , moreover , the stately stem // is clustered about , high upward , with creeping and twining shrubs , the ivy , and sometimes the mistletoe , close-clinging friends , nurtured by the moisture and never too fervid sunshine , and supporting themselves by the old tree 's abundant strength . We call it a parasitical vegetation ; but , if the phrase imply any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful affection and relationship which exist in England between one order of plants and another : the strong tree being always ready to give support to the trailing shrub , lift it to the sun , and feed it out of its own heart , if it crave such food ; and the shrub , on its part , repaying its foster-father with an ample luxuriance of beauty , and adding Corinthian grace to the tree 's lofty strength . No bitter win- ter nips these tender little sympathies , no hot sun burns the life out of them ; and therefore they outlast the longevity of the oak , and , if the woodman permitted , would bury it in a green grave , when all is over . Should there be nothing else along the road to look at , an English hedge might well suffice to occupy the eyes , and , to a depth beyond what he would suppose , the heart of an American . We often set out hedges in our own soil , but might as well set out figs or pineapples and expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , which we choose to call a hedge ; but it lacks the dense , luxuriant variety of vegetation that is accumulated into the English original , in which a botanist would find a thousand shrubs and gracious herbs that the hedge - maker never thought of planting there . Among them , growing wild , are many of the kindred blossoms of the very flowers which our pilgrim fathers brought from England , for the sake of their simple beauty and home-like associations , and which we have ever since been cultivating in gardens . There is not a softer trait to be found in the character of those stern men than that they should have been sensible of these flower-roots clinging among the fibres of their rugged hearts , and have felt the necessity of bringing them over sea and making them hereditary in the new land , instead of trusting to what rarer beauty the wilderness might have in store for them . Or , if the road-side has no hedge , the ugliest stone fence ( such as , in America , would keep itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to be covered with the small handiwork of Nature ; that careful mother lets nothing go naked there , and , if she can not provide clothing , gives at least embroidery . No sooner is the fence built than she adopts and adorns it as a part of her original plan , treating the hard , uncomely construction as if it had all along been a favorite idea of her own . A little sprig of ivy may be seen creeping up the side of the low wall and clinging fast with its many feet to the rough surface ; a tuft of grass roots itself between two of the stones , where a pinch or two of way - side dust has been moistened into nutritious soil for it ; a small bunch of fern grows in another crevice ; a deep , soft , verdant moss spreads itself along the top and over all the available inequalities of the fence ; and where nothing else will grow , lichens stick tenaciously to the bare stones and variegate the monotonous gray with hues of yellow and red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the stone wall , and takes away the hardness of its outline ; and in due time , as the upshot of these apparently aimless or sportive touches , we recognize that the beneficent Creator of all things , working through His handmaiden whom we call Nat'ure , has deigned to mingle a charm of divine gracefulness even with so earthly an institution as a boundaryfence . The clown who wrought at it little dreamed what fellow-laborer he had . The English should send us photographs of portions of the trunks of trees , the tangled and various products of a hedge , and a square foot of an old wall . // They can hardly send anything else so characteristic . Their artists , especially of the later school , sometimes toil to depict such subjects , but are apt to stiffen the lithe tendrils in the process . The poets succeed better , with Tennyson at their head , and often produce ravishing effects by dint of a tender minuteness of touch , to which the genius of the soil and climate artfully impels them : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many countries than the best that England can show ; but , for the picturesqueness of the smallest object that lies under its gentle gloom and sunshine , there is no scenery like it anywhere . In the foregoing paragraphs I have strayed away to a long distance from the road to Stratford-on-Avon ; for I remember no such stone fences as I have been speaking of in Warwickshire , nor elsewhere in England , except among the Lakes , or in Yorkshire , and the rough and hilly countries to the north of it . Hedges there were along my road , however , and broad , level fields , rustic hamlets , and cottages of ancient date ,  --  from the roof of one of which the occupant was tearing a way the thatch , and showing what an accumulation of dust , dirt , mouldiness , roots of weeds , families of mice , swallows ' nests , and hordes of insects , had been deposited there since that old straw was new . Estimating jt5 antiquity from these tokens , Shakspeare himself in one of his morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thatch laid on ; at all events , the cottage - walls were old enough to have known him as a guest . A few modern villas were also to be seen , and perhaps there were mansions of old gentility at no great distance , but hidden among trees ; for it is a point of English pride that such houses seldom allow themselves to be visible from the high-road . In short , I recollect nothing specially remarkable along the way , nor in the immediate approach to Stratford ; and yet the picture of that June morning has a glory in my memory , owing chiefly , I believe , to the charm of the English summer - weather , the really good days of which are the most delightful that mortal man can ever hope to be favored with . Such a genial warmth ! A little too warm , it might be , yet only to such a degree as to assure an American ( a certainty to which he seldom attains till attempered to the customary austerity of an English summer-day ) that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an unconquerable freshness in the atmosphere , which every little movement of a breeze shook over me like a dash of the ocean - spray . Such days need bring us no other happiness than their own light and temperature . No doubt , I could not have enjoyed it so exquisitely , exiept that there must be still latent in us Western wanderers ( even after an absence of two centuries and more ) an adaptation to the English climate which makes us sensible of a motherly kindness in its scantiest sunshine , and overflows us with delight at its more lavish smiles . The spire of Shakspeare 's church - the Church of the holy Trinity - begins to show itself among the trees at a little distance from Stratford . Next we see the shabby old dwellings , intermixed with mean-looking houses of modern date , and the streets being quite level , you are struck and surprised by nothing so much as the tameness of the general scene ; as if Shakspeare 's genius were vivid enough to have wrought pictorial splendors in the town where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queer edifice meets your eye , endowed with the individuality that belongs only to the domestic architecture of times gone by ; the house seems to have grown out of some odd quality in its inhabitant , as a seashell is moulded from within by the character of its inmate ; and having been built in a strange fashion , generations ago , it has ever since been growing stranger and quainter , as old humorists are apt to do . Here , too , ( as // so often impressed me in decayed English towns , ) there appeared to be a greater abundance of aged people wearing small-clothes and leaning on sticks than you could assemble on our side of the water by sounding a trumpet and proclaiming a reward for the most venerable . I tried to account for this phenomenon by several theories : as , for example , that our new towns are unwholesome for age and kill it off unseasonably ; or that our old men have a subtile sense of fitness , and die of their own accord rather than live in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , after all , that hair-dyes , false teeth , modern arts of dress , and other contrivances of a skin-deep youthfulness , have not crept into these antiquated English towns , and so people grow old without the weary necessity of seeming younger than they are . After wandering through two or three streets , I found my way to Shakspeare 's birthplace , which is almost a smaller and humbler house than any description can prepare the visitor to expect ; so inevitably does an august inhabitant make his abode palatial to our imaginations , receiving his guests , indeed , in a castle in the air , until we unwisely insist on meeting him among the sordid lanes and alleys of lower earth . The portion of the edifice with which Shakspeare had anything to do is hardly large enough , in the basement , to contain the butcher 's stall that one of his descendants kept , and that still remains there , windowless , with the cleavercuts in its hacked counter , which projects into the street under a little penthouse-roof , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door was open , and , on my rapping at it , a young person in black made her appearance and admitted me : she was not a menial , but remarkably genteel ( an American characteristic ) for an English girl , and was probably the daughter of the old gentlewoman who takes care of the house . This lower room has a pavement of gray slabs of stone , which may have been rudely squared when the house was new , but are now all cracked , broken , and disarranged in a most unaccountable way . One does not see how any ordinary usage , for whatever length of time , should have so smashed these heavy stones ; it is as if an earthquake had burst up through the floor , which afterwards had been imperfectly trodden down again . The room is whitewashed and very clean , but wofully shabby and dingy , coarsely built , and such as the most poetical imagination would find it difficult to idealize . In the rear of this apartment is the kitchen , a still smaller room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rough fireplace , with space for a large family under the blackened opening of the chimney , and an immense passage - way for the smoke , through which Shakspeare may have seen tbe blue sky by day and tbe stars glimmering down at him by night . It is now a dreary spot where the longextinguished embers used to be . A glowing fire , even if it covered only a quarter part of the hearth , might still do much towards making the old kitchen cheerful ; but we get a depressing idea of the stifled , poor , sombre kind of life that could have been lived in such a dwelling , where this room seems to have been the gathering-place of the family , with no breadth or scope , no good retirement , but old and young huddling together cheek byjowl . What a hardy plant was Shakspeare 's genius , how fatal its development , since it could not be blighted in such an atmosphere ! It only brought human nature the closer to him , and put more unctuous earth about his roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Shakspeare is supposed to have been born ; though , if you peep too curiously into the matter , you may find the shadow of an u*ly doubt on this , as well as most other points of , his mysterious life . It is the chamber over the butcher 's shop , and // is lighted by one broad window containing a great many small , irregular panes of glass . The floor is made of planks , very rudely hewn , and fitting together with little neatness ; the naked beams and rafters , at the sides of the room and overhead , bear the original marks of the builder 's broad-axe , with no evidence of an attempt to smooth off the job . Again we have to reconcile ourselves to the smallness of the space inclosed by these illustrious walls , - a circumstance more difficult to accept , as regards places that we have heard , read , thought , and dreamed much about , than any other disenchanting particular of a mistaken ideal . A few paces - perhaps seven or eight - take us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that I could easily touch the ceiling , and might have done so without a tiptoe-stretch , had it been a good deal higher ; and this humility of the chamber has tempted a vast multitude of people to write their names overhead in pencil . Every inch of the sidewalls , even into the obscurest nooks and corners , is covered with a similar record ; all the window - panes , moreover , are scrawled with diamoiid-signatures , among which is said to be that of Walter Scott ; but so many persons have sought to immortalize themselves in close vicinity to his name that I really could not trace him out . Methinks it is strange that people do not strive to forget their forlorn little identities , in such situations , instead of thrusting them forward into the dazzle of a great renown , where , if noticed , they can not but be deemed impertinent . This room , and the entire house , so far as I saw it , are whitewashed and exceedingly clean ; nor is there the aged , musty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which goes far to cure an American of his excessive predilection for antique residences . An old lady , who took charge of me up-stairs , had the manners and aspect of a gentlewoman , and talked with somewhat formidable knowledge and appreciative intelligence about Shakspeare . Arranged on a table and in chairs were various prints , views of houses and scenes connected with Shakspeare 's memory , together with editions of his works and local publications about his home and haunts , from the sale of which this respectable lady perhaps realizes a handsome profit . At any rate , I bought a good many of them , conceiving that it might be the civillest way of requiting her for her instructive conversation and the trouble she took in showing me the house . It cost me a pang ( not a curmudgeonly , but a gentlemanly one ) to offer a downright fee to the lady-like girl who had admitted me ; but I swallowed my delicate scruples with some little difficulty , and she digested hers , so far as I could observe , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold out half a crown to any person with whom he has occasion to speak a word in England . I should consider it unfair to quit Shakspeare 's house without the frank acknowledgment that I was conscious of not the slightest emotion while viewing it , nor any quickening of the imagination . This has often happened to me in my visits to memorable places . Whatever pretty and apposite reflections I may have made upon the subject had either occurred to me before I ever saw Stratford , or have been elaborated since . It is pleasant , nevertheless , to think that I have seen the place ; and I believe that I can form a more sensible and vivid idea of Shakspeare as a flesh-andblood individual now that I have stood on the kitchen-hearth and in the birthchamber ; but I am not quite certain that this power of realization is altogether desirable in reference to a great poet . The Shakspeare whom I met there took various guises , but had not his laurel on . He was successively the roguish boy , - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too familiar friend of Davenant 's mother ,  --  the careful , thrifty , thriven man of property , who came back from London to // lend money on bond , and occupy the best house in Stratford , - the mellow , red - nosed , autumnal boon - companion of John a ' Coinbe , who ( or else the Stratford gossips belied bim ) met his death by tumbling into a ditch on his way home from a drinking - bout , and left his second-best bed to his poor wife . I feel , as sensibly as the reader can , what horrible impiety it is to remember these things , be they true or false . In either case , they ought to vanish out of sight on the distant ocean-line of the past , leaving a pure , white memory , even as a sail , though perhaps darkened with many stains , looks snowy white on the far horizon . But I draw a moral from these unworthy reminiscences and this embodiment of the poet , as suggested by some of the grimy actualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world not to insist upon finding out that its greatest men are , in a certain lower sense , very much the same kind of men as the rest of us , and often a little worse ; because a common mind can not properly digest such a discovery , nor ever know the true proportion of the great man 's good and evil , nor how small a part of him it was that touched our muddy or dusty earth . Thence comes moral bewilderment , and even intellectual loss , in regard to what is best of him . When Shakspeare invoked a curse on the man who should stir his bones , he perhaps meant the larger share of it for him or them who should pry into his perishing earthliness , the defects or even the merits of the character that he wore in Stratford , when he had left mankind so much to muse upon that was imperishable and divine . Heaven keep me from incurring any part of the anathema in requital for the irreverent sentences above written ! From Shakspeare 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit his burialplace . The appearance of the church is most venerable and beautiful , standing amid a great green shadow of limetrees , above which rises the spire , while the Gothic battlements and buttresses and vast arched windows are obscurely seen through the boughs . The Avon loiters past the church-yard , an exceedingly sluggish river , which might seem to have been considering which way it should flow ever since Shakspeare left off paddling in it and gathering the large forget-me-nots that grow among it flags and water-weeds . An old man in small-clothes was waiting at the gate ; and inquiring whether I wished to go in , he preceded me to the church-porch , and rapped . I could have done it quite as effectually for myself ; but , it seems , the old people of the neighborhood haunt about the church-yard , in spite of the frowns and remonstrances of the sexton , who grudges them the half-eleemosynary sixpence which they sometimes get from visitors . I was admitted into the church by a respectable-looking and intelligent man in black , the parish- clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his vicar , if all the fees which he handles remain in bis own pocket . lie was already exhibiting the Shakspeare monuments to two or three visitors , and several other parties came in while I was there . The poet and his family are in possession of what may be considered the very best burial-places that the church affords . They lie in a row , right across the breadth of the chancel , the foot of each gravestone being close to the elevated floor on which the altar stands . Nearest to the side-wall , beneath Shakspeare 's bust , is a slab bearing a Latin inscription addressed to his wife , and covering her remains ; then his own slab , with the old anathematizing stanza upon it ; then that of Thomas Nash , who married his grand-daughter ; then that of Dr. Hall , the husband of his daughter Susannab ; and , lastly , Susannah 's own . Shakspeare 's is the commonest-looking slab of all , being just such a flag-stone as Essex Street in Salem used to be paved with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes or // 49 recollection deceive me , there is a crack across it , as if it had already undergone some such violence as the inscription deprecates . Unlike the other monuments of the family , it bears no name , nor am I acquainted with the grounds or authority on which it is absolutely determined to be Shakspeare 's ; although , being in a range with those of his wife and children , it might naturally be attributed to him . But , then , why does his wife , who died afterwards , take precedence of him and occupy the place next his bust ? And where are the graves of another daughter and a son , who have a better right in the family-row than Thomas Nash , his grandson-in-law ? Might not one or both of them have been laid under the nameless stone ? But it is dangerous trifling with Shakspeare 's dust ; so I forbear to meddle further with the grave , ( though the prohibition makes it tempting , ) and shall let whatever bones be in it rest in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bust seems to imply that Shakspeare 's grave was directly underneath it . The poet 's bust is affixed to the northern wall of the church , the base of it being about a man 's hei*ht , or rather more , above the floor of the chancel . The features of this piece of sculpture are entirely unlike any portrait of Shakspeare that I have ever seen , and compel me to take down the beautiful , lofty-browed , and noble picture of him which has hitherto hung in my mental portrait-gallery . The bust can not be said to represent a beautiful face or an eminently noble head ; but it clutches firmly hold of one 's sense of reality and insists upon your accepting it , if not as Shakspeare the poet , yet as the wealthy burgher of Stratford , the friend of John a ' Combe , who lies yonder in the corner . I know not what the phrenologists say to the bust . The forehead is but moderately developed , and retreats somewhat , the upper part of the skull rising pyramidally ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow ; the upper lip is so long that it must have been almost a deformity , unless the sculptor artistically exag*erated its length , in consideration , that , on the pedestal , it must be foreshortened by being looked at from below . Ga the whole , Shakspeare must have had a singular rather than a prepossessing face ; and it is wonderful how , with this bust before its eyes , the world has persisted in maintaining an erroneous notion of his appearance , allowing painters and sculptors to foist their idealized nonsense on us all , instead of the genuine man . For my part , the Shakspeare of my mind 's eye is henceforth to be a personage of a ruddy En*jish complexion , with a reasonably capacious brow , intelligent and quickly observant eyes , a nose curved slightly outward , a long , queer upper-lip , with the mouth a little unclosed beneath it , and cheeks considerably developed in the lower part and beneath the chin . But when Shakspeare was himself , ( for nine-tenths of the time , according to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) he doubtless shone through this dull mask and transfigured it into the face of an angel . Fifteen or twenty feet behind the row of Shakspeare gravestones is the great east-window of the church , now brilliant with stained glass of recent manufacture . On one side of this window , under a sculptured arch of marble , lies a full-length marble figure of John a ' Combe , clad in what I take to be a robe of municipal dignity , and holding its hands devoutly clasped . It is a sturdy English figure , with coarse features , a type of ordinary man whom we smile to see immortalized in the sculpturesque material of poets and heroes ; but the prayerful attitude encourages us to believe that the old usurer may not , after all , have had that grim reception in the other world which Shakspearc 's squib foreboded for him . By-the-by , till I grew somewhat familiar with Warwickshire pronunciation , I never understood that the point // of those ill-natured lines was a pun . " Oho ! ' quoth the Devil , t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my John has come ! " Close to the poet 's bust is a nameless , oblong , cubic tomb , supposed to be that of a clerical dignitary of the fourteenth century . The church has other mural monuments and altar-tombs , one or two of the latter upholding the recumbent figures of knights in armor and their dames , very eminent and worshipful personages in their day , no doubt , but doomed to appear forever intrusive and impertinent within the precincts which Shakspeare has made his own . His renown is tyrannous , and suffers nothing else to be recognized within the scope of its material presence , unless illuminated by some sideray from himself . The clerk informed me that interments no longer take place in any part of the church . And it is better so for methinks a person of delicate individuality , curious about his burial-place , and desirous of six feet of earth for himself alone , could never endure to lie buried near Shakspeare , but would rise up at midnight and grope his way out of the church-door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . I should hardly have dared to add another to the innumerable descriptions of Stratford-on-Avon , if it had not seemed to me that this would form a fitting framework to some reminiscences of a very remarkable woman . Her labor , while she lived , was of a nature and purpose outwardly irreverent to the name of Shakspeare , yet , by its actual tendency , entitling her to the distinction of being that one of all his worshippers who sought , though she knew it not , to place the richest and stateliest diadem upon his brow . We Americans , at least , in the scanty annals of our literature , can not afford to forget her high and conscientious exercise of noble faculties , which , indeed , if you look at the matter in one way , evolved only a miserable error , but , more fairly considered , produced a result worth almost what it cost hey . Her faith in her own ideas was so genuine , that , erroneous as they were , it transmuted them to gold , or , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indestructible substance among the waste material from which it can readily be sifted . The only time I ever saw Miss Bacon was in London , where she had lodgings in Spring Street , Sussex Gardens , at the house of a grocer , a portly , middleaged , civil , and friendly man , who , as well as his wife , appeared to feel a personal kindness towards their lodger . I was ushered up two ( and I rather believe three ) pair of stairs into a parlor somewhat humbly furnished , and told that Miss Bacon would come soon . There were a number of books on the table , and , looking into them , I found that every one had some reference , more or less immediate , to her Shakspearian theory ,  --  a volume of Raleigh 's " History of the World , " a volume of Montaigne , a volume of Lord Bacon 's letters , a volume of Shakspeare 's plays ; and on another table lay a large roll of manuscript , which I presume to have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pocket-Bible among the books , but everything else referred to the one despotic idea that had got possession of her mind ; and as it had engrossed her whole soul as well as her intellect , I have no doubt that she had established subtile connections between it and the Bible likewise . As is apt to be the case with solitary students , Miss Bacon probably read late and rose late ; for I took up Montaigne ( it was Hazlitt 's translation ) and had been reading his journey to Italy a good while before she appeared . I had expected ( the more shame for me , having no other ground of such expect*tion than that she was a literary woman ) to see a very homely , uncouth , elderly personage , and was quite agreeably disappointed by her aspect . She was rather uncommonly tall , and had a // striking and expressive face , dark hair , dark eyes , which shone with an inward light as soon as she began to speak , and by - and - by a color came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INot that she really , was so ; she must have been beyond middle - age : and there was no unkindness in coming to that conclusion , because , making allowance for years and ill-health , I could suppose her to have been handsome and exceedingly attractive once . Though wholly estranged from society , there was little or no restraint or embarrassment in her manner : lonely people are generally glad to give utterance to their pent-up ideas , and often bubble over with them as freely as children with their new-found syllables . I can not tell how it came about , but we immediately found ourselves taking a friendly and familiar tone together , and began to talk as if we had known one another a very long while . A little preliminary correspondence had indeed smoothed the way , and we had a definite topic in the contempli*ed publication of her book . She was very communicative about her theory , and would have been much more so , had I desired it ; but , being conscious within myself of a sturdy unbelief , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out upon the subject . Unquestionably , she was a monomaniac ; these overmastering ideas about the authorship of Shakspeare 's plays , and the deep political philosophy concealed beneath the surface of them , had completely thrown her off her balance ; but at the same time they had wonderfully developed her intellect , and made her what she could not otherwise have become . It was a very singular phenomenon : a system of philosophy growing up in this woman s mind without her volition , - contrary , in fact , to the determined resistance of her volition ,  --  and substituting itself in **he place of everything that originally grew there . To have based such a system on fancy , and unconsciously elaborated it for herself ' ; was almost as wonderful as really to have found it in the plays . But , in a certain sense , she did actually find it there . Shakspeare has surface beneath surface , to an immeasurable depth , adapted to the plummet-line of every reader ; his works present many faces of truth , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek in him you will surely discover , provided you seek truth . There is no exhausting the various interpretation of his symbols ; and a thousand years hence , a world of new readers will possess a whole library of new books , as we ourselves do , in these volumes old already . I had half a mind to suggest to Miss Bacon this explanation of her theory , but forbore , becausc ( as I could readily perceive ) she had as princely a spirit as Queen Elizabcth herself , and would at once have motioned me from the room . I had heard , long ago , that she believed that the material evidences of her dogma as to the authorship , together with the key of the new philosophy , would be found buried in Shakspeare s grave . Recently , as I understood her , this notion had been somewhat modified , and was now accurately defined and fully developed in her mind , with a result of perfect certainty . In Lord Bacon 's letters , on which she laid her finger as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole mystery . There were definite and minute instructions how to find a will and other documents relating to the conclave of Elizabethan philosophers , which were concealed ( when and by whom she did not inform me ) in a hollow space in the under surface of Shakspeare 's gravestone . Thus the terrible prohihition to remove the stone was accounted for . The directions , she intimated , went completely and precisely to the point , obviating all difficulties in the way of coming at the treasure , and even , if I remember right , were so contrived as to ward off any troublesome consequences likely to ensue from the interference of the parish-officers. // All that Miss Bacon now remained in England for - indeed , the object for which she had come hither , and which had kept her here for three years past - was to obtain possession of these material and unquestionable proofs of the authenticity of her theory . She communicated all this strange matter in a low , quiet tone ; while , on my part , I listened as quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faith so settled would have shut her up at once , and that , too , without in the least weakening her belief in the existence of those treasures of the tomb ; and had it been possible to convince her of their intangible nature , I apprehend that there would have been nothing left for the poor enthusiast save to collapse and die . She frankly confessed that she could no longer bear the society of those who did not at least lend a certain sympathy to her views , if not fully share in them ; and meeting little sympathy or none , she had now entirely secluded herself from the world . In all these years , she had seen Mrs. F. a few times , but had long ago given her up , - Carlyle once or twice , but not of late , although he had received her kindly ; Mr. Buchanan , while minister in England , had once called on her , and General Campbell , our consul in London , had met her two or three times on business . With these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible what epochs they were in the monotonous passage of her days , she had lived in the profoundest solitude . She never walked out ; she suffered much from ill-health ; and yet , she assured me , she was perfectly happy . I could well conceive it ; for Miss Bacon imagined herself to have received ( what is certainly the greatest boon ever assigned to mortals ) a high mission in the world , with adequate powers for its accomplishment ; and lest evcn these should prove insufficient , she had faith that special interpositions of Providence were forwarding her human efforts . This idea was continually com ing to the surface , during our interview . She believed , for example , that she had been providentially led to her lodging-house and put in relations with the good-natured grocer and his family ; and , to say the tr4h , considering what a savage and stealthy tribe the London lodging-house keepers actually are , the honest kindness of this man and his household appeared to have been little less than miraculous . Evidently , too , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with literature- at the critical juncture when she needed a negotiator with the booksellers ; and , on my part , though little accustomed to regard myself as a divine minister , and though I might even have preferred that Providence should select some other instrument , I had no scruple in undertaking to do what I could for her . Her book , as I could see by turning it over , was a very remarkable one , and worthy of being offered to the public , which , if wise enough to appreciate it , would be thankful for what was good*n it and merciful to its faults . It was founded on a prodigious error , but was built up from that foundation with a good many prO ( ligiOus truths . And , at all events , whether I could aid her literary views or no , it would have been both rash and impertinent in me to attempt drawing poor Miss Bacon out of her delusions , which were the condition on which she lived in comfort and joy , and in the exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she pleased about the treasures of Shakspeare 's tombstone , and to form whatever designs might seem good to herself for obtaining possession of them . I was sensible of a lady-like feeling of propriety in Miss Bacon , and a New-England orderliness in her character , and , in spite of her bewilderment , a sturdy common-sense , which I trusted would begin to operate at the right time , and keep her from any actual extravagance . And as regarded this matter of the tombstone , so it proved . // The interview lasted above an hour , during which she flowed out freely , as to the sole auditor , capable of any degree of intelligent sympathy , whom she had met with in a very long while . Her conversation was remarkably suggestive , alluring forth one 's own ideas and fantasies from the shy places where they usually haunt . She was indeed an admirable talker , considering how long she had held her tongue for lack of a listener , - pleasant , sunny and shadowy , often piquant , and giving glimpses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humors ; and beneath them all there ran a deep and powerful under-current of earnestness , which did not fail to produce in the listener 's mind something like a temporary faith in what she herself believed so fervently . But the streets of London are not favorable to enthusiasms of this kind , nor , in fact , are they likely to flourish anywhere in the English atmosphere ; so that , long before reaching Paternoster Row , I felt that it would be a difficult and doubtful matter to advocate the publication of Miss Bacon 's book . Nevertheless , it did finally get published . Months before that happened , however , Miss Bacon had taken up her residence at Stratford - on - Avon , drawn thither by the magnetism of those rich secrets Which she supposed to have been hidden by Raleigh , or Bacon , or I know not whom , in Shakspeare 's grave , and protected there by a curse , as pirates used to bury their gold in the guardianship of a fiend . She took a humble lodging and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not condescend to any stratagem or underhand attempt to violate the grave , which , had she been capable of admitting such an idea , might possibly have been accomplished by the aid of a resurrectionman . As her first step , she made acquaintance with the clerk , and began to sound him as to the feasibility of her enterprise and his own willingness to engage in it . The clerk apparently ustened with not unfavorable ears ; but , as his situation ( which the fees of pilgrims , more numerous than at any Catholic shrine , render lucrative ) would have been forfeited by any malfeasance in office , he stipulated for liberty to consult the vicar . Miss Bacon requested to tell her own story to the reverend gentleman , and seems to have been received by him with the utmost kindness , and even to have succeeded in making a certain impression on his mind as to the desirability of the search . As their interview had been under the seal of secrecy , he asked permission to consult a friend , who , as Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law . What the legal friend advised she did not learn ; but the negotiation continued , and certainly was never broken off by an absolute refusal on the vicar 's part . He , perhaps , was kindly temporizing with our poor countrywoman , whom an Englishman of ordinary mould would have sent to a lunatic-asylum at once . I can not help fancying , however , that her familiarity with the events of Shakspeare 's life , and of his death and burial , ( of which she would speak as if she had been present at the edge of the grave , ) and all the history , literature , and personalities of the Elizabethan age , together with the prevailing power of her own belieg and the eloquence with which she knew how to enforce it , had really gone some little way towards making a convert of the good clergyman . II ' so , I honor him above all the hierarchy of England . The affair certainly looked very hopeful . However erroneously , Miss Bacon had understood from the vicar that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself would sanction it with his presence . It was to take place after nightfall ; and all preliminary arrangements being made , the vicar and clerk professed to wait only her word in order to set about lifting the awful stone from the sepulchre . So , at least , Miss Bacon believed ; and as her bewilderment was // entirely in her own thoughts , and never disturbed her perception or accurate remembrance of external things , I see no reason to doubt it , except it be the tinge of absurdity in the fact . But , in this apparently prosperous state of things , her own convictions began to falter . A doubt stole into her mind whether she might not have mistaken the depository and mode of concealment of those historic treasures ; and after once admitting the doubt , she was afraid to hazard the shock of uplifting the stone and finding nothing . She examined the surface of the gravestone , and , endeavored , without stirring it , to estimate whether it were of such thickness as to be capable of containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anew the proofs , the clues , the enigmas , the pregnant sentences , which she had discovered in Bacon 's letters and elsewhere , and now was frightened to perceive that they did not point so definitely to Shakspeare 's tomb as she had heretofore supposed . There was an unmistakably distinct reference to a tomb , hut it might be Bacon 's , or Raleigh 's , or Spenser 's ; and instead of the " Old Player , " as she profanely called him , it might be either of those three illustrious dead , poet , warrior , or statesman , whose ashes , in Westminster Abbey , or the Tower burial-ground , or wherever they sleep , it was her mission to disturb . But she continued to hover around the church , and seems to have had full freedom of entrance in the daytime , and special license , on one occasion at least , at a late hour of the night . She went thither with a dark-lantern , which could but twinkle like a glow-worm through the volume of obscurity that filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towards the chancel , she sat down on the elevated part of the pavement above Shakspeare 's grave . If the divine poet really wrote the inscription there , and cared as much about the quiet of his bones as its deprecatory earnestness would im-4 ply , it was time for those crumbling relics to bestir themselves under her sacrilegious feet . But they were safe . She made no attempt to disturb them ; though , I believe , she looked narrowly into the crevices between Shakspeare ' s and the two adjacent stones , and in some way satisfied herself that her single strength would suffice to lift the former , in case of need . She threw the feeble ray of her lantern up towards the bust , but could not make it visible beneath the darkness of the vaulted roof . Had she been subject to superstitious terrors , it is impossible to conceive of a situation that could better entitle her to feel them , for , if Shakspeare 's ghost would rise at any provocation , it must have shown itself then ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure had appeared within the scope of her dark-lantern , in his slashed doublet and gown , and with his eyes bent on her beneath the high , bald forehead , just as we see him in the bust , she would have met him fearlessly , and controverted his claims to the authorship of the plays , to his very face . She had taught herself to contemn " Lord Leicester 's groom " ( it was one of her disdainful epithets for the world 's incomparable poet ) so thoroughly , that even his disembodied spirit would hardly have found civil treatment at Miss Bacon 's hands . Her vigil , though it appears to have had no definite object , continued far into the night . Several times she heard a low movement in the aisles : a stealthy , dubious foot-fall prowling about in the darkness , now here , now there , among the pillars and ancient tombs , as if some restless inhabitant of the latter had crept forth to peep at the intruder . By-and-by the clerk made his appearance , and confessed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . About this time it was that a strange sort of weariness seems to have fallen upon her : her toil was all but done , her great purpose , as she believed , on the very point of accomplishment , when // she began to regret that so stupendous a mission had been imposed on the fragility of a woman . Her faith in the new philosophy was as mighty as ever , and so was her confidence in her own adequate development of it , now about to be given to the world ; yet she wished , or fancied so , that it might never have been her duty to achieve this unparalleled task , and to stagger feebly forward under her immense burden of responsibility and renown . So far as her personal concern in the matter went , she would gladly have forfeited the reward of her patient study and labor for so many years , her exile from her country and estrangement from her family and friends , her sacrifice of health and all other interests to this one pursuit , if she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . She liked the old slumberous town , and awarded the only praise that ever I knew her to bestow on Shakspeare , the individual man , by acknowledging that his taste in a residence was good , and that he knew how to choose a suitable retirement for a person of shy , but genial temperament . And at this point , I cease to possess the means of tracing her vicissitudes of feeling any farther . In consequence of some advice which I fancied it m* duty to tender , as being the only confidant whom she now had in the world , I fell under Miss Bacon 's most severe and passionate displeasure , and was cast off by her in the twinkling of an eye . It was a misfortune to which her friends were always particularly liable ; but I think that none of them ever loved , or even respected , her most ingenuous and noble , but likewise most sensitive and tumultuous character , the less for it . At that time her book was passing through the press . Without prejudice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon was wholly unfit to prepare her own work for publication , because , among many other reasons , she was too thoroughly in earnest to know what to leave out . Every leaf and line was sacred , for all had been written under so deep a conviction of truth as to assume , in her eyes , the aspect of inspiration . A practised book-maker , with entire control of her materials , would have shaped out a duodecimo volume full of eloquent and ingenious dissertation , - criticisms which quite take the color and pungency out of other people 's critical remarks on Shakspeare , - philosophic truths which she imagined herself to have found at the roots of his conceptions , and which certainly come from no inconsiderable depth somewhere* There was a great amount of rubbish , which any competent editor would have shovelled out of the way . But Miss Bacon thrust the whole bulk of inspiration and nonsense into the press in a lump , and there tumbled out a ponderous octavo volume , which fell with a dead thump at the feet of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few persons turned over one or two of the leaves , as it lay there , and essayed to kick the volume deeper into the mud ; for they were the hack critics of the minor periodical press in London , than whom , I suppose , though excellent fellows in their way , there are no gentlemen in the world less sensible of any sanctity in a book , or less likely to r*cognize an author 's heart in it , or more utterly careless about bruising , if they do recognize it . It is their trade . They could not do otherwise . I never thought of blaming them . From the scholars and critics of her own country , indeed , Miss Bacon might have looked for a worthier appreciation , because many of the best of them have higher cultivation and finer and deeper literary sensibilities than all but the very profoundest and brightest of Englishmen . But they are not a courageous body of men ; they dare not think a truth that has an odor of absurdity , lest they should feel themselves bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word in her behalf , Miss Bacon never knew it , nor // did I. Our journalists at once republished some of the most brutal vituperations of the English press , thus pelting their poor countrywoman with stolen mud , without even waiting to know whether the ignominy was deserved . And they never have known it , to this day , nor ever will . The next intelligence that I had of Miss Bacon was by a letter from the mayor of Stratford-on-Avon . He was a medical man , and wrote both in his official and professional character , telling me that an American lady , who had recently published what the mayor called a " Shakspeare book , " was afilicted with insanity . In a lucid interval she had referred to me , as a person who had some knowledge of her family and affairs . What she may have suffered before her intellect gave way , we had better not try to imagine . iNo author had ever hoped so confidently as she ; none ever failed more utter ly . A superstitious fancy might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on her head in requital of even the unaccomplished purpose of disturbing the dust beneath , and that the " Old Player " had kept so quietly in his grave , on the night of her vigil , because he foresaw how soon and terribly he would be avenged . But if that benign spirit takes any care or cogniz*nce of such thing s now , he has surely requited the injustice that she sought to do him - the high justice that she really did - by a tenderness of love and pity of which only he could be capable . What matters it , though she called him by some other name ? He had wrought a greater miracle on her than on all the world besides . This bewildered enthusiast had recognized a depth in the man whom she decried , which scholars , critics , and learned societies , devoted to the elucidation of his unrivalled scenes , had never imagined to exist there . She had paid him the loftiest honor that all these ages of renown have been able to accumulate upon his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of her life-long object , she passed into the better world , I know not why we should hesitate to believe that the immortal poet may have met her on the threshold and led her in , reassuring her with friendly and comfortable words , and thanking her ( yet with a smile of gentle humor in his eyes at the thought of certain mistaken speculations ) for having interpreted him to mankind so well . I believe that it has been the fate of this remarkable book never to have had more than a single reader . I myself am acquainted with it only in insulated chapters and scattered pages and paragraphs . But , since my return to America , a young man of genius and enthusiasm has assured me that he has positively read the book from beginning to end , and is completely a convert to its doctrines . It belongs to him , therefore , and not to me , - whom , in almost the last letter that I received from her , she declared unworthy to meddle with her work , - it belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much justice as to know what she wrote , to place Miss Bacon in her due position before the public and posterity . This has been too sad a story . To lighten the recollection of it , I will think of my stroll homeward past Charlecote Park , where I beheld the most stately elms , singly , in clumps , and in groves , scattered all about in the sunniest , shadiest , sleepiest fashion ; so that I could not but believe in a lengthened , loitering , drowsy enjoyment which these trees must have in their existence . Diffused over slow-paced centuries , it need not be keen nor bubble into thrills and ecstasies , like the momentary delights of short - lived human beings . They were civilized trees , known to man and befriended by him for ages past . There is an indescribable difference - as I believe I have heretofore endeavored to express - between the tamed , but by no means effete ( on the contrary , // the richer and more luxuriant ) Nature of England , and the rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship in America . No less a change has been wrought among the wildest creatures that inhabit what the English call their forests . By-andby , among those refined and venerable trees , I saw a large herd of deer , mostly reclining , but some standing in picturesque groups , while the stags threw their large antlers aloft , as if they had been taught to make themselves tributary to the scenic effect . Some were running fleetly about , vanishing from light into shadow and glancing forth again , with here and there a little fawn careering at its mother 's heels . These deer are almost in the same relation to the wild , natural state of their kind that the trees of an English park hold to the rugged growth of an American forest . They have held a certain intercourse with man for immemorial years ; and , most probably , the stag that Shakspeare killed was one of the progenitors of this very herd , and may himself have been a partly civilized and humanized deer , though in a less degree than these re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they do not snuff the air at the approach of human beings , nor evince much alarm at their pret ty close proximity ; although , if you continue to advance , they toss their heads and take to their heels in a kind of mimic terror , or something akin to feminine skittishness , with a dim re membrance or tradition , as it were , of their having come of a wild stock . They have so long been fed and pro tected by man , that they must have lost many of their native instincts , and , I suppose , could not live comfortably through even an English winter without human help . One is sensible of a gen tle scorn at them for such dependency , but feels none the less kindly disposed towards the half- domesticated race ; and it may have been his observation of these tamer characteristics in the Charlecote herd that suggested to Shak speare the tender and pitiful descrip tion of a wounded stag , in " As You Like It . " At a distance of some hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees between it and the road-side , is an old brick archway and porter 's lodge . In connection with this entrance there appears to have been a wall and an ancient moat , the latter of which is still visible , a shallow , grassy scoop along the base of an embankment of the lawn . About fifty yards within the gate-way stands the house , forming three sides of a square , with three gables in a row on the front and on each of the two wings ; and there are several towers and turrets at the angles , together with projecting windows , antique balconies , and other quaint ornaments suitable to the half-Gothic taste in which the edifice was built . Over the gate-way is the Lucy coat-of-arms , emblazoned in its proper colors . The mansion dates from the early days of Elizabeth , and probably looked very much the same as now when Shakspeare was brought before Sir Thomas Lucy for outrages among his deer . The impression is not that of gray antiquity , but of stable and time-honored gentility , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . All about the house and domain there is a perfection of comfort and domestic taste , an amplitude of convenience , which could have been brought about only by the slow ingenuity and labor of many successive generations , intent upon adding all possible improvement to the home where years gone by and years to come give a sort of permanence to the intangible present . An American is sometimes tempted to fancy that only by this long process can real homes be produced . One man 's lifetime is not enough for the accomplishment of such a work of Art and Nature , almost the greatest merely temporary one that is confided to him ; too little , at any rate , - yet perhaps too long , when he is discouraged by the idea that he must // make his house warm and delightful for a miscellaneous race of successors , of whom the one thing certain is , that his own grandchildren will not be among them . Such repinings as are here suggested , however , come only from the fact , that , bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , we have not yet modified our instincts to the necessities of our new forms of life . A lodging in a wigwam or under a tent has really as many advantages , when we come to know them , as a home beneath the roof-tree of Charlecote Hall . But , alas ! our philosophers have not yet taught us to see what is best , nor have our poets sung us what is beautifullest , in the kind of life that we must lead ; and therefore we still read the old English wisdom , and harp upon the ancient strings . And thence it happens , that , when we look at a time-honored hall , it seems more possible for men who inherit such a home , than for ourselves , to lead noble and graceful lives , quietly doing good and lovely things as their daily work , and achieving deeds of simple greatness when circumstances require them . I sometimes apprehend that our institutions may perish before we shall have discovered the most precious of the possibilities which they involve .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
