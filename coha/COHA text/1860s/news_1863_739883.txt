The pending question being on the postponement of the resolution of Mr. SUMNER , etnboaying the proposed new rule of the Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued the discussion , and favored a postponement of action thereupon . Mr. SUMNER held that there was no occasion for postponement , and that it should be brought to a vote at once . Mr. BAYARD wished a discussion of the constitu ! tonality and applicability of the taw to Senators , and a postponement of action for that purpose . Mr. Summit said it was difficult to resist the application urged with so much pertinacity by the Senator from Delaware . Yet that gentleman enjoyed the most ample opportunity of consideting it ; and it was due to the Senate that it should be settled without delay , and before the holidays . He should deem it his duty to press it to a vote . THE ENROLLMENT ACT , The morning hour having expired , on motion of Mr. WILSON , of Massachusetts .

It was one of the most hopeful indications of tse present time that so general an inclination to reenlist was prevalent in the army . If this provision was placed in the bill there would be constant changes from infantry to artillery , or to cavalry . and existing orgatazations would be broken up . The amendment W S agreed to . Mr. Gems moved to amend the amendment by giving four hundred dollars bounty to all veterans ? who enlist prior to the 5th of January ; also , to the effect that any person enlisting in the marine corps of the United States shall receive the sum of three hundred dollars , Rejected . Mr. SHERMAN , of Ohio , ( Luton , ) regarded the policy of paying large bounties as unwise . it would have been better to leave the whole matter to the people at home . The requirements of these amendments involved the raising of more than one hundred millions of dollars .

Nine millions had then been received from commutation . This was now augmented to twelve millions . Mr , FREBENDEN , of Maine , ( Union , ) opposed the system of large bounties , and asked how long will the people bear these burdens ? liow shall we render these burdens equal ? He had felt from the beginning that we must miss a fair law for a draft and then abide by it . The sooner we come to this decision the better it will be . If it should be his tut n to serve , it might be hard but it would be lair ' ? we have lost ground by ignoring the principle , Mat a man had no right to refuse his services when called for . It was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to pay them . We . might thus go on and add hundreds of millions per year to the burdens of the ? war . He believed we could continue to endure them longer than any other nation on earth , but might there not be an end to such capacity for endurance ? Shall we abandon at once the idea of obtaining the services of every able-bodied citisen ? It is in the power of the Government to demand their services , and that power should be enforced . How long could we go on as though there was money in profusion that we knew not what to do with ? If those who favor such prodigality of expenditure would furnish the money to the Treasury which would be required , ' their position would be more reasonable . Mr. Cowart , of Pennsylvania , ( Union , ) toted if the Senator knew why , when the draft failed to produce a sufficient number of men , there was not another ordered . Mr. FESSZNDRN answered that he was not authorized to say . It might be because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that the Government was frightened ; but when it was seen that the people were not a ; all frightened , they ordered another , making these offers for voluntary recruiting in the meantime , as the most available Means for obtaining the men . Mr. WILSON acknowledged the necessity of exercising great care with regard to the depletion of the Treasury and to keeping the credit of the Government intact . It had always been thought more difficult to obtain money than men . He wanted the currency of the country to be sound , and her credit good . Yet we must keep our pledges made to enlisted men . These enlistments were numerous , not only in the Northern States but in the Southwest . East Tennessee had recruited 3,500 men ; Texas had furnished two regiments ; and Arkansas has yielded substantial additions-to these forces . Such recruits Mould be dealt with according to promise . He was in favor of the commutation clause and for the payment of the bounties proposed . Mr. HEsnitiess , of Indiana ( Dem. ) , thought there was sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The draft had thus tar been a failure . We wanted not an army of conscripts , but of volunteers . Mr. HARRIS did not favor the amendment of the Committee as it stood , and thought it would stop all recruiting after Jan. 5 . Mr. LANE , of Indiana , said we could not till our armies witn conscripts alone . There were three millions of men subject to draft at this time ; and of this number , on the basis of the receipts of the last draft , but 426,000 could be brought into the field if the entire enrollment were taken , and out of this number from 20,000 to 30.000 would be deserters . Indiana had more than filled her quota , and could be depended on unuer any circumstances to furnish her full share without resort to draft . Mr. Cot-tames , of Vermont .

The motion was rejected , after a conversational debate , participated in by Messrs . WILSON , Rows and Frressroza . Then Senate , on motion of Mr. SHERMAN adjourned .
