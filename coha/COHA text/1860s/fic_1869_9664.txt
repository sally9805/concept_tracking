Characters . MRS . MORDAUNT . THEODORE . Main text MRS . MORDAUNT sewing . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  It is almost time that Theodore was home from school . His last day ! Next week he must start into a man 's life , leaving behind him these school-boy days that he has found so pleasant . Ah , I hear his step ! Enter THEODORE . THEODORE .  --  Well , mother , here I am . My schooldays are over at last ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  You have had a pleasant day , I hope ? THEODORE .  --  Yes , the teachers were all very kind , and gave me their best wishes for success in business-life . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Are you going out again ? THEODORE .  --  There is no temptation to go out . The rain pours down in perfect torrents . We have a full hour before dinner-time . Talk to me ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Imperative case , present tense ! THEODORE .  --  ( Bowing . ) Will you graciously condescend to converse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What shall we talk about ? THEODORE .  --  About myself . Modest , am I not ? But I would like to have a little talk about the future , and you were always my father-confessor , you know ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Mother-confessor , you mean . THEODORE .  --  Many a cat-killing , orchard-robbing , sign-destroying expedition has lost one of its members , by the thought of your gentle reproof , or sorrowful eyes , overpowering his love of mischief at the last moment before starting . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  It makes me very happy to hear you say that , my dear boy . Yet you are almost too old for a lecture , since you look over my head now , with perfect ease . THEODORE .  --  Well , good advice need not be a lecture . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  I must confess there are some points where there is room for improvement in your course of conduct . THEODORE .  --  I know that well . Take the little sins first , mother , and then attack the big ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is the utter waste of your powers of conversation . You are a boy with more than the average amount of brains , of some talent , and have received a good education , and among your gentlemen friends you may use your advantages  --  of that I can not judge  --  but among your lady friends , you are only one degree removed from an empty-headed coxcomb . THEODORE .  --  Mother ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  It is an undeniable fact . Once among ladies , you talk the most arrant nonsense , by the hour together . THEODORE .  --  Oh mother , not always ! I do talk sense sometimes , I am sure . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  When ? Recall your conversation last evening in a roomful of clever , sensible girls , and repeat , if you can , one single sentence that you would care to have quoted as a specimen of your conversational powers . Was it not from beginning to end , the smallest of all small talk ? The merest twaddle , about weather , opera , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day ? Come , now , Theodore , be candid . THEODORE .  --  But , mother , I do n't want the girls to set me down for a pedantic , conceited fellow , anxious to display his own learning . Girls like small talk ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Do they ? Pray upon what foundation do you form that opinion ? THEODORE .  --  They never talk of anything else but weather , opera , and such subjects . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Do you ever give them a chance ? Did you ever try to lead any of your young lady friends into a sensible , rational conversation , upon some topic that might interest both of you ? THEODORE .  --  I confess I never did . I thought they liked small talk and flattery . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Nonsense ! If you will confine your remarks entirely to the regions of nonsense , of course the young ladies can do nothing but follow your lead . Do you talk so among gentlemen ? THEODORE .  --  No ; not when we really converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversing upon subjects of interest and importance , science , art , politics or literature , what would you do if a party of young ladies entered the room ? THEODORE .  --  We should all do the same thing . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  And that would first be , to look as guilty as if you were plotting a murder , or as silly as if you had been reading Mother Goose , and then each one of you would turn to your favorite companion among the invaders , compliment her dress and appearance , and set in motion a perfect tide of empty words and phrases . THEODORE .  --  I am afraid I must plead guilty ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Very complimentary to our sex , is it not ? THEODORE .  --  Having displayed the fault , now for the advice . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  The advice is that the next time you converse with a young lady , you try to confine your conversation within the regions of common sense and interest , and see if she will not follow you as readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEODORE .  --  I 'll try it ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Next , Theodore , I would cease to make a chimney of my mouth . THEODORE .  --  Oh , mother , a cigar now and then will not hurt any one ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  I am not so sure of that ; and besides , who can be sure it will be only a cigar now and then ? THEODORE .  --  I do not chew tobacco . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  I hope not , I should be sorry to see a son of mine indulging in so disgusting a habit . Chewing tobacco is not only poisonous to the constitution , but it is an ungentlemanly , filthy habit , that is offensive to every person of refinement . THEODORE .  --  I quite agree with you . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Smoking is not much better , even if indulged in but moderately , and who can say moderation in any vice will not lead to excess . Remember the love for tobacco increases with the indulgence in its use . THEODORE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indulgence I allow myself in that way . That will not harm any one . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Perhaps not . But remember great vices take root in little faults . Two cigars a week may lead to four next week , then one each day , two , three , till what was but a scarcely indulged luxurious taste , becomes a positive necessity ; you will never feel contented unless you have a cigar between your lips . Then will follow indolence , a torpid drowsiness , and the want of stimulus may lead you into a love for drink . THEODORE .  --  I never craved that , mother . It is but rarely I touch even a glass of wine . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Like the occasional cigar , Theodore , the wine now and then is a dangerous beginning . THEODORE .  --  You advise , then , total abstinence from liquor and tobacco. ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  It is the only real safeguard . You can never be certain of yourself , if you once permit the love for either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them up , a year from now , the cessation may entail positive suffering , later may be almost impossible . THEODORE .  --  I will consider your words , mother . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  If there were no moral objection , Theodore , drinking and smoking are such vulgar vices . I would have my son a gentleman . THEODORE .  --  What is a gentleman ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Are you in earnest ? THEODORE .  --  Yes . Opinions are so divided . Some of my friends will not wear a coat of last year 's cut , because they are afraid of being mistaken for ungentlemanly fellows , yet have no objection to running in debt , and shirking payment for the same . Now can swindling be gentlemanly ? Debt contracted without any prospect of payment looks to me like cheating . One man will not swear because it is ungentlemanly , while another will tell you of an oath that it is such a gentlemanly way of swearing ; the term seems to me to involve a perfect maze of contradictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . MORDAUNT . Pass me the dictionary from the table . THEODORE .  --  Now you are laughing at me ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Not at all . Did you ever look for it in the dictionary ? THEODORE .  --  Never . Passes dictionary to MRS . MORDAUNT . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Here we have a variety of definitions . Sidney pronounces a gentleman " A man of birth ; a man of extraction , though not noble . " THEODORE .  --  That will scarcely answer for our new country . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Shakespeare informs us that it is " A man raised above the vulgar by his character or post , " and again , that " It is used of any man , however high . " THEODORE .  --  That is better . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Addison says , " It is a term of complaisance ; sometimes ironical . " THEODORE .  --  It is more than that in this age . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  And Camden says it is : " The servant who waits about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  But none of those definitions will describe a Canadian gentleman of the present day , which I suppose is what you want me to be . Tell me what must I do in the arena of my new life , to deserve the title of a true gentleman ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  A true Christian gentleman is the highest moral position a man may attain in this country . First , my son , you must take the golden rule for your constant guide . THEODORE .  --  " Do unto others as you would others should do unto you , " you mean ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  For unselfishness is the first rule of courtesy . From this spring benevolence and gentleness , and these lay the foundation for the thousand acts of politeness , that in a true gentleman are but the outward symbols of a nobility of soul . THEODORE .  --  Christianity , then , is the foundation . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Undoubtedly . To reach this highest grade of earthly perfection , a thorough Christian gentleman , a man must unite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human character . I think it is Ruskin who says , " A gentleman 's first characteristic is that firmness of structure in the body , which renders it capable of the most delicate sensation , and of structure in the mind which renders it capable of the most delicate sympathies  --  one may simply say , fineness of nature . " THEODORE .  --  But that is reducing the whole to simple refinement . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Refinement in every sense , moral , physical and mental . How can you go higher ? Refined honor can never tolerate a dishonorable action , therefore a refined gentleman must be the soul of honor . Refinement of body will make necessary neatness , and propriety in dress , while it will curb the vulgar display of wealth or extreme fashion . THEODORE .  --  Do you class courage among the qualities necessary to form a gentleman ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  True courage , yes . THEODORE .  --  You mean moral courage ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Guiding and directing mere physical bravery . It has been remarked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in olden times , how far apart were the courage of the gentleman , and that of the ruffian . The latter , displaying mere physical disregard of danger , was made furious by the excitement of battle , and dared everything in a fierce animal love of fighting , and committing injury upon his foes . He threw aside mercy , discipline and self-control , and became a mere sanguinary , revengeful animal , murderer and savage . But the gentleman soldier , fired by the noble enthusiasm of aiding in a good cause , recollecting and fully appreciating his personal danger , accepts the risk , and with his life in his hand , dares as much , and fights as bravely as the most furious ruffian , yet regards discipline , tempers duty with mercy , and keeps his self-command in his most daring onslaught . THEODORE .  --  I have often heard people say , they can recognize a gentleman as soon as they see one . Can you do so , mother ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  No . I frankly confess that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many men who have all the polish of manner , all the grace and courtesy of a Chesterfield , yet who are at heart cruel and rude , only deferring to outward observances to shine in society . Others with no knowledge of the etiquette of that society , yet with a heart full of gentle deference to age , weakness or merit , are gentlemen at heart , though they may appear clowns in manner . THEODORE .  --  Then it is not well to decide hastily . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  No . Observation of manner is a good test , because a gentleman at heart will have that in his tone and actions that will shine above all the mere surface polish of mere society airs . THEODORE .  --  It is curious how the authorities vary . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Some authors define a gentleman as simply one who lives without work . THEODORE .  --  But superannuated residents of the almshouse live without work . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Others define it as one who is able to live in comfort without work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make your gentleman , mother ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Never , because I consider idleness as a vice . Honorable employment is not derogatory to a gentleman , because it paves the way to independence . THEODORE .  --  But if a man already possesses a fortune ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Then he can find ample employment for his time in works of philanthropy and charity . THEODORE .  --  Well , I shall have to make my fortune , before I spend it ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Another fault against which I would warn you , Theodore , is a tendency to over-dress . What is vulgarly called flash-dressing is becoming a vice only too common among our young men . Gay neckties , jewelry in profusion , smart waistcoats , and conspicuous gloves . THEODORE , ( laughing. )  --  A gentleman may not have the scope allowed the fair sex , then ? MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  No . Custom has decided that quiet colors , and a modest style of dress are more becoming to your sex , so I beg you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which you dazzled my eyes last evening . THEODORE .  --  To hear is to obey . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Lounging about the streets is another evil . I will not mention whose son it was , I saw last week , leaning against a tree-box , talking to five other boys , apparently as idle as himself . THEODORE , ( laughing. )  --  I am afraid you must own him . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  And that is another of the little sins , against which I would warn you as paths to great vices . Idleness can be cultivated , till it rules soul , mind and body with a rod of iron . Find something to do . THEODORE .  --  But father told me I might take a month to look about me . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Look about you , then . Do not waste one day of your month , but gain something in that time that will help you in your future life . And in the train of idleness , you will and wasteful extravagance . THEODORE .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , cost me more than I could afford , yet I could not avoid the expense without appearing mean . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Do not be a slave to the opinions of a set of brainless fellows who want to enjoy themselves at your expense . It is not mean to keep within the limits of your purse . Your character will not stand any higher among sensible people , for wearing clothes more expensive than you can afford ; running in debt for suppers you ought not to give ; smoking , drinking , gambling , to pass away time you ought to employ in useful labor . You must scorn the ridicule that would lead you to useless extravagance , not fear it . THEODORE .  --  Fear is scarcely the word . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  Fear is exactly the word . It is a want of moral courage that leads to half the evils that beset young men , when starting in life . THEODORE .  --  There 's the sun ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  And you think you have had enough good advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that . You have given me subjects for many an hour of thought . MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  And prayer , my son . Remember all my counsels and your good resolutions will be of no avail , unless you ask for strength and guidance from your Heavenly Father . He only can keep your feet in the right path . THEODORE .  --  I will remember ! MRS . MORDAUNT.  --  And now you must go . I am obliged to go out at this hour to take Clara to the dentist 's . Both go out
