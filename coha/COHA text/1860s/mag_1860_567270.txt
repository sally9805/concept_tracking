ARTICLE 11. - AMERICAN LEGJSLATION. * ILEGISLATION is a comprehensive and practical subject . It has to do with the character and the general welfare of the great political community , and is , therefore , it is believed , worthy of the special attention of educated men . No class in society is too high or too low , too cultivated or too rude , to be beyond its reach ; none so isolated or independent , as to be exempt from its influence and power . It creates and it exhibits the character of a community . It forms the habits of society , advances or retards the material interests of all its members , nor is it without its control over public morals , as well as intellectual improvement . *There are few subjects with which it may not deal , and fewer still upon which it does not leave its impress . Nor does its consideration regard only the past . Legislation is not a finished work . Long as human governmnent may last , it will continue to affect human happiness , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Legislation is itself a science , sadly unstudied , it is true , but still a practical science , behind no other iii its capabilities to promote human happiness . If antiquity can make it venerable , it is old as the human race ; if names can give it respectability , it has commanded the attention of the ablest minds in all civilized nations , and if variety can make it interesting , it is multiform as are the creations of human famicy . In a land where law has done so much for the promotion of mental cultivation , it is but a fitting return that educated men should contribute the results of their study to legal iml ) rovement . But the legislation which it is our present design to consider , is of comparatively modern origin . It is only within a few hundred years that the written law of any nation has emanated // from those whose action it was designed to control . In the earlier history of the world , the right to make laws , with very rare exceptions , was vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or in a select class , above the common ranks of the people . The republics of Greece had , it is true , something like popular legislation , but those republics were but cities . The districts governed by them were appendages rather than constituents of the state . The power was in the citizens of the town , and even that was little more than a right to accept or refuse ordinances proposed for their adoption . Such , also , was the Roman constitution at the only periods of its history when the legislative can be said to have been severed from the executive power . The " plebiscita " were propositions of the executive ratified by a popular assembly , - an assembly convened in the Campus Martins , in no sense representing the cities and provinces over which its action was to have the authority of law . Even to this day , in most countries , the executive is the sole legislator . His decrees constitute the only written law of his subjects . The theory of such a government is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . It does not assume the consent of the governed . Such legislation , however , is not without its advantages . Being the work of a single mind , it might be expected that it would manifest greater unity of purpose and freedom from whatever is complicated and experimental . What might thus be expected , we apprehend , finds its realization in the history of those nations where the statute laws have been made by the person who has in charge their execution . But it might also be inferred that such laws would not be well adapted to the social convenience and common necessities of the people , and the inference is undoubtedly found to be in accordance with observation and experience . Making all due allowance for the common propensity to magnify that which is our own , it can hardly be denied that that people are best governed who make their own laws , under suitable restraints against licentiousness ; that they enjoy higher facilities for general social development , and better protection to all their personal and relative rights , while , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of constraint , which , in despotic governments , is onerous , and which , to a people with a temperament and education like ours , would be unendurable . American legislation is thoroughly popular , representative indeed , yet more expressive of the popular will than any other which the world has ever witnessed . Its forms are not original with us . They came from the mother country . Before the revolution there were legislative assemblies in most of the provinces , closely resembling each other , and all miniature likenesses of the British Parliament . They were composed of two distinct bodies , the separate assent of each being necessary to the enactment of any law . When a successful struggle had finally separated us from the mother country , and it became necessary to frame institutions suited to our altered circumstances , very little change was made in the machinery of the law-making power . Our fathers did not cease to be English , because they resisted English oppression . They loved liberty more than country , but they were not indifferent to the merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their view , indispeusable to all wise legislation . But they were not insensible to the attendant dangers . They knew that popular impulse was unreasoning , that it was liable to yield to excitement , or to the seductions of present apparent expediency . With large coinprehension they foresaw the possible evils of hasty and improvident legislation , and they felt that , with the divided responsibility inseparable from it , there was danger to be apprehended . In their judgment nothing deserved to be enacted as law until it had received careful and repeated consideration . Whoever has studied the history of our national and early state constitutions must have been impressed with the solicitude which their framers felt to devise suitable checks against the anticipated licentiousness of popular legislation . It was one of the most difficult problems in the construction of our new forms of government . More than one device was adopted , but , if we may judge from an experience of seventy years , not one too many . The framers had seen that the existence of two houses , each acting independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsiderate action , and they could devise no better form for the future than that which was furnished to their hands in the organization of the British Parliament . They were aware , indeed , that the existence of two separate bodies in one legislature might sometimes prevent any action , but they thought , and thought wisely , what is now often forgotten , that too much legislation is a greater evil than none ,  --  that it is even better to " bear those ills we have , than fly to others that we know not of . " It is true there was no order of nobility in the land , and the prejudices which , if not engendered , were certainly deepened by the revolutionary strife , rendered the creation of such an order impossible . Nor was there any material out of which to construct it . There was no individual wealth to sustain such a class in the community . The military distinctions , which had grown out of the necessary maintenance of the army , were too unequally distributed . Besides , the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but neighbors and conipanions of those who had served under them in the ranks . Even in the country from which our people came , with few exceptions , title had not been obtained by militar , y prowess . But the division of the legislature into two distinct bodies was too important not to be preserved . To accomplish it the plan was adopted of requiring the upper house to be chosen by a different constituency , generally larger , and providing that its members should hold office for a longer period . In some of the states a higher property qualification was also demanded . The two houses in England are a necessity resulting from the existence of an order of nobility . The two houses in American legislatures are the offspring of no such necessity , but of an apprehension in the framers of the government that uncurbed popular legislation would prove unsafe . They threw aronnd the legislatures other restraints . They preserved , in a qualified degree , the prerogative residing in the British crown , to arrest even the joInt action of both houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative authority . They did more . By written constitutions they restricted the general legislative power of the // community , when acting by their representatives , and prohibited any action upon some subjects , and particular action upon others . In this respect American legislation is unlike that of the mother country . There never has been a written organic law which restrained the plenary action of the British Parliament . There are , indeed , old statutes and long standing usages , which , by common consent , have come to be regarded as constitutional , but the limits of legislative action are much more strictly defined in this country than they are in England . With these slight differences , the forms of American legislation are as old as constitutional government . Whatever peculiarities it exhibits are due , therefore , to some other causes than its singularity of form . It is obvious , however , from the mode in which the upper houses in our legislatures are constituted , that all can not have been accomplished that the fiamers of the constitutions hoped to secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , if not wholly , the same constituency , both houses must be the representatives of the same spirit . Almost alike dependent upon the same popular breath , they are found to yield alike to popular impulse , and often to legislate hastily and unwisely . Our legislation is more the work of the people than is that of England ; our statutory enactments a more direct reflex of the current popular sentiment . If it be true , as was said of England by mchardson , in 1668 , " that the law is nothing but the history how our ancestors have managed propriety in all ages , " American legislation must pre6minently be an exponent of American feeling and American impulse . Whatever tends to make an impression upon the common mind ,  --  whatever contributes to direct or to characterize social conduct ,  --  must here , more than elsewhere , find expression in the written law . If , now , the inquiry be made what particular influences are most potent in giving direction to legislation - in presenting the objects sought to be accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its action , we answer first , and pre*mineut1y , the power of common usage or custom . In every civil community of long standing , continued usage is // king . Its influence pervades all classes , reaches every dwelling , and , in some degree , controls all action . Its throne may be disturbed , but it is sure to reassert its authority , and reduce to obedience its most rebellious subjects . It is a power eminently conservative , fearful of innovation , steadfastly arrayed against change . In this land , as in all others , there exists a multitude of social usages , the day of the birth of which no man can tell . They have stolen upon us silently and unnoticed . They have made themselves our constant companions , entered into our daily life , taken part in all our concerns . They have identified themselves with all our interests . They are themselves our interests . We should cease to be what we are without them , and their sudden extinction would be to us like translation to another world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a power ruling within as well as around him . It would be unaccountable , indeed , if legislation , so popular as ours , so direct and immediate an expression of public sentiment , should escape the influence of these usages . Whatever peculiarities they exhibit must find their way into the written law of the land . Our present purpose does not embrace an inquiry into the reasons why that , to which we have been long accustomed , should rule as an ever-present power within us . We aim only at presenting the fact , and directing attention to the intensity and universality of this power . The usages of society are its habits , and the same reason which accounts for the control of habit over the man , explains the power of usage over a community . To obtain some adequate appreciation of the unavoidable influence which the established usages of society exert over popular legislation , we need but observe how great is the power of that which is usual over the individual man . It not only guides his conduct , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mental constitution that frequent repetition of an act or event enforces belief in its continued recurrence . In an extended sense , this is a universal truth , applicable alike to the facts of physical and intellectual nature . With all of us , the common reason for belieS is the knowledge that what we rely upon as // a fact is in correspondence with what has previously existed . We know that a heavy body will fall toward the center of the earth , if unsupported ; we believe that fire will burn , that heat will change ice to water , but we believe only because observation has taught us that such have been their habits heretofore . The same is true in regard to all expected physical phenomena . It is equally true in regard to mental and moral action . Of this the most simple illustrations may be given . We believe that memory will preserve to us the scenes of this day-that the power of reasoning , once acquired , will continue-that attention is essential to perfect understanding , but our belief is only another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which shall be . So in morals , no one doubts that the tendency of a life of indolence and vice is to suffering , or that a course of virtuous action is promotive of happiness , and this undoubting convictiOn is but a deduction from repeated results of past observation . So instinctive is the belief which is caused by that which is usual , or customary , that we have learned to denominate usages , laws . Thus we speak of the laws of being , of motion and of mind , and mean nothing more than their usages . It would be a curious speculation to enquire how far it would be possible for human reasoning to exist , were it not for this constitutional tendency to yield to that which is usual , the assent of our understanding . Certain it is that without it the limits of knowledge would be narrow indeed , for even our faith in human testimQny has no other foundation . Our experience has taught us that reliance may generally be placed upon assertions of fact by our fellow-men . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than falsehood in the world . We rest upon this conviction in our individual life , and as members of the community . Upon the same principle human testimony is daily received in our courts of law as a basis for the vindication of social rights , and the repression and punishment of wrongs . So , too , we judge that certain motives will influence to certain conduct , or the converse , that a given line of conduct indicates certain motives . We do not desire to be understood as asserting that the conclu // sions we draw are always right conclusions ; that the faith we adopt is a true faith . I speak now only of the fact that from such evidence we commonly deduce belief  --  and that as regards most of our convictions , especially those which have a practical influence upon life , we can give no other reason for the faith which is in us than that such has been the custom , the conduct , or the belief of others . And what we notice in ourselves , we look for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we regard as sufficient to control theirs , even in matters of religious faith . We anticipate that the son of a Buddhist will worship iL3udh-that one born and educated in IRome will be a papist - that the child of New England parents , reared in the family circle , will be a protestant , not because either has ever examined the evidences which support his faith , but because the usages to which he has been accustomed tend to impose belief . We may call such faith prejudice . It is so , but it is an early judgment adapted to the constitution of our nature . It is a part of man himself . Of this " Vi8 consuetudini8* ' the legislative reformer in the faith , the morals or the material interests of the community must take account . He must admit that faith thus founded is not entirely without reason , and must anticipate the resistance that reliance upon evidence , the nature of which , in most things , all men regard as satisfactory , is calculated to present . Laws are unmeaning , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common habits of those intended to be governed by them , and when those common habits of thought , of reasoning , and of belief are carried into a legislative body , they must give tone to its action . While such is the power of usage upon the individual man , it is not less controlling over men in a state of municipal society , and it is even more potential over their legislation . We have nothing now to say of its effect upon national character . It is doubtless true of a nation , as it is of every man , that its customs are true exponents of its character , and that they establish its reputation among mankind . But they do more . They give to it its laws . The great basis upon which the // rules of civil conduct of any people rest , is the social usages of that people . In vain would be a search through the inoldering records of the past , for any royal decree or for any parliamentary enactinent , securing the relative rights which we now enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge . Some of the domestic relations , indeed , are founded iii nature , and some are of Divine appointment , but most of the rights and duties which grow out of them are such as usage has enjoined . Political privileges are the creatures of written law-most civil rights , however , have had a different origin . The general principles which regulate the ownership of property ,  --  the privileges attached to ownership  --  the evidence upon which title to it depends , the securities which are thrown around its enjoyment , as well as those which environ the person and reputation , are not the dictates of superior power , but the commands of common assent ,  --  the long practised usages which men have tacitly adopted . Statute law may have recognized them , and may have added new sanctions , but it never created them . No human wisdom has ever yet been found adequate to devise a system of rules sufficient for the government of the most simple minded people . No code of laws has ever been framed by a legislature which answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our laws had their origin in statutory enactment . They have come down to us from by-gone times , authority only , because they were the practised customs of our fathers . Even our organic laws-our national and state constitutions and many of our statutory enactments-are but reproductions of older usages , with which their framers were familiar . The British Parliament , as has been seen , was the model after which the provincial , and subsequently the state legislatures , were formed . The concurrent assent of two deliberative bodies , the check upon their action by the chief executive , and most of the forms of legislation , were borrowed . The construction of the judiciary departments , the general distribution of powers between the executive , legislative and judiciary , and very many of the provisions of our bills of rights , are but written // recognitions of what had been the practised usages of our ancestors through many generations-many of them usages so old that no history has preserved the date of their birth . Written constitutions are perhaps the most remarkable illustrations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political community . They show that it governs alike theories and practice . Such instruments look to the future more than to the present . Though intended to work practical results , they are in themselves theoretical ,  - -  plans or schemes for anticipated social action . In them , if anywhere , we might look for a release from the behests of usage , and for a free rein given to unrestrained speculation . But such an expectation finds no fulfillment . Even here the usages of the time , the customs of civil society , assert their sway , and demonstrate the universality of their influence . There have been some notable instances of attempts to frame the organic law of a civil community , in disregard of popular usages , all of which resulted in failure . The constitution which John Locke formed for the province of South Carolina was one . If any theorist could have succeeded in such an undertaking , it would seem that Locke should not have failed . Deeply read , as he was , in the mysteries of the human mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience of the civilized world spread out before him , unembarrassed by the dissentient opinions of any associate , he had apparently every requisite for the work which he undertook to perform . But in its execution he omitted one element , the absence of which admits of no compensation . The constitution which he framed , though beautiful in theory , proved unfitted for those for whom it was designed . It ignored their habits of thought and of life , made no account of their social usages , and consequently was found impracticable in operation . It was laid aside . Plato 's theory of a republic would doubtless have shared the same fate , had it been applied to the government of any nation existing in his age . In the popular mind of most nations a distinction seems to have been made between certain usages regarded as constitutional , and others which regulate only common intercourse . The former have been considered as inseparable from national // independent existence ,  --  the latter as indispensable to social . domestic and individual happiness . The former have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved ineradicable . Conquest has overthrown constitutions , but it has required the extinction of a people to wipe out their domestic usages . Our Saxon ancestors submitted , though reluctantly , to Korman ascendency , but they adhered with inflexible tenacity to the usages which they had inherited , and they have sent them down to us , commingled with those of their conquerors , hut still preserved . We shall be enabled to estimate more fully the indestructible nature of these usages adopted by common consent , and the extent of their influence upon legislation , if we notice briefly the assaults which they have successfully resisted . As in all countries they are the recognized rules of civil conduct , so they necessarily precede all legislation . The very considerations which give them power tend to make them permanent . Yet every written law assumes that they are inadequate to the necessities of society , or that they are in conflict with the best interests of the people . It aims either at their extinction or modification , or it seeks to superadd still another usage . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the usages of a people and their legislation . A power which can maintain such a conflict , continued through long years , and yet survive unconquered , must possess no common vitality . Whoever shall write the history of the legislation of this country and of England , in which , more than in any others , written law is the work of the people , will have a theme not only rich in materials , but immense in extent . Soon after the English restoration , Whitelocke , in remarking upon the multiplicity of written laws , observed complainingly , " now the volume of our statutes is grown or swelled to a great bigness . " At that time all the British statutes were embraced within a single volume . Times have greatly changed since the days of Whitelocke . More is attempted now , by positive legislation , every year , than was the work of centuries before the English revolution . Modern sentiment appears to regard legislation as a remedy for all social ills ,  --  as a ne // ccssary promoter of all true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numberless schemes of political and social improvement , and of attempted ameliorations of those laws which have been established by the common sense and common usage of the people . We have a national legislature in annual session . We have more than thirty state legislatures , most of them also convening annually , and all employed in devising new rules for individual conduct . The results of their lal ) ors are seen in the numerous volumes of statutes which pour from the press , already too numerous to find space in any private library . It is a noteworthy fact , that legislation begets legislation ; that notwithstanding the real and imaginary improvement which has been made in society , and notwithstanding all that written law has attempted to accomplish , the work to be done remains mmdiminished . Each legislator addresses himself to a task greater than that which engaged the attention of his predecessors . The body of the statute law grows in magnitude with every year . The work done by one legislature is often undone by its successor , and a new structure raised upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . It avows a purpose to meliorate the condition of society ; to give to the cornmnunity a better system of laws than their experience has devised , and to change those customs and usages which necessity introduced , and which are the ligaments that bind society together . We would not be understood as asserting that all which is done by our many legislative assemblies is an invasion of the common usages of society . Our political system requires that short lived provision should be made for the maintenance of government , and that its different departments should be reminded of their dependence by annual or biennial grants of the means of administering public affairs . These grants , usually called appropriation bills , contribute to swell the statute book . So also much of the attention of our legislative bodies is directed to private objects . Still these are partial innovations upon the general usages of the community . Yot taking them into account , however , there emanate from our // lawgivers multitudinous enactments of general application , experimental in character , designed to substitute a theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , if legislative enactment could make any system of domestic law perfect , ours would long ere this have been in a high state of perfection . Surely , if anything could have destroyed those usages which gave early character to our people , and which have been the rules of civil conduct in all our history , the legislation of the last seventy years should have acecoinplished the work of destruction . But it is the legislation that perishes . The customs of a people can not die a violent death . Originating in physical necessity , in peculiar location or dangers , or in a tried experience of what is convenient and useful , they are perpetuated by the same causes which gave them birth . They are susceptible indeed of modification , they accommodate themselves to advancing civilization ; they yield to the plastic hand of science and of religion , yet they maintain more than an e4nal struggle with legislation . It is no uncommon observation that certain legislative acts are in conflict with popular sentiment , or in advance of it . Such laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the statute book , they remain there a dead letter , nominally law , but truly powerless ,  --  the form without the life . No power , not even that of a despot , can force upon an unwilling people laws subversive of their customs and their faith . The attempt involves a conflict between a rule which is a part of themselves , and an artificial regulation obligatory only because of the mode of its enactment . All the instincts of self-preservation revolt against it . The authors of the code Napoleon , men of no common wisdom , and men who , while intent upon their great work , kept steadily in view the results of human experience , remarked that " no legislator can escape that invisible power , that silent judgment of the people , which tends to correct the mistakes of arbitrary legislation , and to defend the people from the law , and the lawgiver from himself . " Attempts to elevate a people in the arts , in science , or in morals , by statutory enactments greatly in advance of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such attempts not only fail to accomplish their purpose , but they often induce serious inischiefs . Their tendency is to bring all law into disrepute , to diffuse a spirit of insubordination , and thus endanger the continued existence of orderly society . A law upon the statute book , which can not be executed , is a standing proclamation of license to disorder . There is far less permanency in the legislation of this country than is generally supposed . That silent judgment , of which the authors of the code Napoleon spoke , pronounces its decree upon every act of legislation , and many fail to pass the stern ordeal . Some are forced out of existence , and others submit to modification to render them more consonant with popular sentiment and habits . how few are the statutes in any of our books of laws which have survived unaltered a quarter of a century ? Even our constitutions perish in the lifetime of their framers , and constitutions , far less than other laws , interfere with the social habits and everyday life of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen states have preserved their original constitutions ? Some of those who but recently came into the sisterhood have more than once reconstructed their organic law . Change is the characteristic of all that is artificial in our system of government . There is however a snbstratum of popular usages , which lies deep below all written laws , incapable of being disturbed by any great convulsion . Upon this the lawgiver must build , if he would raise an enduring structure . We have dwelt long upon this part of our subject , because , in our judgment , it is intimately connected with all the other influences which are felt by legislation ,  --  itself affected by them and in return qualifying their efficiency . Among those other influences are such as result from the local situation and physical capabilities of the country which our people inhabit . As usages are the fruit of necessity , or of convenience , and earlier usages principally of physical necessity , it is of course to be expected that whatever is novel or unusual in the situation of any people , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their employments , and consequently of their relations to one another . // After all , the legislator has most to do with that which is material . No law can be equally fitted for all material interests , and legislation which is not adapted to the circumstances and employments of those to be affected by it , is Unmeaning and absurd . There must from necessity be national dissimilarity . No one supposes that the laws which would suffice for an agricultural people , would meet all the wants of a manufacturing or a maritime nation . Every art has its peculiar customs , every employment its own necessities . So also the proximity of others , whose interests are diverse , and who are animated by a different spirit , imposes the necessity of peculiar laws . There is very much in our situation , which has contributed to the character we possess , and which has been speaking out in all our past legi*1ation . We are far removed from any of the great powers of the world . Our position is one of security , fortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyance . We can hardly be said to have neighbors , or even acquaintances , except those of our own choice . We are at liberty to foster our industry , and advance our interests , in our own way , unchecked by the jealousy or interference of any external power . We need no standing army to repel sudden invasion . There is nothing here to awaken the conviction that any domestic policy we may adopt would be unsafe . Moreover , we have such a domain of unappropriated land as no other nation has ever enjoyed , open to the occupation of all our people , and promising competency , if not wealth , to even moderate industry . All along our history this region has spread its broad acres before the eyes of the landless , inviting them to enter and to enjoy . The products of our soil , too , are almost infinitely diversified , adapted to every variety of pursuit . Mines , fisheries , agriculture , commerce , and manufactures afford unwonted facilities to successful effort . Apart from all the effect which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and character of our people , it is impossible that they should not directly shape much of their legislation . No one would dream that the written law , which would be adapted // to ilolland or the British isles , would answer well for our physical condition . It is not difficult to trace in our statute books many effects which have resulted from our remote situation ,  --  our immense landed possessions , and our diversified and peculiar physical interests . We select one . The change which American legislation has made in the law of descent of real estate , is one of its most important achievements . ft is that which , perhaps more than any other , has been farreaching in its influence upon the spirit , the character , and the general development of our people . It has taken away the privileges of the Norman feud , and the Jewish birthright . It no longer permits the whole land of the father to descend , at his death , to his eldest son . It casts the inheritance upon all the children alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrains large accumulation of wealth in the hands of the few at the expense of the many-breaks up the distinctions in families , which grow out of the unequal distribution of property-gives to merit a precedence over birth ,  --  and fosters in the community a spirit of self-reliant independence . This great departhre from the law of our EngliTh ancestry has , doubtless , been induced mainly by the fact that land here has always been abundant , that there has been enough for all , and though , within the older states , the influence of the great unappropriated region at the west is now felt but indirectly , yet in those states where there remain unappropriated or even unsettled lands , they continue to be a constant subject of legislation . Nor do the effects of physical causes cease with the first legislative action . The abolition of the law of primogeniture prepared the way for other laws promotive of general education , and awakened a desire for the establishment of schools , common to the children of all . Who can say that without this , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have found a permanent abiding place in this country ? Yet another influence that impresses itself upon our written law flows from the comparative shortness of our existence as a distinct people . Two hundred years are a brief period for maturing a nation , especially when its first efforts must be // expended in subduing a wilderness for an abode ,  --  too brief to give consistency to its policy-hardly enough to furnish indications of what its ripened manhood will be . Age creates impressions that early youth can not inspire . We render involuntary homage to what has outlived centuries . We esteem it vandalism to destroy it . But there are few things among us which time has rendered sacred . There is little here that challenges our veneration ,  --  little to diffuse abroad a conservative spirit . We have no monuments of art , hoary with years ,  - -  no structures built by the hands of our fathers , which have survived the decay of long ages . We have no laws on our statute books which reach back far beyond the memory of living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the old world , are not yet in their early youth . We have even no state or national constitution , which is older than the time to which living niemory extends . We see , among us , none of those physical or social monuments , around which human veneration is wont to cling , and which attach the present to the far past . We are almost in jest when we apply the term " old " to anything artificial around us . During our short independent existence we have witnessed unexampled improvement in the structure of government , in the modification of those laws which regulate social life , and perhaps in moral and religious culture . We have seen the work of many generations condensed into the lifetime of one . It is natural , though it may not be philosophical , to conclnde that future advancement may be no less easy than was the past ,  --  that as construction was indispensable to our existence as a separate people , and as it has been successful , reconstruction will prove equally safe . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , were the tower of London , or Westminster Abbey , suddenly destroyed , but the shock would be equally great , were some old statute repealed , which had been a living law since tue days of Henry the Eighth . Time hallows even abuses . The long continued and energetic contest which was needed to effect a small reform in the representation to the British House of Commons in 1832 , illustrates the strength of the attachment which men feel for that which // nothing but time has rendered venerable . There are no such venerations in this country . There is hardly anything , it would be considered sacrilege to destroy . What may be hereafter , ( if anything of the present be left undisturbed for a long hereafter , ) we can only conjecture from the history of other nations . The present effect of the novelty around us , it is not difficult to perceive . It is certainly not conservative . It has no tendency to give stability to our institutions ,  --  none to consolidate , or even to secure the advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce similar impressions upon our legislation , is the fact that we are not a homogeneous people . A large majority , it is true , are of English descent , but there are Scotchmen , Irishmen , Germans , French , Spaniards , Korwegians and others , in the aggregate numbering millions , intermingled with each other , and with the English race . All these have brought with them an attachment to the customs and to the legislation of their fatherlands . They cherish their peculiar theories ,  --  their ideal of what would constitute the best attainable common good . Ardent in their attachment to the free institutions of the country , they take part in its public concerns , and their influence is felt in all our halls of legislation . They are probably more active in the affairs of government , because they enjoy a privilege denied to them in the land of their descent or birth . Society here is in a state of fusion . What it will be when its particles shall have readjusted themselves , it is too soon now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be . It can not be English . It can not be German . It can not have the spirit and character of any other living nation . It is wonderful how much has already been accomplished in blending the different constituencies that make up American society . We are the only people into which flows a never-ebbing tide of foreign immigration . It is diffused through all our borders . But it passes at once into the same crucible , and comes out American . The process , however , can not be without a disturbing effect upon our legislation . Men of these different nationalities are found in nearly every legislative body . They necessarily take with them their preconceived opinions , and by contact with // others work out results , which are distinctly American . Even if not themselves members , they contribute , in their daily life , to the formation of a public sentiment which seeks expression in the legislative will . The fact should also be noticed , that the unprecedented progress made during the present age , in invention , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply and to direct legislation . The development of the arts and sciences in modern times has been too rapid , and the consequent changes of social condition have been too sudden , to warrant their being left to the slow process of the growth of compulsory usage . So long as the advance of society is steady and uniform , it may be assumed that existing usages will accommodate themselves to whatever changes may take place . Until within quite a recent period , social improvement has been by regular gradations. high civilization has not been the growth of any single age . But , of late , science has become something more than ahstractious . Its tendency is now altogether practical . It is no longer what it was in the dark ages , or even in the days of Bacon . Indeed , the present century is the commencement of a new era . The principles which the scientific investigations of former periods brought to light , are no longer mere toys to amuse an idle hour-curiosities to excite the wonder of the unlearnej . They have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as more recent discoveries , are valued now just in proportion as they have been made subservient to popular use . The spirit of the age is bold , but utilitarian . It has laid hold of the elements themselves , but only to put them in harness , and compel them to human service . Science has entered the ahodes of all our people , and revolutionized the employments and habits of social life-it has banished from our dwellings the spinning wheel and loom of the matron , the knitting needle of the spinster , while the sewing machine threatens still larger innovations . Science has invaded the department of agriculture , fertilizing the soil , planting the seed , gathering the crops , and preparing them for use , by other than human hands-it has monopolized the whole // domain of manufactures-it has entered the realms of commerce and trade ; - opened new avenues to their successful prosecution , given to them novel and superior instruments with which to labor , and has rendered the modern merchant as unlike his predecessor as is the cross-legged Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Science has also compressed society , has brought its members into closer contact with each other , and into nearer neighborhood with other communities . What physical , what social wonders have been wrought by the multiplication of canals , of rail ways , of telegraphs , and by the introduction of steam navigation ! Applied science has , within the last fifty years , regenerated societyhas diverted labor from its long worn channels-has introduced comfort , even luxury , into the homes of poverty-has stimulated the enterprise that had long lain dormant-has generated in the universal mind a consciousness of power , and awakened conceptions of what is attainable , too vivid to admit of inaction . All this has made unwonted demands for legislative interference . It has rendered necessary new rules , suited to the altered circumstances of the people . This sudden expansion of human capabilities , aided by the application of science to the uses of life , found no usages in the community adequate to regulate the new complications both in the physical and moral condition of the people which it introduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Convenience had established no rules for what had no existence , and selfishness and all evil passions were not slow to avail themselves of new facilities for their indulgence . Here was a great and a new work for legislation . Here was a necessity to be supplied-a vacuum to be filled . To enable the legislator to meet wisely this new order of things , required no common knowlege of the transition state of society , no small amount of j udgmuent to plan , and of prudence to foresee the effect of legislative action . The attempt has been made . Modern legislation has been largely engaged in regulating the new duties and rights which the application of science to the purposes of common life has caused to spring into being . Many of our statutes re // late to canals and railways , to telegraphs and manufactories , to hours of labor , to the duties of the employer , and to the rights of the employed . It is probable that such statutes will become more numerous as the effect of this influx of mechanical improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the effect upon legislation , which practical science has wrought , has been , thus far , rather to substitute a new subject matter , than to introduce a changed spirit into our law , but there can be no great physical changes which do not work corresponding changes in the mind and heart of the community . It is not difficult to perceive that this cause must be peculiarly effective upon American legislation . The benefits of mechanical improvements are more generally diffused in this country than they are in any other nation . There is in all classes a greater readiness to avail themselves of anything which is labor-saving or labor-doing . No decided improvement can long be confined to a single neighborhood . Even patent laws , with all their authority , are too weak to prevent constant infringement . An improved churn or plough invented this year in Connecticut , will next year be in use in Oregon . There are few villages or neighborhoods in which there is not a steam engine , and fewer still unvisited by the products of some labor saving process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements of the age . It is incredible that all this should not give birth to common ideas of a possible improved state of society , and greatly stimulate the popular mind to increased activity . And in such a system as ours , where all written law is but the outspeaking of the common sense , it is equally incredible that such ideas should not find expression in the statute book . We do not intend to dwell upon the power of party spirit or legislation , or upon the consequences which follow that peculiar division of parties , that which now exists , and always has existed , in this country ; or upon that increasing and inordinate desire to become rich without labor , now so prevalent and so corrupting . Each of these is worthy of attentive consideration , and one of them , at least , is fitted to excite apprehen // sion for the future . Our limits will allow us to refer , very briefly , to but one other of those influences which reach our written law . The age in which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever causes may have combined to give to it this characteristic , the fact is undeniable . And the speculation which formerly expended itself in theories , now aims at putting them into practice . At no other period has organized society been the subject of so much day dreaming . In not a few minds conceptions of social improvement and illusory theories of a reorganized state of society , far more conducive to human happiness than is its present structure , are but daily bread . There are no schemes of reform so wild as to find no partisans . There are no established relations of life too sacred to be beyond the reach of projected modification . Even marriage , the foundation of all society , is , in the apprehension of many , not what it should be , but requires the ameliorating hand of human legislation . The relative position of the sexes demands readjustment . The expressed wisdom of the past is , in the judgment of such theorists , but folly , and even the book of inspiration is trustworthy only so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such enthusiasts would be harmless , were it not for the sublime energy with which their schemes are prosecuted . Moderation seems to have been expunged from their catalogue of virtues . Disheartened by no failure , they make it rather a reason for wilder extravagance . They substitute denunciation for argument , and agitation for conviction . There is a still larger class in the community , not so deeply infected , who are yet dissatisfied with the existing order of things ,  --  who regard the government and laws as radically defective , and who are not slow to believe that their own visions of right and policy are essential to the highest social development . They are doubtless true reformers in spirit , patriots and philanthropists . But they are not wise reformers . They undervalue present good , and overlook its cost . They forget that , though a rule may not have been the best conceivable at its origin , society may have accommodated // itself to it , and that it can not now be eradicated , without leaving a wound . Failing to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that both mental and moral reform must , in the nature of things , precede positive human law , they look to no other means of securing their projected reforms , than the coercive power of statutory enactment . It must be admitted that men of these and kindred views have deeply engraven their spirit upon modern legislation . Probably few persons become members of either our state or national assemblies , who are entirely without the impression that there are evils in existing law , which it is their mission to remove . Associated with this is a frequent ambition to connect their own names with some public measure . To the ill considered experiments to which such impressions and this ambition prompt , many of the evils of our present legislation are to be attributed . From the view which we have submitted of the influences which find their way into all legislative bodies , especially into those which reflect the popular sense , the transition is easy to the faults and imperfections which American legislation exhibits . We have already alluded to home , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intelligent observer must be impressed with the conviction that American legislation is excessive . The most artificial state of society is not the best . That community is most prosperous , as well as most free , which is permitted to pursue its course of industry , untrammeled by any rules other than those which are necessary for its protection and harmony . The prescription of any new rule of action , necessarily produces temporary friction in the iuachinery of society , and instead of promoting immediate harmony , tends to foster litigation . Skillful legislation will therefore be sparing . Its province is not to construct , but to develop .. The lawgiver should be an assistant , not a despot . As society advances , new complications will arise . Legislation should disembarrass them , and prevent their continuing obstacles to further improvement . When an old custom has lost its vitality and become an useless form , it may be exscinded When forms are needed for the application of acknowleged // principles , it is the province of legislation to supply them . When crime assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should provide for its repression . When an additional stimulus is needed to whatever is useful or noble , it should be supplied . Whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil . He that is familiar with the labors of judicial tribunals must have observed how immensely the complications of society are multiplied by modern legislation , and how numerous are the disturbances to which it gives rise . There is eminent wisdom in the old saying , " few rules and those inflexible . " How wide has been the departure from this maxim , in these days , the size of our statute books will show . Nor is it alone in its excesses , that legislation needs reform , It is not sufficiently intelligent . There is very much in the material of which legislators , in this country , are made , that tends to inconsiderate and ill advised action . We have said that legislation is a science , and yet , by most of those who frame it , it has never been made the subject of study . In England , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pro . fession of statesmanship . Not a few devote their lives to the attainment of a knowledge of national history , not merely of the biographies of eminent men which fill so large a place in all written history , but of the whole course of executive and legislative proceeding . To them political economy is not a sealed volume . They illuminate themselves with the lights of past experience . They observe the growth of legal principles , and mark the effect upon society of each new development . Nor are they ignorant of the existing state of the law , of its defects , and of the mischiefs , if any , which need a remedy . Knowing alike the law and the facts which require legislative interposition , they are not insensible to the derangement which even a slight alteration may cause in a great system of rules for municipal conduct , and they are able to foresee it . Such men are cautions . When they enter Parliament , if they bring with them integrity , they bring safety . We have no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born legislators . While there is a general appreciation of the value and the necessity of a preparatory education for a theo // logian-for a medical practitioner-for one whose province it is to administer the laws , or even for an artist , its importance to the lawgiver is not practically felt . Yet in his relation to the welfare of society he is behind no one , unless it be the teacher of religion . We can not but think that in this American scholars are in fault . Here is a department of science which they overlook . Too often themselves indisposed to enter a legislative body , they do not devote to the true principles of useful legislation that thought which their importance to the general welfare demands , and consequently they have little influence with those who are active agents in making the laws . Cultivated intellect and thorough knowledge do not contribute their share to the municipal regulation of the community . It is doubtless due to the general intelligence of our people , that our written law is not more crude than it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did legislation , equally with other sciences , command the devotion of educated men , we should be delivered from a multitude of evils . We should not , often , as now , find in our statute books an enactment working widely different effects from those which its framers anticipated-deranging what no one ever desired to disturb , and imposing the necessity of other legislation to remove mischiefs introduced by itself . We should no more be subjected to the trial of illusory theories , and ill digested experiments , so many of which now end in failure , and during their continuance work social disaster . We should have a clearer expression of the legislative sense , with a consequent diminution of the necessity to resort to courts of law , and a decrease of the number of cases of individual hardship . In this age of wonderful mental activity , when science isin a state of rapid progression-in this utilitarian age , when universal knowledge pays her tribute to the common weal-it should not be that the science of legislation alone is regarded as unworthy of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume its duties and to share its honors . It would be a nobler ambition to aspire to fitness to discharge its duties well .
