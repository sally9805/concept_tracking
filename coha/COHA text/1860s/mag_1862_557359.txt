ART . IV . - Undercurrents of Wall Street . A Romance of Business . By RICHARD B. KIMBALL , Author of " St. Leger , " etc . New York : G. P. Putnam. 1862 . A VERY favorable decision has been pronounced on the literary merits of this book . But there are other questions which we propose to discuss . What is its moral character , its religious character ? Has it any such character ? or is it positively irreligious ? One thing is certain . No thoughtful man can read the book without being impressed by it . It goes below the merely imaginative or the amusing . It makes us think , and enters into our thinking . Its representations of humanity affect us deeply , and that , too , all the more for their plainness , their want of striking originality , as some might say . We feel that they are true , because they go down to those deep things in which all men are original , which no man has borrowed from another , but all derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those more interior matters in which men agree , in distinction from the mere surface features in which they so greatly differ . They lead us , in short , to that department of anthropology with which the Apostle was so much better acquainted than the satirist . There has been a gross misnomer here . When we speak of human nature , or a knowledge of human nature , there are almost always had in mind these surface differences . The writers who depict them most vividly , whether as casuists , satirists , or outside reformers , these are called our shrewd men , our sharp men , our keen observers of the world and man . These , it is said , show such a deep knowledge of human nature . Keen it may be , sharp it may be , but what is there deep about it ? A day 's walk in the streets of London , with a good pair of eyes well employed , will give Dickens the materials of one of his longest novels ; just as a walk in the woods will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crooked roots , and gnarled limbs , and odd , fantastic forms of every kind , the materials for a jumbled composite picture which the astonished admirer of such oddities calls most exquisitely true and natural . Such a " natural writer " need only note every outside difference that // he meets , every eccentricity of speech or action , real or affected , and he has produced , forsooth , a perfect picture of humanity . Let each man be dressed up in the odd costume of his individuality , only caricatured to the highest possible degree , or let him have some odd phrase which he repeats on all occasions , and we are immediately in raptures with its exceeding naturalness . How true to the life ! We know the man every time he appears upon the scenes ; we have seen something like him in our own experience , and the recognition gives us a higher idea of our own powers of observation . And so the picture may be infinitely varied . Another man may be represented as ever canting , as never opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this foolishly , unmeaningly , in season and out of season , as though he were afraid the world would not believe him hypocritical enough , or might fail to see the author 's design in this his favorite creation , which is , of course , the honor of " pure and undefiled religion . " Another man is made so unreasonably good , that one can hardly help detesting his shallow virtue , so absurdly overflowing , without any originating fountain , either in God 's grace , or in any truth of humanity . Another is represented as so inexpressibly mean , and so ever exhibiting his meanness , that the sound-minded reader , if he has any natural pity for an ill-used subject , finds himself involuntarily on the side of the poor creature ; the author has made him so very mean , so absurdly mean , that he becomes the object of compassion instead of hatred . This is because we can not help feeling that the false virtue of the one and the monstrous moral deformity of the other are both alike , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural or regenerate state . Grace never made such goodness ; nature never developed such crime . There is no more reason in the one than in the other ; there is no reason in either of them ; and hence the reader gets a sense of injustice , which is all very natural , though the sentimentalist may regard it as very perverse . The avowal may not seem creditable either to our artistic or our moral sense , and yet we must confess an aversion to such good people as Dickens 's Brothers Cheeryble , their goodness is so surfeiting ; while , in spite of ourselves , we get // on the side of wicked old Ralph Nickleby , his devilism is so pitiably motiveless and extravagant . So , too , we can not avoid a touch of sympathy for the Quilps , and the Grides , and the Smaliweeds , and that miserable , canting Uriah Heap . They are not only the author 's creations , but his arbitrary creations ; they look so very ugly simply because he chose to put upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " natural faces " might be as fair , or rather no more deformed , than those of the characterless good people whose outsides he has so painted in seeming contrast ; we see , in short , no reason , either within or without , - no reason in nature , education , discipline , grace , or circumstances , - why the virtue should not have been on the one side as well as on the other . The end is aimless , the goodness has no root ; the proceeding is wholly arbitrary , and our sense of justice revolts against it . The author of the " Undercurrents " exhibits , too , a knowledge of human nature , but it is of a different kind and from a different source . It is Biblical , we may say , although the book makes no show of Biblical authority , and is very far from being what is commonly , and most absurdly , called a religious novel . In other words , unlike the mere satires of Thackeray , or the caricatures of Dickens , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that underlies the anthropology of Revelation . It is the Bible view of humanity , - severe , yet just ; true , yet kindly ; profound , while making no array of shrewdness or profundity . Had our satirists generally recognized the Scriptures , if only as presenting a picture of humanity , they would never have caricatured the race so horribly ; they would never have employed one page to paint men as devils , worse than devils , more foolishly wicked than devils , and another to exhibit the writer 's extreme aversion to that sober doctrine of human depravity which gave the noble Apostle " great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart , " - that compassionate doctrine of human depravity , which , in the sense it brings of the common ruin , is the only antidote to the satirist 's morbid misanthropy ,  --  that loving doctrine of human depravity , which finds below all superficialities , and all individualities , even in the deep original sin of the race , the true // ground of human brotherhood . A state of perfect individual blessedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not primarily suggest it . Peace , harmony , sinlessness , - they are consistent with it , they are strengthened by it , but they do not demand the social or kindred idea . We seldom think of the brotherhood of angels ; there is but little of tenderness in the conception ; it does not greatly move . But the human brotherhood ! here is a new element ; here is a thought of power . What makes it so deeply felt when felt at all ? It is a community of sin , of suffering , of struggle . Higher than this , and stronger than this , it is the hope of a common salvation . The philanthropy that has not one or both of these elements is spurious ; the satire that does not recognize them is the very spirit of Antichrist ; the " knowledge of human nature " that ignores them is not the heavenly crocfr /a , but the " wisdom " of the serpent , " earthly , sensual , devilish . " " Who can understand his errors ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , that dark profound beyond the deepest profound in nature , that vast unknown within , " Upon whose dizzy verge we stand appalled , And fear to east our swimming eyes so low . " He alone who came from heaven to heal could know the desperateness of the disease . He alone could estimate the depth of the perdition , in the labor of the atonement , in the greatness of the redemptive work , or by what other name we may call that restoring process which was necessary for the outward judicial reinstatement , as well as the perfect inward cure , of our fallen humanity . No doctrine teaches charity like this . The worst man is only the developed representative of the evil that is in the best ; the best man is only a proof of what the Divine grace or the Divine providence can do for the worst . And yet along with this deep view of the common evil we may hold what the mere casuist may regard as utterly inconsistent with it . The highest human virtue is sinful more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeeming trait . This is simply holding that the best acts are not what they ought to be ; the worst , not as bad as they might be . Our confusion has arisen from a wrong notion of // that old doctrine of " total depravity " which has , of late , been so much denounced , and so little understood . On both sides there has been misconception of the accurate language of the older theologians . Total is a term of extensity ( we use the word for the sake of the parallel ) , but not of intensity , - of width and breadth , but not of depth . We are bad enough , doubtless , but the degree of badness does not enter into the logical statement of the doctrine . The word is subjective ; it measures the man rather than the amount of his sin . He has not all evil , but some evil everywhere . He has not all depravity , but he is all depraved , - in thought , affections , will , - in body , soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial , - the partial in time and circumstance . It denies that man is partly good and partly bad , that he is part angel and part devil , or that he is either the one or the other . He is wholly fallen , but not out of sight of redemption . He is not one day holy and another day sinful , but always sinful , - not evil in one respect , and innocent in another , but all wrong , - wrong everywhere , wrong in everything , in " every imagination of the thoughts of his heart , " - wrong always , or as the Hebrew expressively gives it , " all the day . " In nothing is he free from sin . Evil he carries ever with him wherever he goes , and into whatever he may do . " Never , never , " says St. Augustine , " was I innocent . " Such is the doctrine . We are not now argumentatively defending it , but only stating it as it truly is . Man is not righteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his works and ways Unholy and impure . " He is not " just before God ; he is not clean before his Maker . " Yet he is not a devil ; there is not in him the utmost intensity of evil ; he has not reached the irredeemable state ; the worst man on earth , perhaps , has not arrived at that depth of depravity where he loves evil per se , or would say with Milton 's Satan , " Evil , he thou my good . " There is that in every man , even the worst man , that yet moves the Divine compassion , yea , more , that has yet a hold upon the Divine love . // Premising this , we are prepared for an assertion that may seem very strange , and even contradictory . We venture the paradox , that every individual man we know is worse , much worse , and at the very same time better , much better , than he appears to be . We judge him wrongly in both ways ; others do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences of manifestation ; some exhibit more of the one side , some of the other ; but there are very few - none , perhaps , on earth , among the holiest or the vilest - in whom the seeming paradox does not hold true . The author of this book may not have proposed to himself any such proposition , or any such doctrine of human nature , as the guiding thought of his story , but he furnishes illustrations of it on almost every page . His good people have many faults ; they are , in fact , very imperfect people , almost every one of them . On the other hand , his bad ones - if we may be even allowed to draw such a line between them - are not as bad as they might be . What is more to the purpose of our criticism , they are not unreasonably or foolishly bad , nor unreasonably or foolishly good , - that is , good or bad simply because the writer tells the reader they are so , and makes them act accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parkinson ; the conventional sins of mercantile life ; the business virtues of the one lawyer , the business vices of the other ; the narrow , selfish religionism of Golding ; the suspected Wall-Street life of Downer , as compared with that most exquisite picture of his domestic worth ; Harley with his " whole-souled God bless you , " and his spirit of speculation , utterly reckless of the evil it might do to himself or others ; Matilda with her fierce vindictiveness ; the ordinary mixture of good and bad we find in the other characters , - these all come naturally out of one common fountain of humanity , modified in its flow by outward influences , whether of fortune or discipline or that heavenly thing we call grace . It is the generic or birth-evil which is in every man , individualized by that outward education , natural or supernatural , through which , in the inscrutable providence of God 's election , one fallen child of Adam is made to differ from another equally fallen . We may remark by the way , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said to be without a fault , - pure goodness , unsullied virtue , at least as judged by the human standard . It is the wife . But she is near the grave , and weaning fast from earth . The author was artistically right in suffering no shade to fall upon that perfect picture . But what have we here , some may say , but the old infidel " doctrine of circumstances " ? Men are what education and outward influences make them to be . We admit the influence , but with a reserve that wholly changes its character . It is the " doctrine of circumstances , " but radically different from that of Owen and Fourier , - radically different from that religious indifferentism which seems to resemble it in its charity , while it directly reverses the position on which that charity is grounded . Mankind are very much alike , - here both doctrines are in harmony . IRadically , human nature is one ; even the outward differences , both moral and intellectual , are much less than they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conclusion , too , seems very much the same , if not absolutely identical , at least so far as language is concerned , in both . Seeing we are all so much alike , therefore we ought to be very kind , very loving , very charitable to one another . So say both ; and yet the one conclusion must be a cheat , for , when carefully analyzed , it destroys itself . It talks of charity , but really leaves no ground for charity ; it claims to be a fountain of tenderness , but its cold indifferences have no power of emotion ; it talks much of evil , but really admits no evil ; it has no deadly disease , and can , therefore , have no restoring cure ; it acknowledges no perdition , and can , therefore , have no real salvation , whether we take this much misunderstood term in the sense of rescue from some impending outward evil , or in its more etymological , as well as more spiritual import , of the ultimate salus , a-&amp;yn*pia , healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil circumstances make one man worse than another . We are all equally bad until favoring circumstances - meaning by the term all helping things in nature , providence , or grace , regarded as outward to ourselves - shall make one man better than another . Without arguing here for the absolute truth of either of these views , // one must see that the difference between them is immense , both in their theoretical and in their practical aspects . The one , we say , really admits no evil . It has no real charity , for it smooths away all the dark features in which the human resemblance most strikingly consists . It can have no strong brotherhood , for it finds the evil to be relieved , the misery to be healed , the great peril in which man most needs help , to be in the ever varying , ever alienating circumstances of outward society , instead of looking for them in the very heart and root of humanity . We are all equally good , unless where the current has been turned to evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has checked the downward tendency , making it less downward , less evil than it would have been , or actually turned it into an upward , though resisted direction , - into a heavenward , though ever earth-impeded path . It is enough to state fairly and distinctly the two views , leaving it to the thoughtful mind to judge which is the most in accordance with the most striking facts and appearances of human history , - which has most of love , of charity , of power , of struggle , of emotional life , - which has most accordance with the solemn , Scriptural declaration , " that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world stand guilty before God . " Of the human nature thus viewed as a natural , evil current mixed with an outward resisting good of disciplining circumstances , Parkinson may be regarded as an admirable average representative , He is very far from being a hero . He sets out with a predominant worldly fondness for wealth . To be rich , respectably , seems to him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit he means to live a good and honest life , according to the Wall-Street standard , He sees no higher virtue around him , - nothing to awaken the conviction how far this is below the right aim of an immortal being . It is only after a long course of severe discipline that he begins to get a glimpse of this truth . He fails twice . True , he pays his debts , and preserves his mercantile idol , credit , though , like Dagon of old , it gets somewhat battered in the process . But he seems to have had no difficulty in his conscience as to the general morality of a business that so frequently leads to such results . He becomes very poor . He experiences the usual treatment // of the bankrupt . There is not much in his character , as it there appears , to show that he himself might not have done to others very much as his creditors did to him , when they tried to prevent losses by his failure . He would probably have been more good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these outside amenities he seems to have had more of a natural furnishing than they ; but there is no evidence that he would have acted on any principle of religion or morality radically much higher than theirs . After his repeated bankruptcy he engages in a kind of business which , to a keen casuistry , would hardly seem defensible in all respects ; but of this he appears to have no consciousness . Circumstances had driven him to such a mode of life . It might have occurred to him , that , in this note-buying and note-selling business , others , through his means , and to make his gains , small as they were , might suffer from sheriffs and Bulldogs , even as he had done . But it fell within the conventional morality of the only society with which he was familiar . He could not get out of it or above it , and so had no time to talk with his conscience about it . Besides , he was no casuist , and we must say we like him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty for what may be called the algebra or the differential calculus of morals , and we think him morally healthier on that very account . A man had better do some questionable things , than to be everlastingly killing his conscience by the Benthamite plus and minus solution of moral questions . But Parkinson is fixed . He must yield to circumstances ; he could not get out of Wall Street ; and thus he toils on for long years , meeting with a variety of adventures , unromantic indeed , but having an interest , often higher than the most labored romance . This Wall-Street note-shaving life is a new field , a very peculiar field . It would have been thought , a priori , the last in which a novelist could hope to be successful . We can not say that we fully understand its mysteries , but Mr. Kimball has certainly thrown a wonderful interest about these very dry and commonplace transactions , as they would in themselves appear . Much is owing to the quiet yet admirable way in which he tells these stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - we can hardly tell 10* // what it is , - by which the reader becomes fascinated with all that relates to this Mr. Parkinson , ordinary and drudging as he seems to be . Many years of his life are spent in this hard way . Chapters are filled with his struggles to support himself and a beloved family , - his petty successes , his petty failures , all touching our compassion the more from the very fact of their pettiness , when we remember what an intensity of human feeling they may call forth within that small circle where they are the great events of the day . He fails one week in making five dollars as he had expected ; he can not fulfil some domestic arrangements ; he is afraid to meet the beloved child at home , and dim her smiling eye by the confession of his straitened way . Nothing heroic here , nothing romantic , nothing very " thrilling " ; but it is more than thrilling , - it touches , it moves the very quick of our hearts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it hurts our feelings when we think of this petty misery , this every-day misery of our most ordinary human life . He struggles on . Fewer and fewer are his friends ; deeper and deeper sinks his poverty . Along with this there are some exceedingly rich domestic incidents . There are episodical matters very well managed , both as descriptive scenes , and in their bearing upon the winding up of the story . This proceeds so steadily , and in the main so evenly , that we find it difficult to imagine how the author will bring it out , or whether he will not simply drop the reader by the way , until at last , by a very sudden incident , striking indeed , and yet , by its extreme probability saving a vast deal of tiresome plot-developing machinery , Parkinson is made comfortable in his old age , with a character well and religiously developed by the disciplinary process through which lie has passed . He becomes a true Christian , we think , though the author does not say so . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can there be to interest us , it may be asked , in such an ordinary character , and in such a plain story as this ? There is matter of the deepest interest ; of that the reader may be assured . It pervades the book , not only the main , but also the episodical , or incidental , narratives . There is the striking episode of Downer , the poor Wall-Street drudge , enduring // poverty , toil , the contumacy of men who have money as he had once , suffering finally , and that undeservedly , the loss even of his Wall-Street reputation , yet laboring on for his dear world at home , and presenting a picture of domestic excellence equal to any that was ever drawn by the poet or the novelist . We have been greatly interested , fascinated we may say , with this most original , yet most ordinary , character of old Sol Downer . We should love to dwell longer upon it , but it would interfere with our main purpose . It is a very peculiar creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it in the whole range of fictitious literature . We would simply say , in passing , that the author might safely rest his literary reputation on this one admirable sketch , and the hearty , healthy , truthful interest he has succeeded in throwing about it . We have expressed the conviction that our author is a religious man , and that his knowledge of human nature is sound , because grounded on those Scriptures which are no less a revelation of man to himself than of God to man . But this Mr. Parkinson , who is the hero , if the book had such a thing as a hero , does not seem commended to us for his piety . He has a serious fit now and then , but does not appear to be a very religious character ; and there is no attempt , even after he has gone through all his hard discipline , and becomes subdued , and seems to have a new and higher life , to make him a very remarkable convert , detailing his experience and warning others . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is set in contrast with the pious man of the book , if we may so characterize him , from the stress that is laid upon his religions profession . Golding is a member of the Church ; he is , moreover , an elder in the Church ; he is a scrupulous attendant of the weekly prayer-meeting ; he gives to missionary societies ; and yet this Wall-Street representative of business and Christianity behaves very cruelly to poor Parkinson , who , though not a member of the Church , is an attendant , with his pious wife , in the same congregation . They hear the same sermons ; their children go to the same Sunday school ; all presents the appearance of religious and congregational respectability , until the non-professing worldling // fails , and his more spiritual co-worshipper hurries to his lawyer for an attachment against the bankrupt 's assets , and a process which will consign him to a prison . To a superficial view it might seem that the author had an irreligious purpose here , and meant to make a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Golding is not a foolish , canting hypocrite . He is no hypocrite at all . This character in the hands of Dickens is , generally , a very absurd and superficial one . Our author gives us a deeper chapter in human nature . Golding is no hypocrite , but a fair representative of numbers who sincerely profess religion , and think they have it . They are men who at some period of their lives have had much trouble about their souls ; they have been converted , or supposed themselves converted ; they pray sincerely , and even fervently , though with little or no self-knowledge ; they mean sincerely , in some way , to serve God ; they become zealous for all good things , very conservative in the state , stanch supporters of the ministry , lovers of social order , respecters of the Sabbath , warm opponents of infidelity , diligent in business , fervent in spirit , liberal to missions , yet counting as of the very essence of Christianity the precept which requires each man to provide diligently for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , it may be , having no real Christianity at all . Yet , we do not hesitate to say it , amid all this mass of pride and worldliness there may be some true faith , even though it be but the thousandth part of a grain of mustard-seed . There may be some good grain taking root among these thorns , and on this stony ground ; there may be some little religion , some heavenly grace , just living on in that deformed spiritual growth , and which may yet be to it , when disciplined and better brought out , the seed of everlasting life . He is no hypocrite ; we do not think the author meant to paint him so . He is a very poor Christian , - perhaps no Christian at all , - and yet a seeker of salvation in his poor , blind , selfish way . He may not be wholly self-deluded even , but a man whose native depravity , which he shares with all , had , through conventional circumstances , presented an unusually deformed appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been greatly checked and // stifled in its development . To take John Bunyan 's panorama of the race , we might regard even Golding as some sort of pilgrim to the New Jerusalem , - as a man terribly diseased indeed , yet striving to get away from the city of the plague , - stumbling when he can not run , and crawling when he can not walk , - making very poor work of it indeed , and yet better than the man who moves not at all , and who , while equally worldly , connts it as his great virtue that he makes no profession , that he is no hypocrite . We do not know that it is the emotion which the author designed to produce in his reader , but we must say that we feel sorry for Golding , without meaning to confess any sympathy with hypocrites . Perhaps , if he had had the failures and the discipline of Parkinson , he would have been nearly as good a man as he . We should like to have put in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard professor and his non-professing debtor , - the one , through the teaching of adversity , brought to see his wrong and make confession , the other led to feel that there might be some spark of a better life even in the man of whom his judgment had been so severely just . But this would have required the author 's powers of painting to make it effective , and even then it might have deformed the plot and marred the artistic proportion of the work . There is clearly no irreligious intent in the picture drawn of these two characters . Quite the contrary is evident , both in the management and the result . Parkinson , the man who makes no profession , is not set in contrast with the hard professor , with an attempt , constantly manifested , to represent the honesty of the one as better than the religion of the other . That is the way Dickens would have treated the matter ; but Mr. Kimball does no such thing . There is one very natural scene , where the hard-pressed bankrupt stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placidity of his petitions . Parkinson 's motive in this is not at all of the pious kind , and some may say that it has a very irreligious look ; but evidently there is no such purpose . The injured man acts thus in a fit of desperation . It is done , not to show his hostility to religion , or to a religious profession , but to confound Golding . He becomes conscious himself that the // indulgence of such feelings is greatly hurting his own moral constitution , and the scene that follows , where his Christ-like wife so gently , yet so piously , reproves him for his moody vindictiveness , is one of the finest iii the book . We may say here , in passing , that this picture , and the one that soon follows , of the wife 's decline and death , possess the highest order of moral and artistic excellence . It is a Christian scene such as Dickens never painted , when with her dying breath she commends to God her poor bankrupt husband , concerned as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitution with which she leaves him to struggle , but still more for the peril that may thence result to his moral and religious life . Charles , it is coming ; we have little to say to each other , for our whole life has been rounded from day to day by love . I leave you to encounter misery and degradation , and what shall seem disgrace ; but through all preserve your integrity , and at the last there will come a season of repose . God permits me to see this , and to tell you , 0 my husband ! ' After a pause , she continued : I have one request to make ; - her voice trembled . Keep them together . Keep them all around you . Promise me you will not separate . ' " Never ! while I have life , never ! ' I murmured " Kiss me : call the children ! ' " She died that evening. ** Like a master artist , the author gives the most simple and touching outlines . He does not spoil it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linger over the page which is so suggestive , until it becomes absolutely painful through the desire it creates to enjoy , again and again , the fascination of . its exquisite finish . Parkinson is a very imperfect man . lie is far from answering , or being intended , as the type of the moral in distinction from the religious man . But , with all his imperfections , there is one thing that attaches the reader to him , although at first we hardly know how it is , or why it is . It is not merely his hardships and his brave endurance . It is not his honesty in his Wall-Street business , for that is conventional , and sometimes questionable ; it is about as high as prevails in the sphere he has chosen ; and the author evidently claims no merit , and no great sympathy for him , in that respect . We would call it // his spiritual honesty . The term needs defining . By spiritual honesty , then , we may understand , not honesty in the business or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is honest to itself , - which will not think of itself , nor seek to have others think of it , other than it really is , so far as it does and can know itself . It may be consistent with a very imperfect state in other respects . It may be a partner with many frailties , faults , and even sins , to which we would give a darker name . It may exist in the midst of much self-ignorance . Yet , if there is any one native trait in man pleasing to God , - in other words , if there be any native human virtue , it is this : perfect honesty of spirit , in that it seeks not to cover from God , or from itself , anything in itself , be its moral b its apcondition what it may . It would have its being and pearing the same , however much it might be dissatisfied with itself , or feel that its being ought to be something different from what it is . It would not be what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a department of our moral psychology that requires great carefulness of language . We ought to be what we are not . Let us amend , then , by saying , that a soul may seek to be what it is not , without the process of becoming it ; it may be greatly averse to such becoming . It would pass from evil to good by some other road than that conflict which is inseparable from the passage . It would fancy the transition made , and , since there is in all men an abstract admiration of righteousness , it would talk to itself , and to its Maker , as though it were made , when really there had not been the movement of a hair 's breadth from the old status . It wants the soft , melting feeling of humility , and so would fain think itself humble , without any humiliation ; it wants the luxury of penitence , of which it has read in books of religious romance , without the pwnitentia , the penance , the pa*na , the inseparable pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the etymology of the word . Such a feeling is the growth of religious sentimentalism ; and the opposite of it , or the absence of it , whether the soul be conscious of its state or not , is what we mean by honesty of spirit , - dreading a false virtue more than a positive vice , - fearing not only to act or speak , but even to think a lie . Parkinson has this spiritual honesty , not as we // have laboriously analyzed it , but as belonging to the native simplicity of a very imperfect , yet unpretending , character . It is far , too , from being a something else which sometimes would ape its semblance . It is not the worse than Pharisaical spirit that loves to say : " I am a plain , blunt man , That only speak right on ; I am no hypocrite ; I make no profession ; I say no long prayers ; I fast not twice a day ; I am no church-member ; I thank God I am not like some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that Pharisee . " We do not know that the author had it distinctly in view , but the character of which we speak is there , - all the better drawn , perhaps , because he did not have it prominently in mind when he made the picture . It comes out of the other elements he has used in the composition all the more vividly , perhaps , than would have been the case had he said to himself , " Now I will paint such a man . " Had he so designed expressly , he would doubtless have overdone , - the sketch would have been artificial and untrue . The writer has been drawn to make the picture , just as the reader has been led to see it , - from its admirable keeping , its perfect consistency with the disciplinary scenes through which his story derives its ever-sustained , harmonious interest . A passage from the book furnishes the best possible illustration of what we mean by this spiritual honesty . Parkinson is moody , low-spirited , and inclined to be sentimental . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted by happy sounds from the next room .

I can not say that I had any habit of prayer , although I was a conscientious believer in the truths of our sacred religion A sweet solemnity took possession of me ; and when they had finished , tears were in my eyes I pressed my daughter to my heart , while now the tears flowed freely down my face . I rose and walked up and down the room . Miserable hypocrite , ' I said to myself , you are claiming for yourself to-day an exalted religious // feeling ; say rather it is a morbid sentimentality arising from disappointment in business . Hallo ! stop that ! Be a man . Do not insult your Maker with this cast-off performance . Wait awhile till things go smooth with you ; then , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that sort of thing , you can have the opportunity . ' Shocked by this sudden revulsion , the idea that feelings which I regarded as sacred were nothing but a phase of low spirits threw me back on myself again . Alice was still in the room , regarding me with painful solicitude . Then , ' I said , in the society of your family , in the honest determination to bear what comes with courage and fortitude , in the sifting the chaff out of yourself ; and preserving what wheat remains for the harvest , - that is a better work , just at present , than indulging in a sentimental whine over your sins . " ' - p. 78 . It is the spiritual truthfulness rather than the false theology of this passage with which , critically , we have here to do . Mr. Kimball has a way of letting his characters talk after their own fashion , and , if they utter any sentiment at which good people might be shocked , he corrects it in a note which he inserts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is undoubtedly self-righteousness in what Parkinson says . There is a wrong view of God , and a mistake us to the speaker 's power to recommend himself to his " Maker " by future good conduct , or in the thought that he must earn something before he can be pious . The author , or the editor , as we must call him , corrects this admirably , and most orthodoxly , in the subjoined marginal note . " We think Mr. Parkinson unnecessarily severe with himself . That we neglect to turn to God for support until other sources fail , is no evidence that our feelings are not sincere . Although it seems ungracious to seek our Maker only after every earthly hope has perished , still this is just what HE tells us we may do . Doubtless , with many , their feelings will not stand the test of returning prosperity . But we have always felt that , whether genuine or not , they forcibly illustrate man 's recognition of a HIGHER POWER . - Editor of . /Jlemoirs . " The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other aspect , - its spiritual truthfulness . The speaker does not know himself , but he means to be and appear , both before God and to himself , no other than himself . What he says about a " sentimental whining over his sins** some would // regard as very irreligious , both in thought and language . " Nothing , " they would say , " could be more gracious and hopeful than such a feeling of tenderness , and produced , too , by such a touching and beautiful cause , - those dear little children and their pious Sunday-school hymns . " They feel utterly disappointed , shocked it may be , at the result . " Why , this was the very place to have had the man converted . " It would have been then , we reply , most likely a false conversion , a sentimental cheating of himself , and an attempt to cheat his Maker . It would have made , perhaps , no better a Christian of him than Golding . He , too , might have been moved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Sunday-school hymns . Perhaps that was the very way in which he was converted . Even the hard Golding may have had his sentimental moods . He could be touched by the eloquent and the tender . He was fond of good preaching , doubtless , and may have been often melted into a placid Sunday-evening spirituality after listening to " the lovely song and the pleasant voice " of one who had described the beauty of the Christian life and the odiousness of Mammon . He might have had all this experience , and yet remained the hard , worldly man he was when " he took his fellow-servant by the throat , and said unto him , Pay me that thou owest . " Such sentimentalities may have their value in certain aspects . They may aid religion when religion actually exists , just as the solemn music of the organ may aid worship if the worshipping spirit be previously there to receive it . But as a substitute for worship , or regarded as religion itself , they are worse than worthless . To have had Parkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian , or it might have made him a very poor Christian ; but , on the other hand , the seeming process , though far from being hypocritical in the gross sense of the word , might have done him a positive spiritual injury . It might have marred his native manliness , - which although fallen has still its fair proportions , - without imparting any heavenly grace . Whether he ought not to have had sterner convictions is not now the question ; but he saw the shallowness , the deceptiveness , of these emotions , and he threw them away . Some may object to the author 's language , // and find fault with the " sentimental whine " ; but he has drawn a picture as true as it is valuable . It is timely , moreover . These are the days of an aesthetic religionism . It is sought for its emotions . There is a truth in such a tendency which makes it all the more dangerous from its accompanying deceptiveness . We ought to be moved , we must be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may become as selfish as the love of money , or the love of fame . We desire the spiritual luxury , and , if it comes not otherwise , it must be got up . The soul is not directly hypocritical in this ; but unconsciously , almost , it seeks to be what it is not , as we have before defined the strange expression . It does not mean to present outwardly a false appearance of the spirit within ,  --  that is the grosser and far less usual hypocrisy , - but it would make this world within look different to itself , look different to its Maker , without actually being , or becoming , what it can never be through any efforts of its own , or any self-moving spiritual life . The cause of this strange deception is our mistaking the abstract admiration of goodness , our " assent " to it , yea , " our delight in it after the inward man , " for goodness itself . All men have this admiration , and even love , of virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter loss may be the very thing which makes the great and final perdition . All men have good principles . The vilest wretch on earth is a lover of right , a sincere and hearty defender of right , when it is regarded as the antagonist , not to himself , or his selfish individuality , but to an abstract wrong . Let the worst man read a fictitious story , and he is wounded if it does not come out right . He even feels a kind of indignation , as though there had been some wrong done to him , if the good are not rewarded , and the evil punished . Such is this abstract love of truth , per se , that even thieves and murderers might be trusted to make a code of laws for a Utopian community . They would make good laws , - all the better , perhaps , from their larger experience of the evils most to be guarded against . So is it , especially , in the placid contemplation of moral states . The picture is beautiful . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " still far wide , " away off in that " region of dis // similitude " to which Augustine compares this strange anomaly in our mysterious human nature . The celestial object is so bright , so magnified , so very near it seems , that we could almost touch it with our hands ; but alas ! millions of miles are but feeble measures of our real distance . Even though the enrapturing scene were near , we mistake our true position in relation to it . From the Mount of Worldliness , whereon we stand , we look over to the Mount of Holiness , as it rises before us with its vision of the Land of Beulah . We think to pass the narrow , intervening space on some gentle " bridge of sighs , " or a step would take us from the one side to the other , and that step , we sometimes fancy , has been made . We think we are there , when in truth we must get down from our false height , - far down in the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill ; and then it is a steep and toilsome path , , ia*po* 8* *ai opOto* oq.Lo* E71 avrlJv . " Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life . " We can not go from evil to good but through pain , - ov 7ap otov TE c*XX ( o* cu3tKta* awaXXari-ea-Oat , - " for it is impossible for us to be otherwise delivered from unrighteousness , " - ov* otov re , - it is morally impossible . In saying this , the wisest of the Greeks knew nothing of that great mystery , the part borne in our salvation by the sufferings of another ; but he taught , even as Christ and Paul teach , that each individual , too , has his struggle . " No cross , no crown , " is still the Christian 's motto . It is * OXb*frew9 , " through hard rubbing , " - through " tribulation , " - that " we enter the kingdom of God . " We do not say that all other experience is false , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped placidly over without cross or conflict , - but there is danger of delusion . Some theologians maintain that , unlike things without , the desire of moral good is the actual possession of it . But it would seem to be contrary to Scripture , as well as to a true experience . It may rather be as " when a thirsty man dreameth , and behold he drinketh ; he awaketh , and lo , he is empty , his soul is faint , he still hath appetite . " This sentimental pietism is deeply infecting the age , and // giving a false coloring to everything about it . It pervades our religious literature ; it is in our Sunday-school books ; it is poisoning the minds of our children . It is bringing in an artificial virtue , which a right mind dreads more than a positive vice , seeing that the first , aside from its own deep evil , is ever the forerunner of the second . It does not merely substitute feeling for truth , but in time destroys all that awes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in emotion itself . There is another state of soul , less emotional , less religious , some would think , but , morally and spiritually , far better , - whether we regard it as belonging to the natural man , or as coming from a supernatural grace . It is that utterance of the spirit which says : " Let me be nothing but what I am . Spiritually deformed as I may be , as something within teaches me I must be , let me appear such before my Maker , rather than seek to veil that deformity by any unreal , self-roused , or selfcherished appearances of my emotional nature . There is a luxury in such emotion , there is a seeming virtue in it ; but be my soul harder than the nether millstone , drier than the sands of the desert , more sapless than the withered root , rather than have it the seat of any false feeling , however fair in appearance , or soothing in effect ; let my spirit be dark as Erebus rather than be cheered by any unreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmed by any artificial heat . " Is it thus cold and hard , is it thus dark and worldly , so let it lie before the Divine eye , rather than even think of any false propitiation , or the screen of any inward state that can only conceal it from itself . Be honest . It is all that man can do . It will not cure the moral deformity , but it greatly aids the true discipline ; it leaves open the way of the true healing . Such a " waiting , " too , " upon the Lord , " may be very far from the state of spiritual indifference ; such a life may be the continual presentation of the prayer , - " Search me , 0 God , and know my heart , try me and know my thoughts , and see the evil way that may be in me , and lead me in the way everlasting . " But we are writing a homily instead of a criticism . There is another scene where Parkinson appears to better advantage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years 11 * // of discipline have been bearing fruit , although he himself seems to be sinking lower and lower in the worldly scale . To the loss of property , and the loss of the commonest domestic comfort , there is , at last , added the loss of reputation . He hears whisperings of the street , the talk of men who doubt his honesty . It is the same injustice that had haunted the steps of his poor friend , Sol Downer . He thought he had given up all , and was truly submissive to the Divine will ; but here is the revelation of an idol in his soul dearer than honesty itself , and he wails , like Micali of old , when that idol is taken from him . It is the crowning process of self-knowledge , and we can not help greatly admiring the way in which Mr. Kimball presents it to us . " The people were fast leaving the street while I stood idly looking on . My attention was at that moment excited by hearing my name pronounced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps near where I was , - suspicious and sensitive , it seemed as if my hearing was doubly acute . " What an old scoundrel he s got to be ! ' said one . " That s a fact , ' said another . " Dear me , dear me , I ca n't think it possible , ' added a third ; he was always considered such an honorable man . ' " I ca n't help that , ' said the first voice . Loomis says he s been in the Tombs all the morning , - he and Devine , for swindling ; and when he found he had to be put through , the old knave planked down the cash in less than no time . ' * " Two of the voices were familiar to me . I thought especially that I recognized that of the gentleman who ventured a word in my favor , but I had no desire to satisfy myself . I did not turn round , but started swiftly for my house . " I saw nothing , heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed past Alice , ran up stairs to my chamber , locked and bolted the door , threw myself on the bed , and cried , - cried piteously as children cry . " - p. 392 . Thus ends abruptly Chapter XV . It prepares us for the scene that follows in Chapter XVI . " The next day was Sunday . I rose , dressed myself mechanically , // 127 1862. and went down to breakfast . I was suffering from no sharp sensations . A dull , heavy , muffled pain , at regular intervals , took the place of the usual nervous energetic action of the heart . Literally , it seemed to be broken . " So much were Alice and Matilda impressed by the change in me , that neither ventured to ask for an explanation . The younger children shared magnetically in the feeling . What a silent table ! How different from our usual cheerfulness ! " At the proper hour we all started for church . I thought the placid face of the old clergyman looked more benevolent and tranquil than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to myself . Shall I ever be at rest ? ' " The services did not attract my attention , until the text was announced . It was as follows : - " The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity ; but a wounded spirit who can bear ? ' " My friends , ' said the old minister , the translation of this verse from the Hebrew is not felicitous . Let me improve it by another rendering . " The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity ; but a wounded spirit , - what shall sustain it ? " That is the question I propose to answer this morning . " The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity ! What a statement of the power and , might and pride of the human race ! Ah ! yes ; in perils by land and by water ; through misfortunes and calamities ; through contests , troubles , and dangers ; amidst disease and pestilence ; and it may even nerve him to meet death itself with composure . " But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the keepers of the house shall tremble , if a wound is inflicted here , ' ( he laid his hand upon his heart , ) what is to be done ? The form of the question in the text implies that there can be no help from within . Physically , a man can not support himself by his own weight . Neither can the spirit receive support through its own power . ' " The venerable man went on to show how only the FATHER of our spirits ' can heal the wounds of the spirit . That it is not until a man is brought into direct communion with his MAKER , that he is armed at all points , and proof against whatever may happen . " I have no design to give even an abstract of the discourse , but only to convey the leading , paramount idea . I listened entranced . Every word seemed prepared for me , directed towards me . " By degrees , as he proceeded , I felt a sense of relief steal over me. // The action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of instinctive effort , I ejaculated in a low tone , God help me pp. 393 , 394 . It is best to leave such a passage to its own effect . We can not , however , help remarking on the illustration it furnishes of much that has been given in the previous pages of this article , or moral lecture , as it might rather be called . Nothing can be more simple and touching than the narrative , but it is no sentimentalism . It stands in marked contrast with the other experience . That was but a shadow , - a surface thing ; here all is real , solid , sound as Scripture and truth itself . The voice of children 's hymns , " anthems of nature , " the solemn swell of the organ , these are all very good , very profitable to the soul that has already " the fear of the Lord , which is the beginning of wisdom** they have in them a certain religiousness , or religiosity , but they are not religion . Dependence , want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deliverer , - these are inseparable elements of the idea . " God help me ! " - here all is real ; in this short prayer each word is emphatic , each word contains an infinitude , either absolutely or in relation . There is the infinite height of the Helper , the infinite lowliness of the object , the infinity of need that brings them both together , in the prayer of faith on the one side , and the immeasurable condescension of the other . This is relig'io , a binding back , a finding of the lost , a reunion of the wandering spirit to Him from whom it came , and from whom it had so far and so grievously departed . The author , the critic , the reader , may fear to assert such a state as belonging to his personal experience ; but we may not doubt its reality . " There is nothing in the universe , " says Archbishop Leighton , " stronger than a believing soul . " Even as a thought of the mind , it has a sublimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all philosophy , even as it soars above our most common worldly thinking .
