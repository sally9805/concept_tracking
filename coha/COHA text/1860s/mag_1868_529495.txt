txt THE GREAT ElI IMBROGLIO . THE u ? timate solution of the Erie contest *waits the next election of the board of directors . Until the second Tuesday of October we shall have plenty of surmises ; there will possibly be very strange and conilictifig tactics , the purposes of the capitalists who have ventured many millions in the fight will become more and more enigmatical and inscrutable ; but of the real import of the war the rightfully curious public will have no certain knowledge before the autumnal meeting of the Erie shareholders . In our present review of the recent developments regarding the Erie Railroad , therefore , no attempt will he made to fo*ecast the future . Neither shall we essay to explain the aspect which affairs have seemed to assume since the passage of the anti-consolidation hill through the New York Lebislature . It suffices that what has already transpired of the immediate or habitual policy of the principal actors in this unfinished drama is of a nature so notably representative of railway management and stock operations in America as to justify careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The primary fact , the overshadowing fact , the fact which should be kept steadfastly in the foreground in all speculations upon the conflict , is that Cornelius Vanderbilt had resolved to secure control of the Frie Railroad , in order to largely enhance the cost of travel and freightage throughout every rood of soil in the State whereof with one exception he is the wealthiest citizen . The programme was bro*d , and with many ram* ifications . If completed , it would affect disastrously , not only the producinb class and the national commerce , but the very share-gamblers who have been most clamorous in its favor . Nevertheless , the scheme was defended so sagaciously , so secretly , and with such incomparable sophistry , that for many months its full measure was most imperfectly comprehended , while it encountered only halting and spasmodic opposition . The general public first became cognizant of the monopoly programme during the initial session of the recent Constitutional Convention of New York . At that time a strenuous effort was made to estop finally and comprehensively all combinations looking toward exorbitant charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle was the insertion among the proposed amendments of a clause forbidding the Legislature from authorizing " the consolidation of railroad corporations owning parallel or competing lines of road . " The measure naturally provoked a very considerable discussion , and in the course of its advocacy there gradually transpired certain facts and hypotheses of which the following are the most trustworthy . // By a series of rapid and enormous purchases of stock , the Vanderbilt family had acquired tile control , not only of the Harlem and Hudson River Railroads connecting the commercial with the legislative capital of the State , but also of the New York Central , which traverses the inland counties from Albany to Buffalo . The capital stock of these lines may be thus tabulated : - Present capital , - Hudson . Bonds outstanding Jan. a , s568 Present capital , - Harlem . Bonds outstanding Jan. s , i568 . Present capital , - New York Central Bonds outstanding Jan. a , a865 Giving in sum total 14,000,000 5,000,000 fi , Soo , ooo 5,000,000 28,990,000 11,347,000 $71,137,000 The fourteen millions credited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half millions of actual money , and owes its creation to one of those peculiar financial expedients by which shrewd American capitalists acquire the enviable title of railroad kings . When the head of the dynasty which now dominates over the three affined companies made his first move toward empire by securing possession of the river route , he inaugurated a system of economical management , special traffic arrangements , and vast construc*tion outlays which afforded a specious pretext for augmenting the capital stock . It was therefore voted that the then capital of seven millions should be increased to fourteen by an issue of bonus shares at fifty per cent . Each stockholder paid in fifty dollaPs , and received scrip , the par value of which was one hundred , but which sold in Vall Street at forty-five premium . This splendid maneuvre , by which the company obtained three and a half millions for the construction and repair fund , while the stockholders doubled their money , presented features too large and captivating to lapse into desuetude . It was now proposed to repeat the same operation along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be consolidated . The scrip dividend in this second scheme was to be 33i- per cent . This would give : July , Fresh capital , - Hudson 6,000,000 Harlem 3,200,000 N. V. Central . . . . 9,663,000 With previous sum total of capital . . . 71,137,000 Capital of consolidation . . . . $ 90,000,000 But this magnificent project had one important drawback . The increasing business upon the coalescing roads , though certain , is essentially slow . It was inconceivable that the ordinary earnings could allow of current dividends on so vast an augmentation of capital . The statistics of railroads are subject to the tyranny of arithmetic . If the subtrahend remain the same , and the subtractor be multiplied 33* or 50 per cent , the remainder will be definitely decreased . It was evident that the profitableness of the programme depended upon the possible elasticity of the rates of transportation . At this dilemma Mr. Vanderbilt showed himself in no wise disconcerted . Dividends must be provided for , and he would therefore advance the tariff . Experts in railroads are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earnings . It costs a trifle less to carry passengers , somewhat more to transport merchandise ; but the iPverage is about three fourths of gross income , while out of the residual twenty-five per cent must proceed the money for repairs and replacement , the interest on bonds , the contingent fund , and the dividends . Now it would put the corppany to no greater expense to carry a ton of wheat at eight cents than at four , while a merely marginal increase on rates of goods in bulk and of passenger travel would secure quite satisfactory profits . on the new shares . Such an enhancement of current rates * Under the impress of modern ideas , this item has recently acquired startling proportions . The Union Pacific , for instance , paid not less than $500,000 for services rendered to tlse company hy lobbyists at Washington . It recently cost the Missouri Pacific Railroad $ 192,175 to secure the possession of that road by State legislation . The New York Central credits $250,000 to the contingeist fund for expenses at Albany in 1866-67 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular prejudice against the Camden and Amboy Railroad , which has certainly attained its ends in Congress and at Trenton by a far more economical expenditure .. 9 // was therefore a necessary feature of the scheme . From one aspect this programme was not only plausible , but feasible . Against the irritation incident to an advance in charges stood the habitual lethargy of the citizens of the United States , who pay six cents as readily as five for a ride in a stre*t car , ten cents as quickly as six in omnibuses , and forty cents for expressage where they once paid twenty-five ; while even if popular excitement should so far develop itself as to prompt Albany legislation , there was " influence " at hand quite adequate to check agitation . It was the ever-present danger of competition which constituted the important obstacle to the measure . As long as the Erie Railroad occupied the position of an active rival , it was impossible either to effect dividends on the fictitious stock , or even to insure large returns on the genuine capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement had been entered into , not only with this line , but also with the Pennsylvania Central , by which the general rates had been kept up very much above a reasonable maximum . Goods shipped from St. Louis to New York at the average charge of$ 2.62 were carried from the same point to Baltimore for $ 1.10 . From Chicago there was a like invidious distinction of sixty-two cents ; from Cincinnati , of eighty cents . On large importations the difference amounted to immense sums , and was threatening disaster to the mercantile interests of the metropolis . Nevertheless , this exorbitant tax was found utterly insufficient for the purposes of the prospective consolidation , and a more intimate alliance became of paramount importance . One of two courses was open to the president of the New York Central . He must either secure the unlimited co-operation of the Erie direction by treaty , or he must control the road by buying up a majority of the stock . Each of these alternatives presented peculiar difficulties , and subsequent events would seem to prove that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he should finally adopt . It is a historical fact , that he made essays in both these particulars . We have now to consider the special embarrassments of the problem . The Erie is one of the most important links in the great chain of interior railway connection between the producing and the consuming States . It was built under the im*5ulsion of popular excitement , amid keen opposition , and with the disadvantage , at the start , of being enormously expensive . Its broad and massive line sweeps through a country of singular picturesqueness , while , for every glory of river gorge and mountain slope its stockholders have had to pay enormously in deep cuts , solid causeways , and firm-built bridges . There is scarcely a road in the country which will compare with it for unavoidable and immense engineering expenses . Moreover , its splendid gauge , while undeniably the most luxurious to travellers , and admitting of excessiye freighting , is notoriously costly , both in construction and repairs . Still further : the central idea of the New York and Erie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of comparatively straight lines , and through trade , rather than intermediate traffic . This principle underlay the construction of the Illinois Central , and is seen in most remarkable activity in the Pacific railroads . Experience has demonstrated the wisdom of the theory . It has been seen that population accepts the fresh channels , that cities rapidly spring up , that manufacture as well as agriculture centralizes itself around the new highways , and real estate triples and quadruples its value everywhere within sound of the locomotive whistle . But all these immeasurable changes come after the completion of the roads ; and , in the interval , the rewards to invested capital are in inverse ratio to desert . It has happened , therefore , that what is averagely true of the first stockholders , even of such roads as pass through a comparatively well-populated country from the first , was exasperatin4y true of the original share-owners of Erie . The // agriculturists and land-owners throughout all the inland lower tier of counties were enriched , New York City was enriched , but the stockholders were hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , which he invested out of pure public spirit , his loss was forty per cent , and it is believed that his case was comparatively a fortunate one . But there is a worse fact beyond . Ordinarily the capitalist who steps in and buys the shares which have proved fatal to former investment succeeds in bringing up the property to a dividendpaying basis . In the case of the New York and Erie this was never accomplished . Had Dr. Kane discovered an orange-grove on the borders of the Central Polar Sea , he would not have been more astonished than would have been a holder of the old Erie stock by the announcement of a six-per-cent dividend . The road was not merely expensive in building , but it had the misfortune of requiring large sums for repair and improvement , while its direction never appears to have acted in the best interests of the company . Although it had received a State gift of three millions , it was always in debt , from which it extricated itself only by fresh emissions of stock or bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This exceptional phase finally resulted in the bankruptcy of the company . The mortgages were foreclosed , the property passed into the hands of recewers , a reorganization of'the corporation *was effected , and under a new name , biit with much the same management as before , the road made a fresh appeal to public confidence . The confidence , however , never came . That large portion of the well-to-do and opulent classes which buys stocks for the sake of dividends alone refused to invest in the new scrip . The contractors were " suspect , " the employees and directors were " suspect " ; an atmosphere of distrust closed in around the coinpany , as the spring fog closes around the Erie ferry-boats . This disastrous suspicion gave birth to one of the most curious phenomena in railway annals . The really profitable roads in America are seldom quoted on the stock-list . The old Camden and Amboy never was . Neither is Panama stock ; neither is Central Pacific . Other roads , like the Illinois Central , are only partially used for speculation ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds , or held by local capitalists . But it has resulted to Erie , by reason of its unparalleled expenditures , its indubitably incompetent management * and the redistribution of its shares , that the sum total of its stock in all its vast volume has become " street " property . Discarded as a legitimate investment , it has been taken up by the lower or lesser operators on Change and employed for " corners , " to control elections , for all possible uses but that for which it was origin ally created . With no deeper significance than a ball in the game of financial battledore and shuttlecock , or counters in rouge d noire , it has acquired a notoriety the most shameful and infamous . The hard practical argof of Wall Street has a certain odd admixture of metaphor in its texture . Like the grammarian of verse , it deals in " longs " and " shorts . " A share-bidder who rises or falls with the market is described as " riding in the saddle . " A broker who temporarily yields to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " True to this rude tendency for figurative language , the stock board has shown its contempt for the creature of its shameless uses by affixing to Erie the terse Saxon epithet which King James 's * This vague phrase has a very definite meaning among railway men , especially as regards Erie . It includes quite a variety of improprieties , such as the borrowing of money to pay dividends , the concealment of debts from the published reports , the Wall Street operations of responsible directors , secret arrangements with contractors , &amp;c. , &amp;c . It is asserted that , although no salary attaches to the position of director , yet no man of intellect , however poor on assuming office , has ever left the Erie board other than rich . A former secretary , who had never been more than a newspaper reporter until accepting place in the company , died worth half a million . Any oqe familiar with the history of the Napoleon Transportation Company , connected with the Camden and Amboy Railroad , will comprehend how this opulence is generally attained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylon . It is " on the street . " It is the scarlet woman of the Stock Exchange . This statement of the actual condition of Erie scrip will enable the reader to properly understand one feature of the problem which Mr. Vanderbilt was now attempting to solve . The whole volume of stock last October amounted to about twenty-five millions . If his purpose , therefore , were supreme control , he would have to purchase one hundred and thirty thousand shares . The fact that this stock was entirely in the street might , or might not , be in his favor . It would enable his agents to work more rapidly , but it also subjected his movements to observation , with the possibility of encountering an opponent who could either hopelessly embarrass the enterprise , or convert it into that species of victory which is worse than defeat . It remained for events to determine whether such an obstacle would disclose itself ; but the King of Central well knew that there was but one person throughout all Wall Street who could contest supremacy with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Commodore Vanderbilt , Mr. Drew is far his senior in all that pertains to the mystery of stocks . Not so wealthy , * he is essentially more subtle ; and in the present issue he had the immense advantage of working from interior lines . His connection with Erie has been a long one , and in the devious transactions which this intercourse necessi-. tated , he had come to comprehend in minutest detail every " point ' ? on which speculations in its stocks must hinge . It is an open question whether the road profited by the intimacy . On certain occasions , it is true , Mr. Drew has come to the rescue of the direction , and * Mr. Vanderbilt is credited with property to the amount of forty millions ; Mr. Drew , with fourteen millions. , Such estimates are , however , very delusive , as they depend upon valuations of stock , - a species of wealth the most fluctuating and uncertain in the world . That they are each very rich , we are quite free to admit . Mr. Drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions in one day without borrowing a dollar . propped up the waning credit of Erie by extraordinary loans , where other capitalists declined the proffered terms . But there was something in the nature of these financial expedients that reminds us of Sir Morton Peto , while at best they operated like high stimulants , flushing the exchequer of the company for the moment , to be invariably suc* ceeded by long periods of still greater abasement . In one particular there is a dim resemblance between the monopolizing president and the speculative director . The former , partly from honorable pride , but not less from a personal theory of *tock finance as complete and more secure than the " systems " of players at Irente et quaranle , habitually tides up the shares of the roads under his control to the maximum register . Every one knows that Hudson and New York Central rule higher than the actual dividends would justify . Nor are there wanting acute thinkers , who hold that this fictitious appreciation is quite as questionable a procedure as any unwarrantable depression . Among railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as an unusual and sterling virtue ; and the friends of Mr. Drew claim that to a certain limit his policy is the same . The stock of the old New York and Erie corporation sold for 17 . Under the new rJgirne , Mr. Drew has seldom permitted it to fall below 6o . But at this point he stops . To lift Erie to par , and to float it to 120 or 145 , as Vanderbilt persistently does Hudson , is contrary to the whole bias of his nature . A believer in the doctrine of total depravity , and an active participant in the sombre transactions of both stock-boards , the speculative director has acquired that melancholy tinge of character which gives to all its victims in Wall Street the epithet of " bear . " Having from his official relations very thorough knowledge of the intimate affairs of the company , he is able to predict with something like astronomical accuracy the rise *nd fall of its shares in the market ; and his constitutional infirmity // invariably leads him to employ this information in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer large quantities of shares for future delivery at figures below ruling rates , or , as his enemies would say , to pledge himself to render the scrip of the corporation of which he is a leading member less valuable than the share-board estimates it , is his familiar practice . At times , indeed , this leviathan of the Stock Exchange has appeared to reverse his habitual rule , and to look more hopefully upon the resources of the great broad-gauge line . The public has not forgotten the famous movement of i866 , when Mr. Drew , as is popularly believed , formed a " pool " with other speculators who were committed to the rise , and lifted Erie buoyantly to 97 . But it would seem that the preternatural distrust of the constitutional " bear " had in no respect lost its empire . Side by side with every dollar invested in the " corner " Mr. Drew staked five dollars in short sales . At last this strange financial zigzag reached its crisis . The original " pool " threatened to transmute itself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own creation , turned to the Erie Company for an instrument to check this untoward appreciation of its shares . Some little while previous he had lent the corporation three millions and a half , for which there had been deposited in his hands. , as collateral security , convertible bonds and unissued stock at sixty cents on the dollar . Mr. Drew is well known as a powerful lay preacher , and his appeals during periods of great religious interest have been helpful to the conversion of many souls , but his capacity for converting bonds is not less remarkable . Quietly but quickly he " placed " all these collaterals , amounting to fifty-eight thousand shares , upon the market. * A chill struck the mer * These shares he bought of the company for $ 3,480,000 . He sold them in the Street when the stock stood at 97 . Supposing that the average price realized was 8o , this would give Mr. Drew a clear profit of $ s , s6o , ooo ; hut , as he bought up the stock again when it reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curial Exchange . Stock dropped to 40 . The operators for the rise were recklessly ruined , while Mr. Drew , who had already made more than half a million , now ventured on long purchases , brought the shares rapidly up to a healthy figure , and then retired from the field much elated , much execrated , and so powerful that he could overlook and stand superior to his defamers . One feature in this magnificent transaction , as will presently be shown , links it with the recent imbroglio . The details , however , are not without their immediate lesson . It can not fail to be apparent to the reader , that a gentleman whose fatal facility for rapid and perfectly safe stock operations was quite as remunerative as the far- sighted methods of Mr. Vanderbilt , would not readily abandon his own system , and accept the other , unless prompted thereto by very potent reasons . Had the president of the New York Central any such reasons at command ? The answer to this question , so far as relates to known facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at Mr. Vanderbilt 's service , there is no satisfactory evidence that he employed them with any success for the purposes of coalition . Indeed , the first positive revelation of his intentions which has reached the public was that of a combination in which Mr. Drew was wholly ignored . Between New England and the distant West there has long existed a subtle bond , the offspring of a sentiment and an aspiration , both of them legitimate , but as yet attended by scarcely commensurate fruit . That wonderful homogeneity of Eastern States , which through its superfluous population has created the West , and given tone to Occidental communities , where its presence , gauged by statistics , is but dimly So also in the case of the five million convertible bonds , the sale of which led to the late widespread litigation . Mr. Drew bought them at 74 , and sold the stock largely at 8o ; thus clearing a fair fortune from the company , apart from what he made on the street . To transactions like these Erie owes much of its ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial intercourse with the vast agricultural resources of the Lakes , the Mississippi , and the Pacific , as of predominant importance . From the aspect of social science , it would seem proper that what are pre-eminently the producing and consuming States should be brought into intimate relations . Nor are there wanting many cogent political reasons for such a restoration of the national balance as shall keep the Middle States more in equipoise , and check the tendencies of commerce to enormous concentration in and around New York . Heretofore , however , peculiar obstacles have stood in the way of this consummation . Although Boston is some twenty-four hours nearer Europe than is New York , yet the latter city has been enabled by the convergence of existing lines to hold the grain market ti*htly under control . The problem of New England capital at the present time is to obviate this disadvantage ; and among the enterprises looking to this end is the Boston , Hartford , and Erie Railroad . The plans of its projectors include the tapping of the Erie line at Newburg . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the coal section , but all that trade which now finds its way to the mouth of the Hudson by the short route from Buffalo . At the head of this railway movement was Mr. John S. Eldridge , a gentleman comparatively new in Wall Street , bound to no clique , clean in record , and believed to entertain the somewhat obsolete idea that railroads are created by legislatures solely for public advantage and shareholders ' profit . As the route which he favored was to connect with Erie , and as it was desirable that a close alliance between the two roads should be effected , not only for the purpose of securing an indorsement of four millions bonds of the Boston company , but for making the parent line a solvent and dividendpaying property , he determined to so shape the approaching election as to sweep the great speculative director from the board . When , therefore , the stock-jobbing owners of Erie began to prepare their proxies , they found among the solicitors for their vote a monopolizing railroad kii*g , a great share-gambler , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of his own section , - a section signally exempt from corruption in its corporations , and as hostile to monopoly in transportation as it is to monopoly in labor . The sanctity of truth compels us to relieve " the street " from any imputation of giving its suffrages to either of the three rivals out of any romantic impulse of admiration for their individual qualities . A majority of the stockholders parted with their stock outi*4ght ; a large majority sold their proxies , and retained their shares. * As the *nomentous second Tuesday drew near , the chief contestants began to count their votes and make their estimate of chances . It was found that neither of the three had a wajority . Although the Eastern party held the larger vote ; yet a combination of any two would ruin the third . That such a dilemma should have arisen would seem to prove that Mr. Vanderbilt chose to make his first attempt in the vast consolidating programme by securing the co-operation of the Erie direction , rather than by controlling it . In that event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be correct , he had no alternative but to ally himself with Mr. Drew . Unfortunately , at this juncture , the speculative director was not in the Commodore 's good graces . The latter for many weeks had been " long " in an immense stock operation ; * It is court testimony that Vanderbilt 's agents advertised for proxies , and that Drew 's agent sold out to the central party . There is probably so greater impropriety in selling one 's vote at a railroad corporation election than at the polls of that larger corporation which is called the State . Botls acts are the offspring of indifference , and in the case of Erie there is this excuse , that no one can hold it without being brought temporarily into somewhat the same moral condition which is normal to Swias body-guards and Free Lancers. 7 // and - so far from aiding him in the emergency - the hero of the i866 corner had developed a powerful " bear " interest , producing a stringent money market , and effectually checkmating Mr. Vanderbilt at the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affined roads sacrificed his policy to his pique , and threw the weight of his influence on the side of Mr. Eldridge . The hour of election arrived . The president of the Boston line was installed president of Erie . Mr. Drew was dropped from the board , and for a little space financial New York throbbed with novel excitement . Scarcely , however , had the street recovered from its surprise , when there succeeded a second shock , even more electric than the first . It was currently rumored that one of theti*wI*r electeddirectors had resigned , that Mr. Drew was reinstated in office , and that he held the keys of the Erie treasury ! The report prbved true . At the last moment Mr. Vanderbilt had repented of his rashness , and had patched up an awkward compromise , of which this was the singular sequel . The outside public was scandalized , but it was also mystified . Queer whispers circulated . Metaphor-loving brokers spoke in parables , and quoted Scripture . It was gravely hinted that " the path which leads to destruction " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both broad gauge ! The market partially collapsed . A multitude of small speculators and Qutsiders went " short " in the unpopular scrip . The stock fell sharply . When at length Erie was fairly shivering in the lower register , the curtain which had veiled the secrets of the great railroad intrigue was suddenly pushed aside , and the jubilant shorts found themselves confronted by a gigantic bull interest ; with nine million in the pool , and Messrs . Drew and Vanderbilt at the head . The stock rose with a bound . In January the pool was closed , and the easy victors divided their immense spoils . Flushed with his late triumph , the president of the New York Central now converged his entire strength to effect that coalition of the railroads on which the splendid monopoly programme necessarily depended . A meeting of the rival managers was called . Holding the main scheme guardedly in the background , Mr. Vanderbilt proposed that the agreement for a uniform tariff of freight and passengers from the metropolis to the West should be continued for the next five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest would be easy . The measure provoked great discussion . A scrutiny of details revealed the fact that the profits of the alliance were wholly on the side of the Central clique . Nevertheless , that party refused to make any modifications . The conference consequently broke up in confusion , and the railroad king , foiled in his atte mptat coalition , boldly *cepted the alternative , and , sending out orders in all directions , began the prodigious task of purchasing the control of Erie . Meanwhile Mr. Eldridge and his associates were quietly completing a comprehensive plan for extending the connections of the broad-gauge road , and at the same time effecting the entire renovation of its present rolling stock and road-bed . By the Ohio and Mississippi , Erie already reaches St. Louis ; by the Atlantic and Great Western , it commands Cincinnati . It was now proposed that a new road should be built from Akron , on the line of the latter route , to Toledo . Here a junction would be formed with the Michigan Southern , and thence , by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between New England , New York , and the great interior grain State whose central depot is Chicago . The scheme was gigantic , but it required corresponding expenditure . The treasury was worse than empty ; it was a million dollars in arrears . Yet there seemed no possible expedient for securing the necessary funds for this large and imperative improvement save by adding to that indebtedness . The company therefore voted an issue of ten million of bonds , and as usual Mr. Drexv stood ready to accept the loan . // The contract was signed , and the convertibles transferred . True to his constitutional infirmity , the speculative director was just then very short . Mr. Vanderbilt , now pledged to the success of his programme , had bought up some fourteen millions of stock . The shares were wellnigh swept from the market . Yet , with Erie rising day by day , the agents of Mr. Drew still continued to sell large quantities for future delivery on current rates , at both open and close board . The claquers of the Central clique were dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into inevitable destruction . This amazement , however , was but momentary . Placing on the street in one day the fifty thousand shares into which the fresh issue of bonds had been converted , Mr. Drew forced down Erie from 82* to 65 , and at the same time sent his loan to the company as a " special deposit " to the banks . Our narrowing space precludes any adequate portrayal of the immense explosion which followed upon this unique invention of Mr. Drew for " covering his shorts " ; nor indeed is there a necessity for details . Its history is fresh in all memories . Probably from no single cause were the financial circles of New York ever so deeply and so continuously affected as by this strategetic movement or the treasurer of the Erie . Never did the legal fraternity reap a more abundant harvest , nor the State legislators indulge in brighter dreams . Strangely enough , the feature which appealed most conspicuously to public attention was that of least practical importance . The litigation in the courts was a meaningless farce . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurtled through the air , and served as texts for innumerable and ill-considered editorials , were employed by both parties , not because a great wrong had been committed , but simply as legitimate instruments for attaining a definite result . The suit of Work against Drew , regarding the issue of stocks in the r866 corner , had been overhanging the latter for months , and could have been compromised at any time if the defendant had chosen to accept the proffered terms . The injunction restraining the directors from the ten-million issue came from Mr. Vanderbilt , not because he believed the act was criminal or illegal , but in order to gain time for freeing himself from his terrible entanglement . Indeed , the position in which the great railroad king found himself when the Erie " bear " closed upon him was one of the most peculiar and dangerous on record . It was not merely his Central programme that was at hazard , he was on the edge of what might have been the most startling financial failure of the century . Resolved to continue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was carrying shares to the extent of twenty millions of dollars . With the depression of the market , his bankers compelled him to put up his margins , while his antagonist not only continued the short movement , but , by calling in loans and forming extensive alliances with the capital of outside cities , he produced a heretofore unparalleled stringency of the money market . If all the facts of this great passage of arms between these gigantic moneyed powers could be accurately related , it would afford one of the most thrilling chapters of financial history . At present , however , they are veiled behind a cloud of conflicting surmises , and we only know that , after a few days of breathless anxiety , Mr. Vanderbilt emerged from his embarrassments triumphant and serene . Popular rumor affirms that he accomplished this by mortgaging his whole railroad and realestate property for a temporary loan of thirty million dollars , which he effected with a famous foreign house . Whatever credence this may receive , no smaller *sum could have enabled him to wrestle on equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extricated from the toils of the bear interest , the success of the monopoly scheme was still matter of grave doubt . The Erie directors , driven // into exile , plucked victory from defeat , and secured from the courts and legislature of New Jersey What New York denied them . At Albany the sons-in-law of Vanderbilt , together with the attorney of the New York Central , successfully manipulated the Assembly . The financial and editorial columns of the metropolitan press , with a single exception , labored morning and night in the consolidation interest . Nevertheless , the outlook remained dubious . Mr. Vanderbilt maintained his control of Erie stock , but a large proportion was in the new issue . This issue was entered on the stockledger in the name of the original buyers , while the transfer clerk was in Jersey City ; and it was given out that the books were closed , and would continue so until the October election . In that event the proxies on the ten millions would be unavailable for monopoly purposes . Moreover , the fearful calamity of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhering to the disadvantage of the Erie directors , afforded a remarkable justification for their conduct , especially as Mr. Eldridge now came forward , and pledged himself that the moneys accruing from the loan would be sacredly devoted to the renovation of the entire line . Still further , the affined roads were suffering grievously from more than one cause . Mr. Drew 's boats had commenced to run from the State capital to New York for a dollar . Fares were reduced on Erie thirty-three and even sixty per cent . The merchants and grain-growers along the Central complained of the outrageous rules of the company , which required that no freight should be taken for any point with which their route connected , unless shipped all the way by rail ; and these complaints began to have their effect at Albany . What fresh tactics Mr. Vanderbilt may have determined upon at this crisis are known only to himself . The theory that he gave up the contest in despair is absurd . His resources are too great , his ambition too exalted , for so crude a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would certainly seem to July , have retired from the field . The Erie bill was hurried through the legislature with railroad speed . The extension of lines East and West was authorized , the issue of bonds indorsed , and the consolidation scheme rendered legally impossible . In New York City the courts still kept up their highly scenical display ; but the exiles of Erie returned from their sojourn in Jersey City , and reposed secure in their luxurious apartments at the palatial West Street offices . It is proper to add that this singular phenomenon is ascribed in financial circles to a mysterious compromise , in which Drew and Vanderbilt are parties , and of which the great public is to be the unconscious and submissive victim . For the sake of the national honor and the interests of commerce , we may well hope that these floating rumors are destitute of foundation . The scheme which the King of the Central has at least momentarily abandoned would have proved disastrous , not only to New York , but to New England as well . The theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based , is fatal to the prosperity , not only of the mercantile and producing class , but to the very interests it apparently favors. * Compelled to vast gains , in order to meet its excessive obligations , monopoly would find itself at the hour of supremest success on the verge of appalling disaster . The impatient and long-suffering West would seek new outlets by Canada , by Baltimore , by the Mississippi . No expedient could ward off this sure result , save spasmodic competition , entailing the loss in a week of the profits of a year . Nor could " privilege , " the * All fictitious stock is a tax on the community , and in the end , by encouraging lavish expenditure , large salaries , careless contracts , it impoverishes she corporations themselves . At present , however , the tendency in America is strongly in this direction . It is estimated that the " watered " stock of the railroads in the United States is from thirty to forty per cent shove actual cost , and that the whole volume of fictitious railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loss entailed by this vicious system on all industries is enormous ; nor can we safely look for the day of cheap transportation before legislation shall have peremptorily forbidden any increase of capital beyond the narrowest limits of economical managemens. // creature of the State , maintain its fleeting existence , except by such corruption in the legislative chambers as must inevitably arouse that giant sense of public virtue , now strangely drugged , but liable at any moment to spring into terrible activity . But while " fictions " are fraught with equal ruin to commerce and to corporations , share-gambling is demoralizing our financial centres , and eating like a canker into the very heart of the national life . Capital draws back discouraged from new and necessary investments . Under present conditions , it can not be otherwise . When Mr. Drew and his imitators on other railroad boards sell " short , " they destroy the value of the stock they are sworn to protect , at least to the extent of their profits in speculation . Practically it is the same as if President Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Confederacy , or Napoleon had bet on Wellington before the Battle of Wa'terloo . The state of Erie under the Drew system is a sufficient illustration of the injury which results . What that state is has already partially been set forth ; but there is further testimony upon this subject which should by no means be omitted . In the very heat of the injunction period a pamphlet was issued on the Erie side , which contained the subjoined paragraph : - " The object of a borrower should be to have his loan so made that he will never be called upon to pay either principal or interest . The Erie Company appear to have perfectly accomplished this end . Its shares , like British consols , are never due . As for interest in the shape of dividends , this is what no one expected or expects . The holders of Erie stock do not want a dividend . Were one regularly paid , the stock would in a great measure lose its value as an instrument of speculation . All parties , therefore , are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Erie , it is certainly a wonderful stroke of good fortune to be able to raise $ 7,250,000 for construction and repairs upon its road , without incurring an obli. gation for a dollar . Not to avail themselves of such an opportunity would show that the directors were utterly unfit for their place . " This significant statement , written apparently with no consciousness of its splendid irony , indicates very remarkably the estimate of Wall Street upon the uses of railroad property , nor can there be any stability in stock , until the strong arm of legislation intervenes to arrest the demoralization of the hour . It must be made as criminal i:or a director to deal in railroad scrip as it is to utter counterfeit money or to appropriate trust funds . In fact , the national or State governments ought to enter at once upon the construction of a railroad code which should be universal in its working and sweeping iii its reforms . If the developments of the Erie contest anywise conduce fr* such an auspicious result , we may well re*t satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveys its own lessons . What new shape it will assume it is not for us to forecast . But we may safely affirm that neither in the ascendency of Mr. Drew nor of the Vanderbilt clique is any health possible . What Erie needs is revolution . From Boston , from Chicago , from New York , there should be a simultaneous conjunction of capital , powerful enough to wrest the line from share-gamblers and monopolists , and thoroughly determined to take the solution of the difficulty firmly in hand . We know not what forces are at the control of the actual president , but it seems to us that no man more adequately comprehends the situation , or more ardently desires to infuse fresh blood into the management of the road , - to repair , replace , reorganize , and reform ; to make the stock a stable property , clean from the defilement of the street , certain of dividends , safe for fiduciary investment . If he should accomplish this , by whatsoever device , he will acquire a national reputation as enviable as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldridge 's intentions or his powers ; but there can be no question of his opportunity . It is for the future to disclose how far that opportunity is converted into achievement . // WHEN Mr. Darwin published his " Origin of Species , " he stated it to be only the forerunner of a more complete work on the subject , in which he hoped to present the evidence on which his conclusions were founded with a much greater fulness of detail . The volumes now before us are , if we neglect a couple of essays on special subjects , the first instalment of the promised work . They are*p be followed in due time by another treatise , on the variation of animals and plants in the wild state , and then by a review of the objections which have been made to the theory of Natural Selection ' . The present work contains a great mass of facts drawn from a very wide range of original observation and a most extensive search through the material published by others . Whatever may be thought of his generalizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painstaking and conscientious industry in the accumulation of facts . The first volume is devoted to a history of our most important domestic animals and plants . The pigeon is the most thoroughly treated , and is , as might have been expected , in a measure , the cheval de bataille of the author . In Volume II . all those general questions of reproduction which arise as soon as we begin to consider the subject of inheritance and the nature of species , such as reversion to ancestral forms , the effects of crossing , the causes of sterility and those of variation , are discussed , - with a spirit of candor , indeed ; which no one can fail to be impressed by , and with which all who are acquainted with Mr. Darwin 's previous works are familiar , but at the same time with a degree of subtilty and ingenuity in places which we think may to many readers prove a poor substitute for that fulness and plainness in the evidence that alone can inspire perfect confidence .
