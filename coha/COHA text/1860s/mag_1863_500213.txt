MONTGOMERY IN SECESSION TIME . Ji* the beginning of the year 1860 , there existed in the city of Montgomery , Alabama , a strong , active , and apparently indestructible Union party . Three months after the close of the year there remained in the city no trace of Union sentiment . To show how this feeling was destroyed , sinking slowly , and with many reactions , under influences in themselves insignificant , and to narrate , as they fell under personal observation , that short train of events which make np the historic period of this first capital of the Southern confederacy , will be the object of the present sketch . Early in the summer of 1860 it became evident to every dispassionate observer in the South that the country was swiftly approaching a great crisis . So dexterously had politicians managed the excitement which arose on the discovery of the plot of John Brown , that at the very beginning of the year a small and united party had been formed , having for its aim the immediate separa* tion of the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only fixed thing in Southern society during the year . In the midst of all changes it was permanent . Even before the presidential election , when men 's minds wavered about things so permanent as party lines and party creeds , about old political dogmas associated with favorite political leaders , it remained unaffected . The presence of this restless and determined insurrectionary element in the party politics of the time gave to the struggle preceding the presidential election a character of unusual intensity . The city of Montgomery , as the home of Mr. Yancey , and consequently of his warmest admirers , and most bitter opponents , felt the full influence of this excitement , and soon became one of the natural centres of the growing struggle of opinions . From causes difficult then to trace , there appeared early in the year in the money market of the South an unusual condition of prostration . Banks were unaccountably cautious . Money was suarce . Debts of more than a year 's standing were unpaid , and business of all kinds languished . Not even were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchase of cotton , nor did the money scattered through the country by those sales which did take place relieve the financial pressure under which everything labored . Ia October capitalists refused to venture their funds on anything which did not promise the most immediate return . In these signs , in the inexplicable shrinking of capital to its hiding places , and in the universal darkening of business , it would seem that all might ha*re discovered the approach of that storm which has since burst with such fury upon the land . But this was not the case . Athough every one looked forward with anxiety to the time of election , it was only a portion of the socalled BREcKLNRTDGE party who saw with any distinctness the point toward which all things were tending . Nor did these men make public the extent of their hopes . They were satisfied at first to do nothing more than familiarize the minds of the people with the idea of secession . They spread the doctrine that the only hope of Union lay in the defeat of Mr. Lincoln . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to be peculiarly calculated to increase the numbers of the Union or Bell party , and was therefore readily adopted by those who would at first have repelled with patriotic horror the alternative it suggested . It is impossible to estimate the influence of this lurking fallacy . Not merely I // were multitudes of well-meaning , but unreasoning men , who were confident of the success of their party , brought to acquiesce in a proposition utterly false in its base , but the whole conservative element in society was placed in a position from which it would be thrown by defeat into a most dangerous reaction . Thus consciously or unconsciously all parties were using every effort in their power to prepare the popular mind for the question of secession . But the period was not without its traits of patriotism . In October strong efforts were made in the States of Alabama and Georgia to unite the three parties in the South on one of the three candidates ; thus securing a President to the South , and the certainty of the Union . The Breckinridge Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement of the kind . The insurrectionary element , gathering to itself the excitable and disaffected spirits of every class , had now gained the command of this party , and no longer attempted to conceal its revolutionary intentions . At the head of this element , exercising a vast influence over all its movements , and embodying in himself ; more than any other man ( except , perhaps , Mr. Yancey ) , the fierceness of its spirit , stood Mr. Toombs , of Georgia . He was now invited to speak in Montgomery . As a man of large political experience , some statesmanship , and master of a grave and sonorous eloquence , it was expected that he would influence a class of men who had hitherto held themselves studiously aloof from the insurrectionary ranksthat calm , conservative class , which is recognized by all as the basis of every society which has acquired , or having acquired , hopes to retain , stability of government and security of morals . The sentiments of the speaker were too well known to admit of any doubts as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undisguised advocate of secession . No form of appeal or argtiment was neglected which could have had weight with a people peculiarly susceptible to the influence of oratory . Setting aside the question of the approaching election , to which he scarcely alluded , the orator strove only to show that it was an imperative social necessity that the South should have a vast and constantly increasing slave territory ; that in the path of this necessity the only obstacle was the Federal Union , and that the time for its destruction had now come . These were the representative arguments of his party before the election , and he did not speak to an unsympathizing audience . For when toward the close , raising his voice until it broke almost in a scream , he exclaimed , Let the night which decides the election of Mr. Lincoln be ushered in by the booming of the hostile cannon of the South , ' the hail rang again and again with the shouts of his excited hearers . But nemo r*pente turpis8irnus semperfuit . These were not the sentiments of alL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither did they hiss . They seemed for the time overawed by the energy of the spirit which had suddenly sprung up among them . In the following week , however , a singular , though , unfortunately , but momentary check was given to the progress of insurrectionary sentiments in the vicinity of the city . Senator DOUGLAS , who had been slowly advancing , in his oratorical t , our , down the coast , was about this time announced to speak in Montgomery . Since his speech in Norfolk , where he was thought to have expressed himself too *clearly against secession , a strong prejudice had grown up in the South against him , and it now threatened to manifest itself in acts of positive violence . Such was the state of popular feeling , that for a time it seemed uncertain whether it would be desirable for him to attempt to speak . Hints of peculiar personal outrages were thrown out ' by men of a certain class ; and // threats were made of something still more ominous in ease he should attempt to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , and was met at the ears by a large crowd , and a procession formed from a coalition , for the occasion , of his party with that of Mr. Bell . It was feared that the short ride to the hotel would not be accomplished without some act of violence on the part of the excited throng by which his carriage was surrounded . A few eggs were thrown , but otherwise the ride was performed without interruption . From further outrages the crowd restrained itself until something positive should appear on the part of the orator himself . Unintimidated , however , by these unmistakable evidences of the public feeling , Mr. Douglas on the following morning presented himself on the steps in front of the capitol , where it had been announced that his speech would be delivered . The city was filled with strangers , who had come from all parts of the country to be present at the State fair which was held there that week . On Capitol Hill , therefore , an immense throng was early assembled , which coldly awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfavorable . But the spirit of the obstinate debater seemed to rise with the difficulties by which he was surrounded . At first even his manner of speaking operated to his disadvantage . The sharp , syllabic emphasis , which he was accustomed to adopt in addressing large assemblages in the open air , grated harshly on ears accustomed to the smooth and carefully modulated elocution of Mr. Yancey . Beginning , however , by enunciating general principles of government , in which all could agree , he gradually conciliated , by an unexpected appear- ance of moderation , the favorable attention of his audience . As he advanced upon his customary sketch of the history of the different political parties during the past few years-a work which a hundred repetitions enabled him to perform with a dramatic energy of style and expression singularly effective-he was occasionally interrupted by exclamations of acquiescence . As he described the'various successes of the Democratic party , these became frequent , and before he had finished the resum* , his voice was drowned amid the enthusiastic cheers of the crowd . It was a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , and the men who in the morning had thrown out dark hints of stoning , ' joined in the applause . He accepted as a certainty the election of Mr. Lincoln , but caused the crowd to shout with exultation at the prospect of tying all his activity by the constitutional check of a Democratic majority in Congress . In short , he came amid general execration , and departed amid universal regret . I had heard Mr. Douglas before , but never when he gave any evidence of the wonderful power which he exhibited on this occasion . With few tricks of rhetoric , with no extraordinary bursts of eloquence , he accomplished all the results of the most impassioned oratory . The qualities of a great debater-unshaken presei'ce of mind , tact in adapting himself to his audience , the power of arranging facts in a form at once simple and coherent , and yet most favorable to his own cause , the strange influence by which one mind compels from others the recognition of its supremacy-have long been conceded to the late Senator from Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before the excited populace of Montgomery . This was the last strictly Union speech which was delivered in that city . No one after this was found bold enough to stand up in the defence of the cause that from this day began slowly to succumb to the fierce spirit to which it was opposed . For several days the effects of fhe speech were . visi // ble in the moderate tone of popular feeling ; ' but they were soon lost in the tumultuous excitement attending the return of Mr. Yancey from his tour in the North , and the still more intense feeling produced by the election which immediately followed . It was impossible in these last hours of distinct political organizations not to be struck with the differences that characterized the opposing partiesdifferences which , both before and since , have had much to do with the progress of the rebellion . The Union gatherings were easy , jovial , fond of speeches adorned with the quips and turns of political oratory , and filled with the spirit t'will all come right in the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become-the secession meetings , a different spirit prevailed . It was the spirit of insurrection , fierce , stormy , unrestrained . It was the spirit of hatred ; hatred of the North , hatred of the Union , hatred of Mr. Bell , whose success would deprive them of their only weapon for the destruction of that Union . But with the 4th of November came a change . Three days . after election there remained in Montgomery no trace of party organizations . All the widely divergent streams of public opinion seemed suddenly to have joined in one , and that running fiercely , and unrestrained toward disunion . The election of Mr. Lincoln united the people . On all sides prevailed the deepest enthusiasm in favor of secession . Mass meetings , attended by all parties , were held , and passed resolutions advocating in the strongest terms immediate disunion . Secessionists were astonished at the change , and in their anxiety to avoid anything which might shock the newly awakened sentiment , appeared in many cases the most conservative members of the community . But indeed nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War committees were appointed , and active measures taken to put the State in a position to maintain her independence as soon as the ordinance of secession should have received the sanction of the convention . Troops were despatched to take possession of the arsenal , and agents were sent North to purchase additions to the already large supply of arms in the State . Immediate secession seemed to be the desire of every class . But this condition of things was not always to continue . The reaction which had carried the Unionists from a state of perfect confidence in the success of their candidate , to one of deep disappointment , and of rage at the section to which they attributed their defeat , having at length spent itself , signs of a returning movement began to make their appearance . At first these were not strongly marked . All were yet in favor of secession , but a large party , composed of most of the former partisans of Mr. Bell , together with the conservative element of every class , began at length to object to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of Alabama should be made to depend upon the decision of the other Southern States . This movement was understood by the secessionists to have for its ultimate object the defeat of their hopes of disunion ; and such , unquestionably , was its aim ; for whatever may have been the plans of some of the leaders of the Coiperationists , as this party was called , it is certain that the great body of the party had no other end in view , and was sustained in its action by no other hope than the perpetuation of the Union . At the caucus meetings which preceded the election of delegates to the State convention the two parties , as now formed , first came into conflict . At once important differences became apparent . Although nearly equal in numbers , in spirit the two parties were signally unequal . While the secessionists were bold , vigilant , and uncompromising , the codperationists were timid and passionless , though full of a passive confidence that the Union would in some way be // preserved . A knowledge . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows how it was possible that a State so confessedly loyal that it would have rejected the ordinance of secession if it had been submitted directly to the people , could yet , on this very issue , elect a convention with a majority in favor of disunion . The whole question was decided in the caucus meetings . The secessionists of all parts of the State were bound together by watchful associations , and were everywhere on the alert . In counties where by their number they were entitled to no representative , attending the caucus meeting in force , they effected-as they easily could while there was no distinct party organization  --  a union of the tickets , and thus secured to themselves one of the two candidates . So frequently was this repeated in different parts of the country , that it was afterward estimated that by this simple expedient of a union ticket the whole question of the secession of this State was decided . From these political struggles , however , the interest of the community was suddenly withdrawn by an event which instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the little town of Pine Level , a village situated a few miles from Montgomery , traces were discovered of a plot having for its object a general uprising of the negroes on the evening preceding Christmas . In the progress of the investigations which were immediately begun , it came to light that the plot was not simply local , but extended over many counties , including in its circuit the city of Montgomery , and involving in its movements many hundred negroes . Further examination revealed all the horrible details which were to attend the consummation of the plot  --  the butchery of the whites , the allotment of females , the division of property . The whole surrounding country was alive with excitement . Active measures were taken to crush at once the spirit of insurrection . The ringleaders and some of the poor whites , with whom the plot is said to have originated , were seized and , after a brief trial , immediately hung . In Montgomery feeling was such as to demand the adoption of the most stringent precautionary measures . Military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capitol and arsenal . On Christmas eve the plot was to go into execution , and as the time approached , the anxiety became painfully intense . It was whispered that one of Mr. Yancey 's slaves had been detected in an attempt to poison her master . The police was doubled , soldiers with loaded muskets were stationed in all the prominent streets , while mounted guards ranged the thinly inhabited section of the outskirts . The night , however , passed without alarm , and the excitement from that time slowly subsided . It is scarcely worthy of notice , perhaps , that with the returning sense of security came also the flippant confidence which had been for a time put to flight . The blacks were again a timid and affectionate race , and it was soon not difficult to find multitudes who declared themselves willing to meet alone a hundred insurrectionary slaves . Sitting in this evening calm , listening to such remarks , it was difficult to accept as real the events of the hot and excited day which had gone before . Surely they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightly tread of soldiers , the brooding terror that whitened the lips of mothers . A home guard , however , was immediately formed , including all citizens , irrespective of age or station , capable of hearing arms , and not in other military organizations . On the 7th of January , the convention met . South Carolina had already passed her ordinance of secession ; but what others would follow the example of this excitable State was yet uncer // tam . All eyes were now anxiously directed toward Alabama , upon wliose decision would to a great degree depend that of the two great conservative States , Louisiana and Georgia . Nor was this anxiety diminished by the accounts given of the composition of the convention of this State . Both sides claimed a majority ; anA it was evident that , without some unexpected defection , the two parties would narrowly escape a tie . This singular uncertainty was soon , however , to cease . Immediately on convening , it became evident that the command of the body lay with the secessionists . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ten votes . Of the hundred delegates , fifty-five were in favor of disunion . Although this majority gave the secessionists power to carry their wishes into instant effect , it was not thought politic to do so while the difference between the two parties remained so small . The passage of the ordinance was , therefore , for several days delayed , while the codperationists were plied with arguments to induce them to acquiesce in that which it was now impossible for them to prevent . At length , after four days of deliberation , it became evident that all of this party had succumbed whom it seemed possible to change , and on the morning of the 11th of January it was publicly announced that the ordinance of secession had passed the convention by a vote of sixty-one in the affirmative against thirty-nine in the negative . By the insurrectionists the announcement was received with transports of joy , but by the Unionists it was met with demonstrations of grief , which they made no efforts to conceal . Women wept , and houses were closed as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State the manifestations of disappointment were still more unmistakable . Indignation meetings were held , and one of the delegates received a telegram from his constituents , charging him with having betrayed them on the very issue for which he was elected , and demanding explanations . At length the loyal feeling of the State seemed aroused , and had the ordinance of secession been now submitted to the people , all admitted that it would have been rejected by an unquestionable majority . But the ordinance was not submitted to the people , and the Union sentiment , which had already , within the interval of a few weeks , passed through two complete oscillations-vibrating from the loyalty which preceded the presidental election through all the changes of the strong disunion reaction which followed-was now again in the ascendant . But from this point it soon began to recede , descending slowly along an arc of which no eye can see the end , with a momentum that permits no prediction as to the time of its return . A multitude of influences began at once to weaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been the policy of the disunion leaders to represent the question of secession as lying wholly with the South . In case this section should decide upon disunion , there would be little reason , it was said , to fear any prolonged opposition on the part of the North-least of all a war . Nothing appeared on the part of the Federal Executive to refute these assertions . It was by a large class believed , therefore , that the leaders were right when they said that the secession would be a mere withdrawal of the Southern States , for the formation of a goverumeut perfectly friendly to the North , with which , indeed , a boand of commissioners would soon arrange the terms of a peaceful international trade . After the passage of this ordinance , however , a slight modification of this argument beeame necessary . Peace was conditioned upon unanimity . Unionists were now called upon to render their support to the new government in order to secure peace . If it was clear that the State was united in favor of the changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was said , to procure , amid the divisions of the North , a peaceful recognition of the confederacy . The factions of the Northern States would never allow the Federal Government to attempt to coerce a united people . Thus the very weapons which loyalty had used to arm herself were here wrested to her own destruction . To insure peace , men became insurrectionists . It is useless now to surmise what would have been the result if the action of the Federal Government in reference to the question of secession at the beginning of the rebellion , had been less ambiguous . It is enough to know , what was for many weeks so painfully realized by every Northerner in the South , that had the Southern people , by any means , been brought to understand that Federal laws were protected by sanctions , and that an attempt at disunion would certainly be followed by war , the question of secession would never have become a formidable issue . But while men believed , as many of the Unionists did , that secession was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would more than likely result , after a few years , in a peaceful reconstruction of the Union on terms more favorable to the South , there is little occasion for wonder that the cause of disunion met with no very earnest , or , at least , prolonged opposition . The passage of the ordinance of secession gave to the disunionists an incalculable advantage . It is true , the Union feeling was deep , and in many places strongly aroused , but the State had seceded , the new government was quietly and apparently solidly forming itself : , profitable offices were in its gift , and , added to all , the conservative spirit whispered its old motto , quietct non movere , and the hands which had been raised in weak resistance fell harmlessly back . In the mean while , at the capitol , another work was going on . The convention , having established by ordinance the independence of the State , was now engaged in tearing down and remodelling to meet the petty wants of the Republic of Alabama the august structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the 29th of January this body , which in a brief session pf three weeks had carried through measures involving some of the most stupendous changes possible to a civil State , adjourned to meet again on the 4th of March , cutting off , by this , all possibility of any of the questions which it had discussed being brought bef6re the people by a new election . On the week following the adjournment of the convention , the confederate congress assembled in Montgomery . This body immediately showed a fine appreciation of the state of public feeling , and drew to itself the confidence of the people by selecting for president and vice-president of the temporary government men who were thought to represent the more conservative clement in community . Mr. Davis , at the time of his election , was in Mississippi , but on receiving the official announcement of the event , started at once for Montgomery , passing through Southern Tennessee , then a loyal State , along a path nearly parallel to the one in which Mr. Lincoln was at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night , but a large crowd was awaiting his arrival at the depot . A procession of carriages , filled with members of the confederate congress , led the way to the hotel . It was preceded by a military band , and at regular intervals rockets were discharged , announcing to the distant beholder the progress of the procession . All felt that by attention to these honorary details they were assisting to give dignity to the newly formed confederacy . On arriving at the hotel , Mr. Davis was announced to speak from the balcony . The crowd pressed curiously forward . Two candles threw a // faint , yellow light over a spare , angular form , rather below the medium height , lighting up , at the same time , the sunken cheeks and strongly marked jaws of a face now working with the emotions which the unusual events of the evening were so well calculated to excite . The ceremonies of inauguration were postponed to the beginning of the following week . Early on Monday morning , however , the hill before the capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the new confederacy . For the accomodation of the members of congress , a temporary pint- ' form had been erected in front of the capitol . Standing on this , and glancing over the city , the eye rested on the rich valley of the Alabama , stretching away many miles to the north , broken here and there by the dark green foliage of the pine forests , which now twinkled in the soft light of a day mild even for the latitude . At the extreme rear of the platform , behind a small table , was seated the chairman of the congress , Howell Cobb . Corpulent even to grossness , he formed a curious contrast to the small and wasted forms of the two presidents elect , who sat at his side . The events of this day have given to every trait of these men a lasting and unenviable interest . Neither looked like a great man , neither like a man thoroughly bad . All the impressions produced by the first appearance of Mr. Davis were strengthened , without being changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means imposing , he joins a manner too reserved to make him at any time a favorite of the populace . His whole bearing , in fact , declares him a stranger to that deep and contagious enthusiasm which has so often in enterprises like this drawn to a leader the admiration and unconquerable fidelity of the common people . Nor , on the other hand , is there anything in his appearance to indicate the presence of the broad and comprehensive energy which , in the mind of the thoughtful , can take the place of such an enthusiasm . Still , he is in many respects peculiarly suited to take the head of the rebellion . Elected at a time when State distinctions were lost sight of in the warmth of the first formation of the confederacy , he soon lost his sectional character , *and represents , as no one now elected could , the people alike of Virginia and those along the Gulf . He is shrewd , cautious , deter- , mined . But his caution may easily become scarcely distinguishable in its results from timidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stevens , who sat , or , rather , had sunk , in his chair by the side of Mr. Davis , was a thin , sickly looking man , whose small round face was characterized by the pallid self-concentrated expression peculiar to invalids . On rising at the administration of the oath , which he did with the laborious movement of one to whom weakness had become a habit , he revealed a form of about the medium height , but brbken , as by some physical disfigurement . During most of the ceremonies , he wore the air of an uninteresed spectator , amusing himself with the head of a slight and rather jaunty cane , which he held between his knees . Although greatly inferior , so far as mere physical appearances are concerned , to his colleague , there is yet something in the expression and bearing of Mr. Stevens which suggests a depth and comprehensiveness of intellect for which one searches in vain the face of Mr. Davis . On the platform were gathered nearly all those restless spirits which have , during the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conspicuous among them appeared the bristling head of Mr. Toombs . He sat during the whole ceremony , with his face , wearing the imperious expression which had become habitual to it , turned upon the people . With uncovered heads , and in perfect silence , the crowd listened to the oath of office . Immediately on the completion of this ceremony the two presidents and the congress withdrew to the senate chamber . // A levee was announced for the evening . The hail which had been selected for this gathering was a large , low room in the upper story of a building near the centre of the city . Some efforts had been made by the ladies to conceal the rudeness of the apartment , but it was expected that every deficiency of this kind would be fbrgotten in the presence of that courtly society which had hitherto given all the attractiveness to occasions like this on the banks of the Potomac . It is but fair to suppose that these expectations were disappointed , for early in the evening the hall was crowded with a throng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , talking loudly of the hopes of the new confederacy , or moved uneasily about , seeking a favorable position from which to watch the president shake hands . ' This was the ambition of the evening . Every standing point in the vicinity of Mr. Davis was taken advantage of . Chairs and benches served as footstools to elevate into positions of prominence long rows of men dressed in the yellow jeans of the country , who stood , during all the long hours of the evening , watching with unchanging countenances the multiplied repetitions of the short double shake and spasmodic smile which Mr. Davis meted out to each of the constantly forming column that filed before him . The platform was filled with the same class , and even the arch of evergreen , under which it was intended that Mr. Davis should stand , was pushed aside , to give place to those unwinking faces which pressed to every loophole of observation . The ladies , who appeared here and there in the crowd , sparkling with jewels , and dressed in the rich robes naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rude incongruities of the gathering . Men were surprised at the manifestations on every hand of a vulgarity and coarseness which they had been accustomed to think the natural products and exclusive characteristics of a state of society farther north . To the eyes of the fastidious , a new class had suddenly arisen in their midst . Perhaps the lesson was not a new one . Many nations before , when in the midst of revolutions , have been called mournfully to learn that there are grades in every society , that rebellions are not always tractable , and that the class which guides their opening rarely controls their close . But if the scene of the evening had any prophecies of this kind  --  and I do not say that it had-it wailed them , like Cassandra , to ears divinely closed . From this time the ferment of public opinion disappeared . A tangible government existed , against which to speak was treason , and the friends of the Union  --  and in spite of all changes , the number of these was yet considerable-now for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had hitherto indicated the direction of their sympathies . All classes of men were longing for something permanent , and eagerly grasped at these apppearauces of a settled government , as promising to supply that which they so much desired . The establishment of a calm and united state of public feeling seemed , therefore , the almost instant effect of the inauguration of Mr. Davis . As might be expected , the events which have been related had not taken place in the South without affecting the condition of the Northern stranger who chanced to be within the gate . To him every change had been for the worse . During the fluctuations of public opinion in the early part of the season , his position , though unpleasant , had still some relieving circumstances ; the condition of the country was not yet utterly hopeless , and the vanity of being stable in the midst of universal change , ministered a mild though secret plesasure , which , in the painful anxieties of the period , was not without its consolatory value . But when the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // that in favor of secession , all those pleasures , so mild and spiritual , were at once destroyed . Nor was this a condition without change . Every week added some new restraints to those by which the Unionist was already surrounded . But never was the pressure of these restraints felt to be so great as in this singular calm , which followed the inauguration of Mr. Davis . The loyal spirit seemed extinct . Union sentiments were no longer expressed in even the private circles . Now , however , hints were occasionally dropped of the possibility of a future reconstruction , and in this direction it was evi ( lent the small remnant of the Union party was now turning its hopes . Notwithstanding the general appearance of unanimity , one thing remained which seemed to indicate a want of perfect confidence on the part of the people generally in the permanency of the new order of affairs . This was , the little interest which was manifested in the tranactions of the rebel congress . With nothing else to occupy their minds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass almost without remark . To the congress itself this apathy did not extend . There appeared here , on the contrary , a germ even of the old State antagonisms ; for when Mr. Toombs , carrying out the former policy of his State , introduced a bill imposing a tax on imports , declaring , at the same time , that no government could ever be sustained without depending chiefly upon this s*urce of revenue , every member from South Carolina was on his legs . After a warm debate , and against the strongest protestsof these members , the bill was carried and went into efiect . Notwithstanding this , many in England stilt secretly believe that the Federal tariff was the real cause of the secession . The astonishing promptness with which the rebel government , immediately after the fall of Fort Sumter , equipped and placed upon the field an enormous and fairly organized army , has given rise to a strong impression concerning the energy put forth by the executive department during the two months which intervened between this event and the inauguration . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election of Mr. Lincoln the South possessed a military establishment quite equal , in proportion to its population , to that of either France or Russia . At the time of the John Brown excitement , a rumor was spread through the South that larcre bodies of men were gathering b in different parts of the North , having for their object an invasion of the Southern States . Among all the reports which this excited period produced , none was more sedulously diffused , and none more generally believed . Whatever had been the original design of the story , its instant effect , in the excited state of the public mind , was the formation of companies in every county and village throughout the South for military drilL These organizations , of which there were frequently several in a single village , were equipped . *ntirely at the expense of the individual members . As they were under constant drill during the winter and summer , they presented at the opening of the year 1861 the singular spectacle of a great army , organized and equipped at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of the recognized government . This , ft is unnecessary to say , was the grand basis of that army which was afterward placed upon the field ; and thus it was that . a secretary of war so palpably inefficient as Mr. Walker was able , with an empty treasury , for many months to surpass the North in the supply of troops , equipped , and at once prepared for duty . It was in full appreciation of this great armed mass that lay at his hand in a condition to be easily formed into an organized and efficient army , that Mr. Davis , after much entreaty , and // repeated postponement , reluctantly gave his assent to the first strong act of the executive department , and ordered the attack upon Fort Sumter . Without anticipating what were to be the effects of this act in the North , which was , indeed , open to the conjecture of no man , Mr. Davis on this occasion simply exhibited a hesitancy in venturing on extreme measures , which will be found to be a characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled with rumors concerning the anticipated attack , but early on Friday morning it was announced that the bombardment had already begun . In the general excitement , business was suspended . Crowds filled the streets . The war department was in constant receipt of telegraphic messages announcing the progress of the bombardment . But nothing came during the day to diminish the growing anxiety . It was found that the fleet of war vessels said to be outside the bar would take advantage of the night to come to the succor of the fort . Sleep was impossible . Men who had gone to bed arose again and joined the crowd which Mironged the streets . At length , shortly after midnight , Mr. Walker came forth and announced the last and most favorable telegraphic report concerning the progress of the siege , uttering at the same time the famous boast which has linked his name with an indissoluble association of fol ly . Shortly past noon on Saturday , the message came which announced the surrender of the fort . The city was frantic with joy . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitement which filled all classes of society . Standing on the housetop in the evening , a wild crowd could be seen flitting before bonfires , or ranging the streets , and shouting in the ecstasy of an excitement which none could control . Immediately on the arrival of the despatch , messengers had started into the country with the welcome tidings , and deep in the night the ear was startled by the dull roar of the cannon announcing the arrival in some distant village of the joyful intelligence . That will be the end of the war , ' said a man of well known conservatism , who stood by at the announcement in Montgomery of the surrender of the fort . It was the last expression of that fatal fallacy which had lured so large a class quietly to acquiesce in the fact of secession in the hope of thus securing the peaceful recognition of the North . In a few days more , the whole deception had passed away . But the correction had come too late . The Union party was extinct . Twic* , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of which , a people , in majority loyal , was converted into one totally disloyal and revolutionary , it lay wit2Liin the tower of the Federal Executive , by firmness and a proper exhibition of its powers , to have sustained the Union party in the South and crushed the rebellionbefore the election of Mr. Lincoln , and at the time of the strong Union reaction in the election of delegates to the State convention . At both these periods the Union feeling was strong and increasing , immediately after each ; pressed upon by arguments which the course of the Executive had failed to answer , it slowly declined . But no great sentiment is destroyed at once . There is reason to believe that , if left to itself the tide of Union feeling might again have flowed back , and the faint traces of a reconstruction party which appeared in the short interval of quiet that belonged to the rebel confederacy indicates , perhaps , the path along which it would have returned . But the time for these things had passed . The fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roused a spirit of military enthusiasm in the South scarcely less intense than that which the same event excited in the North . At once , in every direction , disappeared all those sober scruples which , during the hottest ex illiontgomery in* Secession Time . // citement of the preceding months , had quietly controlled the judgment of a small but influential class in every community . The change in north Alabama and central Tennessee , where the principles of secession had been steadily rejected by the people , was almost instantaneous . The excitement and pride of a sectional victory , and a false sympathy for the individuals who had ventured their lives in a cause in itself ; perhaps , objectionable , effected what the most cunning fallacies of the leaders had been unable to accomplish . As this movement of the popular feeling had many points of resemblance with the revolution of feeling which took place just after the election of Mr. Lincoin , there were some who believed that it would be followed by a similar reaction . The excitement of the war into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every chance of any such retrogressive movement . No reaction took place . The surrender of Fort Sumter completed the change of opinion which had been so long progressing in the South . Those who look for an immediate restitution of Union feeling in the South , as a result of Federal victories , will be disappojinted . It will be the result of a gradual movement  --  a movement resembling in every important particular that by which the secession sentiment was established in the interval between the election of Mr. Lincoln and the surrender of Fort Sumter . Operating particularly upon that class in society which is by nature passive rather than active , conservative rather than headlong , the movement , as in that case , will be at first slow and attended with many reactions , but the result will not be uncertain . Already the progress of the war has destroyed nearly all the motives by which the Union party of the South was formerly led to adopt the cause of secession . This great party , therefore , stretching through all parts of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village and county which threatened at one time with its passive resistance to overturn the whole scheme of the rebellion , stands now exposed to the full influence of the reactionary tide which has now begun to set back toward the Union . The change may not be at once , but the same motive which led the Union man of Tennessee to return to loyalty , will prove equally effective with his whole party , wherever distributed .
