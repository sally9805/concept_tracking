ARTICLE VI. - TIIE ALABAMA QUESTION . THERE is a strong and a general impression among the people of the United States that the British government , and a part of the British nation , desired the ill-success of the Northern States at the beginning of our late war . The growing greatness and prosperity of the country was looked on , it is thought , with apprehension ; our disruption was fervently wished , and that government was quite willing that any aid should be afforded to the Confederate States , which did not clearly conflict with the laws of neutrality , as understood in England . From this feeling was derived , it is thought , the recognition of the belligerency of the rebels , made with indecent haste before the proper outbreak of hostilities ; and to this recognition it is ascribed that the Confederates could send out privateers upon the ocean , made in England on their account , to burn our ships and to drive our shipping from the seas . The case of the Alabama , though a strong proof of the negligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor are our claims of compensation for the ravages of this successful privateer the only claims we can justly ir ? ake . All the positive injuries inflicted by all the privateers built in England , all the loss of trade and increase of expense , due to the expulsion of our vessels from the ocean , are to be put to the account of the unfortunate *proclamation of neutrality , and the claims are to be urged with the more spirit , because , when we were engaged in a struggle of life and death against slavery , we got no sympathy from a land that prided itself on its cpposition to slavery-we got nothing but blockade-runners and insults in the Times . With the existence of an unfriendly feeling on the part of leaders of opinion in Great Britain , we shall not concern ourselves at this time ; we should rejoice to be able to believe that no such malevolence expresse4 itself in our distress through that English speech which we inherit , or was harbored in English hearts with which ours most readily beat in unison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the Alabama , we must not let indignation prevail over reason ; we must not be made by fervid rhetoric to believe that all the evils to us which followed the proclamation of neutrality grew out of it , and would not otherwise have had an existence ; we must be cautious lest we impute the inevitable course of events to an unfriendly spirit . But we go farther . Admitting that there was an unfriendly spirit in the British nation , or in those who had the conduct of affairs , we can not take that unfriendliness into account , unless it expressed itself in some illegal way , and led to some injustice toward ourselves . Nations may feel resentment for manifestations of ill-will , when they come from public authorities in official acts ; but the spite and malevolence of individuals towards foreign nations has never yet , that we are aware of , been considered worthy of entering into public quarrels . Still less has international law ever thought of demanding apologies for feelings of the heart , indulged with no violation of right nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British unfriendliness , except so far as it shows itself in outward acts , we inquire , first , whether the Queen 's proclamation was such a paper as a neutral in the circumstances might lawfully issue ; whether , in other words , the neutral government , most deeply interested in our affairs , had any good reason for thinking that hostilities had commenced in this country , when the last news before the issuing of the proclamation came to their knowledge . Then we may look into the effect of the proclamation ; was it an encouragement to " piracy , " and would there have been no war on our commerce if it had not been issued ? And , finally , when we have considered these first complaints against the British government we may look into the case of the Alabama , as it stands by itself There is no doubt that , as a nation on declaring war may issue what de Martens calls lettre8 inhibitoire8 against commerce and correspondence with an enemy , * so neutrals may issue proclamations to their subjects warning them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the neutral 's // own laws in protection of such rules . The obvious reason for such proclamations is to prevent the subject from en , gaging in schemes calculated to involve him in loss from the belligerent 's movements , or to expose him to fine or imprisonment from the operation of domestic laws . But there is a special reason for a government 's announcing that there is a state of war , when the parties to it are an established government and a portion of a State in revolt or insurrection . In ordinary cases , the commencement of a war is tolerably certain , even though there be no declaration of its existence ; for the diplomatic relations of two nations keep them informed of the approach of hostilities , and a suspension of such relations announces the beginning of an armed conflict . But where ci*il war bursts out , there is , in general , no such index . Even a declaration of war on the part of the revolters , or a certain amount of armed resistance from them against the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to neutrals of a state of war . But , on the other hand , a denial on the part of the government that a state of war exists , or an attempt to conceal war under the garb of the movement of an armed police , or of repressing a local insurrection , ought not to deceive the neutrals . They are not bound to take their views of the state of things from an interested party . They must judge from the facts of the case which are withif* their reach , but are obliged , also , to exercise caution , and to move slowly towards their conclusions . And it is evident that , with all due caution and the best disposition to form an impartial judgment , they are liable in cases of this kind to arrive at wrong conclusions , which ought not , without clear proof , to be imputed to a hostile mind . The proclamation of the Queen of Great Britain , issued May 13th , 1861 , after declaring that " hostilities have unhappily commenced between the government of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America , " and after citing the most important parts of the foreign enlistment act , as it is commonly called , passed in the fifty-ninth year of George III. , concludes as follows : " And we do hereby warn our subjects . . . . that if any // of them shall presume . . to do any acts in derogation of their duty , , as subjects of a neutral sovereign in said contest , or in violation or contravention of the law of nations in that behalf ; - as , for example and more especially , by entering into the military service of either of the said contending parties , as commissioned or non commissioned officers or soldiers ; or by serving as officers , sailors , or marines on board any ship or vessel of war or transport , of or in the service of either of the contending parties ; or by serving as officers , sailors , or marines on board any privateer , bearing letters of marque of or from either of the said contending parties ; or by engaging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to enlist or engage in any such service , or by procuring or attempting to procure within her majesty 's dominions , ' at home or abroad , others to do so ; or by fitting out , al-ruing , or equipping any ship or vessel to be employed , as a ship of war , or privateer , or transport , by either of the said contending parties ; or by breaking or endeavoring to break any blockade lawfully and actually established by or on behalf of either of the said contending parties ; or by carrying officers , soldiers , despatches , arms , military stores , or materials , or any article or articles considered and deemed to be contraband of war , according to the laws of modern usage of nations , for the use or service of either of the contending parties ; - all persons so offending will incur and be liable to the several penalties and penal consequences , by the said statute or by the law of nations in that behalf imposed or denounced . " It is then added at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection , who shall misconduct themselves in the premises *vil1 do so at their peril , and will obtain no protection from her majesty , but , on the contrary , incur her displeasure by such misconduct . A proclamation of this kind has no immediate use , unless the subjects of the sovereign who issues it are warned against doing illegal acts . Still it may have an ultimate effect of no small weight . The uses direct and indirect may be said to be these : First* it may bring before the minds of subjects the municipal law of the neutral state , designed to protect the law of nations , and especially the rights of nentrals . The announcement // of war is an announcement of the rights of blockade , of capture for various reasons , and of search , as well as of the danger incurred by unneutral acts of every kind and on both elements . Secondly , the proclamation , if it declares that a state of war exists , implies that subjects of the neutral power , who may be captured by either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , if taken on the sea , ought not to be visited with the penalties of piracy . Thirdly , it may possibly release the State , thus pronounced to be in a state of civil war with the inhabitants of a part of its territory , from claims to damages inflicted on the neutral by the insurgents . For , when the neutral declares that a state of war exists , it is precluded from all claims of this description. * Fonrthly , it may prevent complications of other kinds . For example , if there is no war , the cruisers , neither of the parent state nor of the insurgents , can touch neutral trade on the ocean in articles contraband of war . But if the neutral nation agrees to the fact that there is war , she concedes thereby that such articles on her subject 's ships may be lawfully captured , even if the so-called belligerents make no declaration whatever of the state of things , as they regard it.t Let us now look at the circumstances attending the issue of the Queen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this step are chargeable with haste , bad judgment , and a certain unstatesmanlike indifference to results ,  --  affording thus another example of what the old Swedish Chancellor said , " nescis , mi flu , ! *ptantula sapientia regitur mundus . " They seem , moreover , when called upon to defend the measure , to have fallen into the predicament of finding motives in knowledge obtained after the fact . On the sixth of May , Earl Russell ( then still Lord John Russell ) wrote to Lord Lyons at Washington , in the following terms : her majesty 's government " feel that they can not question the right of the South * See Dana 's note on Wheaton , p. 85. t Compare Lawrence on Wheaton , second annotated edition , note 15 ; Dana on Wheaton , note 16. // em States to claim to be recognized as a belligerent , and as such invested with all the rights and prerogatives of a belligerent , " and , again , that they do not wish Lord Lyons to make any mystery of that view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons that the government , " on consultation with the*law officers of the crown , " " had come to the opinion that the Southern States , according to those principles which seemed to them to be just principles , must be treated as a belligerent . " On the ninth , it was again announced by another officer of the government , that such a proclamation was about to be issned . It was accordingly issued on the fourteenth of May , but the motive for making it had existed before the sixth of May , when no official account of President Lincoln 's proclamation could have reached England . Earl Russell assigned at one time the blockade as the motive , at another the magnitude of the insurrection . There seems to have been a marvelous hurry in thus recognizing the belligerency of the Confederate States ; the government was not bound to take this step by any sudden necessit5* of protecting their own seamen , for there was not a Confederate vessel afloat ; Mr. Adams was on his way and actually reached London the thirteenth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have everything cut and dried before the arrival of the new ambassador . Well might Mr. Adams say immediately afterwards to Mr. Seward , that Lord Russell 's declaration on the 6th of May , showed " not a little precipitation in at once raising the disaffected States up to the level of a belligerent power , before they had developed a single one of the real elements which constitute military efficiency outside of their own geographical limits . " And , again , he adds in very mild terms , that " the inference seemed almost inevitable that there existed a disposition at least not to chill the hopes of those who are now drawing the very breath of life only from the expectation of sympathy in Great Britain . " This inference may be further supported by the words of Lord Chelmsford in the House of Lords , uttered on the 16th of May , that " if the Southern Confederacy had not been recognized as a belligerent power , any Englishman aiding them by fitting out a privateer against the Federal Government , would be guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , unless with the expectation that they would , in greater or smaller numbers , rush into this business , and with the desire to exempt them from all penalties but the insignificant ones of the foreign enlistment act ? * But , if we admit that the proclamation was a hasty , ill judged , and possibly unfriendly measure , the main question still remains to be considered ; was it in any sense a step not authorized by the law of nations ? There were hostilities between the United States and the rebels at some time or other . When did they begin ? Did it rest with the United States to say what was their commencement , or was each neutral to judge for itself in that regard ? If this judgment is a biased one , if it can be shown that the neutral 's wish is father to his opinion , and that his opinion is published to work evil to a professed friend , let the due amount of resentment be felt for such conduct . But if the neutral can make a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , let it not be said that his published opinion , to the effect that certain facts , transpiring in another part of the world , deserved the name of warfare , ought to be regarded as contrary to international law . Yon must separate his motive from his act ; if this was justifiable according to the law of nations , you can not say that he has treated you with injustice , or that the consequences of his lawful act are to be charged to his account . We maintain that in the state of things which then existed there was no necessary malignity in pronouncing our relation to the Confederate government one of war . This is shown , fir8t , by the opinions expressed at the time . And here we shall cite opinions expressed , it may be , a week or two later , without fear of being accused of dealing unfairly with facts . After President Lincoln 's proclamation of blockade , there was no point of time when it could be said with more truth that war had begun than just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely no great crime , and possibly a man or a government might be pardoned if he assigned to it an earlier For much in this paragraph , see Mr. Bemis 's " hasty recognition of rebel belligerency , " ete. , Part I. See , also , Mr.Adams 's correspondence in Message of the President and Documents of 1861-2. 1 . 8* seq. , etc. // commencement . But let us see what opinions were expressed by friends and foes , and by observers on both sides of the water . Mr. Everett , in an address at Roxbury , Mass. , May 8th , 1861 , uses this language : " The war , for a long time , though in profound peace , secretly prepared for , has been openly corninenced by the South , by the seizure of the undefended forts , arsenals , dock-yards , mints , and custom-houses of the United State ' * " etc . Then he adds , " but even these acts of treason ' and rebellion , for such they are , are thrown in the shade by that unutterable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " etc . That is , the war began before the attack on Fort Sumter , in the opinion of this eminent man , a statesman , an ambassador , and one who himself had it in contemplation at one time to write on international law . The spcech abounds with similar expressions . The same thing in substance is implied in a letter of the Secretary of State , to the agent of a steamship company , on the 16th of May , who had accepted or proposed to accept an offer of Governor Letcher to sell to . him certain steam vessels , which that governor of a seceding State had seized in the waters of Virginia . " The executive authorities of the State are l ) arties to the insurrection , and so are public enemies . It is treason for any person to give aid and comfort to public enemies . To sell vessels to them which it is their purpose to use as ships-ofwar is to give them aid and comfort . " But of a still earlier date , of the fourth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Minister at Paris , in which the Secretary says that " the insurgents have instituted revolution , with open , flagrant , deadly war , to compel the United States to acquiesce in the dismemberment of the Union . The United States have accepted this war as an inevitable necessity . " So also thought Stephen A. Douglas , who is reported as saying in Chicago , on the first of May , that " armies have been raised and war is levied to accomplish a Southern conspiracy ; " and again , " we can not close our eyes to the sad and solemn fact that war does exist. ** That excellent man Joseph bIt , the Judge-Advocate General , was of the same opinion . In a letter to a gentleman in // Kentucky . dated May 31 , after speaking of the design of the Southern leaders to precipitate a collision of arms , in order to induce the border States to array themselves against the government , he comes to the attack on and the capture of Fort Sumter , and then says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any government whose history has been written . " The same views appear in certain resolutions of the Chamber of Commerce , of New York , which were published on the 20th of April . " The so-called secession of some of the Southern States , " they say , has " culminated into war , ' * and " that , while deploring the advent of civil war , which has been precipitated upon the country by the madness of the South , the Chamber is persuaded that policy and humanity alike demand that it should be met by the most prompt and energetic measures . " They then urge on the government to treat vessels with commissions from the Confederate government as pirates , and urge the blockade of ports in those States which have commenced war against the constitution and government of these United States , " as a measure demanded for defense in war . " Nor ought we to neglect adding that Mr. Caleb Cushing spoke , on the 24th of April , of " the dire calamity of civil war that is upon us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first for the conservation of the Union , and then to avert the evils of a fratricidal war . But the day of discussion had passed and the day of action had arrived . " But let us see how Americans of distinction , who happened to be abroad , looked on the state of things . The eminent historian and ambassador , Mr. Motley , shall represent them . The excellent letter which he wrote to the London Times , the date of which is not given in the copy before us , but which , as its contents show , belongs to the month of May , begins in this strain : " The de facto question in America has been referred at last to the dread arbitrament of war . " " It is often asked why have the Americans taken up arms ? Why has the United States government plunged into what is sometimes called this wicked war ? ' Especially it is thought amazing in England that the Pi*esident should have called for a large // army of volunteers and regulars , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man at this call , like men suddenly relieved from a spell . " To these opinions of our own countrymen , showing that in their judgment war existed at a date anterior to the Queen 's proclamation , we subjoin a single sentence from an able and dispassionate Article in the London News of May 9 . " The effect of the civil war in America , " says the writer , " upon European commerce is certainly one of the most important questions which ever engaged public attention . " This Article ' is remarkable for some views and suggestions in regard to the mode of conducting the war , and for fully expecting that the sea would be filled with cruisers both of the United and Confederate States . Other extracts from English papers show that it was thought that hostilities began with the fall of Sumter . That the Southern Confederacy considered themselves to be at war with the United States will , perhaps , be thought hardly to need proof . They wanted to make the most of everything , just as our government wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to an extremity that the halting slave States might take sides with them , as it was important for our government to represent that the difficulties were obstructions in collecting the revenue , and that the opposition to law came from armed mobs . A sentence or two will suffice to show how the Confederates expressed themselves . The Secretary of War of the Confederate States , Walker , said on the 12th of April , " no man could tell where the war , this day commenced , would end . " A. II . Stephens spoke on the 30th of April to this effect : " a threatening war is upon us , made by those who have no regard to right . " Jefferson Davis in his message to the Confederate Congress of April the 29th , uses the following words : " Scarcely had the President of the United States received intelligence of the failure of the scheme which he had devised for the relief of Fort Sumter , when he issued the declaration of war against this Confederacy which has prompted me now to convoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after recitin* what had been done by the government of the United States to their detriment , // authorizes their President " to use the whole land and naval force of the Confederate States to meet the war thus commenced , and to issue to private armed vessels , commissions or letters of rnarque and general reprisal , " etc . The rest of the act is taken up with regulating privateers , captures , and adjudications in the courts of the Confederate States . Thus persons of all descriptions agreed , early in the month of May , and even iu April , 1861 , in holding that a state of war had coinmen*ed . Was it strange that the British government should share this opinion ? But we go farther and say that facts looked strongly in the same direction . What these facts are a few words are sufficient to indicate . First , we notice the secession of a number of States beginning with that of South Carolina ( Dec. 1860 ) , followed by Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Florida , and Louisiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas in the first days of May . Then ensued the framing of the constitution of the Confederate States by seven States-those mentioned above with the exception of Texas and Arkansas , and with the cooperation of delegates from North Carolina . This occurred in February . Then came the choice of a President and other public officers , the inauguration of Davis , the Confederate States army bill , the proclamation of Davis on letters of marque and reprisal , and the act of the Confederate Congress once before referred to , recognizing the state of war , sanctioning their President 's proclamation and legislating with minuteness on the matters of cruisers and capture . The last of these was made known May 6 , and could not have come to the knowledge of the English government before the 13th of May ; but the others , which must before that date have been well known in England , certainly showed a settled purpose of separation and a sort of established government . Next , the acts of violence which occurred in these earlier months of the year are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the forts on the Southern coast with the exception of fort Pickens , the capture of the Star of the West , and that of 450 United States regulars , both by Van Dorn , in Texas , and in the mouth of April , the firing on vessels sent to relieve fort Sumter , and the bombardment of that fort itself . // All this was known in England before the 13th of ' May , at least with the exception of the events in Texas . And lastly , the two proclamations of Mr. Lincoln are to be taken into account , the one of April 15 , calling for 75,000 men of the militia of the Union , on the ground that combinations of persons in certain States , too powerful to be suppressed by eonrts or marshals , had obstructed the execution of the law ; and the other of April 19 , after the proclamation of Davis inviting applications for letters of marque and reprisal had become known at Washington , announcing that the President deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , which might be made the rendezvous or the sallying point of privateers . In these proclamations the movements of the Southern Confederacy were not called by the name of war , although an insurrection falls not far short of the import of that word , for it was prudent for the government to put the mildest title on events , and perhaps Mr. Lincoln , if asked might have denied that war existed . Yet , as we have said once before , the neutral was not to judge of events by the names given to them so much as by their essence .. The whole stream of events ran with resistless flow in the direction of severance of the Union , of a Southern Confederate government , and , if resistance were to be offered , of armed rebellion . INor was it necessary that the definite point of time or the precise act should be specified from which the war began . Different persons would entertain different opinions , while all agreed that it began in the spring of 1861 . Such differences existed on this side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake in regard to such a point of time , was it a mistake confined to them or necessarily implying designed hostility to this country ? Here we come to another important head of our suilect . Whenever the war began , is the President 's proclamation of blockade to be regarded as an act of war , so that if war had not commenced before , that act was its initiation ? It is sometimes said that the proclamation announced only an intention to lay a blockade . This is true . It did not make the world to know that a blockade had already been instituted . But it declared // that a competent force would be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit from the ports of certain States . A declaration of war is not war in one sense , but a state of war may certainly be said to commence at such a declaration . And so a proclamation of blockade , if blockade means war , is the beginning of a state of hostilities . But does blockade mean war , or might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Here the doctrine of pacific blockade meets us , which a man so well informed as Mr. Sumner , in matters relating to international law , has advoca. ted in his speech . One may be sure that where such a close and thorough student as he , takes up a side on a question of public law , there is something of weight to be said in its favor ; and yet we hope to make it appear that there is no sufficient authority for the notion of a pacific blockade , that all blockade known to the law of nations is a belligerent act , and that it is no safer for our government to put faith in such a doctrine than to do what it did in the case of the Trent . Mr. Sumner , to his lasting honor , taught the country good doctrine then ; may he see the truth in the present controversy also , and appear again in the attitude of a public benefactor . A person , we believe , may look through all the old books on international law without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pacific blockade was dreamed of . Its birth is a very modern one . It is hardly forty years of age , and for more than thirty has slept a most profound steep . Its parentage is due to the fertile genius of those nations who imposed a paper blockade upon the neutrals of sixty years ago . Let us look at it as it appeared in its active state , and what can be said for and against it . The theory of pacific blockade was first acted upon in the year 1827 ' , from which time until 1838 , when the last application of the pretended principle occurred , there were in all about five cases of it , one , or perhaps two , in European waters , and three in South Amnerican. * The first was the blockade of Heifter ( 112 , note 3 ) mentions four cases , that first spoken of in our text , a blockade of the coasts of Portugal by France , in 1831 , one of New Granada by England , in 1836 , and the Mexican blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the coasts of Greece to prevent troops and other supplies from reaching the Turkish army in that country , and to blockade the fleet of Egypt and Turkey within the harbor of Navarino . This was set on foot after the refusal of the Porte to accept the mediation or intervention contemplated in the treaty of London of July , 1827 . The neutrals were duly notified of the blockade , and the three powers , Great Britain , France , and Russia , through their representatives at Constantinople , declared that a state of peace and friendship with Turkey had not ceased . The end of this state of affairs was the destruction of the blockaded fleet at the battle of Navarino , October 20 , of the same year . We ask , in passing , whether the peace ended at the beginning of this fearful sea-fight or lasted through it ? and to this we add that no one now will question the justice of this interference on behalf of oppressed Greece ; but the right and the righteousness of calling things by the wrong names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is most emphatically questioned . When after the battle of IN avarino the ambasssadors assured Perter-Effendi that amity was unbroken , he replied , " it is exactly as if I had broken a man 's head and at the same time assured him of my friendship . Would not such conduct be absurd ? " Two other noteworthy cases of the exercise of this pretended right , were the blockade of the Atlantic ports of Mexico by the French , commenced in 1838 , and that of the Argentine Republic 's ports by France and Great Britain in the same year . In the first case , the French took the fortress of St. Juan d ' Ulloa , and Vera Cruz , still preserving profonud peace : thereupon war was declared by the Mexicans and a treaty of peace , after the old fashion , was soon made between the parties. * the blockade of the Argentine Republic , in 1838 , the most remarkable of all . Comp . Hautefenille , II. , 2 ' 72 seq. , 2nd ed. , and Gessner , in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seq . * The blockade became effective for Vera Cruz the 16th of April , 1835 ; St. Juan d'Ulloa was given up by the garrison Nov. 28th , of the same year ; and on the same day a convention was made between the French admiral and the Mexican commander of the department of Vera Crux , engaging that a Mexican garri son of only one thousand men should be retained in the city , and that the block . ade should be suspended during eight months . Two days afterwards , the Mexican government passed a decree that there was a state of war between them and // In the other instance , the blockade lasted as long as the siege of Troy . The proceedings , as far as neutrals were concerned , were all regular . In 1848 , a Brazilian vessel , the Comte de T/iomar , was seized for breach of blockade . In the French court of first instance , it was released on the ground of a want of special notification , although a part of the cargo , consisting of contraband of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision was reversed , because there could be no such thing as contraband of war save in time of war , while this was a pacific blockade. * The logical French felt that if there was a state of peace , they must come to this conclusion , but the sound sense of the English stuck to the ordinary rule that breach of blockade involved confiscation of the guilty vessel . Th* proceedings of the French in Portugal , in the year 1831 , can not , without impropriety , be classed among the few instances of pacific blockade . This will appear from the brief est sketch of the affair . Don Miguel 's courts having condenined certain Frenchmen to disgraceful punishments on account of political offenses , the French government , which had not recognized him , and was not in amicable relations with him , sent a fleet to the ' Tagus to demand , and in case of refusal to obtain by force , satisfaction . The demands being rejected , the admiral sailed up the river , silenced the forts that opposed his passage , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ships along the streets of Lisbon which bordered on the water . The government did not yield until he threatened to commence hostilities upon the city . Then satisfaction was rendered , but certain vessels of war that had been captured were carried away by the French . The Portuguese government , although unrecognized by Great the French government . This led the French to revoke their suspension of the blockade so far that the neutral vessels could now only enter the port of Vera Cruz without discharging their cargoes . ( Circular of December 22d . ) Peace was concluded the next year . See de Martens , N. Recueil , 15 , 803-817. * Compare Gessner , p. 216 , and the French notification of blockade in de Martens , N. Recuell , 15 , 503 , where it is said that " measures of rigor , authorized by the law of nations , will be taken against vessels seeking to enter the blockaded ports after being warned of the blockade by one of the French vessels of war . " // Britain , besought that ancient ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lord Palinerston declined doing so , and added that , in accordance with legal advice , he considered the vessels just prizes of war . Certainly this instance given by Heifter must be taken out of the class in which he puts it . There was war here , and nothing else . * The writers of international law , who have written since this doctrine of pacific blockade was hatched , have by no means all noticed it-in fact , the greater part have passed it over in silence . Without looking very far , we believe that we have a right to say that it has lain outside of the notice of all the principal English and American writers.t Jiantefenille , perhaps , was the first to draw attention upon it , which he did , with the denial of its right to form a part of the law of nations , in his first edition of 1848 . The protest was rei ? iewed against it in the greatly altered edition of 1858 . Meanwhile ileifter , in his third edition of 1855 , advocated it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written . Since then , ( Irtolan , by not mentioning it in his " diplomacy of the sea , " seems to show that he views it with no f4vor . Dc Pistoye and Duverdy , in their Trait* des Prises , have denied that there is any such blockade , Cauchy has defended it , and Gessner , a German author who has written in French ( le droit des neutres sur mer , Berlin , 1865 ) , is decided in his condemnation of the doctrine . We give the views of Heifter , as representing his side of the question . " A state of blockade , " says he ( * 112 , ed. 3 , of the ( Thrman &amp;riginal ) , " can be set on foot , even before war and without a complete opening of war , whether for the purpose of practising reprisals , or for that of hindering an imminent violation of rights ,  --  as , for instance , to prevent the running out of a squadron or the conveyance of succor to the enemy , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions , which , meantime , arouse suspicion . It is true that examples of this kind of blockade , as of a sort * See the documents in Murhard , N. Supplement 3 , 6Th-61 3 , and A. L. von Rochau 's Gesch . Frankreichs 1 , 314. * We do not mean to be understood that the editors and annotators of Wheaton have not noticed it . See Lawrence 's Wheaton , 846 , 846 Dana 's , 36 , 37. // of reprisals without formal war , are first furnished by the most recent history ; yet there can be no doubt that this step is a perfectly justifiable one , and that even neutral powers are bound thereby . Only no confiscation takes place , except where there is a state of war . " And , in a note , he adds , that " these measures , as being hitherto little used , might awaken some scruple , but , so far as is known , they have not*been decidedly attacked by other powers . " And then , after referring to Hautefeuille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only rejoice in this new nsage of international law . " The arguments on the other side are , first , that blockade has always , except in these few instances , been considered a warright , and classed with such rights by all the old writers . These writers were well acquainted with reprisals and embargoes , or detention of vessels , for the purpose of securing justice , which were far more common in the early times than they have been in the most modern ; and yet the first instance has not been found of a resort to blockade in a time of peace , or of an earlier writer suggesting or advocating such a measure . " All the treaties , " says llautefeuille , " which have spoken of blockade , express themselves in the same manner ; if not in the same words at least in the same sense . All , without exception , suppose that one of the contracting parties is engaged in a war against a third power , that the other nation signing the treaty is neutral ; and they establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pacific party . It is impossible to deny , to fail to perceive , this fact . From the most ancient treaties down to our days , there is r*ot one of these treaties that does not make use of the expressions , enemy , belligerent , neutral , and which , in the whole of its provisions , does not indicate clearly that blockade is an act of war . " Secondly , pacific blockade is not justified by the analogy of reprisals . It seems strange to us that ileifter takes refuge under so weak an analogy . Reprisals are acts , the operation of which is confined to the parties between whom a dispute exists . They resemble distraining goods for failure to pay rent . But paci*c blockade obstructs the pathway of neutrals ; it interferes with their ordinary rights ; it imposes new laws upon them ; it even captures their vessels and , it may be , sub // jects them to confiscation . Where else do we find a right exercised in a state of peace by armed force with such effects on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Heifter 's defense of such blockades , regards them as a particular species of war , a war of siege . But to this Gessner replies in language which we accept as best expressing our opinions , that " the French writer does not suppress the contradiction that there is in carrying on a partial war , which strikes a blow at a part of the state without striking it at the state considered as a whole . If the state were merely an inert mechanism , perhaps one of its parts could be injured while the others were unaffected . But the state is a living organism , and that which wounds one of its members wounds them all . A particular kind of war , which is confined to certain parts of the state , is as great an absurdity as to say that a slap on the cheek is not an insult to the entire man . During the last war in the East , it was proposed in the British Parliament to blockade the Baltic ports of Prussia , because Prussia would not take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a small majority . 1f this proposition had been put into execution , would it have touched the Prussian ports only ? Would it not have been equivalent to a declaration of war against Prussia ? " t Fourthly . It can not fairly be said that such a practice , if introduced , would be a gain to humanity . The blockades of this kind have , except in about two instances , been followed by an actual state of war , and by the destruction of men and of public property . In one of those two instances , the siege or blockade continued ten years , and left IRosas , the author of the difficulties , at the head of the Argentine Republic . There have been wars without a declaration , concentrated in one maritime enterprise , often brief in their continuance , but their brevity was owing to the fact that great nations were engaged in operations against small ones . Suppose they had declared * De Martens ( 61 , ed. of 1858 ) speaking of reprisals , says , " les moyens choisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ' tine tierce puissance arnie. * Gessner , p. 219. // war and called their movements war , might not these movements have then been as limited in place and time as they actually were ? Is a nation obliged , because it is at war , to wage it on both elements , or is a real war necessarily a protracted one ? Has not a six weeks ' war on the land but jus*t now changed the political balance of Europe ? Nor is ileifter 's plea that neutrals did not protest against these pacific blockades of any weight . To them these operations were war , with its usual notifications of blockade and its dangers to neutrals . Their relations to the states between whom a controversy existed were the same as in war . They did not need to look beyond the facts , which were facts of war . But the most serious fault which we find with the views of Heifter is , that he can be willing to make international law out of a few instances of confessedly novel practice on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be degraded into a fashion set by the leaders of national custom , it must be of a very shifting character . There is , then , as it seems to us , really nothing to be urged in favor of pacific blockades , on the score of authority , or of reason , or of humanity , and they must be classed with those other inventions of nations powerful on the sea , which juster views and more accurate science have brushed away . President Lincoln 's blockade , then , was not a pacific blockade , because there is no such nondescript , half lion , half lamb , known to the law of nations or to right reason . But if there were such a peaceful procedure , having the effect of war on neutral trade , the decisions of our courts shut us out from making use of it in any arg ument , which aims to show that there was no war between the United states and the rebels when the Queen'e proclamation was issued . This question , after being first argued before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on appeal before the Supreme Court of the United States in the December term of 1862 . The point to be decided was the validity of the capture of certain vessels  --  the Amy Warwick , Hiawatha , Crenshaw , and Brilliante-all of which were made between April // measures of our government . Of these vessels the Amy Warwick , owned in Richmond and bound from Rio de Janeiro to that or some other port of the United States , was taken , in ignorance of the war , off Cape Henry , on the 10th of July , 1861 ; and the Hiawatha was an English vessel , which left Richmond , May 17th , and was taken on the 20th off Hampton roads . Passing by the pleas set up by the counsel in favor of the claimants , we come to the decision of the majority of the court . It contained these statements of principles : 1 . That a civil war is never solemnly declared , and becomes such by its accidents . The true test of its existence may be thus summarily stated : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt , rebellion , or insurrection , so that the Courts of Justice can not be kept open , civil war exists , and hostilities may be prosecuted on the same footing , as if those opposing the government were foreign enemies invading the land . " 2 . Although by the Constitution Congress alone can declare war , and the President has no power to initiate a war either against a foreign enemy or a domestic state , yet , if war be made by invasion or organized rebellion , the President is bound to resist force by force . Nor is a war any the less war , though the declaration of it be unilateral , for war may exist without any declaration on either side . The battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de Ia Palma had been fought before the passage of an act of Congress of May 13th , 1846 , which recognized a state of war as existing by the act of the republic of Mexico . 3 . Because a war is called an insurrection as the President called it in his proclamation it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary that the independence of the revolted province or state be acknowledged , in order to constitute it a party belligerent in a war , according to the law of nations . In the case of the Santissima Trinidad , the Supreme Court said , " the government of the United States had recognized the existence of a civil war between Spain and her colonies , and had avowed the determination to remain neutral between the parties ; and that each party was deemed by us a belligerent nation , having , so far as concerns us , the sovereign rights of war . " 4 . After such a proclamation as that of the Queen of England recognizing hostilities as existing between // the government of the United States and certain States , styling themselves the Confederate States of America , and after similar declarations or silent acquiescence by other nations , a citizen of a foreign State is estopped to deny the existence of a war with all its consequences as regards neutrals . They can not ask a court to affect a technical ignorance of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . and thus cripple the arm of the government and paralyze its power by subtle definitions and ingenious sophisms. * 5 . The proclamation of blockade is itself official and conclusive evidence to the court that a state of war existed , which demanded and authorized a recourse to such a measure under the circumstances peculiar to the case . The question whether the President , in fulfilling his duties as Cqmmander-in-Chief in suppressing an insurrection , has met with such armed hostile resistance , and a civil war of such alarming proportions , as will compel him to accord to them the character of belligerents , is a question to be decided by him . He must determine what degree of force the crisis demands . The court was of the opinion that the President had a right , jure belli , to institute a blockade of ports in possession of the States in rebellion , which neutrals are bound to regard . Nor did the court doubt that a blockade of ports , properly under the jurisdiction of the FJnited States , but in a territory where rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign ports . The minority of the court dissented from this decision on constitutional grounds . The President , not having the right to declare war or recognize its existence within the meaning of the law of nations , and thus to change the country and all its citizens from a state of peace to a state of war , they judged that he had no power to set on foot a blockade under the law of nations , and that therefore all captures before July 13 , 1861 , when Congress recognized the state of civil war , were illegal and void . It is to be observed that this minority did not doubt that the blockade was an act of regular war , nor 9 * This applies particularly to the case of the Hiawatha. // that a State can blockade its own port , nor that a civil war affects neutral rights in the same way as any other kind of hostilities . They only denied , and let us add , most techincally and formally , that the blockade was proclaimed without competent authority . Perhaps if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacific blockade , their argument from , that source would have been about equally satisfactory. * Thus war existed according to the judgment of our highest court before the President 's proclamation , which he recognized by that measure , and against which , by this as well as by various other measures , he eudeavored , as was his duty , to defend the country . There existed then , according to this authority , a state of actual war , a considerable time before the Queen 's proclamation . That the majority of the court took a right view of the matter we fully believe , but whether they were right or wrong , in their opinion , it weakens whatever arguments to the contrary , our government or our statesmen can urget or have urged on the other side4 We proceed now to a brief examination of the consequences which have been attributed to the Queen 's proclamation . By conceding ocean belligerency to the rebels , and thus saving them from the penalties of piracy , it encouraged British subjects to join their cause ; - it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . " At the early date when this was done , " says Mr. Sumner , in his speech of April 13th , " the * In that case compensation might have been justly claimed by the British government for these condemned vessels according to the principle of the French courts , to which we have referred , but not in accordance with English practices . The French principle alone can stand . * See Black 's reports , 2 , 635-639 . We have stated those opinions which bear on our subject , and chiefly in the words of Judge Grier and Judge Nelson , without the trouble of adding quotation marks . See also the note of Mr. Dana-who was counsel for the Libellants , in the case of the Amy Warwick-on Wheaton 3 ' 74-3 ' 75 , and Mr. Pomeroy 's introd. to constitutional law , 44 ' 1-453 . The opinions both of the majority and minority of the court are to be found in the supplement to Lawrence 's Wheaton , ( 2nd ed. ) p. 13. * May it not be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there was no actual war , he had no authority to take this step . Actual war may be constitutionally repnlsed and put down by measures of war . But who gave him a right in time of peace to adopt a measure which seriously affected the trade of neutrals ? // rebels were , as they remained to the close , without ships on the ocean , without prize courts or other tribunals for the administration of justice on the ocean , without any of those conditions which are the essential prerequisite to such a concession ; and yet the concession was general , being applicable to the ocean and the land , so that by British fiat they became ocean belligerents , as well as land belligerents . " And again , " had it not been made , no rebel ship could have been built in England . Every step in her building would have been piracy . Nor could any munitions of war have been furnished . Not a blockade*runner . laden with supplies could have left the English shores , except under a kindred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the rebels on an equality with ourselves in all British markets , whether of ships or of munitions of war . " This is confirmed by the authority already cited of Lord Chelmsford , who said in Parliament that " if the Southern Confederacy had not been recognized as a belligerent power , if any Englishman were to fit out a privateer for the purpose of assisi*ing the Southern States against the Northern States , he would be guilty of piracy . " And on this action of the proclamation a claim of immense damages is made to depend . There is something that is true in these fervid sentences , and more that will not stand examination . We will look at the weak points first . We say then at the outset that if there was a state of war , as our courts judged , even before Mr. Lincoln 's proclamation , there was no violation of international law , and no injury of the United States in publishing the fact . Whatever unhappy consequences grew out of an authorized act , it does not appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is most obviously true , unless such consequences were clearly foreseen , and the Queen 's proclamation chosen deliberately as the means for bringing them to pass . Again , it is not true that the rebels had no ships on the ocean and no prize courts , nor that ocean belligerency on their part was created by the Queen 's proclamation . They were indeed quite poorly off as it respects skill in constructing vessels , means of obtaining machinery for steamships , skilled engineers // and sailors , but they had at a very early date of the war a settled purpose to prey on our commerce upon the sea , just as they plundered our property on the land . In his message to the Confederate Congress of April 29 , Mr. Davis announced that " two vessels had been purchased and manned , the Sumter and McRea , and are now being prepared for sea at New Orleans with all possible despatch . " The Savannah , a pilot boat which was fitted out for a sea expedition in May , was taken by the Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , where it arrived June 15 . This was the vessel whose crew were tried for piracy and , were afterwards treated as prisoners of war . The Sumter , mentioned above , ran out to sea , early in July , escaping the blockading squadron at the mouth of the Mississippi , pursued a career of ' plundering in the West Indian seas , and then crossed the ocean , to lie useless and inactive under the watch of the Tuscarora in Spain . Its commander was that most self-satisfied mortal , Raphael Semmes , afterwards of the Alabama . The York , another of this fraternity , was burnt by the United States steamboat Union , in August . The privateer Jefferson Davis , after taking the bark Alvarado , was wrecked on the bar of St. A ugustine in the same month . The little Confederate privateer Nixon ran out of the Mississippi and escaped the clutches of the Niagara on the first of August . The privateer Judali was burnt by men of the Colorado , in September , while getting ready , at Pensacola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blockade at Charleston , in October , and destroyed the Harvey Burch on its passage across the ocean . These , we are aware , were small and inferior vessels , but they initiated ocean belligerency before , and long before , any of the large gunboats built in England began their work of destruction . Again , it is not true that the Confederates were without prize courts , if it be meant that no provision was made by their laws or their constitution for adjudication upon captured vessels . The constitution was copied after ours in this respect . The act of the 6th of May , to which we referred once before , is almost entirely taken up with the conduct to be observed by privateers . Enemy 's property on neutral vessels is not to // be seized ; the usual bonds are . required , prize money is to be distributed according to certain rnles ; property of amicable powers recaptured is to be restored on the payment of reasonable salvage ; captured vessels are to be brought into some port of the Confederate States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against before a competent tribunal ; and in the case of captured vessels , goods , and effects brought within the jurisdiction of the Confederate District Courts of said States are to have exclusive original jurisdiction . These are some of the provisions of the Act , which also offers a bounty for burning or capturing vessels of the United States , and allows a reduction to be made of 33* per cent . on the arnonnt of duties imposed by law , whenever any captured wares or merchandise are brought into port . This act , it is probable , will be found to have been copied , to a great extent , after our own ; but it shows that from the very first , war on the sea , in a manner conformable with the rules of civilized warfare , was within the contemplation of the Confederates . Again , it can not be true that there would have been no bnil ding of privateers in England , nor blockade running , nor trade in the munitions of war , but for the Queen 's proclamation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penalties of piracy would have deterred from all such aid to rebels and traitors . But as soon as it was established by our courts that Mr. Lincoln 's blockade implied the existence of war , every other nation could have protested against visiting the pains of piracy upon its subjects . Moreover , the penalties would not have been execnted . The fear of a bitter retaliation , and the singular gentleness of Mr. Lincoln 's spirit , to whom vengeance " was a strange work , " would have made them a dead letter , and this would have been found out by all the world . As for blockade runners in particular , we are not sure that we understand what Mr. Sumner has in view , when he says that not one of them " could have left the English shores except under a kindred penalty , " that is , a penalty kindred to piracy . But what penalty worse than confiscation of ship and goods would the United States have inflicted on them ? Or would the dread of this have outweighed commercial cupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest penalties of the law never put an end to the slave trade  --  a far more disgraceful traffic . These blockade runners it was that protracted the Southern rebellion . The privateers , built in England , harmed us by actual loss , and , to a considerable extent , drove our commerce from the sea . But the actual loss was a limited and a definite one , to be estimated in dollars and cents , as Mr. Seward estimated it in one of his despatches to Mr. Adams . On the other hand , the evil inflicted by the blockade-runners was an immense one . Every gun , all the powder imported , all the cotton taken back , was so much fuel for a long war , warming the rebels into hope when they were nigh despair . But the proclamation of neutrality , as we conceive , had a small effect in calling into life this traffic ; and if there had been no such proclamation , supplies would have been furnished . We freely concede that the rebels drew hope from the attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the attitude of the governing class toward the United States , that they would be recognized as an established government . We conclude , also , that the proclamation was not called for by any pressing necessity , and so far forth was dictated by a misjudgment of probabilities , or by a wrong bias . There was , as we all thought , a wish that the country might be divided , and this was as well known to rebel agents and the rebel government as to us . Let this hostile mind come in as evidence , if any is needed , whenever the Alabama claims are argued before an arbitrator , in case the negotiations are to take that shape ; let it be remembered , if that must be , as a ground of war , but there let its influence stop . It is the inevitable conclusion from the foregoing argument , that no consequences flowing out of this proclamation , be they as great as Mr. Sumner 's imagination makes them , or as small as a professed advocate of England would make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice into the discussion of the Alabama question . For , if President Lincoln had declared in effect that a state of war existed , if , according to the decisions of our courts , reviewing the circumstances of the tir*ie , such was the fact , if the blockade imposed on Southern ports could not be called a pacific one , if from the // fall of Sumter our first men regarded a state of war as having begun ; the British government can not be chargeabl* with any offense against international law , in making known the same fact to British subjects , and in warning them of the municipal as well as of the international penalties of trausgressing against the laws of neutrality . Cau they not fairly say , " there was war , and we warned against the temptations incident to a state of war to which neutrals are exposed ? How are we responsible for any disastrous results , near or remote , flowing out of the announcement of such a fact and of the dangers to which it might expose our countrymen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be demanded from Great Britain . Apology is a kind of reparation most honorable to one who has committed a violation of international law . But internatiQual law does not require confession for the sins of the heart . One nation never takes the stool of penitence to make confession to another except for some positive outward act . The case of the Caroline and Lord Ashbnrton 's regret that such a thing had occurred , have been adduced as a wrong and a reparation , showing to us what we have a right to expect in the present instance . But the Caroline was invaded within our waters ; the Canadian leaders of that expedition committed an offense of an overt kind against the laws of neutrality . But what overt act of wrong was there in the proclamation of neutrality ? The moment we overthrow the position that there was no war , and Great Britain ought to have acted as if there were none , that moment all possibility of calling for an apology is cut off . There is nothing to apologize for unless a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation listen to the suggestion to make such an apology ? Would it ever say , on compulsion or at the prompting of another state , that it had acted unwisely ? If we have been successful in the foregoing remarks , we have performed our main task , which was to brush away all those extraneous considerations that have accumulated around the question of the Alabama . They do not properly go with it , they have no pertinency to it , they ought not to be taketi into account . We might , therefore , here come to a close , but the simple case of the Alabama itself , perhaps , needs to be // presented to onr readers , who may have been familiar enough with the Aiscussions arising out of it several years ago , but may have now forgotten some of those facts and those points of international law which ought to be looked at , if we would take a just view of the case . More than a year had elapsed since the date of the Queen 's proclamation , when our minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building for the Confederate States , at the shipyards of the Lairds , on the other side of the Mersey from Liverpool . On the 23d of June , he writes to Earl Russell that a war-steamer more powerful than the gunboat Oreto ( or Florida ) and built in the dock-yard of persons , one of whom was at the time a member of the House of Commons , had been launched and was now fitting out for the especial and manifest object of carrying on hostilities by sea , and that it was " about to be commanded by one of the insnrgent agents , the same who sailed in the Oreto . " " The parties , " he adds , " engaged in the enterprise , are persons well known at Liverpool to be agents and officers of the insurgents in the United States , the nature and extent of whose labors are well explained in the copy of an intercepted letter of one of them , which I received from my government some days ago , and which I had the honor to place in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now transmits , by way of confirmation of what he had said , new evidence received from the American consul at Liverpool , and begs that either the projected expedition may be stopped , or the fact be established that its purpose is not inimical to the people of the United States . Earl Russell replies ( June 25th ) that the matter has been referred to the proper department of the government , and again , in a note of July 4th , suggests to Mr. Adams that the consul of the United States at Liverpool be instructed to submit to the collector of customs there the evidence in his possession relating to the destination of the vessel . Meanwhile , the Lords Commissioner of the Treasury , " the proper department of the government , " as we suppose , report ( July 1st ) that they have , through the collector at Liverpool , found the description of the vessel to be correct , " that she // is evidently and avowedly intended for a ship of war , that she has several powder canisters on board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the current report iu regard to the vessel is that she has been built by a foreign government , which is not denied by the Messrs . Laird with whom the surveyor has conferred ; but they do not appear disposed to reply to any questions respecting the destination of the vessel after she leaves Liverpool , and the officers have no other reliable source of information on that point ; and , having referred the matter to their solicitor , he has reported his opinion that at present there is not sufficient ground to warrant the detention of the vessel or any interference on the part of this department , in which report they beg to express their concurrence . " To this they add the advice that seems to have led to Earl Russell 's letter of July 4th , that the American consul should submit his evidence in regard to the destination of the vessel to the collector at Liverpool , since , without full evidence to jnstify their proceedings , " the seizing officers might entail on themselves and on the government very serious consequences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted in accordance with this recommendation , but as he did not affix to the paper which he submitted to the collector the legal form of evidence* it was rejected . This omission was afterwards supplied . The evidence in the possession of our minister and of the consul was submitted to a legal adviser , Mr. IR . P. Collier , Queen 's counsel , whose opinion ( given July 16th ) was , that the evidence was almost conclusive in favor of the vessel being fitted out as a privateer for the use of the Confederate government , in contravention of the provisions of the foreign enlistment act He also advised that the chief officer of customs at Liverpool should be immediately applied to , in order to seize the vessel , as the said act authorized him to do , with a view to her condemnation , an indemnity being given him if he required it . It would at the same time be proper , he thought , to inform the foreign secretary of the fact , and to add the request that the government would direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizure , if it had been made . " If the matter were not urgent , " says he , " I would advise no other steps being taken until it was known whether or not the government // thought fit to interfere ; but inasmuch as the government might not unreasonably take some little time to determine what course to pursue , during which time the vessel might escape , I advise the more prompt remedy . " Mr. Adams , feeling the urgency of the case , now sends to Earl Russell copies of those same depositions which the consul had placed in the hands of the collector at Liverpool , and two days afterwards-July 24th-submitted to him two more depositions relating to the same matter , together with a second opinion given by Mr. Collier . This opinion contains the following expressions : " I am of opinion that the collector of customs would be justified in detaining the vessel . Indeed , I should think that if he allows the vessel to leave Liverpool , he will incur a heavy responsibility ,  --  a responsibility of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be acting , must take their share . It appears difficult to make out a stronger case of infringement of the foreign enlistment act , which , if not enforced on this occasion , is little better than a dead letter . It well deserves consideration whether , if the vessel be allowed to escape , the federal government would not have serious grounds of remonstrance . " On the same day that Mr. Collier gave that opinion-July 23d-another legal agent of Mr. Adams writes to the Board of Customs , and puts into their hands two new affidavits , the same to which Mr. Adams had called Earl Russell 's attention , together with Mr. Collier 's opinion . lie adds , that he had that morning learned that instructions were forwarded the day before to the collector at Liverpool not to exercise the powers of the act in this instance ; on the ground that the facts disclosed in the affidavits made before him were not sufficient to justify the collector in seizing the vessel . He asks , on behalf of the government of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest possible description , " and closes by saying that the gunboat was now lying in Birkenhead docks ready for sea in all respects , with a crew of fifty men on board , and might sail at any time , for which reason he had sent the depositions directly to the Board of Custom , instead of transmitting them according to ordinary rule through the collector . // This letter induced the Board of Customs to refer the matter to the law officers of the crown , whose opinion would be followed-they say-as to the matter of seizing the vessel . It must have been at this time that the unfortunate 4elay occurred , of which Earl Russell spoke in a conference with Mr. Adams on the 1st of August . His lordship-says our minister-first took up the case of " 290 " ( the Alabama ) " and remarked that a delay in determining upon it had most unexpectedly been caused by the sudden development of a malady of the Queen 's advocate , Sir John Harding , totally incapacitating him for business. * This had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been at last given for the detention of the gunboat , but before the order got down to Liverpool the vessel was gone . He should , however , send directions to have her stopped if she went , as was probable , to Nassau . " Mr. Adams subjoins these words : " I said I was aware that the gunboat was off , but I did not say what I myself have little doubt of : , that her sudden departure was occasioned by a notion , obtained somehow or other , that such a proceeding was impending . " t The opinion of the legal advisers of the Crown was given on the 29th of July in favor of detaining the vessel , but the same day she sailed out of Liverpool without register or clearance , as if on a pleasure trip , with the builders and members of their families , and with other invited guests . Earl Russell , in 1864 , referring to this transaction , quotes a passage from Fullam s cruise of the Alabama , to the effect that the hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities had orders to board and detain the vessel that morning , and adds that such was the fact , and that there certainly seemed to have been treachery on the part of some one furnishing the information . But let us complete our sketch of the course of the priva * There seems to be no doubt that this was a veritable and alarming malady . * Thus far we have drawn from the Executive documents for 1862-68 , Vol. 1 . It is hardly necessary to refer to the pages , which are between the 138th and // teer . Towed down the iMlersey by a steam tug , she lay for a while in Beaumaris or in Maelfra Bay , until the tug could return and bring out a portion of the crew . The American consul watched the movements , and on the 30th of July informed the chief officer of the customs at Liverpool , that the Hercules was then at a landing stage , Iaking on board men , forty or fifty in number , beams evidently for gun-carriages , and other things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days before . He says , also , that the master of the tug stated that the gunboat , which was cruising off port Lynas , had six guns below and was taking powder from another vessel . The surveyor of the port on the same day writes to the collector that he visited the tug , and , although he found no guns or ammunition on board of her , saw there a considerable number of persons , male and female , some of whom admitted to him that they were a portion of the crew , and were going to join the gunboat . He found , however , nothing on the tug which could call for the collector 's interference . The captain of the tug again made affidavit that on this second voyage of his he took with him from thirty to forty men , who , according to his belief ; were to be employed on board as a part of the crew . We know from subsequent testimony of one who was concerned in the affair , that the men signed articles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts relating to this " fatal and perfidious bark , " down to the time when she was ready to leave the nest where she had been cherished and guarded , until she was fledged and fitted to fly abroad . It was supposed that she might go into Quecustown harbor . But no message was sent to seize her there before July 31st , on which same day the collector of Liverpool received the empty order to lay hands upon her , as if it was really thought she would run back into the jaws of the lion . Her further progress has no especial bearing on our subject . She made for the Azores , and at Terceira " was shortly joined by a barque , the Agrip * Clarence Yonge , paymaster on the Alabama , who chaaged sides , and gave Mr. Adams a detailed account of the contract for making the vessel , its escape , and cruise .

Another vessel short*y arrived from Liverpool , the steamer Bahama-conveying the Confederate officer Captain Semmes , with Bullock and fifty additional men , and stores for the privateer . The Portuguese authorities then ordered all three vessels ofl but they merely went to a secluded part of the coast , and completed the transhipment of the stores . The Bahama cleared from Liverpool on the 12th of August , having on beard nineteen cases , containing guns , guncarriages , shot , rammers , etc. , shipped by a firm of engineers and ironfounders . These cases were professedly shipped for Kassan . After the transfer of the cargo had been concluded , Semmes took command , ran up the Confederate flags to the masthead , and christened the new steamer the Alabama . ' ile read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then made a speech , in which he explained the kind of warfare he proposed to wage , and called for volunteers . One hu*dred and ten of those on board consented , and forty refused , returning in the Bahama to Liverpool . " Of those who remained , a considerable part belonged to the English naval reserve , and were all trained gunners. * Of the reception of the Alabama in the British Islands , and of her successful career of plunder and destruction , we do not intend to speak . The number and value of her prizes may be fonud , as given by the Secretary of State , in the diplomatic correspondence for 1866-1867 . ( Executive Documents 1 . 180-192 . ) It is plain on the face of these transactions that our government was not unreasonable in making complaint and demanding redress . Nor was it strange , when every steamer was bringing news of the open sympathy of the most influential * From an extract from a pamphlet published in London entitled " the Alabama , " given in a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New York , 1868. // class of society in England , that the same feeling was imputed to the govern in ent , and that to the connivance of the government was imputed the escape of the Alabama , as well as many other violations of neutrality . The aristocracy seemed to us to resemble " the children ofEdom in the day of Jerusalem , who said raze it , raze it to the foundation thereof . " The time when the " 290 " was getting ready for sea was that in which new reached England of the ill success of General McClellan betore Richmond . The friends of the Confederate cause were encouraged . In the House of Commons , not less than four-fifths of whom Mr. Adams thought , some months afterward , to be no well-wishers to anything American , there were motions looking towards recognition and intervention by " peaceable means or otherwise . " He was assured that the apprehension of distress and of agitation among the laboring classes , growing out of the failure of the cotton supply , might " lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government of the United States , they being in no condition to withstand any great severity of pressure of this description . " In a word , the strong sympathy at this time for the Confederates , the ill success of our armies , the great desire for industrial reasons to have the war come to a speedy end , are sufficient to account for a failure of the British Government to do its duties of neutrality , if any such failure can be made out on probable evidence to have existed . The delay and reluctance to detain the vessel are thus readily explained , and an intention not to do right runs prima facie through all the proceedings . But was there a failure of that government to do its duties of neutrality ? Here two questions meet us . Could the vessel have been stopped according to the provisions of the enlistment act , and was there sufficient ground for the government to intervene according to the law of nations . To us it is of minor im*portance what the enlistment act requires or forbids ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done . Suppose that there had been no enlistment act ,  --  and the present act bearing that name was not passed until near the end of the reign of George JII. ,  --  and that there were no process // known to English law by which certain infractions of the rights of neutrals could he reached , would that defect of the law shut neutrals off from complaint and claim of reparation ? Certainly not . The object of the enlistment act , and of our earlier neutrality acts , was to defend the law of nations by the law of the State , to protect other States from being wronged by private persons enjoying the protection of the government , and to prevent collisions of States with one another , which would be sure to arise , unless civil law and the courts were constituted the guardians of that law between States , which must otherwise rely on armed force alone for its conservation . When a nation receives injuries from subjects of another , it needs not to stop and ask whether those subjects are violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committing a breach of international law that is ground enough for reclamation and demand of redress . Thus the principle is logically necessary that no nation can be excused for any international injury committed within its jurisdiction by the plea that its municipal law is defective . " Tbat is your own affair , " would be the just reply to such a plea ; " it is your duty to have efficient laws , but whether they are efficient or inefficient , or if you have no law at all , it is all one to us who are injured . We are wronged , and under the law of all Christendom which you and we profess to obey , we demand some kind of reparation . " This view of duty has governed the United States . Before the law of 1794 had been passed , and in the very infancy of the government , President Washington declared in a proclamation that he had given instructions to those officers to whom it belonged , to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons who should , within the cognizance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of nations with respect to the powers at war or any of them . Shortly after , on the representation of the British Minister at Washington , that the Little Sarah was fitting out as a French privateer , she was seized , and being found to contain a suspicious armament , was prevented from sailing . A number of prizes were restored to their owners on proof that the capturing vessels had been fitted out in the United States . The governors of the States were called // upon to arrest vessels about to depart . These are but a specimen of what was done in a country without precedents to be followed , and guided by views of international obligation . The neutrality acts of 1795 and of 1818 grew out of this feeling ; and , when in 1823 the repeal of the foreign enlistment act was moved by Lord Aithorpe in the House of Commons , Mr. Canning could say , " if I wished for a guide in the system of neutrality I should take that laid down by America in the days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there in this anything supererogatory on the part of our government . It is believed that international law has a right to demand for every independent State such protection . If we can not say that whatever a State could not do without placing itself in a hostile attitude it could not allow a private person within its jurisdiction to do , we may say thus much : that no act can be permitted or overlooked , by which a private person procures for a belligerent either men or vessels intended for the service of war . In the present imperfect state of the law of nations , a neutral may perhaps shut its eyes to the conveyance of contraband articles as a matter of trade , but even such connivance is a refusal to prevent unneutral acts and an indirect administering of fuel to the flames of war . Beyond this , to act as an agent of a belligerent , to make a ship of war or transport , to enlist men to serve in his army or navy , this is so palpable an identification of neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of neutral States to prevent it and to punish it , as truly as it is their duty to punish plots concocted within their borders to assassinate a foreign sovereign . And this is a duty prior to any law passed to that effect , a duty which demands that laws be made to enforce its fulfillment . An extract or two will show that this doctrine , drawn from the nature of neutrality itself ; has been current among the modern writers on the law of nations . Kliiber uses such language as this : " A neutral State is neither judge nor party . It is obligated , not only to allow itself and its subjects to commit // no act , the aim of which is to favor or support one of the belligerents in their undertakings , but also to endure a violation of its neutrality from no belligerent power . A violation of complete neutrality on the neutral State 's part would accordingly be not only every sort of assistance in war or allowance of the same to its subjects-as , for instance , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also every voluntary concession to one of the belligerents to make immediate use of its lands and seas for purposes of hostility . " Dr. Wheaton , in referring to the right asserted by the Minister of France of arming and equipping vessels of war and of enlisting men within the territory of the United States , being a neutral nation , thus speaks : " examining this question under the law of nations , and the general usage of mankind , the American Government produced proofs , from the most enlightened and approved writers on the sul ) ject , that a neutral nation must in respect to war , observe an exact impartiality towards the belligerent parties ; that favors to the one , to the prejudice of the other , would import a fraudulent neutrality of which no nation would be the dupe ; that no succor ought to be given to either , unless stipulated by treaty , in men , arms , or anything else directly serving the war ; that the right of raising troops being one of the rights of sovereignty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign power can levy men within the territory without its consent ; that , finally , the treaty of 1778 , making it unlawful for the enemies of France to arm in the United States , could not be construed affirmatively into a permission to the French to arm in those ports , the treaty being express as to th' prohibition , but silent as to the permission. ** We only add a citation from Dr. Phillimore 's work bearing on the responsibility of the nation for acts done within its territory . " The maxim adverted to in a former volume of this work , is sound , viz. : that a State is prima fade responsible for whatever is done within its jurisdiction , for it must be presumed to be capable of preventing or punishing offenses , committed within its boundaries . A body politic is therefore responsible for the acts of individuals , which are acts of actual meditated hostility towards a nation , with which the government // of these subjects professes to maintain relations of friendship or neutrality . culpa caret qui scit sed prohibere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; but such an avowal , actual or constructive , on the part of the unintentionally injuring , State justifies the injured State in exercising , if it can , that jurisdiction by foreign force which ought to be , but can not be exercised by domestic law. *** We are aware that the views of the duties of neutrals are somewhat modified in modern times , that , for instance , of old to allow a belligerent to enlist troops within the neutral 's territory , if the same privilege was granted to both adversaries , was not held to be a participation in the war ; while now complete separation from all aid to either of the hostile parties is considered obligatory . Perhaps , owing to this change in the views of neutral duty , as consisting not in impartiality , but in standing entirely aside , nations differ somewhat in their feelings ; those which have generally been neutral may have a nicer sense of what is right than those which have waged the great historic wars of modern times ; but the tendency seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency towards righteousness and peace* Moreover , the neutrals have gained vastly by modern law in the security of their Tuaritime commerce ; why should not with these privileges the definiteness of the line of their duties increase also ? The English enlistment act , although less stringent than our neutrality laws , was intended to protect the law of nations and generally serves that parpose . Let us now see whether there was good ground under that act , and according to the spirit of international law , in detaining and trying " iNo. 290 , " and also whether the English Government seems to have done its duty . First , the Oreto had left the port of Liverpool , not six months before this gunboat went to sea , and appeared on the ocean as a Confederate privateer . There were men who could be shown to be in all probability agents of the same parties , and intercepted letters proved an intention to procure vessels from England in order to prey on our conimerce. // Secondly , the Alabama , as we will call it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a foreign governmentnot by themselves as a commercial adventure , which the act did not forbid  --  and they were indisposed to answer any ques tions respecting the destination of the vessel after she should leave the port of Liverpool . They did not attempt to disguise what was most apparent , that she was intended for a ship of war . Was not the probability greatly heightened by these admissions , that this was the beginning of a hostile expedition ? Why conceal the fact that a ship of war was built for a government at peace with mankind , and why not evemi swear to it , if such were in reality the fact ? Thirdly , the evidence submitted to Mr. Adams 's counsel led him to advise an application to the authorities at Liverpool that the vessel should be seized . The position was almost conclusive to his mind that she was being fitted out as a privateer for the use of the Confederate Government . And again , in an opinion given seven days afterward on new evidence , he thinks that a stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty be made out . It is little better than a dead letter , he says , if this vessel can escape . He thinks that iii such a case the Federal Government would have serious grounds for remonstrance . Fourthly , there was direct evidence given by at least one person that the Alabama was going out as a Confederate privateer . William Passmore , who is mentioned by M* . Sumner in his speech , and whose name appears among those whose affidavits were submitted by our minister to Mr. Collier , swore that he was engagod to go with the vessel on her cruise , and was ( listinetly told by thecaptain that the ship was to fight for the Confederate States of America . The elder Laird , the member of Parliament , in a speech delivered at Liverpool in October , 1863 , refers to this testimony in the following words : " Does any shipowner present believe , or any man connected with shipping , that the captain of a vessel , supposed to be going upon an extraordinary voyage , would go and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spy of a certain gentleman in London ? Would the captain of a // ship on such an expedition go and tell a common sailor , at the sailor 's home , all the ins and outs of his intentions regarding the ship ? " And then he quotes the solicitor general as saying , in a speech delivered some months before , that " of the six de1 ositions transmitted on the 22d of July , only one was good for anything at all , viz. : the evidence of a person named Passmore , which was sufficient to prove the material facts . Two more were sent , corroborating Passmore , on the 24th , and were received by Earl Russell on the 26th . " To which Laird adds , " Passmore was the man who made the affidavit that he was told by the captain where the ship was to go . I do n't believe him , and he must have got up the evidence for the occasion . " The solicitor evidently regards the testimony of this man and of two others as important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood , on the ground that a captain bound on such a business would not have been such a fool as to admit him into his secrets . Very well , but there the testimony was , and , until it could be shown to be t*lse on the trial of the vessel after seizure , it was good ground for the action of the government . But the government at length admitted that there was good ground for detaining the vessel by sending orders to that effect . What shall be said of the delay before sn*h action was taken , but that the government was responsible for its consequences ! No reason has been given which justifies such delay . The evidence was in a nut shell . The ship was known to be almost ready to sail . If the Queen 's advocate was too ill to give advice , new counsel could be employed . The Board of Customs resolyed so to do on the 25th of July . Could not an opinion have been reached in a few hours ? It looks to persons at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctance to detain the ship in the face of a strong public sentiment , or regardlessness of the interests of a friendly state , if not willingness that its commerce should sufler , had seized upon those whose business it was to act with promptitude and vigor . But how far does the fact that no armament was taken on board in English territory affect the question ? Lord Palmerston said in Parliament , that he had great doubts whether , if // the Alabama had been seized , there would not have been a liability for considerable damages on account of the seizure . " It is generally known that she sailed from this country unarmed , and not properly fitted out for war , and that she received her armament , equipment , and crew in a foreign port . Therefore whatever suspicions we may have had  --  and they were well founded , as it afterwards turned out-as to the intended destination of the vessel , her condition at that time would not have justified a seizure . " To this it might be replied , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armament on board , but on one or more persons having been enlisted with the understanding that she was to be a Confederate privateer . Moreover , such an evasion of the law is manifestly possible in every similar case . Ought the aggrieved nation to forbear complaining and demanding redress , because the law was a dead letter , and the government could be so easily cajoled ? Suppose the captain of the vessel had published in th' newspapers that the gunboat belonged to the Confederate States , that it was to go out of English waters unarmed , and to take gnus and ammunition on board in a foreign port , or , if worse came to worse , on the sea ; suppose he had invited the Board of Customs to take a pleasure excursion to Beaumaris Bay ,  --  her condition under such circumstances would have been precisely that which it was , when , as Lord Palinerston said , it would not have justified a seizure . If this be so , the neutral has no redress under the laws of Great Britain for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three vessels in some place like the Azores , where there is no dangei* from the public authorities , and you may do what you will . We forbear to add that when the bird had flown , it was the duty of the government , under circumstances which confirmed the more than suspicions of its destination , to send out a swift steamer in pursuit . This was talked of , but never , if we are well informed , was it carried out . In a letter to Earl Russell of October 23d , 1863 , Mr. Adams uses this language : " That this vessel was built with the intent to make war against the United States by British subjects in a British port , and that she was prepared there to be armed and // eqnipped with a specific armament adapted to her construction for the very purpose she is now pursuing , does not appear to the United States to admit of dispute . Furthermore , it is sufficiently established that when this vessel was ready , and her armament and equipment were equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her British holders , and the armament and equipment were at the same time clandestinely sent , through the contrivance of the same or other British subjects who prepared them , to a common point outside of the British waters , and there the armament and equipment of this vessel as a warship were completed . " " From a review of these circumstances , the United States understand that the building , armament , equipment , andexpedition of this vessel carried with it one single criminal intent , running equally through all the portions of this preparation , fully complete and executed when the gunboat , No. 299 , took the name of the Alabama ; and that this intent brought the whole transaction , in all its several parts here recited , within the lawful jurisdiction of Great Britain , where the main portions of the crime were planned and executed . " lie then goes on to say that the United States gave due notice of this criminal enterprise to the British government , and that if they had acted with the required energy , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " can not consider the justice of their claim for reparation liable to be affected by any circumstances connected with the mere forms of proceedings , on the part of Great Britain , which are exclusively within her own control . " lie adds , " that he is instructed to say that his government musf continue to insist that Great Britain has made itself responsible for the damages which the peaceful , law-abiding citizens of the United States sustain by the depredations of the vessel called the Alabama . " These are words which have not yet lost their power . And in reading them , as well as many other papers from the same hand , written about the same time , one can not help entertaining high respect for the minister , who never lost his patience nor his temper , who maintained the dignity of his country with a noble calmness , and , when he was forced to feel indignation , confined it within those bounds which were prescribed // by the great cause which he represented , and by the trying circumstances in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus govern themselves ! We have finished our work , and have no intention to discuss the question , What ought now to be done ? It is a pity that the recognition of the belligerency of the Confederates was ever mixed up with that of the Alabama claims . But when the policy of the government was changed , and a treaty submitting this simple question to arbitration was made , it is a greater pity that it was rejected by an almost unanimous Senate . For what is to come next ? Shall we go to war ? On what pretext , when the adverse party is willing to have the differences settled amicably  --  and at what cost ? Shall Mr. Sumner 's position be accepted , and England be called upon to pay damages for every possible result of the first step which she took at the beginning of the war-we ought rather , if we take this position , to say , before the war ? But neither will she nor ought she to think of this ; and we may be sure that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all impartial countries . Shall we return on our steps and make a new treaty on the basis of the one just rejected ? But that will involve a loss of national character . We shall seem to have acted like children . Shall we let the matter drag along , to be settled some ten years hence ? But we may be sure that better terms will never be obtained than we might have now , unless , indeed , the mean policy be in contemplation of waiting for some time of public distress in Great Britain , and screwing our claims , just or unjust , out of her n ' 3cessi4es . We make no reply to these questions of our own asking . Being mopes consilii ourselves , we offer no counsel to the country , and are only sorry that those who are responsible for counsel did not look before they leaped . And now , in closing our remarks , we wish to express our regret that what we have said is in direct opposition to the views of a man whom we esteem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a peace-loving man , he is one of the best informed men we have ever had in the United States , he has rendered many and varied services to the country , he has endured , in maintaining a righteous cause , what public men // rarely endure . That he desires a protracted quarrel between our country and Great'd3ritain , we can not for a moment believe . His suggestions , false as they appear to us , do him credit , for it seems to his fervid soul that Great Britain in our contest had a direct complicity with slavery . We can not suspect him of political management , for he is a scholar and an orator rather than a manager . We shall not cease to hold him in honor , although we think that he has chosen , on the subject of the Alabama claims , an untenable and an unwise position . Though we disclaim the intention of giving counsel in regard to the negotiations with which Mr. Motley is entrusted , we may be allowed to say that the present moment seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two countries to settle some points touching neutral rights for the future . To do this is for the highest interests of both nations ; it would be honorable for both , and humiliating to neither ! The English may be assured that , whatever becomes of the Alahama claims , the memory among us of what they felt and allowed in the late rebellion will not soon sleep , if things remain as they are ; and that the next war , in which they become involved , will see more than one Alabama issuing from our ports to rob and burn their shipping . The United States on their part need and demand some assurance that the present Joose practice in respect to neutrality will not be persisted in hereafter . Nor is it well for us-either for our character or prosperity  --  to chew the cud of wrath and brood over supposed wrongs . It is far more important to agree on general rules for the future than to determine how the claims for damages not exceeding , at the utmost , a few millions of pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of lasting peace , and in the belief that the present system of rules in regard to contraband is wholly wrong . War now , to rto small an extent , is carried on by neutrals and for neutrals : they are the capitalists in the workshop of death . Let the countries agree by treaty that hereafter , when either is a belligerent , no ships of use for the purposes of war shall be built in and sail from the ports of the // other , being a neutral , without heavy bonds given by the parties interested restraining such vessels to an innocent employment . Let blockade running and the export of contraband articles be placed under similar restrietions . Let a trade more bloody than the slave trade be stopped , as far as law and police can stop it . When it is once expressed in honest treaties that such trade is to be frowned upon , the future of the world will be more hopeful .                   @ @
