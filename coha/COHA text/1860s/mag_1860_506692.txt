txt THE FIRST OVERLAND TRIP TO CALIFORNIA . I T usually happens that when a useful inventi on is introduced by any person to the world , he is at once pronounced the inventor ; though it afterward turns out that the invention itself was of long standing , and entirely due to another , and to the former belongs only the secondary merit of application . So , peculiar circumstances may give to an island an importance that attracts attention to it for the first time , and the person then announcing its existence is proclaimed the discoverer ; yet later investigation proves that other explorers long before had visited it . Thus , the recent discovery of gold in California gave it such prominence that an overland route to it was soon known to the whole country , and Fr*mont , who made it , had the credit of being the first man who ever crossed the continent to San Francisco . History accepts the common verdict and records the fact for all coming time ; yet history , in this case , is wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years ago , after many and strange adventures and innumerable perils and hair-breadth escapes , finally reached the Pacific slopes , where so // their wonderful story was disbelieved , and they themselves thro*vn into prison as spies of the King of Spain . Sylvester Pattie , a Virginian by birth , moved to Kentucky when he was a boy , and after he became a man emigrated , with his wife , to the Missouri River . Here a pleasant family grew up around him , and the sturdy frontiersman thought himself fixed for life . But the death of his wife , to whom he was devotedly attached , changed the whole current of his existence . When the first burst of grief had passed away , a settled melancholy took its place , that time , instead of lessening , only deepened . Moody and dejected , he neglected his business and moved about like one in a dream . His friends , after suffering much anxiety on his account , finally persuaded him to undertake a hunting and trapping expedition to the head waters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , and they thought the adventurous and hazardous life he would be compelled to lead would divert his mind from its one engrossing thought . His son James , who was at school , heard of his project and resolved to go with him . Vigorous , strong , independent , and fearless , with a heart full of the tenderest affections , brave and chivalric as a knight of old , his father could have no better companion in the perilous expedition before him . The party , consisting of only five crossed the Missouri on the 20th of June , 1824 , and steadily ascended its banks into the heart of the wilderness . Reaching the last military post , Pattie was here forbidden by the commander from trading with the Indians . Disappointed in one of the chief objects of his expedition , he abandoned it altogether , and hearing that General Pratt was on the head wtiters of the Platte preparing to start for Santa F6 with a trading party , he resolved to join him . So turning off to the left , he ascended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pratt 's camp . The latter was glad to see him , and immediately appointed him commander of the entire party , consisting of a hundred and sixteen men . This formidable little army set out on the 6th of August , still ascending the river . A guard was placed in advance , and one at some distance on each side , to prevent surprise from Indians . If the main body was in sight , the approach of Indians was to be signaled by lifting the hat ; if not in sight , by a single pistol-shot . This was the order of march day after day , while the camp at night was guarded with military strictness . Cut loose from all outward help , depending solely on their own skill , watchfulness , and bravery for self-preservation , they boldly entered the vast territories of the various tribes of Indians , and pushed on toward the dividing ridge that separated the head waters of the Missouri from those of the Rio del Norte , which flowed south , and on the banks of which stood the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace with a friendly tribe of Indians , to-morrow charging with resistless fury a hostile one that attempted to oppose their progress ; guarding against all surprises , and superior to any panic , the little band made its way over all difficulties toward the distant goal of its efforts . Still the march was not a monotonous one , but experienced all the vicissitudes and was attended with the endless variety of a life in the wilderness . The picturesque encampments of the various tribes of Indians ; the vast herds of buffaloes that thundered over the prairies before them or charged with reckless fury on the packmules , scattering them in every direction over the plain ; flocks of antelope , and deer , and elk , and the almost hourly encounter , some days , with the grizzly bear ; the gloomy bivouac in the pouring rain , and the midnight assault on a hostile camp , left no time for listless thought or weary repining . One day they came upon a vast plain on which the grass was so short and stiff that it pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were obliged to stop and kill buffaloes , and make moccasins out of their green hides to protect them . At length they came in sight of the Taos Mountains , covered with snow , and five days after encamped at their base . Leaving the warm plain below them , the band ascended to the cold temperature of the higher regions ; and , after three days ' severe toil , arrived at a little town in the plain on the other side , occupied by half-wild Spaniards , clad in strange , fantastic costumes . On the 5th of November they reached Santa F* , and imme*liately asked permission of the Governor to trap on the Gila , a branch of the Colorado . He took the application under consideration , and the party retired to their quarters . At ten o'clock that night an express came in from Pacus River , where the nobles had their country-seats , stating that a large body of Indians had come upon several families , robbed some and murdered others , and among the latter two Americans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had carried off as prisoners . Immediately the drum beat the alarm , and the shrill cry of the fife mingled with the loud , clear notes of the French horn calling the soldiers to arms . Consternation and terror seized the inhabitants , and men and women ran screaming about the streets , crying out that the Comanches were in the place , butchering all that came in their path . Pattie ordered his men to stand to their arms ; and although by the light of the moon , which was shining brightly , he saw that no enemy was near , he did not know but Indians might be skulking about , and he thought it best to be prepared for any emergency . When daylight dawned he saw about four hundred men in uniform preparing to mount their horses to go in pursuit of the robbers . The Governor asked Pattie if he would join the party with his force . Ever ready for a fight with the Indians , his men gladly assented , and they were soon on the march toward the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night came to the place where the murder had been committed . // Halting only to take a little refreshment , they continued on through the night , and in the morning came upon their fires still smoking . All was now excitement ; the trail was fresh , and they pressed eagerly forward till noon , when they saw the marauders , with the stolen herds in the distance , making for a gap in the mountain . Pattie immediately proposed to the Spanish officer to take his party , and , making a sweep behind an intervening hill , get possession of the gap , while the latter , the moment he heard his fire , should close up swiftly in the rear , and thus hem them in between two fires . The Spanish officer assented to this arrangement , and Pattie immediately wheeled off , and placing the hill between himself and the Indians , and striking into a sharp gallop , soon reached the opening in the mountain . Here dismounting in a hollow , the hunters tied their horses together in the rear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approach of the savages . Pattie 's direction was to aim at the Indians nearest the prisoners , lest at the first onset these would be sacrificed by their captors to prevent their escape . They waited here an hour and a half , screened by the rocks and trees , when they saw the Indians slowly advancing and urging forward the large droves of sheep and horses which they had stolen . As the trappers looked out from their cover on the wild caravan a sight met their gaze that made their breath come quick and each brawny hand clutch the firelock with a more determined grasp ; for right in front of the Indians slowly walked the five captive women , stark naked , driving the herds before them , while their savage captors lazily rode behind . It was a new and maddening sight to the bold and chivalric young Pattie . The insult and the shame set his American blood on fire , and it was with difficulty he could restrain himself from leaping like a tiger to their rescue . They were all ladies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenances as they moved wearily forward was enough to melt a heart of iron . One of them , Jovaca , the daughter of the ex-governor , was in the first blush of womanhood , and of rare and wondrous beauty . Her ravishing form was in perfect harmony with the faultless features whose expression revealed a heart all tenderness and affection . 11cr disheveled hair hung to her ankles , almost sweeping the ground , and as her tender feet , unaccustomed to such harsh treatment , pressed the cruel rocks , a slight shudder ran through her frame . Her dark eyes , swimming in tears , were bent sadly on the ground , while her delicately penciled brow was contracted from mental anguish . Silently and slowly the melancholy group moved up the narrow gorge , their 1hopes of deliverance giving way to utter despair as they saw the frowning shadows of the mountains before them . Those bold frontiersmen looked a moment on the captives , and then on each other . It needed no language to express their determination , while the fierce eye of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that steady gleaming look . The Indians kept unsus pectingly on until they arrived within forty yards of the Americans , when the rolling volley from a hundred and sixteen deadly rifles broke the stillness of the gorge and tumbled them in scores from their saddles . Some instantly leaped forward and drove their spears into the backs of three of the women . These , flinging their despairing hands above their heads , fell forward , while the blood gushed in a ruddy stream over their bodies . This was more than young Pattie could bear , and with a voice that rung like a bugle over the tumult , he cried Out , " Save the women ! " and leaped amidst the savages . An Indian was just about to drive a spear into another of the women when he sent a bullet through his brain . The Indians recoiled for a moment before this bold onset , when he hurried the remaining captives behind the screen of rocks . Hastily wrapping blankets around them and placing them out of the reach of the bullets , he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderous firing , turned back in dismay . The trappers then pressed forward with loud shouts , loading and firing as they followed . They expected every moment to hear the volleys of the Spaniards , when they would make clean work with the miscreants . But as the latter saw the savages approaching with loud yells they gave one distant random volley and fled . They had now reached the open plain ; and the Indians , seeing the Spaniards in full flight , and how much they outnumbered their pursuers , whom they still supposed to be Spaniards also , turned back . Pattie immediately ordered his men to take to the trees and be sure of their aim , saying , " Stand resolute , my boys ; although the cowardly Spaniards have deserted us when we came to help them , we are enough for these devils alone . " As the Indians drew near , each trapper fired as he covered his man , and they tumbled with frightful rapidity from their horses . The savages , however , unaccustomed to flee before an inferior number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they approached . But when they got within pistol-shot the hunters made such deadly work that they halted , and after trying for ten minutes to bear up against the murderous volleys , turned and fled . In this last determined rally Pattie lost ten men , and received a wound himself . This did not make him feel particularly affable toward the Spaniards , who came galloping bravely up after the Indians had fled , and showed their courage by hacking the wounded and dead . Pattie sternly ordered them to desist . The commander grew enraged at this , and raved and swore , and wound up his abuse by demanding that the women should be placed under his charge . Pattie asked by whose authority he made this demand , telling him to his face that he was a coward . He laughed derisively at the lame excuse that the latter could not rally his men ; and said , if cowardice made a good Christian , he was a first-rate one . As to the women , he replied that it should be left to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning her beaming , grateful eyes on young Pattie , snid she would stay with her deliverers . The other preferring to remain with her , the officer wheeled and made for Santa F* . Pattie , throwing up a breast-work of logs that had drifted down the stream that here issued from the mountain , encamped for the night . Young Pattie took off his leather hunting-shirt and made Jovaca put it on , to keep her from the chilly night-air . Next morning they started on their return , and he gave her his horse to ride , while he riiarched on foot . They traveled all day and night , and the day after approached Pacus . Oa the way they met the former Governor , the father of Jovaca , in his carriage . The old man was almost beside himself with joy when he saw his daughter . The latter threw herself on his neck , weeping , and then led him forward to her deliverer . The grateful father insisted that both Pattie and his son should take a seat in his carriage with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , wishing to leave them to the uninterrupted enjoyment of their own conversation after such a painful separation . Reaching Santa F6 in safety , they were invited to dine at the Governor 's . In the evening the father of Jovaca took young Pattie to a coffee-house , kept by his son-in-law , and after refreshments invited him up stairs , where his daughter was with her sister , both of whom received him with a warm embrace . He sat down and conversed with them by sigas and gestures for an hour . When he arose to take his leave , Jovaca immediately threw open a door and pointed to a bed , indicating that she wished him to remain all night . He declined , on the ground that he had not suitable clothes . She ran and brought him apparel of her hrother-iu-laxv , when , seeing that she felt hurt at his refusal , he consented to stay . She then produced the leather hunting-shirt he had taken off on the battle-field for her protection , and said she should keep it as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it put it on . The next morning , before the family was up , he left and joined his companions . A dinner at the Governor 's , and a fandango at night , occupied the time ; and on the following morning , having obtained the desired license to trap on the Gila , the father and son , with five others , set out for the wilderness . Eighty miles from Santa   , and in the direction they were going , was a magnificent villa belonging to Jovaca 's father . Before they reached it the ex-Governor , accompanied by his daughter , overtook them , and insisted on their becoming his guests . They consented , and remained three days , receiving all the attentions that unbounded gi-atitude and wealth could lavish on them . Refusing the magnificent presents which the old Governor urged upon them , they accepted only a horse apiece , and departed . Jovaca watched the receding form of her deliverer with swimming eyes , for he took her heart with him . The party struck off eastward for the Gila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Spaniard , and were soon buried in solitudes never before trodden by the feet of white men . Wandering up and down the banks of the Gila , exploring its tributaries in search of beaver , they remained in this unknown wilderness for nearly six months . Now surfeited with provisions , and again reduced to dog's-meat and buzzards to sustain life ; one day occupied in skinning the beavers they had trapped the night before , and the next engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand fight with hestile savages ; now crossing inhospitable mountains , and again traversing desert plains , they encountered all the perils and passed through all the vicissitudes of a life in the wilderness swarming with Indians . At length , heavily laden with furs , they turned their footsteps again toward Santa Fe . Their long absence from civilization , and the wild life they had led , were not calculated to improve their outward appearance , and a rougher looking set of men than they could not be found on the frontiers . In the wilderness they did not care for this ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in sight of the mansion of Jovaca 's father , young Pattie , at least , could not help casting a somewhat unsatisfied glance at his shabby apparel . His hair , which had seen neither shears nor comb for months , hung long and matted around his face ; his leather leggings were dirty and full of holes ; his shirt was black and ragged ; while an old straw-hat in tatters completed his costume . In this plight he presented himself before Jovaca . The loving girl shed tears at his forlorn appearance . He had left some articles of his clothing there when he started on his expedition , and these she had cleaned and repaired with her own hands , and now brought them to him . They remained here three days to recruit , and then started for Santa   . At his departure the old Governor gave young Pattie a gold chain on behalf of his daughter ; while she , when she bade him adieu , said she should always remember him in her prayers . The copper mines before alluded to were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the proprietor of them was macli annoyed by Indians . Pattie with his men happening to pass that way about this time , encountered a band of these , and gave them a severe chastisement . The neighboring tribes then made a treaty with him . But the proprietor of the mines , fearing it would be broken the moment Pattie left , engaged him and his company to remain several months for his protection . At the end of the engagement he proposed to rent the mines to Pattie at the low rate of a thousand dollars a year . The latter accepted the proposition , and abandoned a second trapping expedition on which he was preparing to start . He wished to have his son remain with him ; but the latter had got such a taste for a roving , adventurous life that he could not be prevailed on to come down to the monotony of an overseer 's duties ; and , taking a small company with him , he started again for the Gila . It was now nearly two years since be left his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a hunter for life . In the fall he again returned , to the great delight of his father , and remained at the mines for some time , hunting in the vicinity . One day , in an encounter with a grizzly bear , his gun missed fire , and he escaped death only by rolling over a precipice . As it was , the wounds he received from the bear , and the fall together , confined him to his room for several weeks . With his recovery returned the desire for the wilderness ; and , notwithstanding his father 's earnest expostulations , he again set out for his old bunting-grounds . In this expedition he came very near losing his life . In an encounter with the Indians one of his companions fell wounded . Seeing the savage who had shot him rush forward to get his scalp , Pattie killed him , and then broke cover to bear off his comrade , when an arrow struck him in the hip . He immediately pulled it out , but while stopping to load , another entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off , and , beating back the Indians , bore away his friend . He suffered severely from his wounds , especially from the rough surgery employed to extract the arrow-head from his breast . On his return in the winter he again passed sear the mansion of Jovaca 's father , and stopped to make him a visit . The old man was oveijoyed to see him , and took him to his arms in a long and fervent embrace . The wound in the young hunter 's breast was not yet healed , and it was with difficulty he could keep from wincing under the agony produced by the friendly pressure , for it started the blood till it oozed through his waistcoat . Jovaca 's welcome seemed more constrained than usual , which did not escape Pattie 's notice . She , however , beckoned him to a seat beside her , and began to question him of his adventures , are inquired tenderly why he looked so pale and haggard . He told her of his desperate fight with the Indians and his severe wounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest . She gave a sudden start , exclaiming , " You have good reason to look sick , for you are wounded to death ! " at the same time turning on him such a look of inexpressible tenderness that , unsuspicious as he had been heretofore , he could not be blind to its meaning . A long conversation ensued , the burden of which the young hunter did not disclose . The next day he left for the mines to see his father . As Jovaca bade him good-by she breathed the fervent prayer that they might meet again . She had before implored him to leave off his dangerous life and settle down quietly , and he had promised to do so after he had trapped one more year . After remaining with his father a short time , the latter wished him to take some money and go to Santa Fi to buy goods . Seeing , however , that he did not like the mission , he sent instead his Spanish superintendent with *3O , OOO , all the money he had laid by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aroused , and young Pattie set off in search of him ; but after a long and fruitless pursuit he gave it up , and brought back the sad news to his father that he must abandon all hopes of ever seeing again the earnings of his long labor . A change in the policy of the government at this time made it impossible for him to continue his arrangements with the proprietor of the mines any longer , and he resolved to resort to the wilderness again . Obtaining a license to trap on the waters of the Colorado , he joined a party of thirty and struck eastward . It was five years since he left the Missouri , and the son , then a mere stripling , was now a finely developed , mature , and firmly-knit man . In the long journey that followed the greatest privations were endured , and provisions got so low at one time that they were compelled to kill their dogs to escape starvation . After these were all eaten up they turned reluctantly to their horses . These , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last the lot fell on young Pattie . His horse was the gift of Jovaca 's father  --  a noble , spirited , yet docile animal . An affection had sprung up between the two like that which exists between the Arab and his steed . The intelligent animal would utter a low whinny of delight whenever Pattie approached him in camp ; and now , when he was led forth and looked around for his master , the latter felt that he could not be his executioner . The poor brute seemed by instinct to feel that something unusual was occurring , and as Pattie stepped forward and raised his rifle , turned on him such a pleased look of recognition that his heart failed him . It could beat as calmly amidst the tumult of battle as in sleep ; but this silent appeal unmanned him . His head grew dizzy , and the eye that never blanched even in looking on death quniled and sunk , and his rifle fell heavily to the earth . He declared he could not do the deed ; and offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he turned away so as not to witness the murder . The next moment the sharp crack of a rifle told him that the faithful companion of his long journeyings was no more . At length dissensions broke out in the party , and on the 27th of Novemher they separated . The greater portion resolved to return , while Pattie and his son , with six others , determined to proceed . The elder Pattie was chosen captain , and all , after taking a solemn oath to stand by each other till death , started down the Gila . They kept along this stream till it joined the Colorado . Here they found Indians with cloth in their possession . Pattie inquired where they got it . They replied , in California . After obtaining all the information he could from them , he withdrew to the other side of the river and camped . Soon after two hundred of the tribe swam the stream , and approached them . Pattie , seeing at once that his little band of eight would be completely overwhelmed if such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at a distance , permitting only a few to advance at a time . Fearing an attack , and knowing what the consequences would be in his exposed situation , as soon as it was dark he packed // 85 qwq taking deliberate aim , fired . The Indians rolled off the limbs and dropped to the earth . After reconnoitring carefully , and finding no other Indians about , they rowed over to where the two bodies lay . One was not quite dead . They were of the party which had stolen their horses , for they had the ropes by which the animals had been tethered around their bodies . With these the enraged hunters strung them up to the limb of a tree , and left them to swing and blacken in the sun , a warning to marauders in the future . Continuing their course-trapping as they went - they floated slowly down , day after day . The monotony of the desert scene was broken only by the hoarse cries of wild geese , as they rose with a rushing sound from the still bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other wild birds , to which the crack of the rifle was a new and strange sound . At length the furs accumulated so fast that they were compelled to stop and build another boat . On the 20th they put off again , and had not gone far when they saw some naked Indians on shore , who fled affrighted at their approach . They tried by friendly signs to stop them , for they wished to inquire about the Spanish settlements they were in search of ; but could not succeed . The panic-stricken wretches disappeared like deer in the distance . They had now been a fortnight on the river , when one day they came upon some Indian families asleep on the shore . These they approached so cautiously as to surround them before they awoke . The effect of the strange apparition that met these children of the forest as they sprung to their feet was frightful . They were perfectly paralyzed with terror , and seemed to become almost insane . Their countenances assumed a ghastly expression , while some seemed about falling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The hunters finally succeeded in allaying their fears and stopping their clamor , when they sat down and smoked the pipe of peace together . They then inquired about the Spanish settlements , by drawing the figures of a cow and sheep in the sand , making up for the want of correctness in the likeness by imitating the sounds of the two animals . The Indians understood them and pointed west . They had , however , never seen the Spaniards , hut made signs that they had heard of them from their chief , who lived down the river . The women were all naked ; many of them not being over sixteen years of age , and of exquisite forms , with long , splendid hair that hung to their heels . They seemed to have no idea of modesty , and were quite astonished when the hunters gave them hunting-shirts to cover themselves . Their surprise and terror when young Pattie shot a wild goose in the river knew no bounds ; and as they handed it round to each other , pointing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and varied expressions of countenance were striking and amusing . Keeping on , the little party at length arrived at the village where the chief dwelt . He had been apprised of their coming , and had prepared a grand feast of fatted dogs for their reception . The usual harangue followed , and the hunters staid with their new friends all night . Next morning they endeavored to obtain some knowledge of the Spanish settlements on the coast , but could gain none , except that the chief pointed west , and then imitated the sound of the surf as it rolled and broke upon the shore . Inferring from this that they were not far distant from the ocean , they again embarked and drifted downward . On New-Year 's Day they were suddenly assailed by a shower of arrows from the shore . Pushing hastily to the opposite bank , they took deliberate aim at the savages , who now leaped into view . Each hunter picked out his man , and the eight rifles , cracking almost simultaneously , brought down six Indians . The rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , and worming themselves like snakes through the tall grass , made off in terror . The bewildered party were now constantly going ashore to see if they could find tracks of horses , to indicate the proximity of settlements , but always with the same success . At length , on the 18th of January , more than five weeks from the time they set out , they came to back-water , so that the boats , instead of moving down , remained stationary . They at first attributed this to some tributary stream below , which , swollen by snows in the distant mountains , had thrown such a volume of water into the river as to set the current back . B*t while they were puzzling themselves over this strange phenomenon , and were rigging their oars to commence rowing , the current gradually began to assume its old direction , and steadily increasing in velocity , at length swept them downward at the rate of six miles an hour . These men had been brought up on the western frontier of the States , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of them , and now began to suspect vaguely that they were on tide-water . Keeping the middle of the stream , they boldly s*vept on till evening , when , coming to a low point , they landed , and hitching their canoes to the bushes on the bank , pitched their camp for the night . After supper all lay down to sleep except the elder Pattie , who chose to keep watch . The night was clear and tranquil , and all was serene and peaceful around that little band of sleepers . The deep silence of the night was broken only by the cry of wild fowl , or the sudden plash of some animal into the stream . All was strange , lonely , and desolate . Suddenly his quick ear caught a sound like the faint and far-off roar of waves . As he stood intently listening it grew louder and clearer . He concluded that one of those fierce hurricanes of the west was approaching , and , quickly arousing his companions , bade them secure their tents . They sprang to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the now loud and angry roar that came booming up the river , began hastily to secure their camp . Nearer , angrier , burst // 87 qwq dred yards wide , and the task was easily accomplished . On the opposite side they saw Indian footprints in the sand , but no other signs of life . Here they rested while young Pattie and one of the hunters ascended the highest hill in the vicinity to take a survey of the country . The view was wide and desolate , with nothing to inspire hope , or encourage the wanderers , except a single column of smoke that far to the southward arose from an Indian camp . When they reported this to their companions they hesitated at first what to do , but finally concluded , as there must be water in the neighborhood of the Indian camp , to make straight for it ; no matter how great the hazard of such a course , water they must have , or die . Having come to this resolution unanimously , they shouldered their packs and pushed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a mile of the camp . They then stopped to reconnoitre , and found it composed of some forty or fifty Indians . They then consulted respecting the course they should adopt-whether to make themselves known quietly , and attempt to conciliate the savages , or suddenly burst on them with a warshout . But Pattie found the men so wild with thirst that they would not listen to a moment 's delay  --  a bright clear spring lay glittering in the sun , and they declared they would have one drink of water if they died the minute after . They moved forward and got within thirty rods of the camp before they were observed . , At the sudden apparition of these armed strangers in their midst the Indians sprang to their feet , and with loud cries bounded into the neighboring forest . The hunters gave one shout and dashed on the camp and rushed to the water . The elder Pattie called on the men to be careful , and not to drink too much at first ; but he might as well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank till they grew sick and began to vomit . In a few minutes , however , Pattie called them together , and told them they must stand to their arms , for as soon as the Indians had hidden their women and children they would return and give battle . They had hardly posted themselves behind the bushy top of a fallen tree when the woods resounded with yells , and the next moment the Indians , painted black , burst , with their wild war cries , into view . In an instant every rifle covered its victim ; but when the Indians had come within fair shot , Pattie made signs to them to halt . They did so , and a few friendly signs were exchanged , when one of the Indians called out in Spanish to know who they were . They answered , " Americans . " The Indian then inquired if they were Christians . On their replying in the affirmative they proposed a treaty . After settling some preliminaries to avoid treachery , the hunters met eight of the Indians , and soon concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advance , when part complied , but the others walked sullenly away . They asked them also to bring forward their women . This they de dined to do , saying they had not known them long enough to trust the women in their hands . The women , however , soon drew near of their own accord , and gazed timorously on the strangers . They were entirely naked ; and though at first shy , soon grew familiar , expressing unbounded curiosity and admiration at the red shirts and white skins of the hunters . One of the company had light hair , blue eyes , and a singularly fair skin . The women gathered in an excited manner around him , examining his neck and peering under his shirt ; and finally proposed he should strip himself , that they might see if he was white all over . This he indignantly refused to do ; when they ran off and brought him some excellent dried fish to eat to coax him to comply . The hunters , seeing how anxious they were , and thinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more friendly , told him it would be better to gratify them ; and he finally took off his clothes and stood , white as marble , before them . They were immensely delighted , s*d laughed and talked together , and then came one at a time and stood beside him to let their companions compare their dusky bodies with his . This gratification of their wishes quite won them over , and they brought dried fish for the entire party . The Indians told them that their chief was absent , and would not be hack for three or four days , and asked them to stay till he returned . This they were very glad to do , for they were completely tired out . On the 25th the chief returned , and was received with loud shouts by the whole camp . He was a venerable man ; quiet , dignified , and of few words . After smoking with the strangers , he asked what they wssnted . They told him guides to direct them to the Spanish settlements , for which they would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give . They replied that they would give their blankets . He seemed very much pleased at the offer , but said he preferred their red shirts . They immediately pulled them off , and , tearing them into ribbons , distributed them around . The men and women were both highly delighted , and tied them around their legs , arms , and heads , with as much pride and pleasure as more civilized women put on necklaces of pearls . Two guides were selected , and the next morning the party bade adieu to these hospitable Indians , and struck westward toward the snow-covered mountains , which the guides indicated by signs they would reach by midnight . Not dreaming that there was no water on the way , they did not carry any with them-an oversight which they bitterly regretted before the day was over . They started off vigorously , and the guides , by the rapid rate at which they traveled , evidently meant to make a long march before night . They soon came to a high hill , up which the hunters were compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tired and thirsty , but there was no water near , and it now flashed over them that none could be had until the distant snow-covered mountain was reached ; // 89 qwq EATON 'S BARBARY EXPEDITION . ( 1 UBA , Mexico , and the Central American States lying upon and adjacent to our frontiers , have so much occupied the attention of the American people for the last few years , as to give rise to the impression that our intermeddung with the internal affairs of other states dates from the time when filibusterism commenced against these countries . We forget that soon after the formation of our Government , or nearly sixty years ago , we endeavored to help a despot , the pther side of the Atlantic , to overthrow the usurper of his throne , and came very near reinstating him in power . For this purpose we furnished a commander-in-chief to the land forces , money , and a fleet . The fact that this extraordinary movement on the part of the United States resulted . in comparatively nothing , and hence figures very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacity of those who had direct charge of it , or that the expedition itself was a failure . It was arrested by a pusillanimous Government in its triumphant progress , and a humiliating peace was made with the barbarous despot it was attempting to overthrow . After the American in charge of the expedition had traversed six hundred miles of an unknown desert , and planted the stars and stripes on the second city of the kingdom he had invaded , and was about to thunder with his cannon at the prison-doors of American captives that awaited his coming , the Administration made peace by buying up its own seamen with gold , and treading under foot its solemn compact made with an exiled sovereign who had confided in its word . Ihe disputes which we had with the Barbary Powers at the commencement of the present century belong so history . The stranding of the ill-fated Philadelphia before Tripoli , and the capture of her gallant commander , Bainbridge , with his entire crew , and the brilliant exploit of Decatur afterward in driving the conquerors into the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tripolitan forts , are well known . It is equally well known that WILLIAM EATON , of the Army , under sanction of the United States , organized an expedition in Egypt to avenge our wrongs and release these captives . Marching across the Lybian desert , he took Derne , the key of Tripoli , carrying consternation into the tyrant 's palace at the capital ; and here , on the very threshold of victory , was met by a civil commissioner , who consented to let the tyrant keep the crown he had usurped from his elder brother , and pay $6Q000 for the release of American seamen . This little piece of history made some noise at the time , but it was hushed up as quickly as possible .. Had this occurred at the present day - thanks to the American press-it woold have sunk the Administration of which it formed a part beyond plummet 's sounding . But though the expedition of Eaton is known // as a historic fact , a detailed and connected narrative of it has never been written . Yet , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the scenery amidst which it was carried out , and the characters that formed it , it stands alone among the marvelous adventures and expeditions with which the American annals tire crowded . Doniphan 's famous march from California across the country to Mexico has been compared to Xenophon 's renowned retreat , and it deserves all that has been said in praise of it . But it must be remembered that he led Amerscans : not merely men of judgment , intelligence , and resolution , but men who felt the necessity of discipline , and cheerfully yielded to it ; while Eaton led an army of wild Arabs over an untrodden desert , and through barbaric tribes that had never before seen the face of a white man. * WILLIAM EATON  --  a New England man-early entered the United States Army , in which he rose to the rauk of captain . He afterward resigned his commission , and was appointed , in 1797 , consul to Tunis . Besides attending to the ordinary duties of consul , he was authorized , in connection with the consuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Frenchman by the name of Famin-acting as United States agent-had made with the Bey of Tunis . His conduct in the negotiations that followed reveal clearly the character of the man . Impetuous in his feelings , and chafing under the delays and deceptions of diplomacy , his actions were often intemperate and daring . He was of the Jackson type , scorning all diplomacy except the simple truth , and looked upon every mode of obtaining his country 's rights beyond in a straightforward and manly one , as unworthy of an American officer . The wily Bey of Tunis and the base Famin did not know what to do with him . They saw the complicated webs they had so artfully woven , and which they deemed it would require so much skill and time to unravel , cut with the sword of the soldier . He told the amazed Bey to his face that he was betrayed , and made a fool of by his confidential adviser ; he horsewhipped Famin in the public streets , and kicked an insolent Jew down stairs . The treacherous Bey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him mad . Eaton was undoubtedly too passionate and irritable under provocation ; but his errors in this respect were not half so injurious to our credit abroad as the timidity of the Government at home . After years of vexatious delays on the part of the Bey of Tunis , and irresolute action on that of the Administration , Eaton found his labors abruptly terminated by being recalled . Tripoli in the mean time had declared war against the United States . The Bey was the younger brother of Hamet Bashaw , whom he had driven into exile , and whose throne he had usurped . Before Eaton 's recall he had succeeded in rescuing Hamet from exile , who imme diately began to organize a force with which to regain his dominions . When Eaton reached the United States he took advantage of this state of things to urge on the Administration the policy of assisting the exiled Bashaw to recover his throne , on condition that he should release the nearly three hundred American ses*sen in prison , and ever after maintain good faith with the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering to share the advantages of his recovered power with him , gave such weight to Eaton 's proposals that it was decided to aid the dethroned Bashaw with necessary supplies , some field-artillery , a thousand stand of arms , and forty thousand dollars in cash as a loan . Eaton , under the general title of Agent for the several Barbary Powers , was to have charge of the expedition . Before his departure , however , news came of great reverses to Hamet , compelling him to retire to Alexandria in Egypt . This so alarmed Mr. Gallatin that he advised the cabinet to abandon the expedition , and , instead of maintaining the rights of the country , to pay tribute to the piratical usurper for the release of the prisoners . Vacillation and delay followed ; but Eaton , though unable to obtain any specific directions from the Administration , which wished not to be compromised in case of disaster , received permission to depart , and arrived in Malta in the early part of September , 1804 . The commander of the fleet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vague and contradictory directions brought by Eaton . The latter , however , with his accustomed energy , no sooner found himself on the field than he set to work to organize the expedition against Tripoli . He reached Alexandria in the latter part of October , and immediately set out for Cairo . He had with . him two boats : in the advance one were Lieutenant O'Bannon of the Marines ; Midshipman George Mann ; his son-in-law , Eli Danielson ; Mr. Farquahar ; Selim , a janizary ; Ali , a dragoman ; and six servants , all fully armed . Captain Vinent , with about the same number , had charge of the second boat , which was mounted with two swivels , and carried a large number of muskets , pistols , and sabres . The Nile was not at that time , as it is now , a highway for travelers ; and this armed invasion of its sacred waters created the most profound astonishment , and , on one occasion , open hostility among the inhabitants . Reaching Cairo , Eaton found there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-governors . From them he received the disheartening intelligence that Hamet , in sheer despair , had joined the Mamelukes . At first this seemed to render Eaton 's contemplated expedition out of the question ; for the Mainelukes were in rebellion against the viceroy of Egypt , without whose firman Hamet could not leave the country ; and this it did not seem at all likely he would give . But Eaton was one of those few men whom unforeseen obstacles , in * The incidents of the following narrative are mostly derived from Eaton 's Journal , and from his private letters and public dispatches and correspondence . // stead of dispiriting , arouses to greater exertion and resolution . By skillful management , he succeeded in winning over the viceroy to his friendship , and obtained from him a letter of amnesty , a passport , and safe-conduct to unmet Bashaw . The next difficulty was to get the Basbaw away from the Mamelukes . Having at last succeeded in this also , Eaton obtained an interview with him near the ancient Lake Moeris . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but from the strange region in which it occurred and the object it had in view . Eaton , with two American officers in full uniform , and an escort of twenty men , came forward on a gallop , and drew up before the wild encampment of Hamet . The latter was prepared for the proposals that were presented by the former in behalf of his Government ; but when he made them known to the swarthy chieftains around him a murmur of disapprobation was heard . Those children of the desert could not understand why a Christian lender should come so far to lead their forces and help put their exiled monarch on his throne ; and looked upon the whole movement with jealousy and suspicion . This was not surprising , for the strange spectacle of barbaric Moslems and enlightened Christians striking hands together in the deserts of Egypt for the purpose of placing a Mohammedan despot on his throne , and the blending of the crescent and the stars and stripes in a common cause in that wild land , might well have staggered more civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed energy and impetuous daring , overcame all obstacles . Articles of convention were drawn up and signed by him on behalf of the United States ; the Bashaw having affixed his signature also , the alliance was completed , and measures were at once taken to organize the expedition . There were fourteen articles in this convention , of which the following were the ones of chief importance to Hamet : Article 2 . The Government ef the United States shell use their utmost exertions , so far as comports with their own honos ' and interest , their subsisting treaties , and the established law of nations , to re-establish the said Hamet Bashaw in the possession of his sovereignty of Tripoli against the pretensions of Joseph Bashaw , who obtained said sovereignty by treason , and who now holds it by usurpation , and who is engaged in actual war with the United States . " Article 3 . The United States shall , as circumstances may require , in addition to the operations they are carrying on by sea , furnish to said Hamet Bashaw , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if necessity require , debarkation of troops also to aid and give effect to the said operations of said Hamet Bashaw by land against the common enemy , " etc . Eaton , having thus committed the flag of the young republic to the fortunes of this barbarian despot , endeavored to infuse into his Mohammedan ally some of his own energy , and succeeded so well that by March an army of 500 wild warriors were assembled near Alexandria ready to start . He could have raised one of 30,000 , if he could have found subsistence for them in the inhospitable region he was to traverse ; for he had taken the bold and novel resolution to march across the Libyan desert six hundred miles , and attack by land Derne , the city next in importance to Tripoli in the province , while the fleet should co-operate by sea . He had with him but nine Americans and some twenty-five Greek Christians and cannoniers , whom he proposed to keep as a nucleus , around which the Arab host should gather , and by which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1805 , with the crescent and the stars and stripes in front , the disorderly host set out on its extraordinary march . A hundred and seven camels , with asses and horses , carrying the provision and baggage and ammunition , made up , with the vast multitude of servants and camp-followers , an imposing caravan . The first day 's march gave Eaton a foretaste of some of the difficulties he would be compelled to encounter in the attempt to carry that half-savage , wild , and lawless crowd across the Libyan desert . They had advanced but a few miles when the owners of the camels and horses mutinied , declaring they would proceed no farther unless paid in advance . Eaton applied to Hamet to restore subordination and compel the drivers to march forward ; but the latter was irresolute , and did not dare to exhibit any authority , and , as the forenoon wore away , and the drivers still refused to stir , became lowspirited and desponding . Eaton , finding that he could not prevail on him to use any force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum to beat to arms , and , placing himself at the head of his little band of Christians , bade Hamet Bashaw farewell , telling him he must recover his throne without aid , as he should return to Alexandria . This had the effect intended . The drivers , finding that the expedition was to be abandoned altogether , and the engagement with them dissolved , immediately returned to their obedience , and promised to go on if Eaton would not desert them . After exhibiting a little well-assumed hesitation he at length yielded , and the march was resumed . The next day they entered the desert : This vast and desolate tract  --  a thousand miles in length north and south , and six hundred miles wide from east to west-was then almost wholly unknown to the civilized world . Commencing in the interior at a considerable elevation , it descends in vast terraces of sand , divided by rocky ridges , to the shores of the Mediterranean . No far-off mountain skirts the horizon . Not a clump of trees relieves the dreary aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cavalry of this strange expedition was commanded by a chief named Chiek-il-Tahib . The superb animals which composed it , with the picturesque yet fierce-looking riders , contrasted strangely with the firm , compact little knot of Americans around which it circled . The ample turbans , loose flowing robes , and disorderly movements of the one , and the close-fitting uniforms and exact military movements of the other , // were a perfect illustration of the different characters of the two races that now trod the desert side by side . Indeed every step of their progress revealed , in the strongest light , the strange extraordinary extremes that had met there on the Libyan sands . The Americans , when they pitched their tents at mid-day , or bivouacked at night , did it with the same precision and quiet order that they would have displayed in a regular campaign with disciplined troops ; while the Arabs-warriors , drivers , and camp-followersprepared their miscellaneous encampment with shouts and cries , and in all the confusion of a wandering tribe of savages . With his eyes steadily fixed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great efficiency as possible to the little band about his person , on whom he knew the weight of the final struggle would come , Eaton , after the halt each day , had the drum beat for drill , and went through the evolutions prescribed by the manual , to the unbounded astonishment of the Arabs . For three days after the mutiny was suppressed the march was uninterrupted , and on the last of these they made twenty-five miles by two o'clock in the afternoon , the whole distance being over desert plains and through long sandy valleys . The tents had been pitched for the mid-day halt , and the noise and confusion of the assembling tribes and closing caravan had given way to the quiet and repose of a Moslem noon , when Eaton 's attention was called to a cloud of dust in the distance caused by a swift rider bearing directly down on the encampment . The chiefs sallied out to meet the new-coiner , who brought the exciting intelligence that Derne , the city before which they expected to meet a determined resistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his life , had been compe*led to shut himself up in the castle . In an instant the whole camp was in an uproar , and as the news flew from lip to lip a clamor arose and continued to swell till the desert shook with the wild joy . The chiefs mounted their steeds , and , amidst the discordant cries and tumultuous movements of the vast multitude , caracoled about , now charging with headlong fury , and again executing feats of daring horsemanship , to exhibit their joy at this unexpected good tidings . But before night another courier arrived , announcing , to their great chagrin , that the news was false . The unbounded joy and excitement of the army changed at once into corresponding gloom and despondency . Eaton , however , did not share in the general discouragement that followed , any more than he did in the enthusiasm that preceded it . Indeed , it is very doubtful , if the truth was known , if he was not rather displeased when he heard that the object of his expedition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daybreak , he ordered the bugle to sound . The stfrring blast echoed afar over the desert , and soon the long caravan was again in motion . After marching twentysix miles through the sand they came to a rocky ravine , at the head of which they found water standing in cavities where it had been gathered from former rains . Here they encamped . But their tents were scarcely pitched , when a fierce , cold wind came sweeping over the desert , accompanied by a driving storm of rain . The night set in dark and gloomy , and passed wearily away . It was succeeded by a still wilder day . Low black clouds came rolling up over the plain ; the wind increased to a tempest till the tents threatened to be swept away by its fury . The thunder shook the desert , the startling peals , seeming to come from below as well as above , bursting on every side , while the rain fell in floods . The day was turned into night , making this desolate region still more desolate . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire encampment ; so that in the midst of the pitiless storm they were compelled to break up and pitch their tents on higher ground . The encampment presented a sorry aspect in the blinding storm , and the day passed gloomily to all . The second night was no better than the first . The tempest lulled before morning , but the rain continued . Eaton , however , resolve to march ; and ordered the bugle to sound . But the Arabs , whose plotting heads had not been idle during this long halt , refused to stir unless they were paid . The whole forenoon was spent in expostulations and entreaties. * . But at length , by dint of lavish promises , Eat* prevai led on them to march . After going twelve miles they encamped in another deep ravine . The next day they came to a vast valley filled with ruins , in the centre of which stood an old dilapidated castle that served , in its solitary grandeur , to enhance the desolation of the barren waste . There had once been in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now its ruins lay half-buried in the sands of the desert , and not a living soul broke the monotony of the scene . Here Eaton , to his surprise , learned for the first time that Hamet , expecting to encounter some friendly tribes on the way , had engaged the caravan no farther than this point , and , moreover , had not paid them one dollar . Of course the drivers would go no further without pay . He endeavored to persuade them to advance to Bomba , where he said he should find the ships , when he could pay them liberally ; but they utterly refused to move , and said that as soon as they had eaten their dinner they should return to Egypt . He then promised to pay them himself for the distance they had already come if they would continue on for two days longer . He expected in that time to reach a friendly Arab tribe , which Hamet told him was not far in advance , and from which they could hire another caravan . To this they consented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill the contract made with them by Hamet . He took all his money and borrowed the residue from the Americans , $673 in all , and gave it to the Bashaw , telling him to pay the drivers . He did so ; but the rascalsall but forty-having got the money , made off as // soon as it was dark , leaving the army without any means of transportation whatever . Even the forty that remained behind would not go on , and the next night they also decamped . Eaton was now in a painful dilemma ; for he could move neither backward nor forward without the means of transportation ; and he asked the Bashaw what was to be done . The latter replied that he saw no other way but to stow the baggage in the deserted castle , and seek the protection of some friendly tribes . But the circumstances must be desperate indeed in which such a man as Eaton would abandon at once all hope from his own resources and courage , and look to chance or charity alone for succor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other chieftains , and from information gathered by some of the officers , he soon ascertained that the drivers were not alone in this mutinous movement-that it was a conspiracy extending throughout the army . The chiefs had heard that the news of their approach had been received at Tripoli , and that eight hundred cavalry had been sent out to assist the garrison at Derne . Alarmed at this intelligence , they resolved to proceed no farther until they received positive information of the arrival of the American ships before the latter place . As soon as Eaton had fully assured himself of this cowardly plot , and that it embraced the Bashaw as well as the subordinate chiefs , he made up his mind what to do . He knew that it would not do to repeat in the heart of the desert the ruse he had practiced on its edge . The threat to abandon the expedition , which then awakened alarm , would now be received with a laugh of incredulity . He therefore apparently retracted his decision , and fell in with the Bashaw 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once into the castle . The provisions he had from the first wisely kept under the sole charge of his little band of Christians , and subject to his direct control . These , always carefully guarded , were now still more closely watched , and as soon as the baggage was disposed of he gave directions to have them removed to the castle also . When both were safe within the walls , and before the Arabs could comprehend his purpose , Eaton took possession of the castle with his handful of Christians , and at once stopped the rations of the entire army . He knew that the chieftains had power enough to compel the drivers to keep their agreement with him ; and he therefore , as soon as he discovered the combination to force him to halt there in the desert until favorable news were received from iDerne , determined to effect by starvation what he could not carry out by force . It was a bold movement ; for although he and his handful of followers could hold the castle as long as the provisions lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arabs . But he knew , also , that present necessities would plead louder with them than the desire for future revenge ; and this sudden stoppage of provisions , together with the dead lock to which it brought the entire enterprise , would stagger the chieftains as well as their leader . He was not disappointed ; Hamet and his followers were taken entirely aback by this counterplot . They supposed that they had Eaton entirely within their power , when they dropped him thus in the midst of the desert . If he had been less resolute and fearless they probably would have resorted to threats , but they knew too well the character of the man they were dealing with to attempt any such thing . They had penetrated two hundred miles without seeing a human habitation or track of man , and to a person of ordinary perve the prospect was appalling enough . But Eaton looked at it without flinching , and the Arabs knew it . The courage and resolution exhibited in this fearless attitude , with only a handful of friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded at once to his demands and sent after the drivers . The next day fifty returned , and agreed to go on two days longer . Eaton then emerged from his castle , and taking down the American colors , which he had kept defiantly floating ahdve the time-worn strong-hold , once more set forward with his motley host . On the second day they had made but twelve miles , when they came upon the encampment of three tribes of Arabs , numbering in all some three or four thousand souls . Their white tents were scattered over an area twenty miles in diameter , sprinkled in between with herds of cattle , horses , and camels , innumerable . The enlivening spectacle extended as far as the eye could reach . It seemed , after the solitude and desolation of the desert , like suddenly coming to civilization . The strange flag , and the strange beings that bore it , created the most unbounded astonishment among these primitive tribes , none of wh*m had ever before seen the face of a white man . Eaton resolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bomba , where he supposed Captain Hull of the Argus to be waiting for his arrival on the sea-coast . In the mean time Hamet 's friends were busy among the Arabs , endeavoring to beat up recruits for the army . Their efforts were so successful that next day forty-seven tents were struck and moved over beside those of the army , and one hundred and fifty warriors swelled the ranks of the exiled monarch . The next day , instead of news arriving from Captain Hull at Bomba , a courier came from Derne , saying that five hundred cavalry were marching on that place to defend it , and would be there before the Bashaw could possibly reach it . This disheartening intelligence spread like wild-fire throughout the encampment , and created such consternation that the camel-drivers mounted their animals and disappeared in the desert . The Bashawwas completely discouraged , and began to think of abandoning the effort to recover his throne . In this dilemma Eaton called a council of war , which assembled in his marquee . As the chiefs came in one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw by their dejected countenances that he could receive no // encouragement from them , and must fall back on himself or abandon the expedition . The latter alternative he had no idea of adopting ; yet having called the council together he proceeded , through his interpreter , to ask the opinions of each chieftain . Chiek-il-Tahib , the commander of the cavalry , declared boldly that he would not stir another step till he heard from the fleet . No persuasions , expostulations , or promises could move the stubborn barbarian . Eaton , after exhausting every means in his power to make him change his purpose , at length lost all patience , and told him that he was false to his own pledged word and a coward to boot . This bitter taunt and accusation threw the chief into a tempest of passion , and , turning on his heel , he strode out of the tent , saying that the Christian would see his face no more . Mounting his horse , he galloped among his followers , and bade them follow him ; part did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being thus broken up in confusion , Eaton began to east about him to see what step he should next take . The night that followed was an anxious one both to him and to the Bashaw ; for the expedition seemed about to break np there in the heart of the desert . The morning , instead of bringing relief , only increased the perplexity ; for Chiek-il-Tahib sent secret emissaries into camp , who created an insurrection ; and by night half the army had struck their tents and started for Egypt . The Bashaw , now thoroughly alarmed , hastened to Eaton , and begged him to dispatch a messenger to Chiek-il-Tahib , and implore him to come back . Eaton sent the messenger ; but instead of instructing him to make the request asked by the Bashaw , bade him tell the chief that he , Eaton , had a rifle and a sabre , and the time might yet come when he could use them on him in chastisement of his present conduct . Instead of retorting on Eaton , the indignant chief sent his curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them . Notwithstanding this desertion , Eaton did not for a moment hesitate in his course , and next morning early ordered the march as usual . About noon a messenger came up from Chiekil-Tahib , saying , that if the army would halt early he would join it . Eaton at once ordered a halt ; and in about an hour and a half the Chief , with a chagrined look , came into camp . As he did so he remarked , in a half-deprecating , half-defiant tone , " Yon see what influence I have with my people . " " Yes , " replied Eaton ; " and I see also what a disgraceful use you make of it . " This difficulty being adjusted , the Bashaw 's old fear of his brother 's advancing forces again seized him , and he declared he would advance no further till he could hear from the fleet . Eaton 's patience , never very remarkable , was getting quite exhausted , and he fiercely told the Bashaw to leave him if he wished ; and , riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . The Bashaw was at first confounded at this prompt action ; but , instead of following , turned back to join the mutincers . Two hours later , however , he again joined Eaton , and , with true Eastern hyp6crisy , complimented him on his firmness and decision , and said that he was compelled to appear to be undecided in order to keep control of his men . After marching about twelve miles , a messenger galloped to the front , saying that all the Arabs who had joined them from the friendly tribes they had just left had decamped for Egypt . Hamet Bashaw immediately dispatched a general officer with a squad of horsemen to overtake them and persuade them to return . The night passing without their reappearance , it was determined to remain in camp till the return of the officer . About four o'clock the fugitivessome 200 in number-came riding into camp , hailed with loud shouts by their companions . The next morning , early , Eaton started forward with his band of Christians , leaving the Bashaw to follow with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , a quarrel arose between his chief of cavalry and Chick Mohammed about the distribution of some money the former had received . High words followed , threats were interchanged , and the dispute finally ended in the withdrawal of Mohammed with a part of the Arabs . Hamet entreated and implored him in vain not to leave him ; and at last , finding all his efforts useless , he left an officer to expostulate with him , and followed on after Eaton . The camp was pitched that evening at five o'clock , and immediately afterward Hamet , who was distressed beyond measure at the desertion of Mohammed , took horse and went back himself after him . The next morning , finding that he had not returned , Eaton resolved not to move forward , but*wait in camp for him . The expedition was now approaching the sea , the refreshing breeze from which revived the Americans after the stifling air of the desert . The morning was deliciously cool and grateful ; but at noon angry clouds began to roll up the sky , their dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll of thunder shook the heavens . This gathering of the elements was followed by a hurrican* of wind and rain , before which the tents shook like reeds in the blast . In a short time the tempest passed by ; and as Eaton sat in his n*rquee , listening to the sullen retiring uproar , he saw Chiek-ilTahib and five other chieftains slowly npproaching him . He knew at once by the expression of their countenances that it was not to be an ordinary visit of compliment and consultation . He , however , received them courteously , and was not long kept in suspense respecting their object ; for the chief of cavalry abruptly and haughtily demanded an increase of rations . Eaton refused , and a sharp altercation ensued . The chief , exasperated , began to use threats , to which Eaton replied only with scorn . Irritated beyond control by the imperious bearing of this fearless American , Chick at last burst forth : " Remember you are in the desert , and in a country not your own . I am a greater man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be bearded thus by a barbarian in his own tent was too much for the hot blood of Eaton . Springing to his feet , and point .. ing to the entrance , he exclaimed , " Leave me ! But mark , if I find a mutiny in my camp while the Bashaw is absent , I will put you to instant death . " The chief turned away with a fierce gesture , and , leaping into his saddle , disappeared in the desert . During the afternoon , however , he came back again quite humbled , and asked for a reconciliation , with true Eastern sycophancy . The rain kind storm had been followed by a cold , raw * which gave a chilling aspect to the desolate *cenery , and shed additional gloom over the encampment . The night passed withoat any tidings from the Bashaw , and Eaton was in doubt whether to proceed or remain longer where he was , when the missing monarch made his appearance accompanied by Mohammed . The Bashaw had shown more energy in this volunteer undertaking of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been two nights and a day in the saddle , riding all one night in a pouring rain , in the mean time eating nothing except some dates and milk , which the friendly Arabs on the route had given him . That evening a grand council of all the chiefs was called at Eaton 's tent to decide on some specific course of action . Eaton knew that these constant quarrels , mutinies , and desertions must cease , om . the whole expedition be broken np . After they had all assembled he made them a speech , in which he explained their present position and his future expectations and prospects . He gained nothing by the council ; for although , while the chiefs were in his presence , they assented to every thing he said , and promised every thing he required , they had not the slightest intention of being influenced by either in their future conduct . Peace , however , was restored for the present ; and the next morning at daybreak the bugle roused the sleepers , and by six o'clock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the sandy plain . The army numbered now nearly seven hundred warriors . The camp-followers and drivers swelled the entire force to twelve hundred . These , with the long train of animals , made an imposing display as it moved across the desert , and presen*d as novel and extraordinary an array as ever pressed after the flag of the Republic . They had gone but ten miles when they pitched their camp for breakfast . This was meagre enough , for provisions were now getting low . The chiefs , becoming alarmed at this state of things , insisted on sending ofl'a caravan into the desert after dates , and declared that they would go no farther without provisions . Eaton expostolated with them , telling them that the best course was to push on to Bomba , where they would find provisions in abundance . They refused to run any such risk ; and he finally threatened , if they persisted in their refusal to march , to take the Christians and go to Bomba with them alone . The chiefs , to compromise matters , begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get something to eat . To this request Eaton finally gave a reluctant consent , saying , as he did so , that if , after that , they delayed him any more , he would embark at Bomba on board of his ships , taking the Bashaw with him , and leave them to their fate . In the mean time the caravan that was to go in pursuit of provisions started ofl promising to join the army again at Bomba . The next three days the march was uninterrupted and nothing eventful occurred , except the marriage in camp of a girl of thirteen to an old man , the ceremony being accompanied by lascivious dances , merriment , and revelry , which served to keep the chiefs in good spirits for the remainder of the day . On the 6th of April Eaton pitched his camp within four miles of the sea-shore , and ninety miles from Boxuba . The march of the last two days had been a severe one , for it had led directly across a barren desert , and for the last forty-two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When at last they reached a well , so intense was their thirst that they crowded around it like madmen , jostling each other fiercely aside in their eagerness to obtain a single swallow . The next two days the army kept along the sea-shore , Eaton , with the American officers , moving in advance with their glasses to reconnoitre . On the 8th , after having rode far ahead , he stopped to await the approach of the army . Finding it did not arrive , he rode back , and to his astonishment found the camp pitched . On inquiring the reason of this , he was told that the troops were exhausted for want of food , and could march n* farther without something to eat . On closer investigation , however , he ascertained the real reason to be that they wanted to send to Bomba to see if the ships had arrived there . Eaton replied that the only food that remained was six days ' rations of rice ; hence their only safety lay in pushing on as rapidly as possible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not move . Eaton curtly replied they might starve then , as they liked that better , and stopped their rations altogether . This summary action , coining as it did in the midst of their distresses , threw the army into a state of excitement bordering on open rebellion . The chiefs gathered in angry groups , and pointed threateningly toward Eaton 's tent , over which the stars and stripes floated defiantly ; while the hungry Arabs only waited the signal to rise on the Americans , murder them , and , seizing the provisions , seek safety in the desert . The day passed tumultuously ; the Bashaw and his chiefs were in a state of the highest excitement , while Eaton sat in his tent , if not cool and indifferent , at least dogged and savage . An explosion seemed inevitable . What destructive form or direction it would take Eaton and the American officers could not tell , and seemed not to care . Their patience had become completely exhausted at the treachery , falsehood , and childish peevishness of their allies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the // imperturbable coolness and quiet scorn of this little band of officers , the chiefs dared not propose force and seize the provisions . So at three o'clock in the afternoon they compelled the Bashaw to pack , mount , and depart with them , leaving Eaton to his fate . They thought this movement would wring some concession or proposition from him . But he looked quietly on , without saying a word . He had played that game on the Bashaw too successfully to become a victim of it himself . Maddened at this continued cool contempt , the chiefs finally made a movement as if to seize the provisions . This broke the spell of Eaton 's apparent indifference . His countenance changed instantly . His hitherto quiet , scornful eye shot forth fire , as , springing to his feet , he shouted out the order to beat to arms . The rapid roll of the drum brought his little disciplined band of twenty instantly to his side . Hastily forming them in a line in front of the baggage tents , he sternly awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , with their followers , boldly approached to within a short distance and halted . The swarthy , wild-clad masses seemed able , by mere force of numbers , to crush Eaton and his few companions to the earth ; but awed by the moral power of that handful of fearless , self-collected men they paused and hesitated to advance further . For half an hour Eaton and his group of officers on one side , and that host of untamed barbarians on the other , stood looking at each other without saying a word . It was a thrilling spectacle to see the Moslem and Christian thus standing breast to breast , and witness the silent , motionless struggle between civilization , backed by a handful of men , and barbarism , with a host to give it countenance . The Bashaw at last , by dint of great effort , persuaded the Arabs to abandon their purpose , and they withdrew and dismounted . The excitement , however , was far from being over , and they stood beside their horses conversing in angry tones , and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was restored to them . Eaton , however , thinking the trouble was all over , ordered his men to go through the manual exercise , as it had been his custom to do every day since they entered the desert . This daily drill had become a familiar sight to the Arabs , and he did not dream its repetition at that moment would create any alarm . But in their excited state the Arabs could not see any military movement on the part of the Christians except in a hostile light , and immediately cried out in affright , " The Christians are going to fire ou* us ! " Without stopping to think on the utter improbability of such a thing , the Bashaw instantly sprang into his saddle , and putting himself at the head of two hundred horsemen , all shouting their war cry , came down in a furious charge . Eaton , astonished at the sudden movement , hut not in the least intimidated , ordered his men to stand to their arms . They did so , and stood and watched the onsweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was only a part of an ordinary review , though all saw the perilous crisis at hand . Those two hundred wild horsemen , and their not less wild steeds , charging on a run , was a spectacle that might have appalled the stoutest heart ; for they knew perfectly well that , unless that onset was arrested in five minutes , they would be ridden down and trampled* to the earth . The fiery squadrons never drew rein till within close pistol-shot , when the whole column suddenly halted , and each rider unslinging his carbine leveled it at Eaton and his comrades . In an instant the word " Fire ! " fell on the ear like a thunderclap . A moment more , and half of that brave little band of Americans would have been stretched on the sand , and the other half hewing their wild way to the grave through crowds of their foes . But no sooner did the order to fire escape the Bashaw 's lips than several of his officers suddenly cried out , " For God 's sake do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Another instant , and it would have been too late . As it was , one of the Arabs snapped a pistol at Mr. Farquhar 's breast ; but by a lucky accident it missed fire . Had it gone off , that day would have had a sad ending , for Farquhar 's fall would have been the signal of a death-struggle which would not have left an American alive , althou*hi before it ended it would have heaped the sand with the dead bodies of their untamable allies . But the sudden arrest of the fire did not end the danger . Eaton , however , taking advantage of it , advanced alone toward the Bashaw , with a gesture of caution . In an instant a column of muskets was leveled at his heart . The Bashaw , instead of interfering to save him , seemed beside himself , and acted like one distracted . Eaton shouted to the Arabs to hold ; but their wild clamor drowned his voice . He gestured to them , but in vain . The tumult grew wilder , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steed between him and the leveled muskets , and waved the mutineers peremptorily back . The uproar then began to subside , and order was fast being restored , when one of the Bashaw 's officers turned to him in an excited manner and asked if he was mad . The Bashaw in reply struck him with his sword . In an instant the tumult broke forth again , and . a general fight seemed inevitable . But in the midst of it Eaton walked up to the Bashaw , and , beseeching him to dismount , took him by the arm , led him away from the crowd , and talked to him alone . The Bashaw at once saw how rash and inconsiderate he had been , and frankly expressed his sorrow at what had occurred . He then returned , and requested the Arabs to retire to their quarters , while he accompanied Eaton to his tent . A long conversation ensued ; but the Bashaw told Eaton that nothing could be done toward effecting a reconciliation with the chiefs unless he restored the rations of rice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past hour to yield at last ; and replied very // kindly , but firmly , that he could not , unless they would agree to march at the heat of the morning reveill6 . This the chiefs finally consented to do . Peace was once more restored , and the day that threatened to end in blood passed quietly away . The next morning at the reveilki the Arab army , true to the promise of the chiefs , struck their tents , and recommenced their weary march over the desert . They came to only one well during the whole day , and in that they found two dead men . Repulsive as it was , they were compelled to drink the water or go without entirely . The next day , April 10th , they marched only ten miles , and encamped in a lovely valley , between two mountains , the first they had seen for a month . But events were drawing to a crisis , which even Eaton , with his indomitable will , felt he would he unable to meet . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutiny , the Arabs had had nothing to eat but rice and water , and only half rations at that . Starvation was now staring them in the face , and Eaton well knew what famine would make of men already half savages . They could not remain where they were , and he knew they would not continue to march forward till the last morsel was gone , uhless certain of relief at the end . But he could hear nothing of the ships , and he was utterly at loss what next to do . As a last resort he called a council of war of all the chieftains . A common suffering had made these men more considerate , and the consultation did not consist of trickery and deception on one side , and the exhibition of an iron will on the other . To go on farther without knowing that the American vessels were at Bomba with the promised provisions , the Bashaw said , was madness , and he would not consent to it . Eaton , without any recrimination or fault-finding , acknowledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would march forward two days longer ; and if no relief came in that time , he would consent to halt and wait till they heard from the ships . To this proposition the chiefs refused to listen for a moment , and the council broke up in gloom and despondency . Eaton had now exhausted all his resources , and was compelled to trust to fortune alone to help him out of his difficulties . Against treachcry , deceit , and pusillanimity he could oppose his firm will and unshaken courage ; but he could not conquer famine . There was not enough provisions on hand to carry them , even by rapid marches , to Bomba ; and he knew it was in vain to attempt to force those wild chieftains to the desperate efforts they would be compelled to make to reach it , if nothing but famine awaited their arrival there . The sun went down over the desert , and as its last beams fell on the stars and stripes that drooped from the flagstaff above Eaton 's tent , which he had borne with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought with bitterness of spirit of the utter failure which now seemed inevitable . Tossed with conflicting emotions , he sat down in his tent and pondered over his position , and revolved various plans for his future conduct . About seven o'clock an officer approached him with the military salute , and reported that a mutiny was organizing in the army . Eaton made no reply ; he expected it , and knew , ever since the council broke up , that before morning those wild warriors would be far away in the desert . As he sat perplexed and irritable , not knowing what to do , a courier suddenly dashed on a full gallop into the encampment , and , pressing straight for the American flag , drew rein in front of Eaton 's tent . His brief message was like life to the dead . " The American ships are before Bomba ! " was the inspiriting news that he brought . In an instant it traveled through the encampment , setting it in a blaze of excitement . The morose and sullen countenances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been deceived after all ; the vessels of war were awaiting them ; and not only did visions of victory usurp the place of suspicions and doubts , but the certainty of provisions in abundance , now within their reach , banished all feelings but those of confidence and joy . Mounting their steeds they spurred through the encampment , waving their sabres and shouting their exultation in loud discordant cries . An indescribable scene of wild , uncontrollable enthusiasm followed , to which all their former extravagant demonstrations were tame , and the night that foreboded such gloomy disasters rung with savage shouts to Ali and to the brave Americans . Eaton threw himself on the floor of his tent with a light heart , for his good star was once more in the ascendant . But in the morning , when the reveill6 beat to arms , he was met with the sad news that the Bashaw was sick and could not travel . He did not attempt to conceal his irritation at this unexpected obstacle to his advance . The vessels were awaiting him , and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lost , or at least concluding the expedition to be abandoned , so long had he been buried in the desert . He determined therefore to proceed at all hazards , and the march commenced . They had advanced however but five miles when the Bashaw gave out entirely , and they were compelled to encamp and wait till he should be able to proceed . That day was a long one to Eaton , and he chafed like a caged lion under the delay that might blast the hopes which had been so suddenly excited . Independent of the fear that the ships would leave the coast before he should arrive , he knew that he had not provisions sufficient to last them to Bomba , even if not an hour was lost . A halt of two days would reduce the army to starvation . Yet the Bashaw might grow worse instead of better , and possibly die on his hands . But there was no help for it , and he was compelled to sit down in idleness , a prey to the keenest anxiety . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians , and in the intervals visited the Bashaw , and thus wore away the day as he best could . Toward evening , to his great relief , the Bashaw grew better , and Eaton determined next morning to move forward . At daybreak , therefore , the bugle rung cheerily out on the desert air , and soon the army was pressing eagerly , cheerfully after the Christian banner , which now waved them on to sure relief . Eaton urged his barbarous allies vigorously all day , making twenty-five miles , and camped in the barren plain , without water or fuel . The last half ration of rice was tl*n doled out , which the hungry warriors were compelled to eat raw , and without a mouthful of water to wash it down . In the morning they started off without breakfast , the abundance in advance standing in the place of discipline to keep them marching . The want of food , however , sin began to tell on them , and they were compelled to halt and rest , when the Bashaw ordered one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Refreshed by the slender mefsel each received they again moved forward . Passing through a tribe of friendly Arabs , the Bashaw traded off a second camel for some sheep , on which they might survive another day . Exhausted by the low rations they had been kept on so long , the troops marched wearily , and made only fifteen miles this day . The next morning early they were again roused by the bugle call , and without breakfast pressed after the little band of Americans , who seemed impervious to fatigue and insensible to famine . As the sun *nounted the heavens the arid desert , combined with the want of food and water , drove the poor wretches almost to despair . All effort at order was lost , and the soldiers scattered themselves like sheep over the sandy plain in search of something to cat . As far as the eye could reach bowed forms were seen snatching at the sorrel and wild fennel and such other herbs as they could find with which to stay the pangs of hunger . But Bomba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on . All day long they staggered forward , panting with thirst and weary with hunger , till at length , at four o'clock in the afternoon , the minarets of Bomba were seen flashing in the distance . A wild clamor suddenly rose from the whole army  --  the despairing grew light-hearted , the weak strong , and with shouts and laughter they pressed forward till the walls of the town arose before them . Eaton immediately dispatched an officer to the hill-tops to look out for the vessels . He returned with the disastrous tidings that they had gone . Fate seemed determined to try this brave man to the utmost . The effect of this disastrous news on the Arabs was fearful . The prospect of relief had hitherto kept them up ; hut now starvation , disappointment , , and despair made them savage and reckless . To . stay there without food was impossible . To attempt to reach friendly tribes in the desert , in their present suffering state , seemed an almost equally despe rate alternative . The latter , however , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , to break up their camp and turn their faces once more to the desert . Eaton knew that all attempts to dissuade them would be in vain . Neither promises , entreaties , nor threats could supply the place of food . Nothing but the expectation of finding it at Bomba had kept . them together under the trials and privations of the last three days . Still he would not despair . With that strange tenacity of purpose which refuses to yield to fate itself , he would not yet abandon all hope ; and taking with him some officers , he repaired to the summit of the highest bill , and gathering together a large quantity of combustible materials waited till darkness had settled over the sea and land , and then set fire to it , hoping the vessels might see the light , though far out at sea , and take it for his signal . The tropical stars came out upon the sky , the scattered tents of the encampment gleamed white and tranquil below , the fresh breeze stole gently inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose dimly in the distance ; but the only object that attracted Eaton 's eye and enlisted his thoughts was the column of flame and smoke that rose steadily in the night air and shed a lurid light into the valleys below . He remained all night on that lonely hill-top , and when the first streak of dawn appeared in the east , he turned his eye toward the sea . As the light broadened he swept it anxiously with his glass ; but not a sail could be seen except the little coasting vessels moving tranquilly along the shore . At length the sun arose flooding the blue Mediterranean with light , and it heaved bright and beautiful below him ; but no sail appeared to cheer his aching sight . The Bashaw and his chieftains had now resolved to abandon the expedition altogether , and appointed eight o'clock as the hour for the final breaking up of the encampment . Eaton therefore descended reluctantly to his teat to witness the painful event . His heart sunk within him as he saw the preparations for departure . Still he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look-outs constantly ascending the hills to see if the vessels could not be discerned on the distant horizon . But the report was always the same : " No sail in sight . " The Bashaw had at length marshaled his army . The tents were all struck , and the camels loaded ready to start . That was a bitter hour to Eaton , and his impetuous , unyielding soul rose in rebellion against the dark decree of fate . This , then , was to be the pitiful end of all his hopes and efforts . He had crossed the ocean , had over almost insurmountable obstacles organized his wild army in Egypt , and traversed for six hundred miles an inhospitable desert , endured toil , vexatious , and suffering , periled life itself , only to be left alone on the sea-coast to find his ships as . he might . Such an utter failure was crushing , and he could not consent to it . He would not even yet believe he was doomed to such a remorseless fate ; and at the last moment // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill-top to see if he could not detect on the deep some sign on which he might hang a single feeble hope . Watching him eagerly through his glass , he suddenly gave a start , as he saw him wave his hat and leap into the air . The next moment the officer came bounding down the hill , shouting that a vessel was just visible on the northern horizon . Instantly jumping to the conclusion that it was one of the American vessels of war , Eaton persuaded the Bashaw to delay his march for a little while , and hastened himself to the hill-top with his glass , and gazed long and anxiously on the distant stranger . He soon discovered that she was bearing directly down on the coast . Gradually looming larger and clearer on the sea , her dark hull at length rose into view . Bowling along before a gentle breeze , she continued to approach till Eaton could distinguish from her mast-head the broad pennant of Hull , who commanded the Arqas . With an exclamation of satisfaction , and a countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass and descended to the army with the welcome news . Unused to control their emotions , the Arabs broke forth into frantic shouts and cries of delight , accompanied by the most extravagant gestures . More disciplined natures than theirs might easily be pardoned for giving way to unwonted demonstrations of joy ; for to pass at a single bound from starvation and despair to hope and sure relief is enough to bewilder the strongest head . The watch on board the Argas had seen , the night before , the beacon-light of Eaton , and reported it to Captain Hull . The latter suspecting it might be Eaton 's signal that the expedition had reached the coast , he immediately ordered the sails to be squared away , and stood down toward it ; arriving , as we have seen , just in time to prevent the army from disbanding . Before noon the Argas had come close enough to send off a boat ; and at twelve Eaton went aboard to consult with the commander on their future operations . Provisions were immediately landed ; plenty reigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful again , while Eaton felt as if a mountain had been lifted from his heart . The next day the Hornet arrived . But that part of the coast which the army had approached being found bad for landing provisions , and furnishing a scanty supply of water , Eaton moved the army around to a spot twenty-two miles distant , where the landing was excellent and water was abundant . It lay encamped here three days , to recruit and land provisions sufficient to last them in their march to Derne . The 23d came , with rain and a fierce wind ; and the vessels , afraid of being driven on shore , put to sea . Eaton , notwithstanding the storm , determined to march ; and the army struck its tents , and , drenched to the skin , moved slowly over the hills in the direction of Derne . The country through which theypassed was cultivated , yet no marauding was allowed . The second day they came to a beautiful valley , and a fine grove of trees  --  the first they had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . They encamped here , preparatory to their march on the city , only five hours distant . But toward evening the camp was thso* a into a state of the wildest excitement and alarm by the arsival of a courier , who stated that not only had the Governor refused to yield up the place and was fortifying himself , but that a large army of relief from Tripoli was marching on the city , and would be there before them This disheartening news brought*n one of those sudden transitions of feeling to which all untutored races are subject ; and where , an hour before , all was high hope and confident courage , now terror and despair reigned . Two of the principal chiefs immediately mounted their horses and sped off to the desert . The Bas*aw himself lost all heart ; and there , right on the very verge of success , every thing seemed about to be lost . All the chieftains and the Bashaw assembl A in private council , andremained in consultation all night . Eaton was informed of the meeting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , sent word requesting to be admitted . But they bluntly refused him . This looked ominous ; and again and again he sought admittance , in order to interpose his strong will against any resolution to retreat or disband . He could effect nothing , and remained all night in a state of the most painful uncertainty . But as soon as day dawned he ordered the geaerale to beat , and watched with deep anxiety to see the result . As the stirring call rolled through the camp a part of the army marshaled into line ; but the Bedouins refused to strike their tents , and sat as unconcernedly as though it was a trading caravan to which they were attached . The chiefs , too , were on the verge of mutiny . But Eaton , by making a bountiful distribution of provisions , and promising them $2000 if they would keep on , prevailed on them to march ; and soon the army and caravan was again in motion , a ad wound reluctantly up the neighboring heights in the direction of Derne . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . A shout arose at the sight , while Eaton looked long and anxiously on the object toward which he bad been so long toiling .. The tents were pitched in view of the town , crowning all the gray heights that surrounded it . Soon as the camp was put in order , Eaton started with some of his officers to make a careful reconnoissance of the place . He discovered that its defenses consisted of a water-battery of eight nine-pounders and some temporary breastworks , extending half-way round the town . The houses were also loopholed for musketry , while the Governor had a ten-inch howitzer on the terrace of his palace that looked threateningly down on all the surrounding country . The city was divided into two distinct departments , one of which  --  the second-remained loyal to its old // ruler , Hamet ; and in the evening sent a deputation to him proffering their allegiance . Eaton occupied the last hours of the twilight in sweeping the sea with his glass to see if any of the vessels were in sight , hut without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent up from the highest mountain summits . The long spiral columns , as they wreathed gracefully upward , caught the land-breeze , and leaned gently toward the sea , making a picturesque hack-ground to the wild encampment on the lower ridges . At two o'clock the Nautilus hove in sight , and soon from her spars fluttered an answering signal . At six Eaton spoke her . Next morning the Argus was signaled . Eaton , knowing that all the vessels would now soon be before the place , sent a flag of truce to the Governor offering him the most liberal terms if he would give in his allegiance to Hamet Bashaw . The laconic , Spartan-like answer came hack- ' lily head or yours . " The vessels having arrived , Eaton , on the 27th , determined to advance on the city . The Arqus landed one field-piece , which was dragged with great difficulty up the rocks , and planted so as to command the place . The Nautilus and Argus took up their positions where their guns could sweep the space over which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans stood boldly on with the hornet till within pistol-shot of the battery , when he deliberately anchored . As the gallant little vessel swung to her cables , her broadside opened on the battery with a fierceness that astounded the barbarians . They , however , returned the fire with spirit , and the incessant explosions shook the shore . While it was flaming and thundering seaward , Eaton and the Bashaw , with nearly twelve hundred men , came down from the heights with colors flying and drums beating . Lieutenant OBannon , at the head of twenty-six Greeks , twenty-four cannoniers , and some Arabs , took up his position directly opposite where the enemy , screened by parapets and a ravine , lay in greatest force . The Bashaw threw himself into an old castle that overlooked the town ; while his cavalry stood marshaled in the plain below waiting the first opportunity to charge . The battle soon became general . The shot and shell from the ships fell so rapidly , and with such precision , within the battery , that in less than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defenders , finding their guns useless , went over to help their comrades opposed to Eaton and the Americans . Here the fire was very hot ; for the enemy , protected by the parapets and ravine , stood their ground firmly . Eaton had a single field-piece with him , which was worked with great rapidity and effect . But in the hurry of loading and firing the rammer at length got shot away , when its fire of course slackened , as the gunners could load it only with such substitutes as they could lay their hands on . Encouraged by this the enemy increased their fire , which soon became so scourging and destructive that the Arab allies were thrown into confusion . Eaton moved among them , exposing himself recklessly , in hopes , by his example as well as words , to mtke them steady . But , unused to discipline , they grew more disorderly every moment ; and Eaton , seeing it impossible to keep them any longer under the fire , ordered his little band of Americans to charge bayonet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marksman , made every shot tell . With a thrilling cheer this handful of brave men threw themselves fearlessly on the enemy . A shower of halls received them , one of which piercing the wrist of Eaton rendered his rifle useless . It was one against ten ; yet the overwhelming numbers could not resist the fierce onset , and gave way . The vessels of war saw the charge , and immediately stopped firing . OBannon and his men rushed on after the retreating foe , and , breasting the enveloping fire that was poured on them fl-am every place of concealment , finally scattered them in all directions . Keeping on his victorious way , he stormed the battery , and carrying every thing before him , cleared it with a shout , and planted the stars and stripes upon it . As the flag swung off to the breeze cheer after cheer rose up from the little hand , to which loud answering cheers canine hack from the delighted crews of the vessels . The enemy in the mean time had thrown themselves into the houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Americans . On these the vessels now directed their guns , and the heavy shot went crashing through the walls with such fatal effect that they were speedily descited , the fugitives escaping into the open country . Then came the turn of the Bashaw 's cavalry , which , with the wild shout of the desert , came thundering down on the flank of the disordered host , riding them down and sabring them without mercy , completing the overthrow and the victory . By four o'clock the battle was over , and the strange spectacle was witnessed of the American flag floating over a foreign fortress and a fortified city . ' Time has not diminished the novelty of that event , and at this day it stands alone and unique in our history . Eaton at once turned the cannon that had attempted to repel the shipping toward the country ; for he had received intelligence that a large army was advancing from Tripoli , and was already within fourteen hours ' march of Derne . In collecting his killed and wounded , to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of his own little force had fallen . Several days now passed in strengthening his defenses and preparing for the approaching conflict with the army from Tripoli . On the 2d of May it appeared in sight , swarming over the neighboring heights . The Bey commanding it pitched his camp on the very spot which Eaton had occupied previous to his descent on the place . The inhabitants of Derne were terribly alarmed at the apparition of this army , nearly five thousand strong , hanging in such threatening array over their heads . Nothing , however , // was done on the part of the Bey but to attempt to create an insurrection in the city against the conquerors , till the 13th , when the entire force displayed on the . high grounds with streaming standards , and at a given signal began to pour down the sides of the hills to the sound of their discordant music . A detachment of Hamet 's cavalry  --  a hundred strong-was stationed about a mile from the city in a plain near the sea . On this the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , the little detachment stood firm , and bravely fought every inch of ground . It was slowly driven back by the increasing masses that were precipitated upon it . The retreating battle at length brought the enemy under the fire of the vessels , when the round shot came rushing across the plain , tearing up the earth in their passage , and crashing through the astonished ranks . The assailants , however , kept firmly on . They had ascertained that the Bashaw was in the old castle , and they were determined to make him prisoner . So resolute and persistent was this unexpected attack , and so close did the enemy approach the castle before their purpose was detected , that their success for a moment seemed certain , when a nine-pound shot in full sweep struck two men on horseback who were approaching the gate , killing them instantly , and hurling their crushed and mangled bodies , with one of the horses , into the road . The destructive effect of this single shot so terrified those following after that they instantly sounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though on the very verge of victory , turned and fled in aifright . Hamet 's cavalry , seeing them retreat , wheeled on their flying traces , chasing them again with loud cries under the shot of the vessels . By three the battle was over ; and the Bey , enraged at his defeat , and the loss of eighty of his troops , retired to his would keep him cooped up there he could not tell . The commander of the Tripolitan forces wished to bring on a decisive action as well as himself ; but the Arabs had acquired a mortal fear of the Americans , and refused to advance against the place . They said they were willing to fight men who made war like themselves , but would not fight the Americans , who fired such big halls that they carried away a man and his camel together , and who would rush on them with bayonets , without giving them time to load . At length , on the 3d of June , a great commotion was seen in camp-marching , and counter-marching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to be completed , and the entire force came steadily on toward the edge of the slope . It advanced but a short distance , when it halted and began to marneuvre . Now forming into solid squhres , and again unrolling into line , while clouds of cavalry swept along and around the glittering formations , they presented an exciting spectacle . A grand attack was apparently at hand , and those formidable masses , that literally covered the slopes , filled the town with alarm . Eaton , supposing that of course the Bey intended to bring on a decisive battle , sent for Lieutenant OBannon and the Americans who were stationed near the battery to come over to the other side . As the little detachment passed through the town , with the American flag at its head , the inhabitants streamed out of their houses , women and children yelling and shouting , " Long live the Americans , our friends and protectors ! , , They evidently relied more on this mere handful of Americans than on the whole of the Bashaw 's army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a mere military display ; and the hostile force retired to their camp , having camp . spent the day . in ostentatious mancenvres and qwq // which the besiegers would have selected . The declivity was so steep-being , in fact , but little less than a rocky led*e-that the cavalry , in a body , could not descend , except in one spot , and that two miles and a half from town . From the base of this hill a rough and broken plain , a mile wide , stretched along the sea-shore to the city . This plain was completely swept by the guns of the Argus , except where a rocky elevation furnished temporary shelter . Upon this plain , half-way from the town to the pass , down which the cavalry were compelled to come , the Bashaw had posted videttes . A body of the enemy 's cavalry attempted to cut these off , who , when they detected the movement , instead of falling back on the town , bravely stood their ground , and a sharp encounter followed . Neither party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides . As the combat deepened , these were followed by others , and they kept coming in , section by section , till the entire armies were engaged . Captain Hull , from the deck of the Argus , could distinctly view the whole scene , and see tbe rapid gathering of the storm . It was an exciting spectacle to behold those seven or eight thousand men , flanked by their superb cavalry , coming in , like successive waves of the ocean , toward the vortex of the battle , i*ntil they stood in splendid array on the plain between the mountains and the sea . The officers stood grouped on deck , and the gunners leaned over their pieces , watching the deepening contest , as reinforcement after reinforcement was hurried forward . Their inaction lasted but a few moments . The guns of the Argus swept this plain ; and soon her well-directed shotwent plunging through the ranks of the assailants while at every opportunity the cannon from the town swelled the deafening uproar . Above the rattle of small arms , and the din @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yells of the Arabs . Gay standards undulated over the fight , but the stars and stripes fluttered where the battle raged the hottest . Enraged by the obstinate resistance with which they met , and scourged into madness by the galling fire of the Argus , the enemy made desperate efforts to push on , and his splendid cavalry was hurled again and again , with headlong valor , on the Bashaw 's troops ; but they never yielded an inch . Those peerless riders charged through the cross-fire of the ships with the steadiness of veteran troops , and heedless of the ugly rents made by the cannon-balls plowing through their squadrons ; again and again closed gallantly up , and fell like a loosened cliff on the steadfast ranks , but as often were rolled back in confusion . The plain and the sea were wrapped in clouds of smoke , and shook to and fro ; and for four hours there was no cessation to the determined strife . At length , finding it impossible to break the firm array before him , the enemy turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound the charge , when the Bashaw 's cavalry , breaking into a furious offensive , fell with VOL . XXI. - No. 124. -K K 509 loud shouts on the flying squadrons . Many fell before the keen sabre , and the plain was strewn thick with the picturesque uniforms of the mixed races that had struggled and fallen on its bosom . Some , to escape their pursuers , were compelled to leap from their horses , and take to the sides of the mountain ; while , from the ships , cheer after cheer was sent up by the excited crews . Lieutenant OBannon , to complete the overthrow , requested permission to lead his little band of Greeks against the disorganized army ; but Eaton thought it not best to hazard such an unequal contest . He was well satisfied with the result of the fight , and now felt sure of Tripoli , on which he determined at once to lead his victorious troops . But at this juncture , in the very moment of triumph , and just as he began to feel compensated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vexatious delays and hazards , he received word from Captain Hull that an official dispatch had arrived announcing the conclusion of a treaty of peace between the United States and Tripoli . It turned out that the Government had sent Mr. Lear as Peace Commissioner , to settle , if possible , the difficulties with this barbarous power . Eager to have the honor of terminating hostilities , and fearing , from Eaton 's progress , that this would soon be done without his aid , he was willing to accept of almost any overtures , even at the sacrifice of the honor of his country . The usurper at Tripoli , trembling for his throne , was equally anxious to arrest Eaton 's progress by diplomacy , as he saw no prospect of doing it by arms . He found the American Commissioner more eager , if possible , than himself for peace ; and with a sagacity that puts Mr. Lear in a pitiful light , exacted and obtained the terms of a conqueror . Mr. Lear agreed , on the part of the United States , to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars for the American seamen that be held captive . Relying on the word of the President , and trusting implicitly to the convention that Eaton made with him on the part of his Government , Hamet Bashaw had crossed the desert with his followers and fought battle after battle under the American flag . The chiefs also put implicit confidence in the good faith of the Christians and now that same Christian Government , without consulting them , and on the very threshold of success , had put its seal to a treaty that sent their rightful sovereign again into exile , and themselves wanderers over the desert . Eaton was totally overwhelmed by the disgraceful news . He had borne up nobly through all the trials of his long and tedious march ; had fought his way heroically over every obstacle ; and now , just as he saw his promise to Hamet about to be redeemed , and success within his grasp , and the flag of his country certain to be vindicated , and the tyrant who held so ninny of his fellow-countrymen in bondage receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humbled , from the very scene of his exploits , and from the field itself of victory . // qwq who went on shore with a flag of truce , offering favorable terms to the remaining inhabitants . But he was received with sullen defiance . As far as Eaton was concerned , the drama was now over , and the expedition ended . Great effort was made by the friends of the Administration to cover up the disgraceful transaction , hy endeavoring to prove that Eaton 's prospect of taking Tripoli was very poor at best ; and that it was far better and more economical to close the war , even if Government had to pay $60,000 ransom for its seamen . Granting this to be true , it does not by any means relieve the Government , and especially the Commissioner , from the disgrace attached to the treaty of peace . For , in the first place , no one doubts that Eaton could have ohtained far better and more honorable terms if he had been let alone . In the second place , a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to betray a fallen prince , and pay a ransom for its own seamen , is a burning disgrace to any Government . What was the market value , in dollars and cents , put by Mr. Lear on the plighted word of his Government ? How much money did he consider as a fair offset to the contemptible attitude of the Great Republic , in going into the public shambles of a little piratical power , and buying its own gallant seamen , and asking that peace should be one of the conditions of the purchase ? Eaton would have scorned to execute such a commission , even though peremptorily ordered to do it by his Government , much less have assumed the responsihility of such a deed of shame . The Commissioner who would dare at the present day to commit his Government to such a transaction would he hooted out of the land , and the Administration that would sanction it disappear in the universal scorn of the people . As a fitting appendix to this disgraceful transaction , Government hesitated to indemnify Eaton for his personal losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his claims , acting on a nature that rebelled fiercely against injustice and deception , drove him into dissipated habits , and cut short a life that ought to have been spared to his country ; for men of such executive force and indomitable resolution are not so plentiful that they can be sacrificed to meanness and incapacity . He had the satisfaction before he died , however , of hearing that Hamet was installed Governor of Derne , the city on which he planted the colors of the Republic .
