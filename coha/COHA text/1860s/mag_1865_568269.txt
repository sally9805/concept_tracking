481 Personal Perils of the Preacher . ARTICLE 111. - PERSONAL PERILS OF THE PREACHER . IT is very natural for men to regard the circumstances in which the Christian minister is placed by his profession , as peculiarly favorable to his own spirituality of life . The multitude almost envy the godly eminence of those commissioned with the gospel 's messages of glory and mercy . They seem to think that the conspicuous position of the preacher necessarily lifts him above all other men in piety , as well as in the character of his professional utterances . They find him always ready with a prayer and holy phraseology to apply to others ' wants ; therefore they imagine him as equally equipped against assaults upon himself . He can at any time confirm the weak , and point the trembling to God 's treasury of promises ; therefore it is believed that he himself lives in the very holiest sanctuary , surrounded constantly by abundant means of grace . Thus he is regarded not only as a servant , but a favorite of the Almighty , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace is shed . Aud sometimes the minister himself believes all this ; with nothing to bid him raise the mantle of official power , and see what he would be without it , and self-deceived by the facility of heavenly utterances to which he is accustomed , he forgets that many may be less in Jesus ' earthly kingdom , and yet be greater in the heavenly , than he . Unless with Arthnr Dimmesdale , some guilty secret burns like a scarlet letter in his heart , and constantly torments him for concealing such a shame beneath the garments of mock holiness , he will , the last of all professed disciples , feel the possibility of being cast away from God ; and as there are ( thank God ! ) few Arthur IDimmesdales in the ministry , consciously wearing one face to themselves , another to the multitudes few among the clergy realize the dangers of their high vocatiou ,  --  all the more imminent , because the very grandeur of the office raises them to a bewildering preeminence of labor and authority . But the Apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He not only knew , but felt , that the laws of mind are not suspended in behalf of ministers , any more than for less marked disciples ; and great as was this ministry of Jesus in his eyes , enviable as he considered this privilege of preaching , and sublime as must have seemed to him the calling of Amnbassadors for Christ , yet do we not hear this chief of the Apostles , at the end of his recital of the gifts and graces of his preaching , saying , " Lest I myself should be a cast-away ! " Although Paul had a strong assurance of his own salvation ; although his real experience was found in the eighth , rather than in the seventh chapter of his Letter to the IRomans , yet , in view of the Apostle 's use of checks upon an over-confidence , may it not be , for all clergymen , an appropriate prayer which the good deacon made during a revival , " Oh , Lord , bring us , also , out of the seventh into the eighth chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , all the " peculiar privileges of the clergyman , " ( as set forth in an Article with this title , in this Quarterly , five years ago ) , * may we not with equal candor show the perils of the minister , and lift the veil that sometimes shrouds him from the world , and far too often from himself . First , then , let it be fully understood that ministers are " human , " in the very fullest meaning of that word . let there be no shadow of a feeling , even , that by entering the pastoral relation men somehow doff their human qualities to don the perfect sanctities which some imagine to accompany the sacred robes . Let it not be supposed for a moment that there is to be a trial at the last great day for " saints " and " sinners , " with a special assize , with special pleading , for those invested with the holy priesthood ; for instead of being made less human , in any sense , the man is made partaker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostle of the cross . His occupation calls for and develops more of human nature in him , than any other calling on the earth . Is he not touched by the humanities of life in more points of his being than any other man ; and is he not in contact with a wider circle of the merely human joys and woes ( to say // nothing now of spiritual syinpathies ) , than men of other occupations ? To whom do sorrowing hearts love to pour out their griefs , as to the friend that God has placed to be His minister of consolation ? Who hears so many tales of family distress ? Who , therefore , more than the clergyman , needs for these things , a human heart , as well as a divine and heavenly unction ? And are not clergymen , alas , too often ! made conscious , more than others , of the human nature on its evil side within them , by the want of humane treatment on the part of those who call on them to lay aside humanity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , that the minister is human ; that he ought to be in some things more human than others ; while it is likely , from causes incident to his profession , that he will be in a few things more human than he ought , and we pass on to see how life with him , upon this basis of his real and deep humanity , must lie amid peculiar perils . I. The popular belief in ministerial character endangers him . There are always persons to believe in any minister of fair exterior ; to listen with avidity to what he says , and to defend him against every foe . In spite of those who loudly talk their skepticism concerning ministerial character , there are more than enough in every community , by their applause or secret approbation , to turn the thoughts of ordinary clergymen in upon themselves with self-congratulation . The day is past for hats to fly off at the approach of every man in clerical apparel ; but so constituted is the human mind , that when a man stands in the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaks the glorious mysteries of the kingdom , denounces sins and vices , and exalts the beauties of a holy life , insensibly he gathers to himself the sympathies he has touched in favor of religion and of God . A portion of his hearers ( especially it they see but little of his daily life , and sometimes in spite of anything they see ) will certainly invest his person with the qualities which he illustrates in his words . They can not separate what a man may say , from what that man may be . And though few go so far as did that weeping follower of John // Wesley , who , out of hearing of his voice , upon the outskirts of the crowd , was wholly overcome , as she expressed it , by the holy " wagging of his head , " yet always some will blend the gospel and its human medium together , believing equally in both ; a belief in " verbal inspiration , " as injurious to him believed in , as to him believing . Then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight to faithful preaching , and are ready , as all hearers should be , to give assent to any proper presentation of the truth . Now all these favorable indications the preacher notices first of all . Unfavorable things he also hears , ( especially when a clique desire to get rid of him , and take this method to discomfit him ) , but so human is he , or so anxious it may be to succeed , that one remark in favor of his style , or substance of discourse , will far outweigh a large amount of disapproving words . It is strange how soon the whisperings of a preacher 's friends and foes are brought , as upon zephyr 's wings , to him ; but , stranger yet , how happily he learns to choose the complimentary remarks as good , while casting all the rest , as bad , away . The latter he styles " hypercritical ; " begins at once to trace them to their origin , either in the want of discriminating qualities in the criticising party , or in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards himself . And thus a habit of vain contemplation is encouraged , causing him to become less and less worthy of the approbation upon which he lives . He must hear complimentary , or at least compliant notices of himself and his performances , or he grows moody ; thinks the church cold , and gives himself to morbid reverie over all causes but the true one for this appar* ent falling off in zeal . Sometimes he gets to be a sullen preacher ; steeps his pen in wormwood , and instead of offering the gospel to his hearers , stings them with a bitter satire on their vices , especially the vice of not appreciating Truth . For let no one think that personal ambition always yields , with ministers , to higher interests and aims ! // Tn a peculiar sense , this passion tries the soul of one whose influence must be entirely spiritual , and whose means for gaining this authority , by being almost wholly moral and persuasive , excite but little opposition from the world . Since the clergyman 's ambition is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since by his reputation for sanctity , he must hold the power to bind or loose the consciences of men , the end of his ambition is to stand an oracle among them , not only for his scholarship and eloquence , but also for his purity and piety . And as the means are in accordance with this end , there is great danger that in using them he sink their sanctifying power over his own heart , in his desire for personal distinction as a saintly man . Thus the very fact that his real authority depends upon his piety , makes the ambitious minister belie himself ; as , for example , when he frankly owns a fault , expecting and believing that men will set it down to humbleness of spirit , though he knows that it is nothing but sheer pride . Moreover let this spiritual authority be gained , whether by praiseworthy means or not , it is the most imperiling of all , to hold . It exalts a man above the level where our human nature still is master of itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavens to men , is more than ordinary , unassisted souls can bear ; and to be called upon to judge the evidence of others ' piety , or to interpret IRevelation with authority , is enough to put some men completely off their equilibrium ; while add to this the consciousness of wielding more or less political and social power , which naturally accompanies directorship of consciences , and no wonder that some clergymen think themselves " ordained of God " in other senses than the true . Encouraged therefore by belief in himself , as well as by the popular belief in him , it is the easiest thing possible to mistake the fervors and excitements of high mental states , for genuine love for souls ; it is most easily forgotten when the end seems good , that " ardor " is not " piety , " and that a man may even work through a revival with the utmost zeal , only to find himself at the end of it , impoverished at heart ; more self-inflated than before . Thus the successful minister by the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may all unconsciously hoodwink himself ; and come forth , thinking that he is not only " called " and " justified , " but also " glorified . " He may even give his followers leave ( without perhaps expecting a complete apotheosis ) , " To carve a shrine about his dust And burn a fragrant lamp before his bones When he is gathered to the glorious saints , " when from this height of spiritual authority , he is but getting ready , like the crowned relics hidden in Etruscan tombs , to crumble , more than others , into nothingness of character , before the light of the great Judgment Day . II . But not only is the preacher thus in danger from the popular belief in him ; he also runs great risk of fancying security in his priesthood . As an officer of Christ , he is gathering souls into the kingdom ; he is sowing seed that must spring up unto eternal life , in hearts now wandering from God . The Saviour blesses him as instrumental in achieving great results ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ministry , " he nevertheless is in attendance on the Saviour , sharing in the labors of his onward march . All his hours of study , his meditations , his ministrations of the word in public and in private , cluster about the cross . He uses language of authority towards the incorrigible sinner ; he confirms the feeble , and the very bread he eats conies from his efforts in behalf of souls . The symbols wrought into the texture of his daily thought are of the mystic power established in the ministry whose name he wears . " Can it then be possible , " he reasons with himself ; " that I , a part of this great priesthood ; T , whose work on earth is similar to Christ 's own work ; whose tongue is swift to sound his praise , and by whose hands the cross is held continually before the people ; is it possible that I , to whom God seems to give his power for the conversion of the sinner and the upbuilding of believers , may at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of grace , which I am giving up my life to spread abroad ! " You see how easily one ( whose self-congratulation in his // priesthood no gross immorality is present to disturb ) can so identify himself with the official character in which he acts upon the world , as to remove all fear of his own ultimate disgrace , and fix his own salvation upon evidence which would be wholly insufficient to him in the case of others . Of course the minister asserts his safety only in the blood of Christ , but may he not , for all this open avowal of his ground of hope , be unconsciously in part relying upon a presumed identity in priestly office with the Saviour ; may not the strength of his assurance of salvation come in some degree from " casting out devils " in the name of Christ ? Is there not danger then that he may hear at last the answer to this plea from Christ 's own lips , " Depart from me ; I never knew you ! " for may he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he has violently declaimed against it ? Like St. Simon standing on his pillar thirty years , we may be none the nearer heaven for that ; and God may even reap a harvest through us , though we at last be lost . III . Another danger from the ministry is the liability of its becoming exclusively an art . It is necessary that this ministry of Christ should avail itself of every aid that tends to dignify , enlarge , or strengthen its influence upon the world . Like every other profession , God has given this to men to make the most of , for his glory ; and there is a laudable desire in every worthy minister , to do his very best . To accomplish this he must seek skill , as well as piety ; learning and prudence equally with grace . He need not , with Professor ilagenbach of Vienna , spend twenty years in getting into perfect form a course of lectures on one chapter of the Bible ; nor with his colleague Guthmann , measure off his lectures on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volumes ; but unless his oratory is impressive and his words profound , he misses just so much of power to win men to the Saviour as he is lacking in attractiveness of manner and the resources of a cultured understanding . John Wesley , bred at Oxford , was the finest rhetorician of his day , save Whitefield , who was equally at home before the peers of England as upon the moors of Wales . // But the danger is , that ministers will conscientiously become mere artists . Fully interested in their work , their hearts in love with it , the danger is that they will come to look upon it rather as an art which they should carry to perfection , than as the mission of Jehovah to lost men . An interest in their profession often runs away with medical practitioners ; and why may it not with honest ministers as well ! Thus one may actually pray less , the more devout he seems ; and since it is the highest art to hide the artifice , one may appear to speak most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at all , except in the exhilaration of the spirits , naturally accompanying the mental exercise . It is the true preacher 's constant study to impress on others what he himself believes . He must feel the truth , in order to make others feel it ; but speedily his own condition , as he grows earnest in the work , and conversant with all its methods , is like that of the surgeon , who has long ago passed by that moisture of the eye which dimmed efficiency of vision , and that tremulous pulsation of the hand which dulled his skill . It is now maturity of feeling ; none the less alive to human woe ; all the more discriminating , wise , and strong ; and yet it is a state of hardness of a certain sort . The soul looks at itself as an objective thing to be examined and made use of , mainly for the good of other souls . Thus the preacher comes to read his own experiences , just as he reads books , to learn the art of interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena , just as be studies the solution of a moral question , that he may present as strong a view of it as possible , to certain men whom he would fain lead to the crcrs ; and we have even known a clergyman to look upon a grave transgression of his own , chiefly in the light of very precious training for home-thrusts at other peoples ' hearts . Indeed , a famous preacher once congratulated the writer upon a most severe bereavement , as of great value to him for his ministerial work ! Thus there is danger , in this constant effort to impress the truth on others , lest it make but little real impression on one 's self ; danger that the preacher come to look upon his own // condition as of the least importance , provided it afford him the best opportunity to move the world to prayers and tears While he is preaching on the danger of man 's hardening his heart , he may be all unconsciously distilling petrifying influences upon himself . Content in saving others , himself he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he concerns himself alone in men , professionally , as " deeply interesting cases . " He does not go to dying bedsides with this clinical and calculating purpose in his mind ; he loves these souls ; he gives his life to save them , but in loving theirs , he seems at least unmindful of his own . " Oh , woman , " ( said the celebrated John Welch to his wife , when she complained of his nightly vigils ) , " I have three thousand souls to answer for ; " but we do not hear that this devoted minister ever took much anxious thought about his own . And this would bring no disaster to him spiritually , except as it should draw him gradually from self-inspection , as it might , when suffered to extend beyond due bounds . Thus the preacher may even slight the ordinances provided for his own relief and culture , in attending to the wants of others . His love of private prayer may lose itself amid the frequency of public exercises ; or he may pray in secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited for a coming duty in God 's open sanctuary . So too , he may forget the sanctity of Sabbath hours , and lose the influence of holy time , while getting mind and body into working order for the public service . Thus made a keeper of the vineyards , his own he may not keep . Just here then , let us notice the preacher 's danger of a slcepticis ? n , arising from the practice of his profession as an art , for others ' good . When the ancient Roman faith began to yield before the growth of liberal opinions , we find the priests of the old Paganism among the first to give up their belief . The " Haruspices , " we learn , would even smile in mutual incredulity , over the entrails of the sacrifice which they pretended to consult . And thus , it is alleged , ( see Ellis ' Half-Century of Unitarianism , p. 367 ) , that in these modern days " clerical skepticism is a disease under which thousands have suffered , who have not proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This unproved insinuation need give no uneasiness concerning an educated clergy , at this period in the growth of an impregnable , scientific basis for the main doctrines of the gospel . Liberalism may unsettle some traditional and narrow applications of the Truth ; and to this extent , we trust , it will achieve its work ; but it is losing power every day to trouble faithful students of the word . iRenan , or even Colenso , might have been a dangerous poison fifty years ago among the ministry , while to day neither of these men is looked upon as anything more than a phenomenal phase of struggling infidelity . And yet , firm as we believe a careful study of the scriptures makes the clergyman , who is applying what he learns to dying men aronnd him ; more and more child-like in his faith , as we believe he grows , amid the blended duties of severe examination , and the practical enforcement of the doctrines of Christianity , we often feel his danger from the freqnent though temporary suspension of his judgment in matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental processes at once , within his mind ; the one , that of the critical faculties in search of final causes and exhaustive evidences ; the other , that of his faith , endeavoring to confide in probable and worthy intimations of God 's will ; and until his mind attains release from its intensity of wish for demonstration , and finds the truest end of learned acquisition to be " faith " in its supremest exercise , he is exposed to strange experiences , akin to doubt , unknown to those who feel but little of that deep responsibility for their opinions , which continually weighs on the preacher 's heart . He is a teacher of others ; upon his words hang everlasting life and death for many hearers ; his faith is theirs , in cases where they do not care , or are not able to examine for themselves ; therefore no one feels as he does , the necessity of a well-buttressed faith . And he must ever speak authoritatively ; though surprised by a new view , which calls for a re-adjustment in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his querying be known . Obliged also to be always on the defensive , and often able to satisfy the popular demand without the deeper proof which his own mental needs require , // his ministerial position has at least a tendency to make him partisan , and unfair in argument with himself . us eagerness to be considered orthodox , combined with fear of sowing seeds of doubt in other minds , make him moreover appear determined and convinced , on questions yet on trial in his mind ; so that finally he wishes to believe the things he has proclaimed ; a state of heart the most unfavorable for an impartial judgment . In such a struggle then , on the one hand , with the subtle influences of his own will , and , on the other , with those fears and self-distrusts which every scholarly and earnest preacher meets while critically investigating Truth , there is great danger , lest in trying every spirit , to see whether it be of God , some one , more mighty than the rest in knowledge of his weakness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rule him for the time ; while he , continuing to preach in the old way , runs the great risk of weakening forever after , that sense of full fidelity to Truth , which is the preacher 's tower of strength ; to say nothing of his liability , in this constant throttling of the devil , to find at last , ( as a quaint writer has it ) , " somewhat of brimstone sticking to his hands . " Some of these injurious results may even come to him , simply from mistaking the different stages , or variable conditions of mind from which he looks at Truth , to be periods of distrust , when they are really but degrees of ordinary progress in the recognition of relations between different truths . In short , we can not stop to tell one-half of the perplexities that rise upon the ministerial soul , as it is honestly endeavoring to keep a childlike confidence , amid the manifold developments of its progressive thought . Enough , however , has been said to show that it is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " IV . With one more illustration of the preacher 's peril from his ministry , we conclude the catalogue , which might easily embrace a wider field . It is the special danger which gave rise to the expression of Paul 's fear , lest , having preached to others , he himself should be a castaway. // We refer to temptings through the body , incident to this profession , as to no other in a similar degree . There are , in any literary career , peculiar exhaustions of the nervous energy ; inadeqnate or disarranged secretions ; drains upon the system , leading not so much to weakness and dullness of the appetitive functions , as to an inordinate desire for stimulating management . This may account , in part , for the amount of dissipation among writers and authors of all eras ; geven Coleridge being unable to resist the opiate that proved so detrimental to his happiness and vigor . But the inspiration of the writer upon sacred themes especially , resembles that of the Pythoness , who , on the cessation of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , in strange degree , comes that exhaustive longing after some continued stimulus which the body would fain have after the excitement of the mind has passed . Cut off , moreover , from the expensive sources of relaxation of other men ; his sensibilities more acute and powerful than theirs by reason of his constant meditation upon stirring , spiritual themes ; he is more liable than they , to feel as Paul did , " thorns in the flesh ; " a " messenger of Satan sent to buffet him . " We do not refer to clergymen who recklessly outrage their nervous organism by night-study and excessive extra work ; we need not count them , or the few whom self-indulgence had within its grasp before they became ministers ; for the name is legion without such as these , who are prone to rush from the extreme of spiritual excitement to the most careless bodily indulgence . Not that the clergy are , as a class , in danger of immoral practices ; we believe a purer-minded order of men , when taken as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are apt to lay hold of innocent enjoyments ( which in moderation they should seek ) with a relish , or rather with a nervous eagerness , out of all proportion to the innocence of a restrained participation in them ; and we all know that lawful pleasures , when abused , are far more perilous to spirituality than an occasional relapse into great sin . When clergymen seem // worn out , therefore , with their work , it is their work , in one sense ( though no harder than the brain-work of the other prof'essions ) , but only as their kind of work leaves hankerings of a more lasting and injurious sort behind . Therefore a minister , the more he throws himself into his work the more he shall forget himself in it , the more is he imperiled by the buffetings of Satan through the flesh . In view , then , of these perils , where is the hope of any Christian preacher that he shall not be at last a cast-away ! Better not to wear these robes of holiness , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ! Happier those who wear their badge of sin before the world , than they who , " wearing one face to themselves , another to the world , get finally bewildered as to which may be the true ! " Better , in the language of another , " show freely to the world , if not your worst , yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred , " than to be found at last a selfdeceived , deceiving soul ! and in the attempt to scale the kingdom on the ladder of the priesthood , to drop back into a deeper hell ! Fearful , indeed , is such a destiny ! To keep so long the entrance to the holy city ; to call so many into life ; to catch ourselves grand glimpses of the glory yet to be revealed , and all this , only as the preparation for a more disastrous , ignominious refusal of admission , thrust into the outer darkness by the very hand that we have urged souls in distress to take ! Surely , on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry , we are bereft of hope ! As men , encircled by these dangers , we are surely lost ; as priests , we may be left to perish at the very altar of our ministry ; but thanks to God ! as his redeemed and pardoned children , we , with all the rest of the unworthy multitudes of earth , may hope . Upon the basis , not of our humanity but of Christ 's divinity , there is encouragement even unto us to lay our hands upon the blessed promises of grace . Let us , then , pray God to counteract the evils that environ us ; to preserve us from the snares peculiarly endangering // our spirituality as preachers of his word ; even letting the arrows of conviction from our official hand fly back , when needful , on our consciences , and giving us , as we shall need , to feel the edge of truths and terrors we are wielding against others ' sin . Bring us , Oh , our Father , humbly to thy feet ! Beat down our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that rising in Thy might alone , clad only in the priestly righteousness of Christ , and guided by the Holy Ghost , we may not , having preached to others , be cast away ourselves !
