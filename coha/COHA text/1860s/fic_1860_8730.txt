CAST OF CHARACTERS . Table : 4Kb Costumes modern in style , and suited to the station and character of the persons represented . Time of Representation . One hour and twenty minutes JOHN S. CLARKE Was born in the city of Baltimore , in 1833 . At an early age he evinced a predilection for the stage , and was , with our distinguished young tragedian , Edwin Booth , the " head and front " of a little band of juvenile Thespians ,  --  the two lads enacting opposite parts in tragedy , which Clarke conceived at the time to be his particular forte . By the earnest desire of his mother ( his only surviving parent ) , young Clarke entered a lawyer 's office , for the purpose of preparing himself for the legal profession ; but preferring Shakspeare and the Drama to musty parchments and the acts of the Revised Statutes , he determined to adopt the stage as a profession . Having obtained an engagement at the Howard Athenum , Boston , he made his first appearance on the 7th of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Paul Pry . " He subsequently , in 1852 , joined the company at the Chestnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , then in its palmy days , where he remained until 1851 , when he again returned to Baltimore , as first low comedian of the Front Street Theatre . The complimentary benefit which was given to him in the fall of 1854 will be remembered by those who had the good fortune to be present as one of the greatest ovations ever awarded to native talent in the country . In August , ' 55 , he became a member of the Arch Street Theatre , Philadelphia , where he has been ever since , as the leading comedian , and for the last three years as joint manager with Mr. Wheatley . His occasional " starring " visits to the Southern cities are always greatly successful . In the profession , and by all out of it who enjoy his acquaintance , he is esteemed highly for qualities that render manhood doubly attractive when combined with those of the artist . As an indication of his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his last benefit the throng was so great that the stage was partly given up to spectators . We have in his comedy the first grand essential . This is affluent , spontaneous , natural humor . For this quality it is impossible to substitute the graces and clever forms and modes that education brings It is this bounteous gift that runs the artist into dangers . Criticism mistakes simple excess of humor for extravagance , as Dickens is always reminded by those most sensible of his vivid nature , that he puts life under a magnifier , and travesties its incidents and emotions . We know no comedian who is so throughly appreciative of the ludicrous as the subject of this notice . His fun is like a perennial fountain , clear , and sparkling , and gushing . It refreshes all alike . We have seen old and care-tried men , youths without a care , the educated and refined , and the rough and unlettered , given up literally to its strength and stir . We have repeatedly seen " old stagers " overcome by the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and interrupted in their labors for an unregretted space . Sympathy is the signet of genius ,  --  sympathy , or that subtile , close communion with universal nature which , for the sake of distinguishing it from acquired knowledge of the human character , we call intuition . Without this delicate sense no deep impression can be made by the public performer , whether religious or secular . Mr. Clarke 's power with an audience is wonderful ,  --  magnetic ,  --  because he has its pulse in his hand , and its heart beating close to his own . We are all the time seeing how Art is measuring and controlling the gift of humor with which Mr. Clarke has been endowed . All of his delineations are suggestive of intelligent effort to realize the best functions of the stage . In the fresh parts he has played within the past twelve-month there has been as little exaggeration as the stage will allow . ( It clearly will not allow any precise and unvarying method ; since nature is mysteriously various . ) Versatility distinguishes this comedian eminently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered a wide range . We have seen him as " Toodles , " the embodiment of the grotesque and low comical ; as " Bob Acres , " the half-genteel braggart ; as " Farmer Ashfield , " the type of the pathetic domestic man ; as " Bob Tyke , " the man of fierce passions and original good sympathies ; as " Tilly Slowboy , " the awkward , honest creature ; as " Major De Boots , " the familiar type of eccentric ardor unsustained by vital force . In all these characters , and many more as widely contrasted , we think Mr. Clarke has shown the conception of a general artist , and a power of expression which no living comedian possesses in the same degree .

While other girls are sedulous to secure the affections of one lover , I have a fresh one offered me every week , by my provident father ; all of which have been duly refused . An odd catalogue of aspirants is mine , to be sure : Merchants , who have so annoyed me with long stories of drafts  --  upon my patience . Drafts indeed ;  --  advances  --  failures  --  shipments  --  clearances.  --  No clearance of them all afforded me so much pleasure as their own . Lawyers , with their latin and logic  --  arguments  --  pleas  --  which displeased me ,  --  and suits in which they were nonsuited . Physicians , who have amused me with the same means that made their patients miserable ,  --  a medley compound of love and fevers , drugs and blisters  --  to draw my attention ; and to end the list , I have a lord ,  --  a sprig of nobility ,  --  an exotic lover .

Miss Squeamish What do you mean , miss ? El . Ellen Tomkins O , I have watched you ;  --  as soon as a man appears , old or young , if your glasses happen to be off , on they go directly . Miss S. Miss Squeamish That 's because I do not wish their eyes to meet mine . Do you dare to think , miss , I can see better with them than without them ? No ; I do not wear them to improve my sight , but because they give one an air of age and respectability , that 's all . El . Ellen Tomkins I 'm sure there is no need of that . Your old age shows itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use such language to your old  --  I mean your own aunt ? El .

Wilkins I am to marry Tomkins ' daughter . Wait till the ceremony is over ; then I touch , and so shall you . Why do you hesitate ? McN .

I 'll go and search among my rist of cards , sir . Perhaps  --  Sand . Sandfield Perhaps , villain ! I 'll freshen your memory . You are known to me , and your deeds . Merston !  --  disgrace and infamy were brought upon him by you ! ' T was you who under the mask of friendship first seduced him to the gaming-table ; and he was there soon stripped of his fortune , and largely involved in debts of honor , with villains for his creditors ! When your share of the spoil was spent in dissipation , or lost again among the sharpers of your gang , you forged a draft upon a banking house , promising a loan on receiving it . He believed it true ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to accept the proffered assistance . Wil . Wilkins Well , sir , what 's this to me ? Sand . Sandfield The forgery was detected ;  --  he arrested and imprisoned . You appeared against him in evidence ;  --  perjured villain ! your words convicted him ! Wil . Wilkins Whoever you may be , sir , you must be aware  --  Sand . Sandfield I have not done . In my possession are documents to prove your share of the transaction . I have crossed the ocean , and have come from the Indies to establish his innocence ,  --  to free my friend from the foul stain stamped by you upon his name !  --  to publish to the world your character ; and when found , to give you up to justice . I am aware , sir , of your designs here , and shall prevent them . Wil . Wilkins Should he disclose ! Sir , you are mistaken . My surprise was so great I did not before interrupt you . I am not the person you suppose . I forgive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in vain . If you have forgotten me , I have not forgotten you . You are so imprinted on my memory time can not efface the recollection . I have followed you here . Ten years have I , with an almost frenzied heart , waited the arrival of an hour like this ; and when I have thought of the home I left , madly I have cried for vengeance . ' T is come !  --  I am Merston ! ( Throws aside cloak . ) Wil . Wilkins Merston ! Have care !  --  I am soon to be united to one of this family . Go , while you are free ! If you longer stay , to cross my purpose , I 'll denounce you as a fugitive from justice . ( X to L. H. ) Sand . Sandfield I will not leave you . ( Detaining him . ) Wil . Wilkins ( aside ) . I can not force by threats ; I must bribe him . I receive my intended bride 's fortune , thirty thousand dollars , on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it shall be yours . Sand . Sandfield No ; I have not poverty  --  that finger-post to vice  --  to urge me . When the father of the girl , whom you intended to seduce from home and happiness , to be the companion of a villain , should know it , what would be his language to me ? He is my brother ! Wil . Wilkins Suffer me to fly ! ( Aside ) Death and furies ! Sand . Sandfield No , you stir not hence ! I say no ! Enter Tomkins , C. , and down C. Tom . Tomkins I say no , too . You are a pretty rascal ! Brother ! What have you to say for yourself ? Wil. , Wilkins L. Nothing ; if he has charges against me , let him prove them in a court of justice . Sand . Sandfield Yes ; ' t is easily done . He has but now escaped from prison . This paper I hold in my hand is evidence of that fact . Tom . Tomkins ' T is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hardly look you in the face . You infernal rascal ! how dare you ? But I shall not waste my breath talking to you . And Ned ; I turned him out of my house ! Sand . Sandfield Edward has been sent for , who as yet knows me not as his father . Enter McNab , C. , and down L. C. McN . Terrence McNab I have been listenin ' at the door . So you have found out my friend there . I suppose I may take him to his friends now . Tom . Tomkins Take him where you please , so ' t is out of my sight .  --  I care not . Why did you deceive me ? McN . Terrence McNab He promised to pay me for it ; and in default he stands committed . ( Crosses to L. H. ) Come along . Exit , with Wilkins , L. H. 1 E. Enter Jedediah , L. H. 1 E. Jed .

Tomkins Do n't call me Sir Jonas , or anything again that sounds like title . At the next session of Parliament  --  damn Parliament  --  I mean next Court , my name shall be changed back again . Brother , sister , nephew , daughter , Joe , you may all get married in a lump ; and I 'll make a nursery of every room in my house . I do n't care how soon I 'm a grandfather . Joe .

Tom . Tomkins Damn your titles ! Jed , say no more . Jed . Jedediah Homebred Only one thing more , square .  --  As I 'm now about to leave your employ , I may want a character , you know ; and so I thought I 'd just ask the good folks here , after what has passed to-night , if they 'd have any objection to give their recommendation to the Green Mountain Boy .
