The Month of August in the First Year of the Reign of Titus Main text ACT I Scene : the Harbor of Pompeii Enter Clodius and Sallust meeting Clodius : Clodius : Hail to you , Sallust ! You have favored Rome More than we liked . What kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Emperor installed . A sight To make a native of this little place Scarce breathe for wonder . Have you aught that 's new ? Clodius : Clodius : Here in Pompeii ? Sallust : Sallust : Yes . Clodius : Clodius : Not much ; unless You call our frequent earthquake something new . Sallust : Sallust : Moving , at least . Clodius : Clodius : It will amuse you , Sallust , At the next shake , to see our people run , Like frightened sheep , to the Egyptian fane Of Goddess Isis . Our poor Latin gods Are out of fashion ; deemed unskilled to cure This earth 's grim cholics . Sallust : Sallust : Is Arbaces here ? Clodius : Clodius : A seeming fixture . You must see his ward , The fair Ione . You have asked for news : Here is a novelty , and wonder too ,  --  This young Greek damsel with her Psyche face , Diana 's virtue , and proud Juno 's port . Sallust : Sallust : What , Clodius , what ! are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all Pompeii with me . Not to skip Glaucus , my rich Athenian friend . No , no ; I am no rival to his wealth , his grace , His cultured mind and splendid equipage : And he is wild about her . Sallust : Sallust : Did you say She is Arbaces ' ward ? I like not that . Clodius : Clodius : Nor I , Nor any one that cares for her , Nor , chiefly , Glaucus . Hence his fiery zeal To free her from the dark Egyptian 's power . Sallust : Sallust : The swarthy conjurer ! how I hate a man That makes your skin creep when he speaks to you ! Clodius : Clodius : If that were all !  --  By Jupiter , I think , In that man 's heart is wickedness enough Richly to furnish and endow a hell That would make Pluto jealous . Enter Dudas Dudas : Dudas : Hail !  --  hail !  --  hail !  --  If I could be myself , I 'd be more mannered !  --  Oh ! my poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sallust : Sallust : Indeed ! Dudas : Dudas : Yes ; two four-footed gladiators . Clodius : Clodius : Four-footed men ! Dudas : Dudas : I 'll bet a pound of gold , I said not men . Are you a taker ? Clodius : Clodius : Pshaw ! But are not gladiators men ? Dudas : Dudas : Not always . For example : a lion Footnote : 1Kb and a tiger , Fresh from the desert 's and the jungle 's depths ,  --  Insane with rage , death in their very looks ; What do you think of them as gladiators ? Clodius : Clodius : As somewhat better than the human brutes . Sallust : Sallust : But what had you to do with them ? Dudas : Dudas : You know , I am near-sighted ; and I chanced to venture A step too near the lion 's cage . By Jove ! Ere you could wink , his furious fore-claw Was buried in my toga ; and the beast Was in the act of gathering me in , All to himself , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust a burning torch Full in the monster 's yellow eyes . Hercules ! ' T was a sensation ! I am on my way , To buy that bondman 's freedom . Clodius : Clodius : Only quits . But the poor lion lost a meal . Have you No feeling for him ? Dudas : Dudas : Just this much . I would That I might see another fill my place ,  --  Some criminal or Christian ; but to see How I had fared , had lion had his way . Sallust : Sallust : But that is hopeless at the coming sports . There 's no obliging murderer in view : Nor make the Christians sacrilegious mouths , As once they did , even at the cow-faced Isis . Clodius : Clodius : Dudas , oblige us ; as an amateur , In Nero 's way , pray try another bout With your familiar lion . Ha , my man ! You owe a breakfast to him . Come , pay up ! Dudas : Dudas : If you and Sallust will attend the feast , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our table . Fare you well ! I must to Pansa . ( Exit ) Clodius : Clodius : And to Glaucus I. Sallust : Sallust : Ha ! who comes here ? I shall take flight myself . Cross your forefingers ! dread his evil eye , As an infection ! Clodius : Clodius : Nay , retreat were best . Exeunt severally Enter Arbaces and Calenus , accompanied Arbaces : Arbaces : Apaecides is discontented then ? Calenus : Calenus : Yes , more than that . Arbaces : Arbaces : As how ? Calenus : Calenus : He swears outright To quit the priesthood . Arbaces : Arbaces : Dare he ? This appears To be more grave . That weak boy , to rebel Against my teachings ! I must gather him Within the veil of Isis : there to live , Loyal till death ; or  --  Well , you know how soon Death comes to the unfaithful ! Calenus : Calenus : ' T was a step In that direction brought these humors forth . The other day , I showed our neophite How I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and levers and my naphtha lamps : That seemed to horrify him . When I took My long brass trumpet up , and roared amain , Through Isis ' inner lips , some gibberish , To show how neatly works the oracle  --  That is my pride , for I invented it  --  He dashed me and my trumpet to the ground , And half drew out his stylus , in a rage That made me tremble for my life . Arbaces : Arbaces : So , so ! This must be looked to . For his sister 's sake I can bear much from him ; but not too much  --  Not to the loss of Isis , and her sway Above these Romans . Calenus : Calenus : No , by Jupiter  --  Forgive me Isis , for that pagan oath !  --  Else where would go our temple 's revenues , And my small scrapings ? Arbaces : Arbaces : Miserable miser ! Wealth is a means , that only . Calenus : Calenus : And a power . Arbaces : Arbaces : Over the brainless . Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fop Of fickle Athens , with his haughty sweetness , His mien of grandeur ; as though he disdains The mere barbarians whom he condescends To honor with his presence . Ach ! my bird , If I should ever get you in my claws , I 'd send your fine plumes flying ! See the slaves  --  Degenerate Romans  --  cowering at his glance , And worshipping each footstep ! Calenus : Calenus : For his wealth . Arbaces : Arbaces : Wealth ! Something far more potent , silly man ; The fellow is the fashion . And this thing Of silks and jewels , and presumptuous airs , Dares to aspire to my Ione 's love ! One of my brood , my very nestling she  --  A peacock mate with eagles ! Enter Glaucus and Clodius , accompanied by nobles , freedmen , slaves Glaucus : Glaucus : Mark , Clodius ! Look at our everyday , yet ever-new , Wonder of wonders , here , before our eyes , With all its azure depths and starry waves ; As though the happy synod had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cheer the spirits of ungrateful men . Look , friends , I pray ! Can mortals , upon earth , Stand nearer heaven than we are now ?  --  Look , look ! Clodius : Clodius : A happy heart is ever close to heaven . My Glaucus , let me share your joy . What hap Uplifts you thus ? Glaucus : Glaucus : The happiest of haps : Surely the gods have fallen in love with me . A secret , Clodius , which must so remain , Until I give it to the world . Clodius Clodius I guess it . The fair Ione  --  Glaucus : Glaucus : Yes , yes , conjurer ! How could you know that which I hardly hoped ? ' T is so indeed ; and I have walked the air , And felt Elysian breezes on my cheeks Since I first heard  --  Nay , she said nought in words : She only slid her little dove-like hand Into my own ; and , with her pleading eyes , Looked truth and faith out of my eager heart , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fixed When we must lose you then ? Glaucus : Glaucus : All time stood fixed When we exchanged our troth . Futurity Limps , like a slave , beside love 's chariot . All things , between themselves , belong to those Who truly love . The world may rage outside , And shake Love 's throne , but can not overthrow Him or his loyal subjects . Clodius : Clodius : Recollect , Arbaces is her guardian . Glaucus : Glaucus : But in name . A year ago his tutelage expired By law 's decree , her father 's testament , And the insistence of Apaecides  --  Her brother , and a priest of Isis too , But seemingly not over-full of trust In guardian Arbaces . Clodius : Clodius : Wise young man ! Arbaces advances . Clodius makes the sign against the evil eye Footnote : 1Kb Arbaces : Arbaces : You speak of me . Glaucus : Glaucus : Yes , truly ; but what told you ,  --  A tickling nostril , or a burning ear ? Arbaces : Arbaces : A goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Listens to gossip then . Arbaces : Arbaces : Our butterfly Still flaunts his reckless Attic wit . Glaucus : Glaucus : Oh , yes ! Even as the laboring beetle of old Nile Rolls his dark ball before him . Arbaces : Arbaces : Scoff not , man , At things above your knowledge . Glaucus : Glaucus : Or beneath . Arbaces : Arbaces : Beneath a Greek ! ' t were low enough indeed ! Glaucus : Glaucus : Just low enough to touch the highest flight Of an Egyptian 's spirit . Arbaces : Arbaces : Fie ! I 'll go To Isis ' temple , and implore her grace To pardon you . Glaucus : Glaucus : To Isis ' temple , hah ! ' T is but four lustra since the Senate 's voice Decreed that not a temple to your goddess Should stand in Italy . Arbaces : Arbaces : I said not temple  --  Not consecrated temple : house , or hovel , Or whatsoever shields her sacred head . That sacrilegious Senate ! Woe to it ! Woe to this land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , woe to this very spot ! See , where earth 's goddess lifts her threatening hand In yonder mountain . Dead , inert , you say , Since history began . O man , with sight Short as his life , what are unwritten ages To the immortals ? Isis ' day will come , When , on this ancient lava where you stand  --  Once more a molten sea in gales of fire  --  You 'll grind your knees for mercy , but in vain ! ( Exit ) ( Nydia sings within Glaucus : Glaucus : Prophet of evil ! A foreboding tongue Never wants ears to hear and quail at it : And yet our Strabo said almost as much . What think you , Clodius , will Veseveus  --  Our fruitful mountain , with its cup of vines , And flowery garlands  --  ever fill that cup With stygian flames ; and , from its wounded sides , Pour burning blood upon our shrinking heads ? Enter Nydia listening to Glaucus Clodius : Clodius : As our poor slandered hill has lived in peace With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition , it will scarce begin So wild a life within our time . Glaucus : Glaucus : Perhaps  --  ( Nydia advances , and touches him ) Well , maiden ? Nydia : Nydia : ' T is the voice of Glaucus ! Glaucus : Glaucus : Aye . Nydia : Nydia : Then a new heaven is spread above my head ; And stronger gods , and gods more merciful , Rule o'er the world . My lord , when came you here ? Glaucus : Glaucus : Two days ago . Nydia : Nydia : And I not know of it !  --  Not feel it in my heart ! But then  --  ah me !  --  I was in prison . Glaucus : Glaucus : How ! Nydia : Nydia : But others hear . ( Glaucus motions to Clodius and others , who retire ) Glaucus : Glaucus : We are alone . In prison ? Nydia : Nydia : Worse , far worse ; If hell be worse than prison . Dare I speak ? Repeat one word I say , and worse than death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ! ( Laughing ) As though I 'd not be ready for my death , When Glaucus could betray me . I have been Shut in Arbaces ' house . Glaucus : Glaucus : Poor child ! Nydia : Nydia : Fie , Glaucus ! There may be dust upon me , but no stain . Glaucus : Glaucus : Thanks , Pallas ! Nydia : Nydia : Let me kiss your hand for that . ( Kisses his hand ) I 'd not be here , to tell you of my fall , If that great bay could rock my shame to sleep . That refuge is mine always . Glaucus : Glaucus : Were you there Against your will ? Nydia : Nydia : My will ! What is my will ? What is a slave 's will but obedience ? Why , I was beaten there ; dragged there in bonds ; With ever that gross threat held over me , To make me something nameless , if I dared Avoid my fate . Once there , I sang ,  --  such songs , So outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , Glaucus ? Glaucus : Glaucus : Yea , in heaven . Nydia : Nydia : Then you can understand . I thank the gods That I am blind sometimes : I could not see ; But all my other senses were appalled At the infernal orgies that went on ,  --  The roars of drunken laughter , and the shrieks Of frantic women ; and the rites obscene Offered to Isis , sick with burning blood , And torturing blows , and howls of anguish . Glaucus : Glaucus : You ? What part was yours ? Nydia : Nydia : I only sang , and sang , Perched above all , secure but terrified , Like a poor linnet in a thunderstorm . Glaucus : Glaucus : This is the outcome of Arbaces ' zeal For Isis then ? Nydia : Nydia : Name not that dreadful man : It holds me spellbound . Glaucus : Glaucus : Go not there again ; I shall devise a plan for your release . Nydia : Nydia : If that were possible . All things are so To a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cudgel for an empty purse . Here is a bunch of violets , my lord : ' T is the Athenian flower . I gathered them , And many roses , on Veseveus . ' T is late for them ; and when those flowers grow late , Disaster follows , as the old saw says : When the violet blooms late , Then beware the hand of Fate . When the roses also blow , Then beware a greater woe . Glaucus : Glaucus : But we have had our sorrows . One may see The earthquake 's ravages on every hand , In prostrate walls . Even in my solid house , The statues were cast down , the frescoes cracked , And conduits dried . Nydia : Nydia : Oh ! it was droll indeed , To feel the pavement slide beneath one 's feet , The columns turning , as if they would dance A measure to the thunders under ground  --  Hell 's music  --  louder than a thousand cars Rolling at speed along a stony road . It made me laugh . Glaucus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , laugh . The miserable have nought to dread , like those Who love their lives , and therefore shriek with fear At peril to their comfort . Glaucus : Glaucus : Know you , child , What is the Greek name for this flower ? Nydia : Nydia : For what ? Glaucus : Glaucus : The violet . Nydia : Nydia : Oh yes ; ion ' t is called In my Thessalian land . Glaucus : Glaucus : Thence comes Ione . Know you a lady of that name ? Nydia : Nydia : You mean , The rich Greek damsel of Neapolis . Yes ; she has often taken flowers from me . Glaucus : Glaucus : Bear all these violets to her . Nydia : Nydia : From you ? Glaucus : Glaucus : Yes . Nydia : Nydia : I would rather cast them in the sea , A sacrifice to Neptune . Glaucus : Glaucus : But my days Of voyaging are over for a space . Take her the flowers . Nydia : Nydia : I shall obey , my lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glaucus : Nydia ? Nydia : Nydia : You  --  forget my pay : Remember Burbo 's stick . Glaucus : Glaucus : The gods forbid ! ( Gives her money ) Nydia : Nydia : Glaucus  --  Glaucus : Glaucus : My child ? Nydia : Nydia : Another time  --  farewell ! ( Exit hurriedly ) Clodius : Clodius : What ails that girl ? Glaucus : Glaucus : Her nature . She rebels Against her life of servitude . She dreams Of something better in the gift of fate Than Burbo 's mercy . Hapless , helpless child ! Think you the brute would sell her ? Clodius : Clodius : Without doubt . A sightless slave is but poor property .  --  Look , Glaucus , look ! Glaucus : Glaucus : I saw , before you spoke , And felt with all my senses . Clodius : Clodius : Venus speed you ! ( Retires ) Enter Ione , attended . Glaucus meets her Footnote : 1Kb Glaucus : Glaucus : Ione ! Ione : Ione : Glaucus ! Glaucus : Glaucus : Is there more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes ? Oh , but to look on you , to feel you near , To know the same world holds us both , to breathe The air that warms itself against your cheek ; To crown that rapture with the dizzy thought Of what to each the other is ; of how The coming days  --  happy and brief enough  --  Will bring us closer ; till possession crown Our foreheads with one glory ; that is joy To make a man impatient of the thought Of Jove 's elysium , in a world so fair ! Ione : Ione : I tremble at your raptures . Recollect , Your idol is but clay , like all the rest : Like all the rest , to clay she must return . I trust the fact of my mortality May not be made too obvious to you , By any failings of my nature , ere My sepulchre is open , to receive My faults and me together . Glaucus : Glaucus : Dear , Ione , What is this cloud upon your spirit ? Look , How fair the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ! Ione : Ione : Too fair , perhaps , To be enduring : night must follow day . Since I arose  --  I can not tell you why  --  A weight , that seems like a foreshadowed ill , Has lain upon my spirit . For relief , Thus early to the temple of our goddess , Pallas , I went with votive offerings . Alas ! the pure divinity 's white shrine , And every omen of my sacrifice , Seemed but to bring me nearer to the truth Of my foreboding , that for me  --  for us  --  There hangs above us , in yon lucid heaven , Disaster terrible , and soon to fall . Glaucus : Glaucus : My lovely soothsayer , you must have heard Arbaces ' oracles . Ione : Ione : Arbaces ! Glaucus : Glaucus : Nay ; Why do you tremble , love ? Ione : Ione : I know not why . His name went through me like a pang ; and brought The cloud upon me , darker than before . My faithful guardian , father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own father 's solemn testament , To represent him in all things to me ! And well has he fulfilled the trust . Indeed Fancy betrays me . I am weak enough  --  Almost enough  --  for your contempt . Glaucus : Glaucus : For mine ! Ione , when you know less reverence From me than I accord the sacred gods , Then I shall not be Glaucus , and your heart May hold me as a stranger . Ione : Ione : See , ' t is gone ! Your sunny eyes have scattered every cloud , Henceforth you shall not see these gloomy moods In her whose duty ' t is to make your life As bright as that which you bestow on me . Glaucus : Glaucus : My darling , be yourself , and only that , To be my happiness . I am content , Henceforth , to call all virtues upon earth Ione only . Nydia screams within Ione : Ione : Glaucus !  --  Enter Nydia running , pursued by Burbo , Nydon and gladiators Nydia : Nydia : Glaucus !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burbo : Slave , I 'll teach you to obey when I command !

Or you 'll not thank me much for catching you . 1st Glad : 1st Glad : Go take her , Burbo : she 's your slave . Burbo : Burbo : Not I. He has an arm like Vulcan 's . Glaucus : Glaucus : Are you , men Or but a pack of savage wolves , to run This poor doe to her death ? Have courage , child ! I know no scorn with which to brand the wretch Who lifts his hand against his mother 's sex . You , Nydon ? I thought better of you . Nydon : Nydon : No ; I ran to save her . I am slow of foot : My business is to stand . Had he but struck her , I 'd made his head acquainted with the stones . Glaucus : Glaucus : What means all this ? Burbo : Burbo : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nydon : Nydon : Yes , she 's everything But bad , as you would make her . Ione : Ione : Glaucus , pray , Buy the poor girl . Nydia : Nydia : Whose voice is that ?

Burbo : Burbo : I do not want you . Take her if you will , My lord ; her temper is too much for me . Twenty poor aureas . That 's but half her worth . She sings and dances  --  when she has a mind to  --  Knows all about her plants and flowers ; can run  --  Phew !  --  you saw how . She has a little fault : She 's somewhat blind . Glaucus writes on his tablets Nydon : Nydon : Somewhat , you thief ! stone blind . Glaucus : Glaucus : Take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay her price . ( Gives tablets to Burbo . Exit Burbo ) Nydia : Nydia : Then I am yours ? Glaucus : Glaucus : Yes , mine . Nydia : Nydia : Hear , people of Pompeii , hear ! I am The slave of Glaucus  --  Yea , his very slave  --  And should he beat me , let no one prevent ; For then I shall deserve it . Ione : Ione : Nydia !  --  Glaucus : Glaucus : This would be droll , were it not pitiful : Enter Arbaces behind , observing them She has known nought but scourgings . Nydia , It is not fit that you should be my slave . My dear Ione , take the girl from me . Ione : Ione : Most willingly . Nydia : Nydia : His " dear Ione ! " No ! I 'll go where I belong .

Nydia : Nydia : Doubtless ; I am a damsel . Mistress , come . I shall be faithful , if no more . Arbaces : Arbaces : ( Advancing ) Ione , What means this comedy , and in the streets  --  The public streets ? Ione : Ione : I thank the gracious gods , Beneath the open eye of heaven !

This I call usurpation , patent wrong . Arbaces : Arbaces : Inborn republican ! Can not your wealth Purchase your own opinions ? You are mad , To talk rebellion in the public ear . Glaucus : Glaucus : Your former ward  --  fresh from a sacrifice At Pallas ' shrine  --  performs a duty meet , To one oppressed by fortune and by man  --  What if in public , if the deed were right ?  --  And you in public , like a pedagogue , Rebuke her !

Nydia : Nydia : I wonder often what it is to see . What is it you call light ? and how do you Know of a thing when ' t is so far away ! And what is beauty ? Ione : Ione : You bewilder me .

It is the common tattle of the town That Glaucus , an Athenian fop , a man  --  Ione : Ione : Beware !

Ione : Ione : Give it me . My father 's wishes are supreme commands , Within the bounds of reason . Arbaces : Arbaces : Saving clause !

Calenus : Calenus : By Jove , the child is bright ! She can see more , With her blind eyes , than that dumb Aedile could , And all his people .

Now , how think you , would it pay My friend , who is so poor  --  so very poor  --  Would it pay him  --  just as poor Glaucus seems Caught in the net  --  to rise in open court , And make his innocence as clear as day ? How would it pay , my girl ? Nydia : Nydia : In millions , man  --  Talent on talent . Nay , ' t would pay as well To do all that before the trial . Calenus : Calenus : Hm !

Calenus : Calenus : And you ? Arbaces : Arbaces : I lost my stylus in the crowd , And came to seek it . Calenus : Calenus : Ah ? I picked it up , And hid it in the temple . That ' s to say , One half of it . The point must yet remain Wedged in the body . Glaucus broke it off , When he withdrew it , I suppose . Arbaces : Arbaces : How so ? Then that was Glaucus ' stylus . Calenus : Calenus : Yes , perhaps , With your cartouche engraved upon the knob :  --  That is quite likely ! Arbaces : Arbaces : Man , what mean you ?

What she is aiming at , I do not know ; But since she does it , it must be all right  --  At least for me , who would front burning Hades , If she but crooked her finger . What was that ?

I heard him mutter , as he issued forth , And locked and barred the heavy iron doors : " There blab my secret to the granite walls , Till famine make your tongue too thick to talk . " And then he laughed ,  --  oh , horror ! what a laugh ! Hell must have gaped to hear it ! Nydon : Nydon : Nydia , What means all this ? Why are you so concerned About Calenus ? Nydia : Nydia : Simple Nydon ! Say , Can you not trust me ? lend me all your might When I have need of you ? Nydon : Nydon : You know .

Nydon : Nydon : But , Nydia , I believe You love this Glaucus . Nydia : Nydia : Ha ! ha ! ha ! why , yes , As an owl loves the moon above her head , She sings to so , so sweetly !

The back of Scene a Doric Colonnade , through and above which the adjacent city and country are seen . Mount Vesuvius in the distance , to the right of centre of stage .

Enter from the Basilica , Clodius , Sallust and other Noblemen Clodius : Clodius : I know the man . I tell you , gentlemen , He is incapable of such an act . 1st Noble : 1st Noble : But the Egyptian ' s oath was so direct : He heard the quarrel , saw the blow struck . Clodius : Clodius : True : But then the motive ? In the name of sense , Tell me why Glaucus killed Apaecides ?  --  His bosom friend , the brother of the maid To whom he was contracted ! 2d Noble : 2d Noble : It was done In hot blood , haply , as Arbaces said . Had Glaucus supped abroad ? Sallust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with Apaecides , his freedman swore , Discussing Plato . Clodius : Clodius : Is there aught in Plato To lead a man to murder ? It was shown That this Arbaces had pretext enough To hate both Glaucus and Apaecides . And yet the lying wizard one time said  --  You heard him , Sallust ?  --  Sallust : Sallust : Yes ; beside the corpse . Clodius : Clodius : He said that Glaucus was his friend . Could hate Go further than the countenance he wore At mention of Ione ' s name ? 2d Noble : 2d Noble : That ' s true . Clodius : Clodius : Distrust that black Egyptian . It would not Amaze me , if one day it should be shown Arbaces struck the blow ; and therefore saw it , As you may deem , quite readily . All : All : O Clodius !  --  1st Noble : 1st Noble : That ' s more improbable than your belief In Glaucus ' innocence . Sallust : Sallust : Now silence . Hark ! Here is the Nuntius . Clodius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steps of the Basilica , the Nuntius . He reads Nuntius : Nuntius : In the name of the Senate and the Roman People , hear ! Glaucus of Athens found to be guilty of the crimes of sacrilege and murder , in causing , by a blow of his stylus , the death of Apaecides , a Roman citizen and Priest of Isis , is adjudged to death , in the manner as follows : He shall be taken hence , today and , armed with a stylus , shall oppose a lion in the arena . All good citizens lend aid to carry out the sentence of the law . ( Exit ) The people cheer Clodius : Clodius : The bloody knaves ! For all the law ' s decree , I think him guiltless . Sallust : Sallust : What does that avail ? Could we appeal to Titus ? Clodius : Clodius : There ' s no time . Sallust : Sallust : I know the Emperor loves Glaucus well . And oft has entertained him privately . When will the sentence be enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant  --  while the games proceed . That noble gentleman to fill a place With gladiators in their beastly sports ! Why , man , they teach us murder as an art . My heart is sick , good Sallust . Sallust : Sallust : See , they come . Enter from the Basilica in solemn procession , the Praetor , Quaestor , Nuntius and Soldiers . Then Glaucus , in custody of Lictors , with the edges of their axes turned towards him , followed by Soldiers , et cetera . As Glaucus reaches the centre of the stage , enter Ione , attended . Enter Arbaces from the Basilica Ione : Ione : My Glaucus !  --  ( Falls on his bosom ) ( Lictors are about to interfere ) Praetor : Praetor : Nay ; permit it .

Do not tell my ear What my heart knows so clearly , that your hands  --  O let me kiss them  --  are as free from blood As these I lift in blessings o'er your head . Glaucus : Glaucus : I can not blame your coming now , brave girl . Now I have heart to face the lion ' s teeth : Perhaps to conquer him ; or dying , dear , This memory of your loving heart will cheer My mangled body , give me strength to die , And hope beyond the grave for both of us .

Surely the Praetor has a kindly heart ; And that will whisper what the truth must be . Glaucus : Glaucus : It were in vain , Ione . I stand here Judged for my seeming crime , not his . No shade must settle on your virgin name Cast by my history . Ione : Ione : What will be my name After today ? and how long will it last , A prey to malice , after you are gone ? Think you I will not follow where you lead  --  Oh ! yes , so briskly and so cheerfully ? Apaecides , and Glaucus , and Ione , Will make but one extended funeral-train .

Hope we there shall meet , And , for that hope , bear all . Ione : Ione : It must be so ; We must meet somewhere , Glaucus  --  somewhere , dear ; For love must be immortal .

Arbaces advances curiously , not perceiving Calenus Nydia : Nydia : Saved , saved ! Where is he ? I am dazed and faint . O lead me to him ! ( Nydon leads her to Glaucus ) And is this my lord  --  Alive , unharmed ? ( She kisses his garments ) Glaucus : Glaucus : Yes , Nydia . Arbaces : Arbaces : Is she mad ? I pray you , Praetor  --  Nydia : Nydia : That ' s Arbaces too . ( She bursts into a wild laugh ) Seize the Egyptian ! I denounce the man As murderer of Apaecides .

Calenus : Calenus : I am Calenus , Priest of Isis , Praetor . Imprisoned , starved , made desperate ; in a night , Made to endure an age of agony , By yonder man ; because , my lord , I saw  --  As I now swear by all the sacred gods  --  Arbaces murder young Apaecides ! Praetor : Praetor : Saw it ? Calenus : Calenus : Yes , saw it . Arbaces : Arbaces : A detected thief , Caught breaking in my treasury . Praetor : Praetor : Forbear ! You may speak later .

Why then hesitate To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole tenor of my trial showed  --  How far more probable ? Pray pardon me : But I was trained up in our law , and stand Here without other advocate , to speak A word in my behalf . Praetor : Praetor : Glaucus , my heart Leans too much towards you : I distrust myself . Glaucus : Glaucus : I have no more to say . I leave my cause With you and justice . Yet , one moment , hear . Do not suppose I shrink from death . Not death , But shame appals me , and the breaking heart Of my betrothed , who should not suffer thus If I am guiltless . Men of Pompeii , Have I not lived unspotted in your sight These many years ? When did a poor man come To Glaucus ' door , to go away unheard , Unsuccored , though his worth no more could plead Than simple poverty ? Men such as he , ( Pointing to Arbaces ) Called me a fool , a spendthrift ; said I threw My fortune thus , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Gave me a name of which my soul is proud  --  A name I hope to hear before the gods  --  You called me : Glaucus of the open hand .

The crowd is about to rush on Arbaces Arbaces : Arbaces : Back , you vulgar curs ! Behold , Isis protects her son ! The scene suddenly becomes very dark . The roar of the earthquake is heard , and the crash of falling buildings . Smoke and fire burst from Vesuvius . Fire , stones and ashes fall upon the stage . The people flee in every direction . Glaucus supports Ione , who , with Nydia and one Sentinel , calmly pacing before the Basilica , remain Glaucus : Glaucus : Ione , dear , Look up ! We have no time to lose . Alas ! She has not strength to move . O Nydia . What is to do ? ' T is certain death to wait . Ah ! she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : But what has happened , Glaucus ?
