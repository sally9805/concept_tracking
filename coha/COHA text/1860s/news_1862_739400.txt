txt The above dispatch from Gen. fIALLKOH , of the capture of Fayetteville , sets at rest the false report promulgated by ALBERT Paz , that he and Paws had defeated Gen. CURTIS on his entrance with his column into Arkansas , Fayetteville is nearly thirty miles south of that part of Sugar Creek where PMI 's great victory was said to have been achieved , and , if victory it was for him , be and his followers seem to have fled from it with amazing anted . Fayetteville is a post-village of Arkansas , the capital of Washington County , in the northwestern corner of the State , and bordering on the Indian Territory , and is a place of about 750 inhabitants . It is situated on the northwest side of Upper White River , about 200 miles northwest of Little Rock , the capital of the State . It contains the usual county buildings , a United States Land Office , several churches , &c.,; and is a place of some Indian trade . It is a wild border town , in a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Boston Mountain westerly . It is hardly likely that Gen. CURTIS will chase the scattered and routed Missouri rebels any further , unless , indeed , he push down to Fort Smith , on the Arkansas River , where the rebels raised by Dm ( Mat Cum , ocu are stationed , and otter them battle . There is a road from Fayetteville almost direct to Fork Smith ; the distance is only about fifty miles . Fort Smith is a good point for supplies , which Fayetteville is not ; and the possession of the fort would not only give us control of the Indian . Territory , but would give us military control of the greater part of Arkansas . This march of Gen. Cents , force from Rolla , Mo. , to Fayetteville , Ark. , is altogether the most remarkable achievement , in this line , since the war began ! but nothing , not even the hills , the wild desolation , and thesavages of the Southwestern border , can stop the onward march of our gallant Western troops .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
