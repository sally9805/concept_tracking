The story of " Dick Whittington and his Cat " has so often amused the little ones , who never wearied of its repetition , that the author of the following version thought she might extend the pleasure derived from it by putting it in language which they could read for themselves . No word contains more than four letters , and none is over one syllable in length , so that any child who has the least knowledge of reading will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIS CAT . PART I. Once on a time , a poor boy was seen to go up and down the side-walk of a town , and sob and cry . At last he sat down on a door-step . He was too weak to run more . He had had no food all the day . It was a day in June . The air was mild . The warm sun sent down its rays of love on all . But poor Dick had no joy on this fair day . He laid his head down on the step , and took a nap ; for he was sick and weak for want of food . As he lay , a girl came to the door . She saw the poor boy lie on the step ; but he did not see her . She went in , and said to a man who was in the room , " A poor boy has lain down on our step to take a nap . " The man came to the door to see the boy . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen a comb all day ; his face and feet are full of dirt ; and his coat is torn . " The man did not like such a mean boy to be at his door . But when he saw the lad 's thin , pale face , as he lay at his feet , he felt sad for him . Just then the boy woke up . He went to run off when he saw the man and girl at the door , but they made him stay . " Why did you lie down here ? " the man said to the boy . " I was weak and sick . " " Have you had no food to eat ? " " I have had no food all day . " Then the girl went in and got him a roll and a mug of milk . The boy ate so fast and so much that they had to wait till he was done , to talk to him more . " Have you no pa nor ma ? " said the man . A tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I have no pa , and my ma they took from me , and I can not find her . She was sick a long time . I used to sit at her side and lay my head on her knee . Once she said to me that my pa had gone home to God , and that she must go too . Then she got too sick to rise from her bed . One day they put me on the bed by her side . She laid her hand on my head , and she said , " I pray Thee , O God , take care of my poor boy . " " Then she shut her eyes and grew so pale , and her hand got so cold , it made me cry . But she did not move , nor turn her eyes on me . They took me off the bed and sent me out to play . But I sat down at the door and wept for my ma . " The next day I saw them lay her in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run up and down all day to find her . Do you know what they have done with my ma ? Oh ! tell me , if you can . " Then the poor lad wept so hard that the man and the girl felt sad for him . " How old are you , my boy ? " said the man . " I was six last May . " " What is your name ? " " Dick . " " Well , Dick , " said this good man , " you may come in here , if you like , and stay till you can find your ma . I will give you food to eat , and you can help me to work . When your ma does come for you , you may go home with her . " Illustration PART II . Illustration Dick soon made up his mind to live with this kind , good man . The man was not rich . He had to work hard , and Dick was made to work too . But he did not mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave him a box on the ear when he did not do as she bid him . She did not let him sit down to eat till she had done , and all that she gave him was the bits that she had left . She made him a bed of a pile of old rags , at one end of the loft . Dick had no one now to show him how to be good , and he soon got to be a bad boy . He told lies , and when no eye was on him , he took what was not his . He did not know God saw him . He used a bad word now and then , and did not work so well as once he did . The man who took Dick to live with him was sad to see him such a bad boy , and did not know what to do with him . Dick had now no joy in life , for no bad boy can be gay and glad . But he did not like to feel that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was the way he had to live that made him bad . Illustration PART III . Illustration Poor Dick had now no one to love him but a cat . One day , when he was out at play , he saw some boys pelt a cat to kill her . He did not like to have them kill the cat , so he ran to her , took her up in his arms , and took her home . The girl let him keep the cat , for she kept off all the rats and mice . She was a gray cat . She had fine soft fur , and a long tail . When Dick had done his tea , he took puss on his knee to pat her on the head , and talk to her , as if she knew all that he said to her . She then did rub her head on his arm , and purr , and lie down on his knee and take a nap . She had her bed on his heap of rags . Once when Dick had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He said to puss , " No one is kind to me but you , puss ; no one has love for me . I will run off . I will not stay . " Dick did not shut his eyes , but when it was yet dark , he got up , and went out of his room , down to the door . He put his hand on the key and gave it a turn . He felt the cold air on his face when he went out . But he ran on fast , till he was so weak , he had to stop . Just then a big bell near him rang out loud on the air to say that day had come once more . It made Dick turn his eyes to see this bell , and as it rang , he felt it say to him , " Turn back , Dick !  - -  Turn back , Dick !  - -  Turn back , Dick ! " Dick did not move . He did not know what to do . His eyes were on the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  - -  Turn back , Dick ! Turn back , Dick ! " It put him in mind of the time when his ma had laid her hand on his head ere she went to God , and said , " O God , take care of my poor boy ! " It put him in mind what a bad boy he had been , and how he had made his life a hard one by his ill ways . He made up his mind to go back . But then he said , " If they find out I have run off , they will beat me . " This fear made him run so fast , that he got home and back to his heap of rags ere the man and the girl were up . As Dick lay on his bed , he made up his mind to be a good boy . He knew his ma used to pray to God to make him good , so he bent his own knee to pray , and said , " O God , make Dick a good boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Dick ! Dick ! get up ! It is day ! " So Dick soon went down and was so kind and good , they did not know what to make of it . But Dick went on day by day , and soon he saw that when he was kind and good , they were kind and true to him . It was hard work for Dick to give up all his bad ways . But each morn and eve he went to God , to ask Him for help , and he did not ask in vain . By-and-by the girl let him sit with her . She made him a good bed . Miss Puss yet kept her seat on his knee , when he sat down to rest , and all was love and joy . Illustration PART IV . Illustration One day a man , by the name of Jack , came to see them . He was to go on the sea in a big ship , to a far off land . He had come to say good-bye . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sail to , is a far off land , and the men who live in it are not like us , and do not know our ways . They do not eat or wear what we do . Now what you give me I will take with me , and sell it for you , and when I come back I will pay you what I get for it . It may be that I will get much gold for it ; for the men in that far off land like what is made here , more than what they have at home . " So the man and the girl were glad , and gave him much to sell for them . Poor Dick sat , with his cat on his knee ; a tear was in his eye , for he too felt the wish to have some gold . The man saw him look sad , and said , " Well , Dick , my son , and what will you send ? " Dick wept . " I have but my cat , " said Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " it may be she will sell for more than all the rest . " They all had much fun at this , and Dick had to join in . He took puss up in his arms . He gave her a kiss and a pat on her head . He felt her soft fur . It was hard for him to part with her , for she had been his pet for a long time . But at last he set her down . He got a big bag . He put puss in it . She did not like to be thus shut up , but Dick tied her in . So the man took the bag in his arms , and went to his ship . When he got to the ship , he let the cat out of the bag . She was glad to be free once more , and ran to find Dick . But poor Dick was at home , sad ; for he knew that he had seen his puss for the last time . The ship was full of rats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them fly , and soon no more rats and mice were to be seen in the ship . The men were glad to have the cat , and gave her food and milk , so that she was well off . PART V. Illustration The ship went on her way . It was more than a year when they got to that far off land . The man who took the cat , had , as was said , the name of Jack . He left the ship when he got to the land , and went to see the king . The king was glad to see Jack , and told him , he must stay and dine with him . When they went to the room to dine , they saw that rats and mice were in it too , and had eat much of the food . They saw the rats and mice jump down and run when they went in the room . The king was in a rage , that he had lost his meal . Jack said to him , " Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know how to help it , " said the king . " I will give a pile of gold to one who will rid me of them . " Then Jack was glad . He said to the king , " If you will give me a pile of gold , I will rid you of the rats and mice . " The king said , " You are in fun . You do not know how to get rid of them . " Jack said , " We will see . " So the next day , he put the cat in a bag , and went with the bag in his arm to the king . Puss did not like to be shut up in the bag , and made much fuss . The king was glad to see Jack , and said , " Let me see what you have in your bag . " But Jack said , " Not just yet ; wait till we see the rats and mice . " So they went to the room to dine . The rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Jack took the cord off the bag , and took out the cat . The king did not know what a cat was ; for he had no cats in his land . Jack held her in his arms till she had lost her fear , and then set her down with the rats and mice . She soon made them know what a cat was , and put them in such fear that they all fled . The king was so glad that he did not know what to do . They sat down to dine . Not a rat came out of its hole . The king ate his meal with joy , and puss sat on his knee and fed out of his dish . The king told Jack he must let him keep the cat . Jack said , " I will give her to you , but you must give me the pile of gold . " The king was glad to keep the cat and pay the gold . So Jack put the gold in the bag that had held the cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by , ere Jack and his ship came back to port . He soon went to see Dick , with the bag of gold . The man and the girl were both glad to find that Jack had sold what they gave him , and that he had got a good deal for them . But when Jack told them of the cat , and took out the bag of gold , they did not know what to say . And when poor Dick was told that it was all for him , he had to cry for joy , and all the rest wept with him , for they were all fond of Dick now , he had come to be such a good boy . " Well , Dick , " said Jack , " what will you do with all this gold ? Let us see what will be best . " So they all said much , and sat up till it was late , to talk of Dick and his pile of gold . At last Dick said , " I will give some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and kind to me . I will take part of the rest and lay it out upon my mind , that I may be wise when I grow to be a man . And what is left I will lay up , so that when I am a man , I will have it to work with , that I may grow to be rich ; for to be good , and wise , and rich , is what I wish . " They all said Dick knew what was best . So that is what was done with the pile of gold that the king gave for the cat .
