ARTICLE 11. - SYSTEMATIC TRAINING FOR THE MINISTRY . WHEN the late war with the Southern rebels broke out , there was a prevailing impression that it was only requisite to collect a host of men , put muskets in their hands , and hurry them into the field , and the rebellion would be speedily quelled . Persons who knew nothing of the military art were thought to be quite competent to head these untrained levies . In fact , study and experience in the grave business on which they were entering was thought by some to be rather a disadvantage than a qualification in those aspiring to command . Martial ardor must not be damped by the rules and traditional prejudices which were supposed to have sway in the military class . The bitter disgrace of Bull Run did something to open the eyes of men to the folly of such views . Yet one sapient editor , having sat for a day or two on the penitent 's stool for his share in occasioning this mortifying rout , quickly fell from grace and signalized himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible war , for the abolishing of the West Point Military Academy ! Military training was so dire an evil , that the nation 's great training-school of officers must be swept out of being , at the moment when skillful leaders were required for the salvation of the country ! And the individual who raised this foolish cry was one who deemed himself competent to handle any subject , from the cultivation of a potato patch to the Trent case-though in his discussion of the latter question he did twice mention Lord Stowell and Sir William Scott as if they were two distinct persons ! The nation learned by experience that although a trained general might be a poor onewitness McClellan  --  and a general trained elsewhere than in the regular schools might be a good one-witness Terry-yet the just presumption is not only that the officer who has received a military education is far superior to the novice , but also that the regular , prescribed course of education is likely to furnish the best leaders . Nobody laments that the management // of the war , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Sheridan , and Thomas , was not committed to Banks and Butler . To say nothing ot common sense , the experience of the world ought to have saved our people from the costly error into which they fell . " One of the most certain lessons of all military history , " says Arnold in his Lectures on Modern History , " although some writers have neglected , and some have even disputed it , is the superiority of discipline to enthusiasm . Much serious mischief has been done by an ignorance or disbelief of this truth . " " While not even the most military nations can become good soldiers without discipline , yet with discipline the most unmilitary can be made efficient . " Now there is much to be learned from our late national experience . One great lesson is , that , generally speaking , training , discipline , special study , are indispensable to effective work in every department of action . Not all are fit for all things . Examples are found of individuals who have succeeded in coinplex and difficult professions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training through the established methods and instrumentalities . But it is fallacious to reason from exceptional cases . Because Dr. Franklin , when a boy , ran away , and afterwards stood before kings , it does not follow that fugitive lads are likely to attain the same distinction , as many who have imitated his example have ascertained to their cost . Rare natural gifts may now and then enable individuals to do what the generality of mankind in the same circumstances would be unable to effect . And where distinguished success is reached , apparently without the slow steps of preparatory discipline and study , it is often possible to see that a much higher and more beneficent success would have been attained , had thorough training been superadded to uncommon natural powers . The general truth set forth in the preceding remarks , we propose to apply to the particular topic of preparation for the Gospel ministry . There is apt to be , even in enlightened communities , more or less of prejudice-prejudice which is sometimes latent-against the regular , systematic training of candidates for the pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconception and fallacious reasoning , and has // often been exposed . But some considerations bearing on the subject may be profitably advanced at the present time . A minister is called to interpret the Bible and apply the truths of Christianity , in public discourses and more private instructioi* , to all classes of men . It is plain that he should be better acquainted with the Bible than the generality of those whom he undertakes to guide . He must be able to study , and must have already studied , the Book in the tongues in which it was written , with the aid of the various lights which critical investigations have provided for the learner . Without this qualification he is but an ignorant expositor of the sacred volume , perpetually at a loss to determine the meaning of its authors , unless indeed he is blessed with sufficient conceit to fancy that he can do by intuition that which patient study alone can accomplish . But besides practice in exegesis and familiarity with the laws of interpretation , the minister must have attained to a systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become possessed of a definite , coherent idea of the message which he assumes to deliver . In what a hapless plight is the preacher placed who has no connected , consistent interpretation of Christianity , to underlie and regulate his teachings ! He is to charge upon men their sinfulness , but he can not tell what sin is ; he is to summon them to repentance , but knows not what repentance involves ; he is to direct them to believe in Christ , in order to be saved , but can not answer the inquiry what " salvation " and what " believing in Christ " mean ; he is to proclaim the Deliverer , but is at a loss to say what He has done or offers to do for mankind . He is , moreover , to solve difficulties , unravel perplexities , answer objections to the Christian system or to the evidences on which it depends , and to set forth the Gospel in a clear light before auditors , many of whom read and think on these high themes . It is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is here briefly sketched , if he has not gained a scientific apprehension of the Gospel system . The study of doctrinal theology , as a distinct branch , is then indispensable  --  the study of Christianity with a special aim at the accurate definition and harmonious combination of its doctrines . // But the minister is to be a minister of . the C*hurch . He is to labor in the Kingdom of God , tke Divine State . And shall he know nothing of the history of that great spiritual Commonwealth , of its establishment , the divine protection and guidance which have attended its progress , of the development of Christian thought , and the phases of Christian life which have appeared in the series of ages intervening between the founding of the Church and the present ? Shall History be acknowledged by all thinking men to be the true " Inagistra vit* , " and the preacher of Christianity alone be ignorant even of the history of the divinely established Community in which he is an officer ? It is sufficient , some say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a public man who imagined *himself qualified for managing the country , with no other knowledge than he can derive from the Constitution , shutting his eyes to the earlier and later history of the Republic ? He passes by the discussions of Marshall , and Story , and Webster ; he knows nothing of the first planting of the country , of the races by which it was peopled , of the struggle of the Revolution , or of the annals of the government since . It is enough , in his opinion , that he has the Constitution . Would not every one answer that he can understand the Constitution a great deal better , if he will investigate the origin of the government , the views of the statesmen who have administered it and expounded its character , and especially if he will trace the actual workings of the Constitution , and follow the course and the growth of the Republic , of which it is the organic law ? Of like value to the minister , is the thorough study of the introduction and propagation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Church institutions and the mutations of polity , of the history of the profoundly interesting movement of the Christian mind of which theology was the product , and of the healthy forms and the mischievous corruptions of Christian life and worship . But the preacher is to preach ; and lie is to be the pastor of the flock . The sound principles of rhetoric must be brought to his attention , and all meretricious and ineffective characteristics of style he must be taught to shun . The study of the structure of a discourse , and of the sermon as a particular form of discourse , can not be superfluous to one who is to compose ser // mons all his life . And the young may profitably listen to suggestions relative to pastoral duty , such as experience has sug2 gested and common sense approves . We have given a bare outline of a theological curriculum . To argue at length in favor of the utility of such a course of study is hardly needful for any who are not insensible to the value of knowledge . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disesteem of theological training , and upon some of these we will briefly comment . It is thought sometimes that much study and learning impair the practical efficiency of a preacher . But experience proves the contrary . The most powerful preacher among the Apostles was he who had the most learning , and signs of whose peculiar type of culture appear on every page of his writings . The pulpit orator in the ancient church , who knew how to bring out the sense of the Scriptures in a way at once to instruct and move great anditories , was the educated and learned Chrysostom . Augustine was a trained grammarian and rhetorician , a student of the Latin orators and philosophers ; at the same time that some of the leading defect8 in his theology are to be attributed to his ignorance of Hebrew and very imperfect acquaintance with the Greek . The greatest preacher of the middle ages , Bernard of Clairvaux , owed his power largely to his long continued , earnest study of the Scriptures . When we come down to the period of the Reformers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther had been an ardent and industrious student of theology . Augustine taught him evangelical truth and Occam sharpened his wits . Without his long training in theology , he would have been entirely incompetent to head the great movement . How would he have appeared in disputation with Eck and other Papal champions ? He found out from Jerome that the so-called apocryphal books of the Old Testament were not in the Hebrew canon ; and this is only a specimen of the numerous discoveries for which he was indebted to the early Fathers of the Church . But the point is , that with his discipline in theological study and his knowledge of theological writings , and partly by means of these advantages , he was able to stand before the people and declare the true doctrine with vastly augmented power . No preachers in // recent times have been more influential than John Wesley and his early associate Whitefleld . Both were bred at the university . Wesley had studied the Greek Fathers , as well as leading writers in English theology . He recommended to his clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatise , which might give them good thoughts and at the same time keep their scholarship from growing rusty . His learning ' did not hinder him from being a zealous , moving , and b highly successful preacher , and a preacher of this character to the poor . It were easy to multiply examples . The notion that intellectual cultivation is a disadvantage to a preacher who would have power with the people , is ill founded and is fully refuted by experience . The Church has suffered from the dullness and ignorance of her clergy , not from their excess of knowledge . Every real advance in the means of culture open to the clergy has been followed by a marked increase of their efficiency and their usefhlness . Such was the result of Augustine 's experiment of associating his clergy in a dwelling together , for study and mutual improvement . A like consequence ensued when Chrodegang , the Archbishop of IMIetz , a Prelate of the eighth century , following the example of Augustine and adopting the rule of Benedict , brought together his clergy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is the body of the clergy who daily , among other exercises , studied together a chapter of the Bible , and met for mutual edification-soon evinced , wherever the system was adopted , their superiority to the clergy who were deprived of this means of training . Sad abuses and corruptions afterwards came in ; but such evils were owing to enforced celibacy and various other causes , and they prove nothing against the usefulness of systematical training for the ministry . - While we are speaking of the past , we are reminded of a frequent mistake respecting the influence of theology and theological discussions . It is often said that such discussions are barren of any useful result . Wrangling upon sacred themes , or the cultivation of theology according to a narrow method , where the enriching influence of scriptural and historical study is wanting , is doubtless attended with serious evils . Yet even this controversial temper may be better than a stagnant condition of the intellect , when no living interest is felt in re // 206 April , ligious enquiries . Scholasticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by striking faults ; yet that intellectual movement was on the whole productive of great good . The dawn of scholasticism brought to an end the gloomy period between the breaking up of the empire of Charlemagne and the epoch of llildebrand ,  --  the only part of the medieval era that deserves to be called the dark ages . Scholasticism imparted to the mind of Europe a severe discipline without which no Revival of Learning would have been able to usher in our modern civilization . Scholasticism systematized the IRomnan Catholic theology , and thus exposed its elements of false doctrine in a form in which they could be confuted . Above all , the scholastic theology was the counterweight to the powerful tendencies to fanaticism and enthusiasm which prevailed in the middle ages , and which threatened to burn up with their unhealthy tire all rational religion . Gieseler has remarked on the happy providential circumstance that it was not left to the wild sects which at one time counted so great a body of adherents and mingled in their creed anti-Christian elements of doctrine , to effect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sober-minded , educated scholars and theologians . He justly observes that it was the schoolmen who not only rolled back the stream of infidelity flowing from the Arabian schools and from other quarters , but curbed , tempered , and balanced the mysticism and fanaticism which otherwise would have met with no barrier to their desolating progress . The great men of the thirteenth century ought never to be spoken of with disrespect . But we are wandering too far into the past . What has just been said may stand for a hint that peril does not lie exclusively on the side of thought and speculation . Other tendencies are dormant in human nature which , to say the least , are attended with equal danger . The imagination and the passions , in the uneducated mind , are capable of being roused to a morbid activity upon matters relating to religion and the supernatural world . The modern delusion of " Spiritualism " with its multitude of votaries , chiefly from the half-educated classes , affords an impressive warning . It shows the danger of allowing anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice in some minds against dogmatic theology , which operates unfavorably to the cause of theological education . The vulgar idea that common sense and science are opposed to one another , is sometimes at the root of this hostile feeling . But there are those who oppose doctrinal or dogmatic theology on theoretical grounds . It is maintained that the object-matter-the truth of Christianity-is of such a nature that it can not be accurately represented in language ; or that language is of such a nature as to be incompetent to serve as a vehicle for accurately stating religious truth . Hence , it is inferred that definition and science in theology must be abjured . We regard this notion as groundless and futile . Language , though figurative in its origin , becomes a trustworthy , perfectly intelligible symbol of thought . The objection must come to this , that we can have no exact thought concerning the objects of faith . And the doctrine to which we refer is frequently stated in this form . It is said that insight , spiritual inspection is here the organ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of perception ) is here impossible . Now , we agree that no deep and living apprehension of Christianity can be obtained prior to experience . He that doeth the will of God shall know of the doctrine . However liable to misunderstanding and perversion the phrase may be , we yet believe that there is profound truth in the maxim of Augustine and Anselm , " credo ut intelligam . " The general tendencies of that philosophy of religion are sound . But then Anselm , and most of the great masters of theology before him and after him , believed in knowledge and science , as well as faith . They saw with equal clearness the truth of the other maxim , " fides qua*rit intellectum . " The understanding is to be met and satisfied . It is possible to reflect upon faith , to investigate its contents , to vindicate its rationality . They saw that knowledge was an efficient ally and aid to faith , besides answering a rightful demand of our intellectual nature . They gave heed to the Scriptural injunction , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the question , for a moment , more closely . Definition in theology , it is pretended , is impracticable . We affirm , on the contrary , that Christian truth may be apprehended from another point of view , and in a dif // ferent manner , than through an immediate practical experience , - admitting , however , that a spiritual experience is requisite . In other words , we affirm that scientific theology is possible . This is very different , of course , from contending that everything can be known , or that theological science is complete . The contrary position overlooks the practicability of two kinds of apprehension . Take an illustration . What is an orange * Now we assert that it is entirely possible to define an orange . It can be described as a fruit of a given genus and species , globular , or nearly so , yellow when ripe , covered by a rind , the inside having a certain construction , &amp;c. , &amp;c . This is a real , objective definition . It tells what the orange is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of nature . " No ! " says the objector- " you must gaze upon the fair fruit , you must take it in your hand , you must taste it and see how luscious it is ,  --  otherwise you can not know the orange . " Does the naturalist then know the orange only as the child knows it who buys it and eats it at a fruit-stall ? Is there no 8cience  |p05-sible  in the case ? Take another illustration . The man of science by mathematical reasoning arrives at the plan of the astronomical system . The stellar universe , the magnitude of the bodies that compose it , and the laws of their motion , are comprehended by him . Shall we be told that such knowledge is unreal and of no value , because a different sort of apprehension is given to him who goes out and gazes upon the starry heavens at night ? Beyond the majesty and splendor that meet thc eye , is there not a glory , also , in the hidden order that is disclosed to the man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a legitimate , product of Christian intelligence . The Church , in the early days of her history , was absolutely obliged to define the faith in opposition to a host of formidable errors that pressed for acceptance . Theology began as au indispensable means of self defense against judaizing and gnostic heresies , in which elements of Christian truth were often ingeniously amalgamated with anti-Christian dogmas . We do not hesitate to say that if , between the year 80 and the year 180 , theology had been deemed by the Church so hurtful and so fictitious a product as some confidently pronounce it , the Christian religion would have // 209 been swamped in the deluge of heretical speculation which flowed in from every side . But it appears needless to argue for the right of theology to exist . They who decry theology , theologize with as much industry as their opponents . They define their opinions concerning sin , the Person of Christ , the Trinity , and the Atonement , discriminate between their own hypotheses and those of other thinkers , expect to be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example belies their own theory : and so it must , unless they leave off the attempt to state their opinions . And if doctrinal theology is a legitimate branch of knowledge , the utility of it was never more obvious than at present . The enemies of Christianity are glad to take part in a crusade against theological science . Nothing suits their taste better than declamation against " dogmas . " To sweep away definite statements of religious doctrine and to shroud religious truth in a haze , where nothing can be affirmed and nothing denied , and where friend and foe are indistinguishable , is a sure means of forwarding their ends . One of the most sagacious of the Unitarian divines , who belongs to the conservative school , and is held in universal respect , has lately remarked that the error of the present is generally not on the side of dogmatism ; that exact statements in theology are the indispensable means of meeting the vague and cloudy utterances of a sentimental skepticism , and of holding fast to the essential principles of Theism , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks who decry theology , casting their influence against the study of scientific divinity , are serving unawares the infidel party . Another reason why systematic training for the ministry is held in low esteem by some , is the habit of undervaluing knowledge . In one sense , this is the best educated country in the world . Knowledge is more widely diffused than elsewhere . There are more people who know so ? netlting , and more who possess a respectable stock of knowledge , than is true of any other land . At the same time , the educated class are , as a body , inferior in their attainments to the same class in several other nations . The prime defect of educated men in the differ . eut professions in this country , is the want of full and adequate // knowledge in the departments which they cultivate . One reason is the superficial and inaccurate manner in which early instruction is given in almost all the schools which undertake to prepare young men for college . A great part of the work which ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in college . Valuable years are lost by the slovenly teaching to which most of us are subject in the early period of life . There is no want of intellectual ability among us . There is no lack of intellectual activity . There is culture up to a certain level . But ample and thorough knowledge in any particular department is seldom met with . The observation holds good of the legal profession . The number of lawyers who can manage a cause which demands extensive reading or a real mastery of legal science is very small . Hundreds of young lawyers waste their time in petty politics or in doing nothing . The observation applies also to the niedical profession . And the same is true , we regret to say , of the clergy . How few continue the earnest study of any branch of theology ! How few are at home even in the interpretation of the New Testament ! flow often do preachers fail to seize on the exact meaning of the text on which they discourse ! I* is vain to plead , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the direct line of professional activity . They directly aid the preacher in his office . And we are not departing , in these remarks , from our subject ; for the present state of things proves the necessity of a training for ministers , which shall give them both the ability and the impulse to pursue their studies in the midst of their work . There is a vulgar idea that extensive reading does not consist with originality of thought . That sort of reading which is called " cramming " - reading which is not digested or assimilated - does confuse and thus weaken the mind . But a thoughtful man is stimulated to more thought ISy books . Reading is to him a constant exertion of the intellect . In his mind , books are like fuel thrown into the fire . They make it blaze the more brightly . And wide reading delivers from a thousand errors and eccentricities into which able men are liable to fall . It does not quench originality , but it diminishes conceit , and gives a large , round-about view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have enlarged the boundaries of // knowledge , have been diligent readers . They have been enabled to mark the limit to which knowledge had already advanced , and from that , as a starting-point , to make new conquests . We are strongly tempted to illustrate sone of the preceding remarks by concrete examples . No theological writer has made more stir of late than Dr. Bushnell . We have often expressed our a*dmiration of his genius , and our respect for his sincerity and independence . If we find fault , we do it unwillingly , and he will be little affected by our praise or dispraise . Dr. Bushnell found in the " Biblical Repository " a translation by Stuart of Schleiermacher 's discussion of the Trinity . Schleiermacher thought himself unable philosophically to construe the personality of God . Hence , with marvelous ingenuity he constructed his theological system , from his first definition of piety to the close , avoiding the assertion of this cardinal doctrine . The wonder is that he wrought into his system so much of Christian truth , and was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when he came to the Church doctrine of the Trinity , he found a somewhat unmanageable dogma . Hence , he revived the old Sabellian theory , and set it up in place of the orthodox doctrine . The Sabellian hypothesis wears a plausible appearance , as it seems to be an easy solution of a perplexing problem . But it will not bear the test of a fair and sound exegesis , nor does it accord better with the demands of philosophyunless indeed philosophy runs into Pantheism . Dr Bushnell , dissatisfied with the later New England hypothesis of a " threefold distinction " in God , which Professor Stuart advocated , laid hold of the theory of Schleiermacher 's essay and propounded it , with his accustomed fervor , in his book entitled " God in Christ . " The clamor which that book excited , led him to read further on the subject , and he expressed himself in his second book , entitled " Christ in Theology , " as not unfavorably disposed to the Nicene doctrine . Had his investigation been wider at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work in vindication of this doctrine . Fifteen centuries ago , the subject was canvassed in the Church by men of unsurpassed acuteness , to whom the Greek language // was vernacular , and who discussed the subject with inintense earnestness , in the light both of philosophy and Scripture . Now we do not say that their conclusions are to be followed on this or any other subject ; but we do say that their opinions and arguments can not be safely neglected , unless Christian thought is to move in successive cycles , ever traveling over its own track . In his last work , on the Atonement , Dr. Bushnell ventures to say that Martin Luther at heart held , without knowing it , the doctrine of his treatise-that is , in one essential feature , the iRoinan Catholic doctrine of Justification ! A better knowledge of Luther 's writings would have precluded this patronizing but quite untenable judgment . Luther knew full well what he believed . A mind in which a few hints of Coleridge on the nature of the Will , the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combustion ,  - -  how much greater things even might it not have achieved had it set a proper value upon the thinking of the past . The most popular preacher in the country is Henry Ward Beecher . He has preached for many years , with undiminished favor , to large assemblies which have been drawn together by the fascination of his eloquence . Beyond his oratorical power , but auxiliary to it , is uncommon fertility of imagination and uncommon ability as a thinker . His deficiencies are chiefly due to his want of theological knowledge . He occasionally sneers at theological science ; but if he had more of it , his power of doing good would be doubled . Mr. Beecher found in " Phrenology " a classification of the capacities of the mind , which impressed him as being remarkable , as well as convenient . All the unphilosophical theories at the basis of this classification , we do not suppose that Mr. Beecher consciously accepts . Yet we have heard him , in a sermon that contained much valuable truth expressed in a pointed way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it wretched , phrenological stuff about the diversity of faculties and the possibility that each may sin . Yet he preaches the doctrine of conversion , and if conversion is total-that is , the renunciation of one fundamental motive of action , and the adoption of an opposite one-then depravity is equally total . This is all that philosophical divines mean by " total depravity , " - that character , as to its radical principle , is // simple , and that no man can serve two masters at the same time . Mr. Beecher has done mischief by deriding doctrinal and metaphysical theology , when it is very evident that he needs nothing so much as a thorough study of that science , and a more extensive acquaintance with the best literature that belongs to it . In older countries , crude attacks upon any branch of science make little impression . There is a numerous body of thoroughly educated persons . who quickly put down such assailants . If a man comes forward to decry learning , he either fhils to secure any notice , or is quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reach beyond the most tangible uses may be made the subject of depreciating observations with comparative impunity . Theological Seminaries are the training-schools for the clergy . The founders of New England showed their earnest desire to have a learned as well as pious ministry , by the self-sacrifice to which they submitted in order to secure to themselves and their posterity this inestimable good . They established harvard and Yale mainly for that end . Seminaries are the development of this original design . The change in the course of college studies , by which little room was left for theology , rendered it necessary to found special schools of Divinity . At Yale , the Theological Department was avowedly an expansion of the means of theological instruction , which had been enjoyed from the first existence of the College . These schools should be liberally supported and fostered . There is little danger , the tendencies of American life being what they are ; that they will send out pedants . There is far more danger that ranters will abound , than that the clergy will suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualification of a good minister . But theological seminaries may be nurseries of piety as well as seats of learning . If the student is taught to pursue his studies in a reverent feeling , with a constant eye to his future calling , his spirit will be chastened and purified by the contemplation of religious truth . Opportunities to do good in Sabbath schools and among the poor will not be wanting ; and if these are improved , the effect will be salutary . Theological // students can not be expected to have the feelings which are characteristic of a more advanced period of life , nor can they have the tempers of heart which only an experience of the work of the ministry can awaken . There are many students of whom it is true that their seminary course produced in them a deepening of the religious spirit . If one complains that he lost his piety in the seminary , it is safe to conclude that he had none when he entered it . This is good Calvinism , and good sense too . Seminary training is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said that students imbibe a system of theology from their instructor instead of thinking for themselves . It is inevitable that young men should be influenced by the opinions of their teachers , and in many cases should be disposed to accept them with insufficient inquiry . But surely the evil can not be greater than it was when the student lived with one minister , and never heard his doctrines called in question . This was the method of education before seminaries were established , and it was generally found , we believe , that the pupils of Dr. Emmons came out " Exercisers , ** and those of Dr. Burton " Tasters . " And the student not only has a number of instructors , among whom it is fair to presume that there will be some diversity of theological opinion , but he also has the influence of his fellow students , and of their mutual conferences and discussions . The great remedy , however , for this acknowledged danger is found in the Biblical and historical studies which enter into the course . The student who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has taken a sarvey of the rise and progress of theology , and of the conflicting systems which at present exist , is provided with an antidote which in the end will prove effectual against the tendency to receive in a servile spirit the dogmas of his theological teacher . He will sooner or later bring everything to the test of the Scriptures , and he will be prevented from being carried away by a peculiar scheme of theology , for the reason that he does not know any other , or has heard no arguments except on one side . As we implied above , a student at the beginning of his practical work will be likely to exhibit a certain rawness , which // nothing but actual contact with the various duties of a preacher and pastor will cause to disappear . This is no ground for surprise or complaint . It is inseparable from the position in which the learner stands , prior to the actual exercise of his calling . The cadet just from the military school finds war to be something new , and notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is a different man after he has once been under fire . A little experience of real warfare sets everything in a different light . It does not , therefore , follow that his training is of no use , or that the system under which he has been educated was a poor one . The relation of theological education to ministerial life is somewhat analogous . The usual course of study in our seminaries includes the substantial parts of a theological education . There is no room for essential alteration . The course may be capable of some improvement , but innovations ought not to be rashly made . There is one additional branch of study which might be advantageously introduced into our seminaries . We allude to " Biblical Theology , " a discipline intermediate between Exegesis proper and Dogmatic Theology . It forms a part of the curriculum in many of the Continental universities . The work of Storr and Flatt , translated many years ago at Andover , is a work of this character . The development of Biblical ideas and truths within the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exegesis of particular passages under the appropriate rubrics . For example , the Scriptures are examined from beginning to end , to trace the gradually unfolding doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul ; and so of other topics . It has been proposed to introduce into our seminaries lectureships on special subjects . Where a special subject requires for its treatment more time than can well be afforded in the established departments of study , and where an individual is found whose knowledge fits him to teach it , the curriculum may be amplified to admit such a lectureship . But some cautions are requisite . Generally speaking , Professors who devote their whole attention to a branch of science , and whose habits of life tend to cultivate a scientific spirit , are far better qualified to give instruction in their several departments than persons who are called in from abroad . There are certain evils which ought to // be most carefully eschewed in changes of the nature proposed . In the first place , nothing should be done to dilute and popularize the course of study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of colleges and seminaries , which would tend to let down the character of the instruction in this respect , should be sternly withstood by all educated men . Diffuse , rhetorical harangues , such as might pass in Lycenins , would do more harm than good , and would soon become ineffably tedious . In the second place , persons who cultivate the physical sciences should not be called in to interpret Scripture . They have not the proper qualifications . They may be able on their own ground , but they are frequently weak and fanciful when they leave it , and undertake to expound the Pentateuch . When theologians are invited into scientific schools , to accommodate the supposed teachings of science to the statements of the Bible , it will then be time enough to consider the propriety of inviting the naturalists to reverse the process in the schools of theology . An educated theologian can , with little difficulty , acquaint himself with those conclusions of physical science having reference to Revelation which are really established , and find out , also , the litigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he alone is qualified for Biblical criticism . In the third place , everything that savors of clap-trap should be avoided in arranging the course of instruction . There is not time for a great number of branches . It is folly to pretend to teach what can not be taught well . And we are not satisfied that it is desirable to add a fourth year to the period of theological study . For some students , a fourth year is eminently desirable and useful ; but for most , we are inclined to think that three years are long enough . The expectation that students will be prevented from going to Germany , by the addition of another year to the course at home , will prove to be mistaken . Those who desire to study in Europe , and have the means , will go there still . They who prefer not to go , or are prevented by some other cause , will generally begin their practical work at the expiration of three years . And , in the case of a majority of theological students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative views in regard to the character // of theological education , we are alive to the importance of keeping the instruction in our seminaries abreast of the times . The tendencies of thought which are rife at present must not be suffered to escape attention . New phenomena in philosophical opinion continually require that a new aspect shall be given to theological teaching . Not a few ministers fall into the error of supposing that all things remain as they were , when they left the seminary , twenty , thirty , or forty years ago . In some cases they imagine themselves to be in close contact and intercourse with the world , when in reality the thinking class  --  and this class gradually leaven with their views the strata of society below them-have sailed away out of their sight . The shelves of their libraries contain the controversies of the last generation ; but of the thoughts , the doubts , and the whole movement of the generation that has arisen since , they know but little . Now and then some disciple of Buckle , or Strauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their slumber , and awakens the uncomfortable suspicion that the world may have moved without their knowing it , and that their old sermons are no longer adapted to the inward questionings and wants of their hearers . Seminaries , through the new recruits which pass from them into the ranks of the ministry and through other channels of influence , may do much to prevent ministers from becoming fixed in the old ruts , and from parting company with the intellectual life of the age .
