S. S. London . 1860 . WE are not disposed to encroach upon the territory of our neighbors in the domain of science , nor to ramble beyond our own acquaintance with the grounds we are about to exhibit to our visitors . We shall only offer a few observations on a subject of general interest , as well in a speculative as in a practical point of view , and of growing importance in the daily life of increasing numbers . The manufacture of illuminating gas deserves attention , whether we consider the material from which it is obtained , the history and the process of the manufacture , or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The numerous and great varieties of coal ( from some of which gas can be obtained , while others yield no such product ) are the evidence of a state of vegetation in many , and indeed in almost all parts of the globe , which was probably very different , in many particulars , from any present product of the soil and atmosphere . Of a woody and fibrous texture , coal contains ingredients which are not found in equal abundance in substances which now grow on the surface of the earth in a similar manner . Not only must the vegetable growth // have been singularly dense at some former age of the earth 's history , but it must have been somewhat suddenly subjected to a varying degree of pressure , and to an amount of heat sufficient to modify or to expel some of the chemical constituents of the great masses exposed to this influence . There is every variety of position , from the immediate vicinity of the surface of the ground to a great depth beneath it , of every kind of coal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this country the hardest and least inflammable coal is found in the eastern part of Pennsylvania , while as one travels to the West the coal-beds become softer and richer ; and the excellent coal of Ohio , Indiana , and Kentucky is as valuable as the best specimens of English or Scottish production . In the North and South , too , valuable coals are found , of the softer kinds , but not of the rich quality that may be seen in the vast coal-beds of the West . It would seem as if the eastern part of Pennsylvania had been exposed to some great or enduring heat , which had nearly expelled the more inflammable constituents of her coal-beds , and the influence of which was less felt in every direction as the distance increased . This process of nature , if the idea be a just one , is rudely imitated in the manufacture of charcoal , by which the aqueous particles contained in the fibre of wood are driven off and the remainder resembles , in some points , a light sort of anthracite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with little flame . The difference of structure , and of component parts , b*tween the buried vegetation which now constitutes the extensive coalbeds of the world , and the classes of plants now existing , must have been very great . The proportion of water contained in vegetable fibre of a given weight is now probably much larger , and that of other chemical ingredients much less than in the great coal-beds of the world ; and it does not appear that the mere burying of wood under a considerable mass of earth would have any tendency to convert it into coal . Indeed , the more perfectly the air is excluded from the surface of wood , the more perfectly , and the longer , it retains its structure and its strength ; and timber that has been buried , either in swamps , the beds of rivers , or wherever it has been secure from the action of the atmosphere , has been discovered with very little // tendency to become what we call coal . It has been supposed that the very timbers constituting the foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Julius Ca*sar , have been found in our own times , with little change in their organization , while the trunks of trees have been discovered in bogs , deeply buried beneath the surface , which must have lain there for a period beyond the memory or tradition of man , without the slightest tendency to become coal . On the other hand , coal of all kinds , from the hardest to the softest , from the least combustible to that which is most combustible , is found as well on the surface as beneath many hundreds of feet of mingled earth and stone . The coal-mines of Europe are generally far below the surface of the ground , while many in this country and in Asia crop out on the sides of hills ; and some of the beds of anthracite in Pennsylvania are actually on the tops of very considerable elevations . It is probable , therefore , at first sight , that pressure has little to do with the production or the character of coal formations . Indeed , the pressure on the deepest mines may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at all events can not be extreme , as the roofs of subterranean passages through earth , of convenient width , are easily sustained by timber of no unusual strength . The chemical constitution of wood and coal is very different , the latter comprising many more ingredients than the former . The residuum , too , of wood and of coal is essentially different in texture and appearance , as well a in composition and in useful materials . The inference , then , which seems to be irresistible from these considerations , is that the vegetation which produced the existing strata of coal was very unlike that which we see around us , - not merely in appearance , but in its essential nature ; and that no conceivable compression of the present vegetation of the globe could produce the various qualities of coal which we discover upon , as well as beneath , its present surface . The conjecture that the coal-beds have been thrown down and thrown up again by successive convulsions of the surface of the earth , is among those theories which scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serve to give an air of profoundness to what is , in fact , mere supposition . // The processes by which these immense resources of power are usefully employed , by human ingenuity , are subjects of more positive knowledge ; and it is only in quite modern times that these great treasures of light and warmth have been developed for the convenience and comfort of mankind . The history of gas-lighting , especially , is so brief , that it scarcely deserves the name of history as yet . In 1726 Dr. Hales performed experiments by which he ascertained the amount of gas which could be obtained from the distillation of Newcastle coal , and his results agree remarkably with those obtained by careful investigations in more recent times . Dr. Watson , in 1767 , published some experiments in the making and preserving of gas ; and the Earl of Dundonald erected furnaces and obtained gas in 1786 , but applied it to no purpose except the amusement of his friends . In 1792 Mr. William Murdoch lighted his house with gas ; and in 1798 Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a part of it , in Soho . In 1802 , on occasion of the celebration , in London , of the peace of Amiens , an exhibition of the new light was made , and soon afterward a cotton-mill was lighted with it . The use of it gradually extended , and it was introduced into various manufactories , and into the Lyceum Theatre in London . One side of Pall-Mall was lighted with it ; and its superiority for use in public buildings , arid in the streets , was soon acknowledged . The imperfection of the art of purifying it from the substances causing an offensive odor , and the tarnishing of polished metallic surfaces , offered so great objections to its use in private houses , that its progress in that direction was slow . The gradual improvement , however , in purification , and the vast superiority , in convenience , of gas to oil , slowly effected its introduction into more common use . In England and Scotland , which are supplied with an abundance of rich coals for the purpose , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , in many parts of which suitable coals are abundant , it has become common in cities and towns where the population is dense enough to render its distribution possible at a reasonable cost . There are more than three hundred cities and towns in the United States where it is in common use . The process of manufacture is a simple one , but can not be described // in detail without illustrations which would be out of place in this journal . It must suffice to give a general account , as far as it can be given intelligibly without diagrams , of the mode in which a bright and pleasant light is obtained from such an apparently unpromising material as the black and heavy bituminous coals . From a hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds of coal are thrust into an iron or clay retort , and subjected , from four to six hours , to a steady heat , varying in intensity in different establishments , according to the nature of the coal used , from a moderate red to a strong white heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the volatile contents of the coals , and they are forced by the heat of the retort along the conduit prepared for them , which is partly filled with water and tar , and is called the hydraulic main , till they reach the condensing apparatus . This is commonly a series of upright iron pipes , along which the gas is made to pass , and which are kept constantly cool , by the atmosphere in winter , and by the evaporation of water from their surface in summer . The object is to reduce the temperature of the gas , which comes directly from the retorts , and to precipitate the tarry and watery particles brought along with it . It is next conveyed along a number of other large upright iron tubes , in passing up and down which successively the gas is subjected to a sprinkling by water , thrown on it through a spout pierced with small holes , so that the effect is like that of a shower of fine drops of rain . By this operation some of the impurities which the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the tubes , and it is easy to see the amount of foreign matter deposited by the gas , in the color of the water as it runs off , after it has performed its office of washing the gas . It is thus freed from some impurities which might otherwise be carried along with it , to be deposited in the pipes , or to diminish the brilliancy of the light . The next step is to the purifiers , which are large iron boxes containing lime , either dry or wet , according to the judgment of the manufacturer , in order to absorb some of the contents of the gas from the retorts , which it is not desirable should enter into the circulation , such as ammonia , sulphuretted hy12 * // drogen , and carbonic acid . In the wet purifiers the mingled lime and water are kept in agitation by machinery , and the gas is forced into the box containing them at one end , and out of it at the other , so that it is thoroughly exposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry purifiers the lime is laid upon perforated shelves , through which the gas is made to pass successively , so that it is brought into contact with a large surface of dry lime . The passage through the purifiers is the last operation upon the gas before it is deposited in the holders constructed to receive and keep it till it is wanted for consumption . The vis a tergo , derived from the heat of the retort , is sufficient to force the gas through a meter safely into the holder , which is a large iron vessel inserted with the mouth downward into a tank containing water . The weight of this vessel is counterbalanced by masses of iron suspended by chains passing over columns placed around the holder , and attached to the upper part of it . When properly counterbalanced it is in condition to receive the gas , which enters it with a force sufficient to overcome tbe remaining weight of the holder . When the evening consumption begins , the drawing off of the gas causes the holder to descend , as the weights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the impulse of the entering or the diminution of the departing gas . The slight degree of pressure on the elastic fluid is felt at every orifice at which it issues into the atmosphere , and the consumer can control the quantity he uses by means of a stopcock near the mouth of the pipe . It contributes materially to render the pressure equal to have large holders at different points of the more distant consumption of gas , and to propel it through mains of a large size , so as to diminish , as far as may be , the retarding effect of friction . From the holders are laid pipes of smaller size for the use of each street , and these again are drawn upon for each building . It is important that all pipes , especially those entcring a house or shop , should be laid below the reach of frost , as great obstruction is caused by the congelation of any aqueous particles carried along with the gas . This difficulty may be removed , when it occurs , by pouring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 1861 . ILLUMINATING GAS . may be still more easily prevented by reasonable caution in placing the pipes . Another annoyance caused by frost is the occasional fracture of a pipe which lies partly in original , native soil , and partly in what is called " made land . " If this last be of recent construction , its gradual settling creates a strain upon the pipe at the point of junction , which often produces a fracture which is betrayed by the escape of the gas , and sometimes occasions an explosion. * In the laying of street pipes it is necessary to provide a sufficient inclination of them to enable the liquid deposits , made in greater or less amount , to run into small reservoirs , prepared for the purpose , which are called siphons , or draining boxes , and thus to be prevented from obstructing the flow of the gas . When the gas has been brought to the place of consumption , the house , the shop , the theatre , the lecture-room , or the church , it becomes necessary to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose a measure has been devised , which registers , with all possible accuracy , the number of cubic feet of gas that pass through it . For this end a chamber of definite capacity is prepared , through which the gas must pass ; and the motion of the gas turns a drum upon an axis , each revolution of which indicates the passage of a known quantity of the article . The revolutions of the drum are recorded on the outside by an index , or rather several indices , for tens , hundreds , and thousands of cubic feet ; and the passage of the gas is the only thing that can affect the record of measurement . There are two kinds of meter , the wet and the dry . In the former the gas is made to pass over water , placed in the lower part of the meter , at a given level . If this level be carefully maintained , it will measure the passing gas with entire accuracy . If , however , the water shnuld reach a level a little too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution of the drum ; and if the water be too low , more gas would pass in the same period . In the one case the customer would receive less than the amount registered , in the other case lie would receive more . To guard Gas becomes explosive when mixed , in certain proportions , with atmospheric air . In its pure state explosion is impossible . // against the former injustice , an outlet for the water is provided , so that no more can be retained than the proper quantity ; while the only security of the company against loss is an occasional visit of a person appointed for the purpose of seeing that the meter is properly filled . In the dry meter , a space of known size , containing an accurately measured quantity of gas , is opened and shut by machinery ; and at each motion a precise amount of it is passed through the meter , and is recorded on the outside as in the other kind of instrument . The advantage of this meter is , that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which the quantity of gas passing through it can be affected . The machine is too nice for any one to touch who is not accustomed to such delicate instruments , and if it were touched it could not be altered . When it wears out , as it must fail at last , it ceases to act at once , and no gas can pass through it to be registered injuriously against one party or the other . The reason of this is , that the chambers , which measure the amount of gas passing through them , are made of an elastic material , which is constantly in motion when the instrument is used ; and when it is worn out , or from any cause is broken , the machine can not act at all , and will not pass any gas , to the loss of either party . We have said nothing yet of the quality of the coals necessary for the manufacture of this important article . In this there is great choice , and room for that knowledge and judgment , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , which constitutes the skilful or the nuskilful , the successful or the unsuccessful manufacturer . It is desirable that gas should be of good quality , without being too costly for use ; and the price of the material from which it is made must , of course , be one of the chief ingredients in the cost of the manufactured article . A quality of gas , five cubic feet of which are equal in illuminating power to twelve candles of a given size , is generally adopted in England as satisfactory . In this country a higher quality of gas is commonly used , ranging from the equivalent of twelve to that of twenty candles ; and there are many species of coal , both here and in England , from which gas may be obtained of a sufficiently // ILLUMINATING GAS . good quality for this purpose . It is the business of the manufacturer to decide what kind of coal will make the gas he offers for sale at the least expense , as well as to produce it in the most skilful manner from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine two things not often found together , scientific knowledge and commercial skill , the tact which enables one to observe the phenomena of nature , and that which enables him to understand the phenomena of the market . The number and variety of kinds of coal from which gas may be made , of good or poor quality , affords a great opportunity for the exercise of judgment . There are sixty or more varieties of coal found in England , Scotland , and Wales , or rather there are more than sixty different mines from which suitable coal is raised , the quality and price of which are to be considered in determining the quality and price of the gas to be manufactured . The number of mines opened in this country , too , is great , and is constantly increasing , which furnish suitable material for the manufacture of gas ; the coal-fields of the Middle , Southern , and Western States being of an extent unequalled in other regions . It is one of the striking marks and evidences of an all-wise disposition of the relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , preparation should have been made for the wants of a population which did not then exist , and which has not existed till within a recent period . The use of this material for domestic as well as manufacturing purposes , has been introduced within what may be considered a short time ; and it is but a few years since the existence of the immense deposits of it in this country became known . The prospect which is opened to the busy and enterprising generations to come , of employment , comfort , and convenience of all sorts , is one of the most agreeable on which the mind can dwell . But we need not extend our view to the dim future to perceive the important relations of this art to the benefit of society . The illumination afforded by gas , when properly *nanufactured from a suitable material , is very superior to that Which has ever been obtained from any of the various oils that have been burned ; while the convenience of its use is so great , and releases such a large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that of the care of lamps , - that its financial advantage , in this single respect , is not easily to be over-estimated . A considerable proportion of the time of one domestic in every private house , and of more than one in every hotel , was formerly spent upon the lamps and candles in use . Scarcely a moment of any one 's time is now required for that purpose , and no more demand is made for the requisite skill in fitting wicks and trimming lamps . The labor of two hundred or two hundred and fifty men , at the gas-works of a city of a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants , has supplanted the dirty work of trimming twenty or thirty thousand lamps every day , by half that number of individuals , and has driven out of recollection the anxiety on grand occasions , and the frequent feeling of discomfort , arising from neglect or mismanagement of the lamps , the poor quality of the oil , or the chill which would render it useless for a long time on a cold winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one that ever happens now-a-days where gas is used , and its occurrence must be attributed to the exposure of the gas-pipe to cold , if it is not secured from frost in its passage from the street to the burner , and not to the quality of the gas itself . This is a not inconsiderable economy of time and money , which is seldom , if ever , thought of by those who are very watchful of their gas bills . Another saving effected by the use of gas , in the place of oil or candles , is that of the eye . Instead of straining the organ by the light of a single lamp or candle , the scholar can obtain , at less expense , a light equivalent to that of a dozeii candles , - the lady may read , sew , or dress , by a brilliant light unaccompanied with any annoying exhalation ; and the man of business may finish the labor of the day without fear of straining his eye , or greasing his ledger . If these advantages were obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons would say that it was a judicious expenditure ; but it is demonstrable that an equivalent amount of light has never been produced , for common consumption , for an equally small cost . The consumer of gas will , perhaps , immediately deny this assertion , and appeal to his bills , confident that he can prove his expenditure for light to have been // much larger than it used to be in the days of lamps and candles . Most probably this will be found to be true , - not because gas is dearer than candles , but because he employs more light than he would , if he were troubled with the care of the lamps and candles . The unavoidable annoyances attending the use of them rendered him cautious to avoid waste . The freedom from all trouble , on the other hand , and the satisfaction of having abundant light , easily and constantly provided , render one thoughtless of the amount used , and the consequent expense , till the presenting of the bill , at the close of the usual term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged . The first impulse of the consumer is , of course , indignantly to deny that lie has consumed so much gas ; and the second is , to rush to the office of the company , and pour out a torrent of vituperation upon the officers , the meters , the innocent gas itself , and to affirm most strenuously that he never used the quantity charged ; or , - without much regard to consistency , - that if he did , it was because the gas was so bad , and so dim , that he could not see by it , without turning on a large quantity ; and it is only by showing him the operation of the meter , and convincing him , if possible , that it is a more accurate measurer than his eye , that he can be soothed at last , though he will probably quit the office with the words on his lips , that he does not believe he ever did burn so much gas . The most discreet way for the company to treat such discontented people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monstrous bill to remain unpaid for the moment , till the angry customer has time to examine more carefully into his rate of consumption , and satisfy himself as to the amount of light used in his premises . The number of conversions produced by this simple and patient treatment is something remarkable , and would be incredible , if it were not confirmed by the constant experience of gas companies . The fact that more light is produced by gas than by oil , at equal cost , and the great facility and convenience of its use , sufficiently explain the increase of gas companies in all places where coal of suitable quality can be obtained . The use of it may , indeed , be included among those great improvements in social life which have so distinguished the present century from its pre // decessors , and which are the harbingers of many more to be enjoyed by our successors . When we look back upon the state of things not many years ago , in relation to individuals , to society , and to national intercourse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own country or in others , we are forced to acknowledge the progress made in all departments , whether of science , art , education , or habits , which is visible wherever freedom is allowed for the exercise of the human faculties . The customs which have been retained in some despotic countries , by the political powers , - the only things that have remained stationary , - serve to mark the progress of nations among whom despotism has not prevailed , and the degree of practical freedom may be shown by the comparative progress in all departments of mental and physical development , from a point fixed by the arbitrary governments of a former day , and retained by those of our own . The manufacture and use of gas are among the best illustrations of the advance of this age . Other periods have had their lights , great and many , but it is the good fortune of this epoch to rejoice in various important discoveries and improvements of condition , which at once distinguish it from its predecessors , and will lead future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be perceived , from the preceding account , that the manufacture of gas requires the practical application of much that is called science ; and that accuracy of observation and measurement , and careful comparison of results , which deserve the name of scientific investigation . It does not diminish this claim to an honorable position , that the result sought is a profitable investment . It only renders the accuracy and exactness of the process the more imperative . Any error is liable to be followed , not only by the objections of scientific men , but by the loud complaints of customers and stockholders , who are not very likely to appreciate fally the difficulties that may be encountered . Improvements are to be made , and the only way in which they can be made is by careful and thorough investigation into the productions and laws of nature , just as in any other scientific inquiry . The false pretensions of speculators , too , are to be set aside and disproved only by means of // ILLUMINATING GAS . that accurate knowledge resulting from wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything human deserves so magnificent an appellation . It is a strong claim to the interest of the community , that the product of the labors of gas companies is used by so large a proportion of society ; and it well deserves the consideration of law-makers , whether some provision could not be made , by the appointment of scientific men as inspectors of the gas mannfactured throughout the Commonwealth , to secure a suitable quality for consumption by prescribing a grade below which it should not be salable . Prices for anything can not be made uniform by law , in a community varying in circumstances so much as ours ; but there are many points which might be so regulated , to the mutual advantage of manufacturer and consumer . An inspector of meters might be of great service to both parties ; and some protection ought surely to be given to such important articles as meters , mains , and service-pipes , for the benefit both of the consumer and of the company . The statements we have made show the magnitude , the delicacy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all these will continue to increase in the future , as they have increased in the past . Our notice requires no apology , therefore , to those who are accustomed to consider our journal as having an interest in literature only . The diffusion of knowledge on all subjects is as necessary as its increase .
