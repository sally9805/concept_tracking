txt The facts that CASSIUS M. CLAY on the 10th inst. , was allowed to deliver from the steps of the capitol at Frankfort , in Kentucky , a speech more than three hours . in length , in which the boldest if not the most radical view on the political relations of Slavery were taken , and . the celebrated work of HELPER unequivocally indorsed , with the exception of a single point , to which the speaker objected " not that it was incendiary , but that it was a blunder , " and that this speech was listened to by a large auditory , many of whom were inflexibly hostile to the sentiments of the speaker , without the least interruption or molestation , though threats had been publicly made that he should not be permitted to speak , and an influential journal had counselled that he should be silenced by violence , and that Kentuckians would be proved to be cowards if he was not  --  we say , these facts are most significant and striking . Northern men , and especially Northern philanthropists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAY 'S known personal prowess , and his invincible determination to speak or die , can explain this unwonted phenomenon , is of course quite out of the question . This is an idea which Mr. CLAY himself repudiates with indignation . Whatever may be the faults of the people of Kentucky , that of a want of personal courage has never been laid to their charge . As Mr. CLAY , with rare felicity , remarked in his opening : " It is because that I know that I am here and among such men and in Kentucky , that I speak here tonight . The brave are always generous  --  always ! and placing implicit confidence in this great fundamental truth , I have never feared to go forth through all this broad and glorious land of ours , relying upon the justice and magnanimity of Kentuckians . I never asked , I never cared , whether they were Democrats , Republicans , Americans , or of any other party denomination . Thank God , gentlemen , this trust of mine has never been falsified . Whether I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your State-house  --  whether I am surrounded by light or covered by darkness , I feel equally safe while I am among Kentuckians . " How , then , are we to explain this apparent anomaly in the prevailing proscriptive course of the South whenever any attack upon her favorite institution has been so much as apprehended ? The most obvicus is , we doubt not , also the true solution of the seeming mystery . CASSIUS M. CLAY owes his triumph to the belief of Kentuckians in , his honesty , to their respect for his high spirit , and , above all , to their feeling that , as a Kentuckian by birth and by the residence of a lifetime  --  a man to the manor born , andithe inheritor of an illustrious name  --  he had the right to express his mature and heartfelt sentiments upon whatever concerned the interests and honor of their and his beloved State . There was no gratuitous intermeddling , no moral impertinence , in his full and explicit utterance . The only dissatisfaction shown with his speaking on this exciting subject at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he was expected to speak , was closed as the hour for the address drew near , and Mr. CLAY , consequently , was compelled to make his speech on the outside of the building . The moral lesson , the illustration of the chivalrous spirit of old Kentucky , would have been complete if the doors of the Hall oflegislation had been thrown wide open for the convenience of that large and respectable portion of the citizens of the State , who desired to hear the distingsished orator . But as the scene truly passed , it was memorable and eloquent enough . There is a touch of the truly heroic in the spectacle of a man , in these days of cheap courage and sentimental philanthropy , standing up in the darkness and the storm , firm in his purpose , conscious of his integrity and his patriotism , self-collected in the might of a sincere soul ? at a time , too , when the excitement of the public mind might well suggest prudent , if not timid counsels  --  and ' speaking his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaiming , not afar off to the whole world , but to his own people , sentiments which he well knew were not only obnoxious to the great majority of the living men before him , but by many of them honestly believed to be immediately inimical to the peace and safety of the State . Nor while we congratulate the Commonwealth of Kentucky on this successful assertion of the great principle of the freedom of speech  --  the one endoting guarantee of the Constitution and the genius of our institutions  --  and while we accord the meed of our gratitude and praise to the man whom good fortune , as well as real nobleness , has been so signally illustrated ? must we forget the woman who , with a magnanimity and devotion of which no brighter example is to be found in Greek or Roman story , " prayed to God " ? not that her husband might be safe from perso , , a1 harm  --  but " that he might most gloriously vindicate his principles to-night .
