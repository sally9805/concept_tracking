ARTICLE VII. - LOYALTY AND DISLOYALTY INTER PRETING THE CONSTITUTION . The Governmental History of the United States of America ; from the Earliest Settlement to the Adoption of the present Federal constitution . In Four Parts . By HENRY . SHERMAN , *Counselor at Law ; Author of Sherman 's Marine Insnrance ; Slavery in the United States , its national recognition and relations , etc . " Felix gui potius rerum cognoscere causas . " Virgil . Hartford : MDCCCLX . The Sectional Controversy ; Including the Canses of the War between the Sections . By WILLIAM CIIAITNCEY FOWLER , LL . D. New York : Charles Scribner , 124 Grand street . 1862 . TnE first of the above writers treats of the formation of our Government . The second of some peculiarities of its operation , since it was formed . It would be difficult to find two writers , treating to some extent of the same subject , so totally nnlike , both in manner and spirit . Mr. Sherman gives us a full , plain statement of all the facts which preceded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounds with documents and statistics . He makes no effort to produce in the minds of his readers an impression favorable or unfavorable to the great instrument , the adoption of which is the result of what he has undertaken to give an ac*onnt. lIe rarely intrudes his own personal views . In one instance , however , when speaking of the Convention , he very justly and patriotically remarks : " The peculiar condition of the Nation had impressed upon the minds of all serious and reflecting men in the land , the necessity of more efficient powers in the General Government , in order to perfect and perpetuate the National Union . The alternative presented was neither an ordinary or an indifferent one . It was a choice between political existence and political death . " Although this history would not be attractive to a general reader , it embraces a systematic collection of facts with which // every statesman , and indeed every elector in this country , ought to be familiar . We turn from it with pain and shame to examine the continuation of this history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long known the author and regarded him as a friend , a scholar , a gentleman , and a patriot . But we had not read a dozen pages betbre we were satisfied that the proper title of the book was a sectional view of a " sectional controversy . " If the author had been nursed by the mother of Robert Toombs , and brought up in the family of John C. Calhoun , he would not have been more intensely Sonthern in all his views and feelings . How he could have been brought into this condition , we have tried in vain to conjecture . One would have thought , that having been first a student and then a tutor in Yale College , and then for many years a member successively of the faculties of two other New England Colleges , he would have been , almost to a certainty , clear in his perceptions , logical in his reasonings , and loyal in his attachments . It is marvelous how the Chauncey blood , at least , that flows in his veins , should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to what we understand to be Professor Fowler 's claim , in one line to William the Conqueror , and in another to Charlemagne , we should have thought its tendency would have been to build up rather than to destroy . Possibly in its descent through the rebellious and disorganizing old feudal earls and barons , it may have acquired a tendency to anarchy ! Be this as it may , it is evident that the blood has degenerated in this their remote descendant , for he advocates a theory of the Constitution which would make the Union a laughingstock among the nations . It has occurred to us , that if Alex- * We would suggest to our readers , and to the learned Judge to whose pen we owe this review of Professor Fowler 's book , that an explanation of what has caused his surprise may be found in an often observed physiological fact , that , in families distinguished for virtues and public services , the bad qualities of several generations seem sometimes to be drawn off , at intervals more or less regular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England more respectable or more respected than that of the Chaunceys ; none which in its various branches , has furnished a greater number of patriotic statesmen . Yet even // ander II . Stephens , and Jefferson Davis , are dissatisfied with the " corner stone " which they selected some mouths ago for their new Confederacy , they might find in a class of men at the North , of whom our author appears to be a fit representative , what would serve as a tolerably good substitute . Another thing which attracts our attention in this book of Professor Fowler 's , is the extraordinary care and diligence which he has manifested in searching out and bringing to light whatever expressions can be found in the speeches and letters of Northern politicians , in the reports of assemblies , and in the columns of newspapers , engendered by the bitterness of party strife , or used for party purposes , which might be regarded as a precedent for the doctrine of secession . Quotations from the speeches of such men as Otis and Quincy , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Boston Gazette and Connecticut Courant , containing sentiments suggesting a separation of the states as a remedy for the evils inflicted on New England by the embargo and the war of 181* , have been car*fally collected , accompanied with an eulogy on the high character and standing of the men who entertained such views . among its members , disloyalty is not without a precedent . In the Jlfemorial of the family edited a few years ago by Professor William Chauncey Fowler himself , there will be found on page 284 , the following significant description of the unfortunate individual in whom cropped out the bad qualities of his generation : Amherst ( Massachusetts ) Committee , In Committee of Safety , Amherst , Massachusetts Bay , Amherst , Aug. 26 , 1776 . WHEREAS , Isaac Chauncey , of said Amherst , convicted ' of being notoriously inimical to the American States , and confined within certain limits , bath , in defiance of authority , disregarded the injunctions laid on him and clandestinely departed ( t is supposed ) to some part of Gonnecticut , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good people of that State , or of other States , where he may be found , to secure him in such manner that he may not have it in his power to injure America . Per Order , NATII'n hcscncson , Jun . It will be found to be a curious and instructive inquiry , for those who are willing to take the necessary pains : Were the grandfathers and greatgrand. fathers of our Northern secessionists , patriots or tories in the times of the Revolution ? - En . NEW ENGLANDER. // The famed Hartford Convention is deemed worthy of being the subject of a particular chapter , from which we are left to infer , that the object of it was what its enemies claimed and its advocates denied , to prepare for a dissolution of the Union , on a certain contingency ; without a word of condemnation , if such was its object , and without alluding to the fact , that it has been universally denounced by all who have professed to believe that such was the purpose for which it was convened . Professor Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten sermons , must have been very thorough . He quotes Daniel Webster freely when his remarks , to any extent , favor his views ; and it would have been well if he had followed his example , when , in reply to Hayne , who had pursued a course similar to the author 's , to defame New England , he proudly exclaimed , " I employ no scavengers ! " The author , has shown equal zeal and *qua1 diligence in hunting up every act passed by the General Government , and by state governments , which could possibly be tortured into a supposed invasion of the rights of the South . According to his views , almost every measure of the General Government , since its origin , which was not dictated by Southern politicians , has been sectional . He has made some extraordinary discoveries in this line . Jefferson Davis himself will be astonished to learn how limited his views have been , and how many terrible grievances the South has endured , without being conscions of its wrongs . It appears now that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonnage and imports , the excise bill , the charter of the United States iBank , the assumption of the state debts , and the location of the seat of Governiucut , were all carried by the North in opposition to the interests of the South . It is astonishing that South Carolina did not secede before the Father of his country had completed his second term ! Then , again , according to our author , the prevalence of the same sectional feeling at the North led to the opposition , by northern men , to the restrictions on commerce before the war of 1812 , to the war itself , to the Mexican war , to the annexation of Louisiana , Texas , and California , and more especially to the extension of slavery into the territories . The tariff of 1828 was // an unpardonable outrage . It is evident that the author thinks that in the great contest between Webster and Hayne , Mr. Hayne had the best of the argument . He is , we infer , also of the opinion that if the compromise measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been justified in collecting the revenue in Charleston . But the author is more especially indignant at the violations of the rights of the South , by the passage of resolutions by state legislatures condemnatory of the Fugitive Slave Law , and by enacting personal liberty bills . One w6uld suppose from a perusal of the work , that the whole history of our government was a series of aggressions on the part of the North , and of a meek submission to them on the part of the South . Noxv we do not deny that the North has in some things been to blame . We do not approve of any auts of state legislatures which are calculat6d to thwart acts of Congress passed in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution . Doubtless resolutions have been passed by legislatures and conventions which were not calculated to promote harmony between the different sections of the country . It was right in the author to refer to them . Still , we insist , that if any one undertakes to write the history of a sectional controversy , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he details the proceedings of legislatures in the New England States , adverse to the interests of slavery , he ought to mention also the acts of the Legislature of South Carolina , and other Southern States , in violation of the rights of citizens of the Free States . If he heads a chapter with the hartford Convention , he ought to have headed another chapter with the South Carolina Convention , which openly adopted the treasonable measures which the other was only charged with designing . Common justice requires that when a man 's acts are called in question the provocations which led to them , and which may extenuate if not justify them , should also be disclosed . We shall not be surprised , however , at this one sided view of the subject , when we discover , as any one can do by reading half a dozen pages in any part of the book , the false and heretical doctrines regarding the Constitution , which pervade the work from the beginning to the end . Professor Fowler and // President Davis correspond exactly in sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaveholders have the right to take their slaves permanently into the territories , and temporarily into the free States , and conseqnenntly that Congress has no power or right to forbid it ; that any attempt on the part of Congress or the free states to prevent this , is violation of the Constitution ; that the Union is simply a confederacy of states ; and that consequently such a violation is a sufficientjustilication for the slave states to separate themselves from the free . The first of these propositions is stated with more cantion , and generally under cover of qnotations from the writings or speeches of others , while the last is reiterated a greater number of times than can be found in all the messages and proclamations of President Davis put together . How any rational man can read the history of the adoption of the Constitution , the biography of the great and patriotic ' men who were members of the Convention , and the Constitution itself , and come to either of these conclusions it is next to impossible to conceive . Their fallacy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject is at the present time of paramount importance , we shall , as we think , establish beyond a doubt , first , that the convention which framed the Constitution never would have inserted in it the right to extend slavery beyond the states in which it existed , if it had been directly proposed , and that this is evident both from the known views of the members and from the instrument itself ; second , that full power is vested in . Congress to restrict it ; and thirdly , that the United States is within its own peculiar sphere a distinct and independent sovereignty , to which allegiance is due from every citizen . A denial of this is treasonable doctrine , and any man who attempts to enforce it is a traitor . George Washington , the President of the Convention , though a slaveholder , regarded slavery as a curse . The debates and votes in the Convention prove beyond a doubt that the whole delegation from Virginia viewed the subject in the same light . It was with difficulty that they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would perpetuate the slave trade . Can any one believe that men who regarded slavery as // a curse , which had been imposed on the colonies by England , and which they were obliged to endure because they could not release themselves from the obligations which , as they supposed , humanity and mercy to the slaves themselves , required of them , would ever have authorized the extension ot such an cyil ? A proposition of that kind would not have received half a dozen votes in the Convention . Three-fifths , at least , of the Southern members sympathized with Jefferson , who , as is well known , was the author of the ordinance of 1787 , excluding slavery forever from the territory northwest of the Ohio . The careful exclusion of the word slave from the Constitution , the authority to Congress after a few years to abolish the slave trade , and other incidental provisions , show beyond a doubt that the Convention regarded the institution as intrinsically a wrong and a curse , and they would not show it any fur ther indulgence than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its extension into territory that was then wholly uninhabited , and no one foresaw the political power which it would in the future give . To suppose that they would favor the perpetuation or extension of what they regarded both as a political and moral evil , would be to impeach both their patriotism and morality . Hence we find that the moment Mr. Calhoun , and those of his school , began to demand the extension of slavery as a constitutional right , they felt the necessity of repudiating the views of Washington , Jefferson , and their compeers . They saw at once that they could not stand a moment before the civilized world , and claim the extension of an admitted evil , solely on the ground of self interest . They therefore necessarily changed their base entirely , and advocated the extension of sla*rery upon the ground that it was a source of happiness and prosperity both to the slaves and to their masters . But when we are construing the Constitution , we are to look at the views of those who made it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been so often asserted by Southern politicians and their friends at the North , that the Constitution recognizes slavery as a national institution , and that consequently it has a right to protection in national territories , that some may be disposed to believe it . But there is not the least foundation // for such a proposition . That instrument recognizes it as a state institution , and as nothing else . It regards slaves as property in the States where slavery exists , and nowhere else , and there only by state law . This will be apparent from a careful examination of it . There are but three clauses in which it is alluded to , and then only indirectly , and not by name . One of these refers to the prohibition of the slave trade ; another to the return of fugitive slaves , and the other to the right of representation . The first of them is in these words : " The migration or importation of such persons as any of the STATES now existing shall think proper to admit shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here it is evident that the slaves referred to were to be imported by and into some one of the States , to be held in servitude there . The second clause is as follows : " No person held to service in one State , under the laws thereof , escaping into another State , shall in consequence of any laws or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . " Here clearly is no recognition of any right to hold slaves except by virtue of some state law and in the State . The only right which the slaveholder has , out of the State , is to take the slave back again and hold him there in servitude by state authority . lIe can not use him as property one moment out of his own State . It is also clearly implied that this right is limited to the case of a fugitive , and that in all other cases the law of the State where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other remaining clause , with equal clearness , refers only to state law . " iRepresesentatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union , according to their respective numbers , which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons , including those bound to service for a term of years , and excluding Indians , not taxed , three-fifths of all other persons . " How does this clause recognize slavery out of the State or as existing at all except by state law * Suppose the General Government in a treaty with Spain should promise that all slaves , escaping from Cuba to the Uni // ted States , should be returned-would that make slavery na* tional ? If the Constitution had provided in terms that the citizens of a State might hold slaves by the laws of that State , without interference by Congress , and it they escaped they might take them back , and that a slave held by the laws of a State , might be counted as threefifths of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic animal for the rule of taxation , it would have made slavery national just as much as it does now . But the absurdity of such a claim is too plain to require refutation . But the question whether the Constitution expressly or unpliedly prohibits the extension of slavery , is of little importance in view of the fact that Congress is authorized in the most explicit terms to legislate on the subject . All the arguments that have ever been used to nullify the clause in the Constitution , " Congress shall have power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory and other property of the United States , " have been extremely futile . All parties gave but one construction to this provision until the demand for the extension of slavery led certain minds to the adoption of such glosses and forced criticisms as prejudice and interest could alone suggest . Everybody has felt , that Congress must of necessity either directly or indirectly make laws for the territories , otherwise their inhabitants would live in a state of anarchy . But Professor Fowler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any support for their claims in the Constitution itself , resorts to the idea that it is unfair to the South , not to allow slavery in the territories . He says " It should be borne in mind that the Northern States claimed all of the territorie8 or themselves , and their citizens and their institutions ; " " The Southern States claimed a part or half of the territories for themselves and their citizens and their institutions ; "  --  and asks , " Which of the two sections was the more generous and liberal and just ? " It is surprising that an author , when treating of fairness , should be guilty of such unfair and unjust propositions . // The Northern States never did claim the whole territories for themselves . They only claimed an equal right in all of them . They never objected to any Southerner going into any territory , with precisely the same privileges as themselves . What proposition could be more fair and just ? What they objected to was , that a citizen of a Southern State should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , with property specially protected by law , which would injure their property , while they had no such peculiar advantages . The only real unfairness consists in this claim of the South to an ineqnality in territory to which all have an equal right . It was unfair also for them to make a claim founded solely on their own change of views . The North yielded to the compromises of the Constitution , on the ground that slavery was admitted by the South to be wrong in its origin , but a necessity which was to be tolerated , until those states which were burdened with it , could get a release . No wonder that when the South claimed an ' extension of those compromises on the ground of their new discovery of the benefits of the institution , the North should resist such a pretension . It is not surprising that Jefferson Davis , regarding slavery , as he professes to do , as the only sure foundation of a free government , should not be able to comprehend why the North opposes the extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing strange that a New Englander , a professor of Christianity and a minister of the gospel can not see that no honest man could coöperate in the voluntary enlargement of the greatest wrong of which nations have ever been guilty , and of the greatest evil that ever afflicted the race , on the ground merely of equalizing privileges . Suppose Professor Fowler 's father had years ago , when selling spirituous liquors was considered respectable and moral , entered into a partnership contract with any of his friends under seal , binding himself and his heirs to enter into trade in a particular place for a term of years which has not yet expired , with a provision that branches should from time to time , as their business increased , be established in other places . // Suppose further that the partnership contract bound the firm to trade in spirituous liquors at their principal place of business , but contained no such provision as to the 1*ranches . He , as the representative of his father might well consider himself bound to continue the nefarious business to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness , on the ground that the other partner had , by his money , his labors , and his efforts , prom oted their joint success , induce him to yield to the demands of the other partner to establish new factories of vice and misery If he would , he has less firmness of principle than we are disposed , even after the publication of his book ; to award to him . Nothing is more common than for Southern politicians to declaim on their right to the territories as having been purchased by the common blood and sacrifices of the North and South . What right can Mississippi and Alabama maintain on any such grounds ? What justice was there in allowing to South Carolina nearly double the voice in giving laws to the territories which Connecticut had , when Connecticut furnished about four times as many men in the Revolutionary struggle as South Carolina ? Much complaint is made by the author , of anti-slavery and abolition societies . The North had much more reason to complain of Southern combinations and conspiracies . Ever since the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful conspiracy , founded on and sustained by the institution of slavery , to monopolize all offices of trust and profit , and thereby control the General Government . With a population much less , the South has enjoyed two-thirds of the Presidential terms , to say nothing of Northern men with Southern principles . The distribution of honorable and lucrative offices has been in abont the same proportion . Our whole history has furnished a continuation of aggressions and monopolies by a decided minority . As soon as the North succeeded to the enjoyment of an equality of rights , the South rebelled . The main political heresy of the book is yet to be considered . The key-note to the whole treasonable strain , is State Sovereiguty . You can hardly open a page without finding it ex // press or implied . Page after page of one of Calhoun 's speeches is transferred to it . Extracts from the partisan speeches of Southern Senators and Representatives , quotations from newspapers , and other scraps of no authority whatever on such a question , constitute a large portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the convention which met solely because the evils of the Confederacy were intolera* ble , accomplished nothing but the formation of another compact between States . The United States , according to his views , have grown in size and strength with unexampled rapidity from a mere mistake . The people supposed that they constituted a nation which was powerful and self-sustaining , but it was because they had not discovered the character of the Constitution . The Ship of State was a vessel of fine appearance and carried a great deal of canvass , but it was not fastened together by a rsingle bolt , and the slightest shock would scatter its disjointed fragments upon the waves . Now , it is a remarkable fact , which seems to have escaped the notice of Professor Fowler , that the very men who framed the Constitution , established a government *s distinct and independent of the States as if it was in a foreign country . A President was elected who acknowledged no responsibility to the States , either individually or collectively . He had an army which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . He had the command of a navy , while they had not a single ship-of-war . A Congress was appointed who made laws operating in each of the States , which they could neither repeal nor authorize their citizens to disobey . A judiciary was appointed who did not hesitate ' to annul the decisions of State courts , frequently very much to the dissatisfaction of citizens of the States , but State authority could not relieve them . There is not a nation on the globe whose government exercises more completely all the functions of sovereign power , and yet we are told that our government is a mere agency of the States . If a grand jury , organized under a United States court holding its session in the State of New York , should find an indictment of treason against Governor Seymour , the // Marshal , with a warrant issuing from United States authority , could go to Albany , and while the Legislature is in session , enter without leave the Governor 's official room , and seize him and put him in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire State to rescne him . What sort of a sovereignty is that where its chief executive officer is liable to be imprisoned by one of its own subjects ? How ridiculous does this make the doctrine of exclusive State Sovereignty appear , when it would be as much in vain for its highest officer to call on it for help , as it was for the priests of Baal to call out from morning until noon , " 0 Baal , hear us . " " The Constitution , " says our author , " contains only delegated powers . The constituent , by the force and meaning of the term , is superior to the delegate . " So we have here a delegate overriding the constituent ! an ao'ent not accountable to the principal ! a subject impris-b onin* his sovereign ! What unparalleled absurdity ! To establish the right of secession , Professor Fowler , following the example of many others , says that " the people ratified the Constitution , as the act of the States . Thus each State , acting by itself ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " lie iloes not seem to be able to comprehend the obvious fact that the people could and did act , each for himself , when voting in this way , as fully and completely as if all the people of all the States had voted at once . Suppose that for convenience , or some other cause , the people of Hartford county had voted on the Constitution of the State of Connecticut one day , then of New Haven county on another , and so on , would not the Constitution have been adopted by the people of the whole State ? The fallacy of this mode of reasoning will be clear from this con*ideration : - Suppose the Constitution had vested the whole instead of a part of the power in the General Government , and then it had been adopted by the people of the several States successively , precisely as it was , that would have formed , beyond doubt , a distinct , independent sovereignty created by the people . There would have been no State sovereignties left . Yet the mode of forming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present government with limited powers . To sustain his argument , the author repeatedly resorts , // without any authority , to interpolation . Where the preamble of the Constitution commences , " We , the people of the United States , " he insists it should read , " We , the people of the States of the United States . " lie sedms to be ignorant of the fact that one member of the Convention proposed this very same change , and it was rejected . There is one suggestion of the author which reminds us of the adage , ne sutor ultra crepidam . He claims that a strong argument is to be drawn from the use of certain phrases . Because the government is called the Federal Government , and federal is derived from fcedus , a league , therefore , he says , the Constitution makes a mere confederaey . But we know that at the same time when this term was applied to the government , the party which insisted that the government was national and supreme , was called the Federal party . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accede , and States are said to accede to the Union , therefore they have a right to secede from it . A man sometimes accedes to the terms of a copartnership . H as he a right , therefore , to secede from it at his pleasure , to the ruin of his copartners ? A bachelor accedes to a state of matrimony . Has he a right to secede at his pleasure , and become single again ? It would not require many such instances to satisfy the reader that a life spent however usefully and creditably in the study of etymology , does not qualify the mind to *rasp the great questions that enter into the science of government . If " Sectional Controversy " was to have , especially at the present time , a general perusal , it would , we think , have a tendency to produce a pernicious effect . We anticipate , however , but little injury from its publication . Its sentiments are *o obviously disloyal , that the friends of the Union will , without a perusal , reject it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they care not for either fact or argument . They avoid any examination of the subject , for fear that their own consciences will convict them of their error . The consequence will be that " Sectional Controversy " will sink into merited oblivion . If it survives the present hour , it will be owing to the notice given to it by loyal publications , as insects are sometimes preserved in amber .
