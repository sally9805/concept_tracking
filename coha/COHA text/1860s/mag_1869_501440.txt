OF all the actions going on in the busy fabric of the human body , there are two that are more directly essential to life , and therefore deserve the name , *ar excellence , of vital actions . These are the movement of respiration , and that of the circulation . Of these movements , that of respiration is external and readily perceived by the eye ; that of the circulation is internal , and required centuries of observation and study before it could be fairly understood . Even now , there are few departments of physiology that are cultivated with greater industry , or that yield more abundant returns in new discoveries . Thanks to William Harvey , we all know that the blood circulates . But how is it that the circulating fluid moves through its secret channels and returns again to its starting-point , to perform with unending repetition its ceaseless journey through the animal frame ? What forces drive it onward in its course , and what are the variations that it presents in different parts ? First of all , the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hollow , muscular organ , with layers of contractile fibres winding round it in various directions it receives the blood from the veins and delivers it into the arteries . Some of the muscular fibres of the heart are spiral in their course , but the greater part of them are wrapped round its cavities in a nearly circular direction ; and when they contract , the muscular walls of the organ shut down upon the blood with a vigorous and determined gripe , like the fingers of a closed hand . So the blood is driven out from the cavities of the heart and carried forward into the arteries that stand open to receive it . Here , then , is the central moving power of the circulation . The heart is a force-pump , and by the physical impulse of its contractions distributes the blood to the farthest corners of the vascular system . This fact , so well known at the present day that it seems almost self-evident , was for a long time misunderstood , and the heart was supposed by all the older anatomists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of chamber for the elaboration of the blood and the preparation of some of its more aerial and stunulating ingredients . It was Harvey who first showed that it was really an organ of impulsion , and that the blood moved forward under the influence of its physical compression . But it is very rarely , perhaps never , that discoveries are made complete at one time , or by the same person . Besides the force derived from the action of the heart , the blood is subjected to other influences which in various parts of the circulation modify its movements . So there was still a doubt , even after the time of Harvey , whether the heart 's action alone was sufficient to propel the blood through its course , and whether some other cause , of a less physical nature , was not essential to act the part of an assistant . This question could only be settled by an exact measure of the two forces on the one hand , that exercised by the heart , and on the other , that required for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart has never been ascertained in a direct manner . Attempts were made many years ago to accomplish this , but they resulted only in very discordant and uncertain estimates . It maybe done , however , by gauging the pressure of the blood in the arterial system . If an artery be cut open the blood is drawn out from it in a powerful stream , and the force of this stream is in proportion // to that of the propulsion exercised by the heart . If , instead of making a simple incision in the artery , an upright glass tube , open at both ends , be fitted to it , it has been found that a column of blood rises in the tube to a certain height , and is maintained at this level by the pressure exerted upon it from below . This makes a sort of barometer of the heart 's force . Just as the pressure of the atmosphere is measured by finding that it will support a column of water thirtythree feet in height or a column of mercury thirty inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the blood is subjected when forced into the arteries by the heart 's action is sufficient to raise a column of blood to the height of six feet , or a column of mercury to that of six inches . It is , therefore , onefifth part as great as the pressure of the atmosphere , and the heart acts upon*the blood contained in its cavity with a force equal to the pressure of nearly three pounds to the square inch . Some years ago , Dr. Sharpey , an English anatomist , undertook to ascertain whether this amount of pressure was sufficient to carry the blood through the entire round of the circulation . This was done by using an injecting apparatus for the blood-vessels , with a mercurial gauge attached to its cavity by a side opening ; so that , when in operation , the hei*ht of the mercurial column in the gauge would indicate the exact amount of pressure exerted by the instrument . The nozzle of the injection pipe was then inserted into one of the arteries of the dead body , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the vascular network and return again by the veins . The result was that a pressure rather less than that actually exerted by the heart , viz. , six inches of mercury , was usually sufficient to accomplish the transit of the vascular system . But this pressure is not quite uniform . It varies from one instant to another , within certain limits , on account of various causes . First of all , the heart itself , as we shall see further on , has an intermittent action , alternating constantly from contraction to relaxation , and from relaxation to contraction . Now at each contraction the pressure on the blood is increased , and at each relaxation it is diminished . Usually when the heart contracts , the pressure is increased by nearly half an inch of the mercurial column ; when it relaxes , the pressure is diminished to the same extent . At the time of the hearts relaxation the blood , of course , would be entirely relieved of pressure , were it not contained in the cavity of the blood-vessels and subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these vessels have been previously distended by the hearts action , and can only exert their elastic reaction in consequence of this previous distention , the force which they exert really represents that which was primarily exercised by the heart itself . The arteries , in fact , return to the blood , in the intervals of the heart 's action , a portion of the compressing force , which they had previously borrowed from its active and more powerful impulse . Besides this the pressure on the blood varies with the state of the respiration . If the breathing be suspended the pressure rises to seven or even eight inches of mercury , indicating an increased obstruction to the passage of the blood . This is because the blood , no longer renewed and modified by the influence of the air , finds a difficulty in passing through the minute bloodvessels of the organs ; and this difficulty produces an unnatural resistance which is at once indicated and measured by the level of the mercurial column . Even the ordinary and natural movements of respiration produce a regular oscillation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the action of the heart , equalling about a quarter of an inch of mercury . At every inspiration the pressure on the blood diminishes to this extent , and at the time of expiration increases again to its for- // 669 mer standard . As the movements of the heart are repeated about four times as rapidly as those of respiration , the two sets of movements , going on together at different rates of velocity , produce two corresponding oscillations in the amount of pressure exerted upon the blood ; so that this varies , as we have seen , from one instant to another , in a somewhat complicated manner . But the average pressure , nevertheless , due primarily to the force of the heart 's action , remains constantly equal to about six inches of a mercurial column . Like other force-pumps , the heart is furnished with valves . No doubt the ingenious inventor who first constructed a valve for use in machinery , supposed that he had hit upon quite a new mechanical idea ; and would have been much surprised to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own heart , without knowing it , ever since he had been born . And yet this is true . Without valves , the heart would merely fill and empty itself ; and the blood would oscillate backward and forward without making any continuous progress . To be carried onward in a definite course , from the veins to the arteries , and round again from the arteries to the veins , its current must be guided by the valves , and compelled to move always in the same direction . Now , a valve is simply a kind of gateway , that opens freely in one direction , but shuts closely in the other . In our pumps and steam-engines they are made of wood or metal , and move upon hinges , or oscillate to and fro upon firm supporting rings or shelvings . In the heart they are flexible curtains , of a thin but strong fibrous membrane , attached by one edge to a firm ring-like band on the inner surface of the heart , while the other edge hangs freely into the cavity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forward , and so allow the blood to pass into the main cavities of the heart without obstruction . But when the muscular walls of the heart contract upon the blood , these valves shut backward . Their free edges come in contact with each other , like so many foldingdoors . They are held firmly in their position by a number of strong but slender tendinous cords , and so shut up completely the passage by which the blood had entered . The blood is caught , therefore , so to speak , in a trap . Grasped by the sudaen closure of the muscular walls of the heart , it seeks to escape from this intolerable compression by any passage and in any direction . But it finds only one way open to it . In front , the arteries invite it to go on ; behind , the valves shut inexorably against its retreat . There is no choice ; and so , with every successive contraction of the heart , a new charge of blood glides through the portals of the arterial system , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins behind . Thus the current of the circulation flows on in a determined course , moving always forward , never backward . But this movement is an interrupted and not a continuous one . To use a medical term it is intermittent . That is , the current is driven rapidly onward at each contraction of the heart , and then ceases for an instant at the time of its relaxation . Simultaneously with this the valves play backward and forward , alternately opening and shutting with the intermittent movement of the blood . So the heart is a machine . It is an organ constructed of muscular chambers and communicating passages , and supplied with mechanical contrivances , adapted to guide the stream of blood passing through it , and to prevent a reflux in the backward direction . Does not this take away wonderfully from the character of fanciful mystery with which poets and sentimentalists have invested it ? The heart that we have always heard of as the centre of the affections , the home of sensibility , the dwelling-place of courage , of faith , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is after all nothing but an organ to serve for the impulsion of the blood ; a mere force-pump , a machine . Does not this bring down our ideas , and show that no poetical mystery can escape the searching investigation of the anatomist ? Not at all . For this machine that we carry about with us in our breasts is alive . There , at its post , at the central point of the circulation , with the soft lobes of the lungs folded round it like a curtain , it contracts and relaxes and relaxes and contracts , with a steady and unremitting industry that by itself is something worthy of our admiration . No other muscle in the body can do this . Try to move your arm up and down seventy or eighty times a minute , and you will see how long such an exertion can be kept up . But the heart acts without any voluntary effort of ours . By some incomprehensible vitality of its own , it keeps up its rhythmical contractions without the aid of our will and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are awake , frim the first moment of your birth , even from before your birth , up to the present time , it has never for one moment stopped or flagged in its movements , for if it were to do so death would be the result . Calculate the work that it has done in this time . If you are twenty years old , and your heart beats seventy times per minute , it has made four thousand and two hundred pulsations per hour , a little over one hundred thousand per day , thirty-six millions five hundred thousand per year , and *n the whole twenty years it has performed seven hundred and thirty millions of pulsations . So intent is the heart on the performance of this function that it will keep on pulsating after it is cut off from all connection with the rest of the body and entirely separated from the chest . In the quadrupeds and the birds , that is , in the warm-blooded animals , these pulsations last but for a few minutes . In these animals the heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and nourishing blood ; and when this supply fails , the organ soon loses its vitality . But in the cold-blooded animals , such as reptiles and fish , where the internal changes in the tissues of the body are more sluggish , the movements of the separated heart will keep up for a long time . It is one of the most curious sights imaginable to see the heart of a frog or a turtle , cut out of the chest immediately after death , laid upon a plate , and still continuing its regular but ineffectual pulsations . It reminds one of the persevering fidelity of a dog watching by the grave of his master , or the Roman sentry at the gates of Pompeii . This action will go on sometimes for several hours . Dr. Harlan found the heart of a rattlesnake continue to beat for from ten to twelve hours after separation ; and Dr. J. K. Mitchell , of Philadelphia , saw the heart of a sturgeon , taken out of the body and hung up in the air , keep up its movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight rustling sound with each pulsation . Besides , the heart is sensitive . It is not an inanimate piece of workmanship , that obeys with undeviating monotony the operation of a physical impulse . Distributed through its substance there is a network of sympathetic nervous filaments , by which it will increase or diminish its action , going faster or slower as the wants of the system require . The usual frequency of its pulsations is , as we have intimated , about seventy per minute . At this rate they go on regularly and quietly , so long as the body is at rest or only moderately active ; and it is one of the most remarkable qualities of the heart that it usually continues its action with such uniform regularity , alternately contracting and relaxing just often enough to keep up a constant and sufficient supply of blood to the vascular system . But let us at any time make any unusual exertion , as in leaping or running , so that the muscles require a greater supply of nutritious fluid , and the heart-beats imme // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even one hundred or more per minute sending the blood with increased velocity into the arteries , and so distributing it everywhere to the limbs in the requisite quantity . Even the varying positions of the body require a different amount of muscular effort , and are accompanied by a correspo*nding difference in the frequency of the heart 's action . A man whose heart beats seventy times per minute while sitting in a chair , will have a pulse of eighty when standing erect , and one of sixty-five when lying down . The heart sympathizes also with the emotions . Though its action can not be governed by any exertion of the will , it feels the varying influence of hope and fear , of excitement or depression . The subtle agencies of the nervous system reach it through their manifold connections , and stimulate it to rapid and tumultuous action or soothe it into quiescence and regularity . It is this that gives it its character of sensibility ; and on this account the poetical terms often applied to it are not altogether misplaced . When we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these expressions may not be quite correct in an anatomical sense , but they convey a fair idea of its susceptibility to the nervous impressions . The heart is not precisely the seat of the emotions , but it is one of the first organs to feel their influence and to show a corresponding reaction . Now , the movements of the heart in some cases can be seen . If you keep a fresh-water tank , or aquarium , with vertical sides of plate glass , well supplied with water-plants , and put into it in the early summer a number of the little pondsnails ( Limneid*e ) so abundant in the country in our pools and ditches , they will be very apt to lay their eggs in various places on the inside of the glass , to which they make them adhere by a layer of transparent , colorless mucus . The young snails soon begin to show themselves in the interior of the eggs ; and as their bodies are , for a considerable time , quite transparent , by placing the aquarium near a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fixing a microscope of moderate power against the glass just opposite the spot where the eggs are attached , you can see all the internal organs with great distinctness , particularly the motions of the heart , and even the play of the valves , as they open and shut , alternately . The French anatomist , Cruveilhier , saw the motions of the heart in the human subject . This was one of those singular cases in which a part of the walls of the chest were deficient in the newly-born infant ; and in that instance the deficiency was so great that the heart was completely exposed . The child lived for several hours , and Cruveilhier was thus enabled to examine its movements by direct inspection . So serious a deficiency as this must , of course , be fatal ; for the heart can not very long kear such an exposure ; but some instances have happened where the difficulty , being less in degree , did not prevent the subjects of it from growing to maturity and leading a tolerably healthy and comfortable life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hamburg , in whom the two sides of the breast-bone were separated from each other , and the interval filled up only by a fibrous membrane covered with the skin , underneath which the pulsations of the heart could be perceived . This person grew to maturity , travelled over Europe for some years , an object of interest to all the medical men to whom he presented himself , and finally came to this country , where he now resides , not far from the city of New York . There is a space in the middle of the chest , one inch in width at its widest portion , where , the bony parts being deficient , the undulations of the heart are plainly perceptible ; but as the organ is protected , // as above mentioned , by a covering of skin and fibrous membranes , its action is not materially interfered with . One word more about the heart . We know that the blood which passes out from it by the arteries returns again to it by the veins , making in this way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the whole body , a quantity of blood amounting to about eighteen pounds ; that is , a little over two gallons . This quantity must , therefore , pass and repass successively through the heart , in order to keep up the continuous movement of the circulation . Let us calculate what the whole amount of fluid is that passes in this way through the chambers of the heart in twenty four hours . The principal cavities of the heart can be distended so as to contain over four ounces of blood . It is usually estimated that , during life , they contain about half that amount , viz. , two ounces ; and experiments have shown that half an ounce is the very smallest possible quantity discharged from the heart at each pulsation . Suppose , for the sake of being very moderate in our calculation , we take this lowest estimate , and consider that the quantity so discharged is half an ounce . As the heart beats seventy times per minute , this will give thirty-five ounces or a little over two pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and twenty pounds per hour ; and we accordingly find that , at the lowest calculation , the entire quantity of blood passing through the heart in a single day is not less than two thousand eight hundred pounds . This is twenty times the weight of the whole body . Such is the extraordinary activity of the circulation , when brought to the test of actual weight and measurement . From the heart the blood passes into the arteries . These are the tubes or conduits by which the blood is distributed all over the body . They form a great system of diverging vessels , a sort of arterial tree , commencing by a single trunk , and dividing constantly into branches , twigs , and ramifications , until every organ in the body has received its due share , and is penetrated with these irrigating canals of the arterial system . The first thing that we notice about the arteries is that , like the heart , they have their movement of pulsation . Wherever you can put your finger on one of them you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arm , in the neck , on the temples , at the inner side and back part of the ankle , and in various other parts of the body , the arterial pulsations can be perceived , keeping pace exactly with those of the heart . This movement of the arteries we call the *uZse . But , though the movement of the arteries is simultaneous with that of the heart , it is quite different in character . The movement of the heart is an active one , that of the arteries is passive . When the heart contracts , the arteries expand ; and when the heart is relaxed , the arteries contract again . This is because each contraction of the heart drives the blood forcihly into the arteries , and so distends them , causing an expansion which is felt everywhere as a kind of stroke or bound of the artery underneath the finger . At this moment , the blood is carried through the arteries with a greater velocity , and is thus hurried onward toward the distant organs . Now , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases its impulse they begin to react again , and relieve themselves of their distention by still urging the blood onward . Accordingly , the blood moves in the arteries , at successive instants , with two different velocities ; first , rapidly , under the powerful pressure of the heart 's contraction , and then more slowly , under the pressure of the arteries themselves , which is due to their elasticity . So we have successive waves of blood flying outward from the heart , and following each other inces // santly in their course through the vessels . The blood is always in motion , and the arteries are always full ; but at each movement of the heart they are still further distended , and the flow of blood is accelerated to a corr*sponding degree . This is what makes the pulse so valuable a guide to the physician . XVhen the doctor sits down by the bedside of his patient , and holds his wrist for half a minute or so delicately between the thumb and two fingers , he does not look as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat owl-like expression of countenance . But in this short time he has really gained information on several very important points . First of all , he has learned the frequency of the heart 's action . Every beat of the pulse represents a contraction of the heart , and whether these contractions are at the rate of seventy , eighty , one hundred , or one hundred and twenty per minute , makes a great difference in the condition of the patient . The heart , as we have already seen , may be excited to increased activity by various temporary causes , such as muscular exertion or mental emotion . This , however , is of but little consequence . It is the perfectly natural effect of a momentary cause , and passes away as soon as the disturbing influence has ceased . But when the patient is lying quietly recumbent , with no external cause of excitement to influence him , and yet has a pulse of a hundred or a hundred and twenty , it is a serious matter . Something is then going wrong in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm . It knows better than the patient , and often better than the doctor , exactly how dangerous this trouble may be . So the doctor goes to it for information , and not infrequently graduates his solicitude precisely according to the number of pulsations per minute . If a pulse of one hundred makes him careful , one of a hundred and ten makes him anxious . A hundred and twenty , perhaps , brings him to the patient twice a day , instead of once , and a hundred and thirty or forty makes him look sober and anticipate the worst . Besides , he knows almost instantly , by the pulse alone , whether the patient has gained or lost . If the pulse be ever so little faster than it was yesterday , even five or six beats per minute , his anxiety increases . The enemy has gained ground , though only a step or two . If it be five or six beats slower , the foe has begun to retreat , and the garrison breathes more freely . Of course , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other arteries , or by placing the hand upon the heart itself . But the wrist happens to be the most convenient place . It is easily accessible , and the patient is not required to disarrange his dress , or to place himself in any uncomfortable position . So the pulse at the wrist is used in preference to any other . Besides its frequency , the pulse has certain other characters , almost equally important . If it be large and full , it shows that the heart 's action is vigorous and sends the blood with a sufficient impulse . If it be small and soft , it shows that the artery is not properly distended , and that the heart 's action is enfeebled . Sometimes the stroke of the pulse is gentle and moderate , sometimes it is sharp and jerky ; occasionally it is irregular in force , or frequency , or in both sometimes it is intermittent , one beat being dropped out or lost every forty or fifty seconds . All these peculiarities indicate special changes in the condition of the heart ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the treatment of the patient . An instrument has been contrived within a few years , by which some of these peculiarities of the pulse may be indicated with rather more delicacy than it is possible to perceive them by the finger , and by which they may , at the same time , be registered for future examination . This instrument is called the sphygmograph . It consists of a brass frame of convenient form and size , to fasten // upon the wrist , so that a small metallic plate , held in place by a spring , presses over the situation of the artery , and is raised at each successive pulsation by the movement of the artery underneath . The moving plate carries a lever , which , in its turn , gives motion to a long index . The index is thus made to oscillate upon its hinge with a movement which translates , as it were , and at the same time magnifies the peculiarities of the arterial pulsations . It serves in this way as a kind of microscope , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the eye . Now for the registering apparatus . At the other end of the brass frame is a cylinder about two inches in diameter ; which is made to revolve , at will , by clockwork , finishing one complete revolution in exactly thirty seconds . Upon this cylinder is fastened a paper or cardboard of the proper width , with its surface covered by a coating of lamphlack . Everything being in readiness , the apparatus fastened in its place , and the clockwork wound up , the operator sets it in motion by touching a small knob on the top of the cylinder . As the cylinder revolves , the point of the index , pressing gently against its sides , traces on the blackened surface of the paper a white line , whose curves and oscillations faithfully portray every peculiarity of the arterial pulsation . The revolution of the cylinder completed , the paper is removed , and thus becomes a permanent register , not only of the exact number of pulsations during an interval of thirty seconds , but also of their extent , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered by the sphygmograph usually leaves such a trace as the following : In the above trace the first or upward stroke shows the period of expansion of the artery . In the great majority of cases the arterial expansion is indicated by a rapid and continuous upward movement of the index ; so rapid , in proportion to the revolution of the cylinder , that it makes a line which is nearly vertical . The height to which this reaches indicates the extent or fulness of the arterial expansion . Then , after making a momentary stay , it begins to descend again as the artery collapses . But its movement of descent is much less rapid than that by which it had previously mounted ; so that while the line of ascent , as we have seen , is nearly vertical , the line of descent is very oblique , showing that a considerably longer time is occupied by the subsidence of the artery than was required for its distention . Besides this , there are almost always one , two , and sometimes three momentary reactions during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a kind of echo or reduplication of the original impulse , checking its subsidence , or even giving it again , for an instant , a slight upward movement . Sometimes these reduplications are very marked , so that they may be felt by the finger on the pulse ; but they are usually only perceptible by the aid of the sphygmograph . But , after all , the arteries are only the channels by which the blood is conveyed to the different tissues and organs of the body . They are the means of transportation , and nothing more . The real business of the blood is done in the substance of the organs and tissues , and while passing through another set of vessels , continuous with the arteries but quite different from them in appearance . These are the capillaries . The capillaries are a set of blood-vessels , very minute in size but countless in number . They are not visible to the naked eye , and require the powers of the microscope to reveal them ; but they are interwoven with the solid texture // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are penetrated throughout by innumerable channels , that unite , and separate , and reunite with each other in all directions , making everywhere a fine network of inosculating vessels . In this network there are , of course , numerous islets or interspaces , between which the capillary vessels run , and which are embraced by them on all sides . So the blood penetrates the substance of the organ and filters through it , so to speak , in myriads of little currents that leave no nook or cranny of its tissue unvisited . This is called the capillary circulation . It is really the most important part of the whole , for it is here that the secret processes of nutrition are carried on . It is while the blood is distributed in these minute and innumerable channels , and so brought into contact with the substance of the organs that it communicates to them the materials of nutrition which are necessary to vitality . By the aid of the microscope , we are enabled to see this capillary circulation . If the transparent web of the frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its position by fine threads , and the whole brought under the focus of a microscope and well illuminated , a view is presented that will excite the admiration of the most indifferent spectator . Here you seem actually to penetrate into the arcana of nature . The veil of her secrecy is withdrawn , and you are introduced into the field of her most hidden operations . Curiously enough , the first impression one receives on looking through a microscope at the details of the capillary circulation is not one of minuteness , but of grandeur . After all , there is nothing very surprising about this . The truth is , size is never an absolute , but only a relative quality . A mountain looks large to us , because it is bigger than we are . But a mountain , though it be Mont Blanc or Chimborazo , is a ridiculously insignificant wrinkle when regarded as an elevation on the surface of the globe ; and the earth itself , atmosphere and all , is a mere globule compared with the empty space in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of grandeur , because it introduces us into a new world . However minute the details of anatomical structure that we examine , we find everywhere the same complicated organization and the same perfection of vital activity that mark the animal creation as a whole , or the associated worlds of the solar system . Though the entire space included in the field of the microscope may not be over one-eighth of an inch in width , and though each globule of the blood moving through its vessels measures only one twelve-hundredth of an inch in diameter , the scene thus brought into view is one of the most intense and busy activity . The streets of no commercial metropolis ever presented an aspect of such restless animation as the bloodvessels of the capillary circulation . The blood globules look as if they were in a hurry . They dart along through the highways , and cut across through the communicating lanes and passages of the vascular network , as if the business they had to do would admit of no delay , and must be attended to at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for moment on the projecting edge of some promontory , or in the sharp turn of a bloodvessel , it sways backward and forward in a discontented sort of way , and the instant it is liberated hurries off to rejoin its companions and make up for lost time . When we remember that this intensity of movement is going on at the same time in the vascular organs all over the body , we can form some idea of the combined activity of the capillary circulation as a whole . The motion of the blood in the capillary vessels , though so rapid and incessant , is not pulsating , as it is in the arteries , but presents the appearance of a uniform and steady onward current . Now , as the heart drives the blood into the arteries , and the arteries in their turn carry it forward into the capillaries , how is // it that the movement of the blood loses its pulsating character , and is converted into a continuous and uninterrupted flow ? It is on account of the elasticity of the vessels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fluid subjected to it . XVhen water is driven by the strokes of a force-pump through unyielding leaden or iron pipes , it is thrown out in distinct jets at every movement of the piston , and ceases flowing in the intervals . But if the force-pump be supplied with an air-chamber , as is usually the case in a water is then driven out from the end of the hose in a continuous stream . The elastic air is compressed at each stroke of the piston , and in the next interval reacts upon the water , and thus keeps up the velocity of its current . The same thing happens in the circulation . The elasticity of the arteries themselves modifies very much the intermittent force of the heart 's action , and thus tends to make the current of the blood more continuous . The difference between the periods of distention and collapse in a small artery at some distance from the heart is much less than in a large one near the centre of the circulation ; because the blood has already been subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which it has passed . But when the blood arrives at the entrance of the capillary system this influence is suddenly increased to an extraordinary degree . The blood is then spread out , as we have seen , into a multitude of minute , inosculating vessels , and the effect of their elastic pressure is accordingly multiplied to a corresponding extent . The pressure under which the blood moves is then completely continuous , and the capillary currents glide through their channels with a uniform velocity . When the blood has passed through the capillary vessels it has done its work . It then enters the commencement of the veins that stand ready to receive it , and begins its homeward journey toward the heart . But during this short passage the blood has undergone a remarkable change . As it enters the capillary network from the arteries , it is a pure , nutritious fluid , of a bright scarlet hue , and rich in the vivifying principles that serve for the maintenance of life . As it leaves the capillaries and enters the veins it is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer fit for the purposes of the circulation . There are , accordingly , two different kinds of blood contained in the vessels on the two sides of the capillary system . On the one hand is the arterial blood coming to the capillaries , on the other the venous blood going away from them . What has produced this striking alteration ? It is the action of the blood itself in the nourishment of the tissues . As it penetrates , by the vascular network , through the substance of the organs , it unloads its precious cargo of organic material , for the benefit of the tissues . The vitalizing oxygen , the nutritious albumen , the various saline and other matters needed for the composition of the organs , are given up to them by an instantaneous transfer . It is for this purpose that the blood has performed the passage of the arterial circulation ; and when it arrives at the capillaries it impoverishes itself exactly in the same proportion that it enriches the tissues of the part . But this is not all . The blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishing substances which they require , but it collects from them all the worn out materials which have accumulated instead . It gives them good money fresh from the mint , and takes in exchange the dishonored paper of broken or doubtful banks . No wonder , then , that it looks differently before passing the capillary network and afterward . The alteration in its color is only an indication of the important change that has taken place in its constitution and in its properties . The venous blood is no longer fit for the nourishment of the body , and if forced // to continue the circulation in that condition , far from imparting to the organs the elements of strength and vitality , would bring only insensibility and death . Accordingly , the venous blood , collected everywhere from the extremities of the system , goes back to the heart to be renovated and restored . It retraces its course , so to speak , from the circumference of the vascular system to the centre , and so completes the double movement of the circulation .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
