INTRODUCTION IN PRESENTING these three plays of George Henry Boker , it must be said at once that they do not represent his best literary work , and that they fail to reflect adequately his importance to the American theater . Their appearance here is justified by the fact that they are good examples of types of play that once flourished on our stage , and thus take on a peculiar value for students and lovers of the theater . They also constitute all that remained unpublished of the work of an important dramatist in the history of our national literature . George Henry Boker is the author of a great poetic tragedy , Francesca da Rimini , which alone should be enough to preserve his memory to posterity . It is difficult to think of another romantic tragedy written in English in the nineteenth century , which combined so well as Francesca da Rimini the power of poetry and the quality which keeps a dramatic work alive upon the stage for many years to delight and move successive generations of playgoers . Written in 1853 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York and Philadelphia in 1855 ; in 1882 , at the height of his career , Lawrence Barrett discovered the play and made it one of his principal vehicles during the remaining nine years of his life . Ten years later , during the season of 1901-1902 , Mr. Otis Skinner , Barrett 's first Paolo , revived the play for the road and played the part of Lanciotto in the principal cities of the country , achieving a triumph which many of his admirers regard as the artistic pinnacle of his career . Yet this play is by no means the sum of its author 's artistic achievement . Calaynos and Leonor de Guzman are almost on the same high level of achievement , and in more fortunate circumstances or in different times they might well have won lasting success , instead of falling , after a brief recognition , victims to the unhappy circumstances which prevailed in the theater of the day . Altogether Boker wrote eleven plays , of which seven were on the stage and eight were published , although not all of his acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring to light all that remained unpublished . Francesca da Rimini , Leonor de Guzman and Calaynos have been mentioned as the masterpieces of Boker , but besides these , one should suppose that five others , Anne Boleyn , The Betrothal , Knigsmark , Nydia , and Glaucus might hold a permanent place among the best dramatic literature of their times . One of these , Glaucus , is here published for the first time . Boker had the natural gifts of the born dramatist , but he was a poet as well . The seven published volumes of his poetry , together with his fugitive poems published in magazines , constitute a major contribution to our literature . Neglected at the time of his death in 1890 , and for many years afterward , his poetry has won critical recognition in recent times , and begins to take a well deserved position in the anthologies among the memorable works of his countrymen . The explanation of the neglect of so much of Boker 's work during his lifetime would involve a biographical study inappropriate to this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited great wealth in Philadelphia , he was too prosperous to be picturesque , but this hardly explains his relationship to a community which had remained equally oblivious to the variegated picturesqueness of Edgar Poe and Walt Whitman . As in the case of these others , both the time and the place were unfavorable to the work that Boker had to do . He was a belated romantic in a world attuned to the new realism ; and failing to achieve the recognition that his nature craved  --  a recognition which Whitman , at least , knew how to do without  --  he turned his active energies more and more to public life , to the organization of Northern sentiment in the Civil War , and later , to foreign diplomacy . Of the three plays here published , two were presented on the stage : The World a Mask in 1851 , and The Bankrupt in 1855 . That they both had short runs is not a significant fact in those days when actors and managers would rather revive an old or foreign play than present a recent native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a native dramatist was assured only in case his work proved an extraordinary popular success ; and in that event , even , the actor or manager was usually not interested in continuing it on the stage unless he could persuade its author to sell it outright to him for a sum ridiculously less than the profit that the play would bring him . The familiar story of the relationships of Forrest with the authors Robert Montgomery Bird and John Augustus Stone is indicative of the situation which prevailed . In the case of Boker 's two comedies , however , there was no such overwhelming popular approval , and the plays were retired from the stage after the average short runs to which even good American plays in that day were limited . The fact is , however , that any native play of the period which succeeded in reaching the stage at all , against such overwhelming handicaps as were inherent in the business organization of the theater , must of necessity be of interest in the history of the American stage . Boker 's plays are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present volume , presents a somewhat different problem . Unlike the earlier comedies , it is in blank verse , and ranks , indeed , among its author 's best literary productions . It is a work of the poet 's last period of artistic maturity , written in 1885 , at Lawrence Barrett 's suggestion . It was written directly for the stage and might perhaps have stood near to Francesca da Dimini in the actor 's repertoire of popular plays , but for a personal disagreement between the writer and the actor which caused the latter to refuse the work . It may be of value to give some account of the history and the manuscripts of each play , and to explain the relationships between the text here presented and the notes which appear at the end of this volume . The fact that there are several manuscripts of each play has presented an editorial problem . Variant readings among the manuscripts are of three sorts : corruptions and errors of transcription ; differences between the " literary " and the " acting " form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention . The texts here reproduced represent what appears to be Boker 's latest judgment concerning each passage for reading as a work of literature . Variants , and cuts for stage presentation are indicated in the notes at the end of the volume . A short account of each play is given below . THE WORLD A MASK The World a MaskFootnote : 1kb represents an experimental stage in the development of its author . He had already written , within two years , three plays in blank verse . Calaynos and Anne Boleyn , both tragedies , had satisfied his artistic conscience ; and his romantic comedy , The Betrothal , was successfully on the stage of the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia in September 1850 , at the very time when its author was beginning his work on The World a Mask . The latter play was composed with an eye to a popular taste of the day . This called for prose comedy , with a melodramatic complexion , preferably concerned with English high life . It was a bad taste to begin with , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Boker to succeed with this artificial type of play . As a result , this dramatist , who was later to rise to the accomplishment of such fine plays as Leonor de Guzman and Francesca da Rimini , produced in this case a play that was just about average for its time and sort . That is another way of saying that it was rather bad  --  and no one knew it better than the author . He finished the play in December 1850 . In January 1851 , when he wrote to his friend Bayard Taylor that it was about to be produced , he recounted with amazement the admiration of the audience of actors  --  probably the stock company at the Walnut Street Theatre  --  to whom he had read it . To Taylor , Boker summed up his own reaction : " It is a damn bad play and all the praise in the world can make it no better . " Nevertheless the piece was put in rehearsal at the Walnut Street Theatre on April 15 , 1851 , and opened on April 21 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed of regular members of the company . Charles Couldock , famous " heavy , " played the villain , Galldove , and Mme. Ponisi the unfortunate Teresa , the sham countess . Apparently , judging from the praise of the press , the comedy was successful ; but its author remained unconvinced by these encomiums . On the day after the opening he . wrote Bayard Taylor , " Never was a comedy worse played to a better-natured audience ... the best effects were marred , and the whole edge taken off the wit ( such as it is ) .... Why , notwithstanding all this , the curtain fell amid cheers and calls , instead of flying benches , cat-calls , and yells of derision , the devil , who must have had a proper care of the whole thing , only knows . The piece was completely successful , much to my astonishment . " This play has had four titles . On October 15 , 1850 , Boker wrote Bayard Taylor , " I am hard at work on ' The Sycophant , ' a detestable wretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fifth act . " The earliest surviving manuscript , in Boker 's hand , is entitled All the World a Mask . This , which affords the best version for reading , has been made the basis of the present text . It is referred to in the notes as MS I. A second manuscript , referred to as MS II , is apparently the version used in the performance of the play . It is in longhand , not Boker 's , and may be the work of a theater copyist . The acts are bound separately and Act I bears a printed title-page with the title , The World a Mask , which has been retained here as the best title for the play . In this copy there are some corruptions , and a good many " cuts " to hasten performance . The stage directions have been greatly amplified and scene plots have been added . The original ending has been cut and several new speeches added to form a new ending , with the apparent intention of heightening the comic nature of the concluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending was distinctly not an improvement . The latest manuscript , here referred to as MS III , is a typed copy dated 1886 , the year when the dramatist , probably in contemplation of a complete edition of his works , had typed copies of several of his plays prepared . This version is entitled Under a Mask . The authority of MS III is in serious doubt . There are no marks on it to indicate either supervision or revision by the author and it abounds in errors which he would not have made . The typist , apparently consulting both previous manuscripts , has followed the one or the other with apparent indiscrimination and frequent confusion . For the present text the three manuscripts have been critically collated with a view to presenting the play in its most readable form . With this end in view it was found desirable to retain Boker 's original version , MS I , in almost every case , indicating all variant readings in the notes , to which the superimposed numbers in the text refer . All " cuts " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few of the additions of MS II have been retained in the printed text , with proper annotation , when they seemed to improve or clarify the reading . The stage directions of MS II have been reproduced in the text , since the original version was deficient in this respect ; but scene plans and the occasional director 's notes and comments have been ignored . The names , which were frequently abbreviated in all the manuscripts , have been given in full . The very few variants in MS III which might prove critically interesting , have been included in the notes . THE BANKRUPT Boker wrote his greatest tragedy and his least successful comedy in the same year , 1853 . Having finished Francesca da Rimini in March , he made an excursion into a field new to him , the portrayal of melodramatic materials from the contemporary scene . The BankruptFootnote : 1kb was not a bad example of the type of play that it represents ; but the type itself was bad , and Boker was dissatisfied with the result of his effort . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he withheld his name as author . No mention of it has been found in his correspondence . He did not include it in his collected works in 1856 . To the reader of the present , however , it serves as a good example of a sort of melodrama which enjoyed a long vogue upon the stage  --  although that interesting consideration does not alter the fact that like most surviving plays of this variety , it is deficient in reality of character , artificial in dialogue and extravagant in situation . Two other facts , connected with the plot of this play , are of great interest for the historian . First , it is a very early example of the use of modern financial operations as material for dramatic situation ; and in its combination of the domestic drama with the financial crisis it looked forward to plot material which was to find its popular use much later , in the work of Bronson Howard and subsequent authors . Also The Bankrupt represents an early , if indeed not the first instance of the employment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of a master criminal mind . Poe had already popularized this situation in prose fiction , and it is most interesting to observe that , in the last scene , Pike , the detective , informs Shelvill , the crook , that he has been trapped at last by a writing in cipher that has been interpreted by a poet whom he employed , a Mr. Poe . The Bankrupt was advertised for performance in 1855 , as a part of the repertory of Julia Dean ( Mrs. Hayne ) when that actress fulfilled an engagement from November 12 to December 12 at the Broadway Theatre , New York . It was first performed on December 3 , and ran for four successive performances , until December 6 . The newspaper criticism was lukewarm , and there is no record to indicate that the play was ever subsequently revived . In 1886 , when Boker apparently considered a complete edition of his plays , which never materialized , he prepared a new version of this play , of which the typescript survives , entitled A Commercial Crisis . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original speeches , resulting in a decided improvement . These changes may , however , have been made much earlier with a view to the stage performance in 1855 . At any rate , long passages are stricken out in the original manuscript and not reproduced in the typescript of 1886 . The present text represents the later version , but all variant readings have been indicated in the notes . For this purpose the original longhand manuscript of 1853 is referred to as MS I ; the typescript of 1886 , as MS II . GLAUCUS It has already been stated that Glaucus is the most satisfactory of the three plays in the present volume , both for its literary quality and its adaptability for performance on the stage . It was , in fact , written directly for the stage , in 1885 , at the request of Lawrence Barrett , who was at that time appearing with great success in a revival of Boker 's Francesca da Rimini . I have , in another connection , recorded in some detail the curious circumstances which prevented the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , briefly , are these : Barrett had asked Boker to write " a play in which he could introduce a number of gorgeous spectacular effects ... something that would give the ingenuity of the stage carpenter , the scene painter and the costumer a chance . " Using the story of Bulwer-Lytton 's Last Days of Pompeii , Boker first supplied the actor with the blank verse play , Nydia . Note : 1Kb Barrett declined this play , probably on the grounds that the principal character was Nydia , the blind slave . This assumption is justified by the fact that Boker at once began work on another and independent treatment of the same story , diminishing the part of Nydia and emphasizing that of Glaucus . This play , also in blank verse , was completed on January 9 , 1886 , and tentatively accepted by the actor . Before final arrangements were made , however , a misunderstanding arose between the actor and the author . It seemed to Boker that Barrett , knowing that the author was exceedingly well-to-do , was attempting to secure royalty terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous for any author who was forced to earn his living by his pen . On this point Boker , who had been a leader in the agitation to secure better protection for American authorship , was not to be dissuaded . The popularity of Francesca da Rimini was so great that the actor was compelled to compromise with Boker in respect to the earlier play . However , he nursed for some time a strong sense of injury which caused him to abandon the plans for the production of Glaucus . There are two manuscripts of Glaucus , both typewritten . Footnote : 1kb It seems likely that an earlier manuscript in longhand may have existed , but it has not been found . MS I is the earlier of the two surviving manuscripts . It bears the typed notation on the first page , " Begun Oct. 18 , 1885 and finished January 9 , 1886  --  83 days . " It seems that the poet may have discussed this manuscript with the actor , for it bears extensive suggestions for " cuts , " which , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve only to shorten the acting duration of the play . A second manuscript is undated , but is consistent in form with several manuscripts of the poet 's other plays which were prepared in 1886 for a complete edition which did not materialize . This has been designated as MS II in the notes for the present edition . Most of the " cuts " suggested in MS I were also indicated in MS II , although the actual text was unaltered . For this reason it seems probable that the longer , and uncut form of the play is the version which the poet preferred and the one which he probably would have printed . In the present edition care has been exercised to indicate in the notes all the deletions which were suggested for the purpose of acting . There is a curious addendum to MS II , consisting of new material to follow note 21 on p. 164 of the present edition . It consists of a shorter version of Act II from that point and another Act III , also abbreviated , but not different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtailing the duration of the play on the stage . It is not reproduced in this edition . It is a pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness and to offer my thanks for the assistance of others in the publication of this volume . My colleague , Professor Arthur Hobson Quinn , the first American historian to direct attention to the poetry and plays of Boker , has assisted me in ways too numerous to specify . I am grateful to Mr. Barrett H. Clark for the devotion to our native drama which has materialized in the series of publications of which this volume is a part . To the Princeton University Library I am deeply indebted for their courtesy in according me the freest possible access to these manuscripts , all of which are in their collection .
