T N reading the novels , the personal memoirs , and the letters of the last generation , and of the generation before the last , we occasionally meet the phrase , " a sociable dish of tea . " To the entertainment thus described , our mothers and grandmothers gathered on special summons , or went without warning on general invitation ; and even our fathers and grandfathers despised neither the tea nor the sociability that sweetened it . But the thing and its name have passed away together from among those who reckon themselv* society ; within which not very clearly-defined circle it lives only in the memory of some morose old bachelors under the ignominious phrase , A tea fight . We drink tea , even more of it and better than our fathers and mothers used to drink , but we do so for the sake of the tea-hastily at breakfast , with the train or the omnibus lurking in the bottom of the cup , or like medicine after the fatigues of the day , to invigorate us for , the fatigue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vogue as the word disk is to designate the vessel out of which we drink it . Esthetic tea may possibly still be had in certain parlors consecrated to 1'vlinerva , but sociable teas are no longer given-no not even by Sorosis . That foreshadow of the woman of the future-let us be daily thankful that she is not the woman of the present-invites to tea , and gives a solemn dinner with a final course of spe*ches ; a proceeding in which there is nearly as much sociability as there is in a coronation or a sea-fight . Tea-parties , sociable and esthetic , have been made the butt of much ridicule , which was not wholly undeserved ; but their disappearance proves to have been the sign of a rapidly approaching change in the character of society . In its more important but secondary sense society is that more or less organized aggregation of men of which by birth or other accident every human being is a member . But this is an enlargement of its original and radical meaning , which is an unorganized number of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , have frequent intercourse and conversation , and among which each one of the number finds his daily companions . Of the latter , we form an abstract notion which we still call society ; as , for instance , when we say that a certain man goes much or little into society , or that such another is not in society , or that society in some ages and in some places has greater attractions than it has in others . Now , of society , as expressed by the word when it is used in the latter sense , sociableness , or the quality of promoting companionship , is the essential , vital element ; and out of the society of the day this element is fast vanishing , if it l*as not already disappeared . There is no more*marked or noticeable characteristic of our time than the unfitness of all our social habits and arrangements for their chief end ; in brief , this social trait is the unsociableness of society . Heretofore , social gatherings in all times and among all peoples , have been occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they are no longer so , at least among us Anglo-Saxon folk . It was reserved for us at this age , when culture is high and widely diffused , when manners have a mildness before unknown , when the means of comfortable and even of luxurious life are common , and when there is a social science , if not an art of skciety , to make such gatherings , in nearly all the forms in which they are known to us , toilsome , z6 // saddening , forbidding in the prospect , oppressive in the present , and exasperating in the memory ; something for which men fortify themselves , which they undergo , and from which they are relieved by the lapse of time and the progress of events . Who speaks of society in terms and tones of real enjoyment Who looks forward to meeting a number of his acquaintances at the house of one of them with any anticipation of pleasure in the meeting for the meeting 's sake ? To a young girl who has just passed the threshold of society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the light in which she is told that she looks beautiful , or to the hum which she fancies is one of admiration and of pleasure , to any woman who expects to meet him who is , or whom she wishes to be her lover , to any lover who expects to meet his mistress , society , even in its most common and oppressive forms , is not only endurable but delightful . But such persons do not go into society for the sake of its sociability , the latter being proverbially the most unsociable of human creatures . And leaving these out , and a few very young men who may really like that empty evolution of the social parade called dancing , what human creature who has attained discretion , with the years supposed to bring it , speaks of society-that society which makes the season-except in those tones of faint disgust and conscious self-sacrifice which indicate that the thing spoken of is a bore that must be endured ? And yet what pains , what money , what anxiety does not society cost ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What years of work and worry , nay , of duplicity , dissimulation and self-abasement , will not women go through to attain that triumph  --  the emptiest of all those at which the inevitable voice is heard , reminding the victor of mortality ! Of what bitter disappointments and what inextinguishable heart-burnings is not that hope the cause ! And all for what ? The nearly unanimous verdict of those who are most competent to pass upon it , men who are past thirty , and women who are past twenty-five-pronounces society dreary , barren , hopeless . We spend so much on it , and we get so little in returi* and as we look back and see that our forefathers who had so little to spend got so much , the product seems to be great in proportion as the tillage is small . Strange to say , the commonest form which society assi*mes is the least endurable . It is called Reception , or a being-at-home ; and surely over this the host and hostess should use the short but sufficient form of grace so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to receive the Lord make us truly thankful . " Could thanks be more heartily due than for the self-sacrifice of the half of one 's five hundred friends ? Our fathers and mothers used to go to " parties ; " and to those parties they received invitations to which they were expected to send replies . This was one advantage ; for the hostess knew just whom and how many to expect . The party was of variable size and pretensions . If it were informal , sometimes not more than twenty-five or thirty people would be present ; and *eie would be a little music , ballad singing , glees , piano-forte playing ( of which there was often too much ) , cards , perhaps a quadrille , and a light supper ; after which the guests did not remain long , except the intimates of the family , who lingered to discuss the little event with the ladies of the family , and to gossip , and perhaps spice their talk with a few grains of not very harmful scandal upon the re.velations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to a formidable assemblage , gathered by issuing five or six hundred invitations two or three weeks before the evening of the entertainment which was formal and splendid in proportion to the numbers summoned to take part in it . But whatever its dimensions or its pretensions , whether given by a rich man or a // poor one , by the cultivated or the rude , the party was sociable , and the occasion of much social enjoyment . Ask any woman who is full fifty-five years old , and being yet fond of society , has sense enough to own her age , what were the pleasures at parties compared with those now attainable ? and if she is a woman of any enthusiasm she will reward you with an overflow of bright reminiscences that will astonish and delight you , and make you wish that you could have enjoyed that form of society ; but with the women of to-day . For the women of to-day are more beautiful than those of yesterday . But the party has disappeared except in the remotest rural districts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have Reception . For this , cards are sent out to all the acquaintances of the hostess , not asking them for the pleasure of their company and thus not needing any reply , but merely informing them that she will be at home on a certain morning or evening , or on certain mornings or evenings , and leaving it to their untramr*elled caprice whether they will visit her house ( not her ) on one or on all of the designated days . And on his arrival what does her guest find ? A throng of people in exceedingly good clothes , but so crowded together that no woman 's toilet , no man 's presence , is seen to any advantage . As for natural and easy grouping the result of mutual attractions and repulsions , it is as likely to be found in a railway station among the crowd that awaits the opening of the door to rush into the departing train . Such is the appearance of thronging , and of nervous exl ) ectation of a coming something that never comes , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in the street , or is overlooked entirely , except in a few striking instances , or by those who have quiet eyes and cool judgments . Of his hostess he sees nothing more than that prescribed society smile which she assumes as he approaches and passes her . And as for him , so for all others . He visits her ; but she and her husband and her daughters , if she has them , are on this occasion the least conversible people in the room . They are too much engaged with a multitude of guests tqhave any time at the disposal of one . But who is conversihle at a reception ? What man or woman ever learned anything of another man 's or woman 's nature at one of these purposeless gatherings ? Peopie may meet thrice a week at Reception the season through , as people often do , and know no more of each other at the end of the last than they did at the beginning of the first . The Reception seems to be contrived to make not only sociability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite impossible , and what Dr. Johnson called a good talk is as unattainable as it would be at a meeting of the BoardI of Brokers . To put any thought or feeling into what one says under such circumstances is a feat only to be performed by those who to the rare ability to think add the rarer gift , a genius for society . And if it is too much , as it is , to ask for an utterance of thought or feeling in the intercourse of miscellaneous society , at least it is not too much to expect a full flow of animal spirits , a lightening up of the passing hour by real gayety of heart , such as we find evidence of in the literature of past generations , in the writings of Irving , of Fieldling. and of Addison , not to go back to those of the Restoration or the days of Elizabeth . But of this we find no trace in the pictures of society in our own day , drawn by such minute and faithful pens as those of Thackeray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trollope . At the Reception even gayetv and animal spirits are lacking . The talk is in small , dry , thin sentences , which are to real social intercourse what yesterday 's sandwiches are to a whole some dinner . Even love-making would be impossible , were it not that love may be made by the manner in which a cup f chocolate is handetl and accepted . // A reception if not crowded is regarded as a failure by the hostess , and as dull by the greater number of her guests . And yet the crowd makes rational , or , let us say , irrational enjoyment quite impossible . It makes the mere moving about from one acquaintance to another among ladies ' trains a trial of skill and patience , a cause of real anxiety . The music , if there is any , is almost sure to be pox ; and , good or bad , is listened to for politeness ' sake and under protest . Music to be enjoyed must be heard in the opera-house or concert-room ; or , better , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , best of all , where in the fading light of the sinking sun , or in the deepening twilight , one priestess ministers to one of the initiated . And yet , of all the music that I ever heard , the sweetest came one early morning in the spring when I woke and heard in a not distant room a young mother singing , with soulful voice , Schubert 's " Ave Maria " over her ailing child . After waking to such music on earth , what need to die that I may hear the seraphs ' songs in heaven ? And I have heard the " Aye " at receptions where it was as much in place as one of those eloquent prayers that the Reverend Dr. - addresses to his audience . As to what is in place at these entertainments , and what can be done there except the exhibition of so man.y dollars ' worth of silk , and lace , and jewels , and the eating and drinking of so many dollars ' worth of supper , it is past my poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a m*n of commpn sense , not to say of culture and intelligence , a patient mention of Reception , or any suggestion for the relief of its dreariness , * any hope that improvement was possible . In former days men dissipated their lives in. social pleasure ; but at Receptions , whether they are those soirtfes that are given in the morning , or those ma/int*es that take place in the evening , there is not dissipation , there is only waste-waste of time and dull discomfort , amid splendor and profusion . One might as well seek dissipation in a reckless round of funerals . It is impossible to get together people of ordinary intelligence and breeding without a chance of some pleasure in the meeting and following intercourse , to some of them . But in the Reception this chance is reduced to the lowest possible proportion , and the pleasure is diluted to its weakest form . What is possible at it is simply a display of fine furniture and an overloaded table by the hostess , of costly dresses by the women , a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , a glance of envy , or contempt , or of insolent criticism from woman to woman , a bow , an offer of the arm to luncheon or to supper , eating and drinking under the most uncomfortable circumstances-light kid gloves , no table , and generally no seat  --  and an uneasy waiting for the moment when it will do to break away . Gradually the crowd thins , and the wearied hostess is relieved of her wearied gu*ts ; those of them who take leave of her assuring her that her entertainment has been a charming success , and begging her not to forget them when she is at horse again . Good creature , she will not forget them ; for she sends her cards to every presentable human being that she knows ( and would send them to the pugs and the poodles if they would give d.c/at to her reception ) ; and they all go again because it wo n't do to stay away , and all are bored again , entertainer and entertained . And this is the commonest , most sociable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stage of civilization . The most firmly-rooted , too ; for although it is condemned by the universal voice as oppressively wearisome , there seems to be no hope of displacing it until there comes some thorough upturning of the social structure . Against the inclination of all men , and of most women , it holds its place for a strange , disheartening reason . It enables // people who entertain to do their work with the least possible sacrifice of time and trouble . True , they get together a miscellaneous crowd of people whose company they do not enjoy , and who do not enjoy each other 's company ; but then they can invite their acquaintances in the mass , and entertain them in the mass , by not entertaining them at all , except by feeding them with costly food . " How delightfully these people entertain ! " said a man to me as he stood eating pii defois gras and drinking Asman shauser , in extreme discomfort amid a surging crowd , his plate and glass upon the mantel-piece , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the whole evening he had not exchanged three words with host or hostess , after the first greeting ; but his mouth was full of the delicious viand , and although the wine had not yet mellowed him , it had excited in him that gratitude which is a sense of favors to come . Now , lati defois is a good creature , and Asmanshauser makes glad the heart of man ; and , therefore , should they be enjoyed with the accompaniment of pleasant companionship , with ease and comfort , and the charm of lively or of thoughtful but unpremeditated talk-in a word , sociably . But entertainers now simply gather their company and give them their food . They cry , " Here is a splendid sty , and here some glorious swill ! Who will come ? " And the animals throng into the sty , and rush to the trough , and go away filled and satisfied . This style of entertainment relieves the entertainers of all the care of the selection of guests , and of arrangement for their pleasure by bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthering friendship . In brief ; it relieves them of the trouble of entertaining at all . They have no longer on their hands the task of lighting up sociability , and scattering social pleasures among their guests . But this trouble and this task are the highest duty , and should be the gr ea*est pleasure of a host and hostess . To be rid of them is to be rid of the essential virtue and the crowning grace of hospitality . Without them , entertainment lacks only the payment of some shot or score to be a mere kind of tavern-keeping . This gross fashion of society is in certain accord with other fashions of the day . As we seek to save labor by making garments , and shoes , and household articles by the thousand , and according to one pattern , no longer demanding , except among the wealthiest and most fastidious people , the making of one article by one man expressly for another , so we attempt to make society by manipulating it in the mass , and according to one stereotyped form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thus lose all the grace of peculiar fitness , and all the value of thorough excellence , so in our attempt to make society by ordering so many guests and so much food for them , we lose all the essentials of society , except its primitive and coarsest conditions , the mere aggregation of individuals , and so much festivity as consists in feeding . But the Reception enables entertainers to do their social duties , and pay off their social debts in the lump . Every one on the visiting list has cards ; all may come if they choose to do so , and if they do n't choose , they are " asked and got rid of . " Special pains are taken either in the invitation or the entertainment of such guests only as will give some distinction to the assembly , and make it what in vile phrase is called a social success . The guest may be a coarse-mannered , coarse-minded soldier , whom the fortune of war has lifted into notice  --  a man who a few years before his hostess would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed in nothing but his rank and his importance ; or a speculator , who has " struck ile " in one of the various forms in which that fluid spouts into some people 's faces ; or a woman who has neither position nor money , but who by personal // allurement , or perhaps the gift of song , has become a celebrated social magnet , capable of attracting alike the heavy weights , and the keen and polished blades of society . Another cause of the origin of this form of entertainmeuf and reason of its continuance , notwithstanding its depressing effect in general , and its reat disfavor with those who pay for it-men-is that it suits the ostentatious spirit of modern society . It enables host , hostess , and guests to make the greatest possible display of money 's worth , with the least possible expenditure of time and thought , and also-what is no less important  --  the least possible opportunity for a blunder in taste . In fact , receptions have come to be , on the part of the hosts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the hostess and her female guests , a rivalry of toilets . The men who attend them , and whose numbers diminish yearly as their disgust increases , are drawn by a sense of duty to host and hostess , or by a gross love of feasting , or by the expectation on the part of one or another , of meeting some l ) articLllar woman , whom he hopes to please by singling her out as the recipient of his attentions . But the main-spring of this social movement is ostentation , which finds vent chiefly in the dress of women . in any public report of a private entertainment ( as to the fitness of which only a misanthrope or a cynic could have a doubt ) the chief part of the account is taken up with a description of the ladies ' dresses . For is it not a matter of great moment that it should be announced to the world that on a certain evening Mrs. Bull wore diamonds , and Mrs. Bear wore pearls , and that Miss A. covered her corset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with silk and lace ? Marry , come up What could be socially more important ? There may not have been the faintest spark of real hilarity , not a good thing said , not one pleasant quarter of an hour of social intercourse , not one heart happier , or even gayer , for the gathering ; but were there not the diamonds and the pearls , the tulle , the silk , and the lace ? And was there not the supper , at which all the men , including the women , ate and drank at great cost ? Go to I what would you have , grum blers that you are , and ungrateful ? Turning from the more numerous social assemblies to dinners , in which the guests must needs be few in number , and selected by special invitation and acceptance , we find in these the same unsociability , the same weariness , the same predominance of the grosser elements of the entertainment , the same motive power of ostentation . Men should not go to a feast to feed . They can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give their wives and children , get it at a restaurant . But men do go to dinners , and what is worse , they are entertained at dinners as if the chief object of the gathering was eating and drinking . Certainly , if a man makes a feast , it should be worthy of his means , his taste , and the guests whom he has bidden . It is not well to biing men from their homes and families by formal invitation , to eat mutton and turnips among people of that condition in which dinner usually consists of something daintier . Dr. Johnson once complained of the quality of a dinner which he had just left , and on Boswell 's remarking that it was a very good dinner , replied , " Yes , sir , but not good enough to ask a man to . " Dinners should always be good enough to please the guests whom they are to be set before ; but this end being attained , the eating and drinking should be left wilbout further consideration . Enough wholesome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in courses at such intervals as tempt appetite and encourage sociability-this is all that is required for a dinner of demigods , except among those to whom // the pleasure of the palate-grossest and most bestial of all pleasures in which the senses take chief part-is respectable and worthy the care of reasonable creatures . There are men to whom it does not seem wasteful and degrading to take a certain amount of money , and after spending much time in seasoning it , A. and stuffing it , and parboiling it , and seasoning it again , arid farcing it , and finally cooking and ornamenting it , to eat up and utterly destroy this money in this shape , for the mere pleasure they feel while it passes from their teeth to their gullets . Such men have very little concern in the sociability of dinner . " Plain living and high thinkino- " has been set up as the rule of the best social life . it is one of the rules that will insure that life ; but like most rules it is subject to exception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , indeed , what is plain living must be determined by a man 's breeding , and means , and habits . But the point is this , that when high living becomes the subject of plain thinking in any society , the decline and fall of that society is nigh . It is in this sense that we should take no thought of what we shall it and what we shall drink , and wherewithal we shall be clothed ; not that we shall not provide for our necessities and our comforts , but that we shall not give our whole minds to the lust of the flesh and the pride of life . One of the reasons why dinner-parties are generally so oppressive is their profusion . Course follows course , and xvine wine , until mind and body are both weary with the multitudinous succession . True , a man may not eat of all the dishes , or drink of all the wine , like him who fe1t it his duty to go through the bill of fare at his hotel . But not knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least of each course , and unless he is a very skilful diner , he may find himself cloyed before the arrival of some dish that he would have made the main part of his repast . And in any case , the course of the dinner must be run , and he who passes certain dishes untouched , unless he is a very ready and agreeable talker , and has a willing listener at his side , is apt to find himself left alone for a little while in the midst of a festive company . Soup , fish , roast and game , with salad and dessert is enough for any creature whose god is not his belly . But since men will undertake an indefinite succession of hot viands , the introduction of Roman punch in the middle of the dinner is one of the most beneficent inventions of sensuous epicureanism . It revives the spirits , sets a new edge on the appetite , stimulates the dulled palate , and starts the diner , whose zest had begun to flag , afresh upon his apician pilgrimage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dinner , in which such a fillip to the flagging powers is needful . Another cause of the lack of sociability in the dinners of the present day , is that perfection of arrangement and attendance , by which all the sitters at a wellappointed table in a rich house , even the host himself , are relieved from all trouble connected with the service of dinner , and have only to eat and enjoy what is carved out of their sight and placed silently before them . It would seem that a table on which there are only fruit and flowers , glass and silver , and where the guests have , as they should have full sight of each other , and need have no other thought than the enjoyment of their dinner , and of agreeable conipanionship , would be the high altar of sociability and elegant conviviality . And such it might be , were all those around it , or the most of them , accomplished men of society , full of resource , without shyness , or hesitation , or prejudice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best social surroundings . There is more sociability in a party of a dozen well-bred gentlemen , dining in red shirts among the Adirondacks , off trout served on cedar chips , // than among the same men in full dress at an elegant table with dinner served 4 la Russe . And the difference is not produced mainly by the absence , in the former case , of fine clothes and formality . Fine clothes hamper only those who are unused to them , and formality at dinner is carried out with the fish . The chief reason of the greater sociability in the camp dinner is that there is between the diners a continuing bond and stimulus of mutual service . The little attentions of the table , which are done away by the fashion of having the dinner invisible , except as each principal dish is paraded for inspection , are not only one means of good training in the minor offices of politeness , but they help materially the sociability of the table . At dinner served * la Russe , a morose and selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atbentive one . During the serious business of the dinner , neither has anything to do but to sit , and eat , and talk a little to his neighbor . But with the dinner on the table before them , the difference between the two would manifest itself constantly-in the neglect of his neighbors by the one , and his care for them by the other . And these kindly little offices bridge many a gap in friendship , or at least in acquaintanceship , and help shy people to struggle out of their Slough of Despond . If a certain dinner had been served * la Russe , Dr. Johnson would probably have sat by John XVilkes silent , and swelling with hatred until he blurted out some anathema that would have dismayed the company , and destroyed the conviviality of the occasion . But Will*s was so assiduous in his attentions , so thoughtful about the gravy , and finally so dainty and so pressing on the subject of kidney-fat , that surly Samuel could resist no longer , and broke down into sociable companionship with the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with . The passing away of the custom of taking wine with one another , is one more step toward selfish unsociability . We drink wine for the mere sake of its flavor and its stimulus ; but our fathers had this , and with it a sense of feasting together , con-viviality , given by the presence of the wine upon the table , the passing it from one to another , the drinking it with each other , accompanied by good wishes to the drinkers or to their common friends . The taking wine together , has begun the restoration of many a tottering friendship , and a magnanimous offer of the compliment has reopened many a closed acquaintance . To do this is one of the chief ends of social gatherings , and particularly of dinner-parties , the capacity of which in this direction is now much less than it must have been heretofore . Some bold talking is required for the perfect enjoyment of a dinner-party . An assuming , big-voiced , brazen-browed man is to be excluded as you would quarantine a pestilence . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , and if one man is its master , or two are , nothing is more welcome or enlivening than the discourse of the one , or the colloquy , or even the decorous dispute of the two , particularly if it comes toward the end of the evening , and is not too much prolonged . No party at a private house should be too large for one of the guests to talk to the whole table with as much ease as he would to his opposite neighbor . A large dinnerparty has all the miscellaneous oppressiveness of a mass-meeting without its varied interest or its weight of numbers . That sociability at dinner is increased by the presence of women , I do not believe ; nor do I think that it is diminished . Few observing men will fail to remember parties equally pleasant , and which consisted in one case of both sexes , and in the other of only one . The presence or absence of women changes the character of the pleasure , but does not enhance or diminish it . Without dis // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they are good counsellors in trouble , chat pleasantly , and listen to admiration , are not strong in steady talk . Their serious talk , like that of clergymen who are not men of the world , as Paul was , is apt to degenerate into preaching or praying . Unless he could be gratified with the company of the one or two women whom he most admires , a man who would be worth much at any dinner-table will not regret* their absence at this festivity as he would at almost every other . On this point , at least , the sexes are not equal . For a dinner-party composed of women only is a social dispensation for which no woman was ever yet heard to pray . Of all the drawbacks to social enjoyment at dinner , the greatest is speechmaking , be the speaker who he may , Demosthenes , or Cicero , or Webster , or John Bright . It is not necessary to refer here to the formal public dinner or banquet , with its regular toasts and speeches , and its reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the practice of calling up one or another man , at private dinner and supper parties , by drinking his health and saying that we should like to hear from him , is a piece of impertinent folly , the only possible palliation of which would be the confession on the part of those who are guilty of it , that they are too stupid to entertain each other , incapable , in fact , of real sociability . What is said on such occasions is almost never worth listening to ; it is neither oratory nor talk , but a lame halting between the two . But if it were in every way admirable , it should be discouraged , as the bane of sociability ; every lover of real social enjoyment and intelligent companionship should set his face against it , without mitigation or remorse . The redeeming social gathering of the present day is the breakfast , which , although not a novelty , has come into moderate vogue within the last fifteen or twenty years . And by a breakfast I do not mean those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundown with a heterogeneous succession of courses , and a mingled flood of wine-unsystematic , disorderly symposiums , not having the well-ar ranged fitness and timeliness of dinner , and having all the oppressive tediousness which the most imposing dinner could have-doing only one thing thoroughly and well , that which is done by no other-destroying a whole day . Whatever else a man may eat at one of these breakfasts , so called , he swallows twenty-four hours whole . But where a few friends are invited really to take breakfast in honor of some special guest , and the little party of not more than a dozen is seated at table not later than ten o'clock ( and it is better an hour earlier ) , and the hostess has her place , and no woman is finer than a dainty morning-dress will make her , and no man wears anything that he can not support without consciousness in his office , when Martha is not cumbered with much serving , and Mary sits at the feet of whatever master she chooses , and when after an hour at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and books , and pictures , the company breaks up , and all go to their day 's work , somewhat later than usual , it is true , but also somewhat invigorated and refreshed by the cool freshness of their social dawn , this is a fine example of real sociability . But the objection to breakfast as an entertainment is that it interferes with business ; and in this day , and particularly in this country of traders , it will not come into general vogue , except among ***ofessional men , and even among them breakfast must be merely a meal  --  the starting-point and the foundation of a day 's work , rather than an occasion of festive or even sociable enjoyment . Breakfast-par .. ties , too , are city entertainments . The guests should be within half an hour of their host , and should have regular and imperative business on their hands and near at hand , that an early breaking up of the party may be insured . // The advantages of real breakfast when compared with other entertainments of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essentials and none of the drawbacks to sociability .

It may be elegant , and yet so inexpensive as to be within the means of all cultivated people whose condition permits them to give any kind of entertainment . It is an entertainment free from the objection that society now excludes a very large proportion of those who are its fittest ministers , who are best adapted to adorn and to enrich it , and who are unable to bear their part in it because of its costliness , a costliness which comes of the work it hinders as well as of the money it demands .

The cause of the unsociableness of society , which grows yearly , and the general diffusion of this blight in Great Britain and the United States , is to be found chiefly in what is called the prosperity of the age . It is to be found in the dif . fusion of wealth , the aggregation of men in cities , rapid intercommunication by railways , the spread of democracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , if they d ? hoard will seek to display their riches ; and hoarding , always practised by the very few , is now less common than ever before . Wealth is most easily displayed in large cities ; and these make large circles of acquaintance , the attempt to entertain which , in the lump and with little trouble , produces Reception . When country and city are brought close together in time and in opportunity of observation , country and country towns will affect the fashions of the metropolis ; and among a democratic people , for whom the only external distinction is that of wealth , the tendency to uniformity of style in living must needs be greater than in any other kind of society , and unfortunately the drift is not toward simplicity on the part of the rich , but ostentation ; and toward imitation on the part of the poor . All the influences of the time seem to combine against a rational enjoyment of society . The publication of such a journal as " Harper 's Bazar , " by carrying fashion-plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules to make it withal , into the remotest recesses of the country , will do much to citify people who otherwise would be rustic and respectable ; and as one consequence of this transmogrification , ere long reception will have driven sociability out of log-cabins . The diffusion of literature and of a taste for reading is plainly inimical to sociability , by making conversation less attractive and less valuable as a means of information than it has been heretofore , and by enabling every man to find companionship , human companionsh ip , to his liking , which he can enjoy just when and just so long as he pleases to do so . A book comes without invitation , and goes without offence when you are weary . It never arrives too late or stays too long . And if you // 415 select your silent literary companions well , they talk to y.ou with more ease and with much more instructiveness than any man could , however gifted .

( I blush to say that the last sentence was written at the command of the publishers of this magazine , of whom I stand in mortal fear. ) in this respect cheap books and newspapers have long been moulding society , and not to its improvement . But books will not satisfy all man 's craving for companionship and conversation . He must look sometimes into the face of man , and particularly into the face of that kind of man that is called woman . Hepce society ; and hence , alas ! reception . Madam receives this evening . This should mean that Maclam is at home , in the simple and unconventional sense of the phrase , and is sitting in her parlor or elsewhere , with her family , engaged as they usually are at that time , but ready and pleased to see any of her friends who may choose to visit her . If few come , well ; if many , better .

And yet how much of such society is there among the wealthier people of any great city in Great Britain or the United States ? It exists almost in perfection in Cambridge , but in no other place known to me . To preserve it , exclusiveness and a certain provincialism seem necessary . And so , while Boston has less of it than Cambridge , and Philadelphia less than Boston , New York , where any man with a decent coat can go anywhere and be asked no questions , unless he *vishes to marry some one 's daughter or borrow some one s money , has none . The remedy for this state of things , so deplorable and so much deplored-a condition of society in which all the greatest ends and sweetest pleasures of society are , by general confession , sacrificed to the meanest and the coarsest , can easily he pointed out . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can be shown . The rich , by their example , are responsible for the practice of society . Let them give more entertainments to fewer guests at each ; and let them measure the " success " of an entertainment , not by the numbers of the guests and the splendor of the show , but by the pleasure which their friends seem to enjoy in each other 's company . Let them take some pains to break up their assembly into little congenial knots of people who divert themselves according to their tastes , so that all their guests may not be doing the same thing at the same time . Let them do thus , except on great and rare occasions , and sociability would reappear in society . It may be objected that this would take us back to the sociable dish of tea which was the starting point of-this essay . Possibly to something like that ; and if like it , but not the same  --  the difference being due to the unlikeness between us and our fathers and grandfathers-nothing better for society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociable enjoyment . A change must be made ere long , or some day all men for whom " society ' * does not mean " the German " will stand out in sullen revolt , will refuse to appear on social parade , and women will be left to exhibit the frivolous costliness of tl*eir toilets one to another .
