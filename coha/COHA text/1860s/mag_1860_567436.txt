" - EXOdUS XXXV , 30 , 31 32 . IN the first of these passages from the sacred Scriptures we are taught that God gives to men endowments , varying in kind and degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and amount , in his service . In the second we have an instance of a particular kind of endowment , given to one who was divinely called to exercise it for God 's pur* poses , viz , the endowment of inventive genius . On one of the days of the last week , from this Sanctuai*y , where he was accustomed to worship and to unite with fellow disciples in saci'ed communion at the table of the Lord , we bore to its burial the body of one of the most ingenious , useful and worthy inventors of this or any other age-CHARLES G.ODYEAR . Aud lie was one who recognized his peculiar endowment of inventive as a divine o'ift involvino ' a genius b b special and defined responsibility , and considered himself called of God , as was 3ezaleel , to that particular course of invention to which he devoted the chief part of his life . This he often expressed , though with his characteristic modesty , to his friends , especially his religious friends . Without presumption and iii great meekness , lie regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as thoroughly and as reverently as did ever ancient prophet , or modern minister or missionary of the Gospd . And lie was actuated and sustained throughout by a strong and sacred sense of duty to // God to fulfill this mission . It is this feature which gives to his life its chief interest in Christian minds , and makes it well worthy of contemplation and discourse on this sacred day , in this sacred place . For , in God 's providence and grace , exampies are given for our instruction in the modern as well as the ancient church . A full account of his life will not be expected within the limits of a single discourse . My object will be simply to set forth the facts aud experiences of his history , so far as will illustrate his ruling spirit , viz : that of one who labored not chiefly for himself , but as the commissioned servant of God and friend of man . His work as an inventor was very great and very beneficent . His merit in this respect was declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patents of the United States , in the case of the renewal of his patent , to " be the same in kind with that of the most illustrious inventors who have appeared in the world , and by Mat of few of tkem* 8urpa&amp;Sed in degree . " There would not be time , and this is not the place , to set forth , in any detail , the nature or the extent and beneficence of Mr. Goodyear 's inventions . Suffice it to say , in general and summary terms , that a product of natural vegetation , literally inexhaustible , since it comes from forest trees which grow in a belt of ten degrees each side of the equator around the whole glob c  --  a product before almost worthless , and which had for years resisted many and very expensive attempts to adapt it to useful purposes , such attempts all ending in pecuniary disaster-has been rendered by his inventive genius an article of inestimable value and of indispensable utility . By that process , in which his chief invention consists , this natural and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " elastic metal ; " and it was applied by him in many forms , some of them almost universal , to secure and promote the life , health , comfort , usefulness and happiness of mankind ; and it is capable of further useful application to an extent to which we can set no limits . Already the various modes of mechanical industry founded upon it give en to // thousands , and supply beneficcutly the wants of millions in all parts of the civilized world . I. The ruling aud truly religious feature of Mr. Goodyear 's character already announced , and which this discourse is designed to set forth , will be naturally illustrated , in the first place , by a brief sketch of his early life , and of the varied labors and trials through which he persevered till his first great success ; while , at the same time , a reasonable biographical interest will be satisfied . Mr. Goodyear was born in New Haven , Dec. 29 , 1800 , the son of Amasa and Cynthia ( Bateman ) Goodyear , and a descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eaton , and after him the head of that company of London merchants who founded the colony of New Haven in 1638 . In his early childhood , as early as his eleventh year , he received deep and strong religious impressions , which resulted in his consecration of himself to God , and in his desire and purpose to bec3me a minister of the gospel . But the condition of his father 's business constrained him to give up that cherished purpose . His father was one of the earliest manufacturers in this country of hardware , and during his boyhood , when he was not at school , he was occupied with the various branches of his father 's business . From the age of seventeen to twenty-one lie served a mercantile apprenticeship at the hardware business , with the firm of *ogers &amp; Brothers , in Philadelphia , at that time one of the most extensive wholesale importing houses in the United States . During the next five years he was engaged in a partnership with his father , in the manufacture of hardware . in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father for the improvement of agricultural implements ; and his observation of the good done by these , especially in lightening the burden of severe labor , contributed to the inventive bias given to his life . At the age of twenty-six he removed to Philadelphia , and engaged in a mercantile firm , the first that was established in this country for the sale of domestic hardware ,  --  a finn consisting of his father , brothers and himself , and connected with their manufacturing business in Connecticut . This was re // garded by many as a visionary enterprise ; for to that time the whole trade in hardware in this country had l ) een in imported articles . For the four following years he was known in the commercial cities as the pioneer in domestic hardware ; and such was his success that a handsome fortune was accumulated by the firm . In consequence , however , of too extended operations in different states , too liberal credits , and heavy losses in 1830 , they were obliged in that year to suspend payment . On account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially that he might retain and complete several unfinished inventions iu that business , which in their incomplete condition would be of no value either to himself or his creditors , it was thought best to continue the business by extension of credit . But such were the disadvantages to be contended with that entire failure was the result . During the next ten years , under the laws then existing , he was repeatedly imprisoned for debt . But notwithstanding , he applied himself assiduously to complete his inventions and improvements in articles of hardware , and from the sale of one of them , which he completed while confined upon the jail limits , within a year or two after his failure , lie derived temporary means of subsistence for himself and family . " Daring these years , his anticipations , " he writes , " of ultimate success never changed , nor were his hopes for a moment depressed . " Indeed , he testifies that from his trials lie acquired firmness for his hopes , and also the lasting benefit of having proved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a high purpose , a man may be happy within prison walls as well as in any other ( even the most fortunate ) circumstances in life . Under these disadvantages , in order to discharge indebtedness , he relinqushed his interest in one after another of the important articles of manufacture , which were very lucrative in his former business . But he says , that in reflecting upon this , " he is not disposed to repine , and say that lie has planted and others have gathered the fruits . The advantages of a career in life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents , as is too often done . Man has just // cause for regret only when he sows , and no one reaps . " This language truly indicates the spirit of the man throughout . Soon after Mr. Goodyear 's reduction from affluence to poverty by his failure in the hard ware business , lie came to the deliberate conclusion to make invention his employment in ife . To this , by his knowledge of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inventor , by his circumstances , and by a strong inward impulse , he felt divinely called , as the profession in which he could most honor God and benefit mankind . When he was yet a school boy , he says , in his own narrative , his attention was strongly drawn " to the wonderful and mysterious properties of the substance called India iRubber . A thin scale peeled from a bottle sometime afterward attracted his notice , and suggested to his mind that it would be very useful as a fabric , if it could be made uniformly so thin , and could be so prepared as to prevent its adhering together and becoming a solid mass , as it soon did from the warmth and pressure of his hand . " By such little indications it is that God 's providence often guides to great and beneficent results . About the year 1831 or 1832 , soon after Mr. Goodyear*s misfortune in Philadelphia , the manufacture of guru elastic or India Rubber was begun in the United States . He turned his attention at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York store of the IRoxbury company  --  a company formed near Boston . lie took one of the articles , a life preserver ; in which he made a manifest improvement . The agent , pleased with this , advised him to give his attention to the miprovement of the material ; informing him that such were its intrinsic difficulties that the business must prove a failure , unless they could be removed , so great had been the losses from this source to the different companies . His resolution was then taken . He began his experiments . He soon found , however , that he had a very inadequate idea of the difficulties to be overcome in the objectionable qualities of the material , especially that by which it stiffens in the cold and melts in the heat . He found that many , chemists and others , ingenious men , had long experimented , and given it up , utterly baffled . But he // took courage , he says , " from the reflection , that what is hidden and unknown , and can not be discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , if at all , and by the man who applies himself most perseveringly to the subject , and is most observing of evem ; ything relating thereto . " But lie was under great disadvantages for making his experiments . He was utterly without money-worse than that , was ( leeply in debt ; had a young family dependent on him for support ; and the ill success thus far of manufactures in the IRubber material threw suspicion and the air of quixotism over the whole subject ; and , moreover , his experiments required some money . Fortunately , however , no great amount . By selling and pawning articles of furniture and clothing , even to those of necessity , he went on . In a narrative prepared by himself in recent years , with the reading of which I have been favored , he says , " Fortunately the substance is one , with which in experimenting fingers are better than any other mechanical power of the same force ; and these were the only mechanical power of which the writer had command during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mixed and worked many hundred pounds of gum , afterwards spreading it upon a marble slab with a rolling pin . Thus , owing very much to the plastic nature of the substance , in extreme pover. ty , he was able to persevere in his course against all obstacles . " But these obstacles were very great and painful , lie had no means of obtaining even daily food . His family were in absolute want ; sickness and death threw their baleful shadow over his abode of poverty ; and he had not wherewith even to bury his child . Still he persevered . The patience of the friends who aided him became exhausted . They told him that he had been an accomplished merchant , and an ingenious manufacturer of hardware , and could earn in that way a handsome support ; and that he was , unnecessarily and almost insanely , bringing distress on himself and family , and embarrassment on his friends . Still he persevered , firmly persuaded that in this direction was a boundless field of usefulness , to which he was divinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauty // during the first two or three years , for which he received , in 1835 , medals from the American Institute , and from the Mechanics ' Institute , in New York . Still , such were the objectionable qualities of the material , and the consequent imperfections of the manufactured articles , that none of them remunerated him , or provided for his wants . Time after time he seemed to be entirely successful , and had the hope of repaying the friends who had aided him ; and then in a few months he would find his articles all melted together , or ruined by some intrinsic difficulty in the material . From whom then could he get again the means of further experiment , or of daily food ? He was accustomed at this time , as the severest test of his manufactured articles , to wear them upon his person ; and this led to a remark , which illustrates both his poverty and the common opinion of his enthusiasm . A gentleman , being inquired of how he ( Mr. Goodyear ) might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who has on an india rubber cap , stock , coat , vest , and shoes , with an india rubber money purse , without a cent of money in it , that is he . " He records one instance , in which he went from home to experiment , leaving as collateral security for the rent of a cottage , among other things , the lineii spun by his wife . During his absence , these articles were sold at auction for the payment of rent ! In the year 1836 , he seemed to have met with success , in discovering what has since been called the " acid gas process , " one of his three most important inventions in preparing the material , but not the chief  --  a process of tanning the material , so that it is capable of a pliable and beautiful fabric . For the fabrics made by this process , he obtained , in that year , medals from the American Institute , and the Mechanics ' Institute , of New York . He also , in the same year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Government . And here the spirit of the man appears in the record which he makes of his objections to taking patents , and of his reasons on the whole for doing it . He says , " It would have been grateful to the inventor if none of his labors , to which lie had so long confined himself , had needed to have been made subjects of patents . It is repulsive to the feelings , that improvements // relating to science and the arts , and especially those of a philanthropic nature , should be made the subjects of moneymaking and litigation , by being patented . The apology he has to offer for doing that which was repugnant to his feelings . is the unavoidable necessity of the case . At different periods during a course of years , he was unable to prosecute his experiments for want of pecuniary means , and was consequently obliged to obtain them of his friends upon the prospective value of his inventions , through such legal advantage as was to be had under the patent laws . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head also . His success now seemed certain , not only to himself but to others . A friend agreed to let him have the means to demonstrate , by the manufacture of goods , the utility of the improvements , of which specimens only had as yet been produced . A large factory and machinery were engaged by that individual , near New York , for the purpose . But soon after that friend , overwhelmed by the disasters which befell the mercantile community in 1836 , failed . He was unable to proceed . And this inability being erroneously attributed by the public mind to the ill-fated business of india rubber , and to want of merit in Mr. Goodyear 's improvement , Mr. Goodyear was left apparently in a more helpless condition than ever-without the means either of proceeding in his business or of subsistence . Of this period he relates an incident , which , with his characteristic spirit , he records as " an unexpected relief by a kind Providence . " He was then in New York city . Speaking of himself ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , as " the writer , " he says , " lie had put in his pocket a small article much valued , and sallied forth in the morning for the purpose of obtaining with it food for the day . Before reaching the pawnbroker 's shop , he met a creditor , from whom he expected to receive sharp , if not bitter , reproache*. his astonishment was so great that he could hardly trust his hearing , when he accosted him with the inquiry what he could do for him . On being satisfied that no insult was intended , lie replied , without telling him that he was in search of food , that the sum of fifteen dollars would greatly oblige // him . It was instantly handed to him , and the article which had been designed for the pawnbroker remained in the hands of the owner , to relieve a greater necessity on a future occasion . He was now , for sometime , at the mercy of the pawnbroker ; every article that could be made available was pledged , until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred dollars from a friend . " In the summer of 1836 , by the help of a friend , he removed with some of his best specimens to IRoxbury , Mass. , where business in this material had formerly been largely carried on . Details as to various measures to complete , and bring to the favorable notice of the public , his improvements , and as to his removals from place to place , driven by utter poverty , must be omitted . Suffice it to say that again , and again , and again , very frequently , he seemed to have conquered success ; and then by various causes was disappointed and utterly prostrated . One cause was that there had been in the few previous years , especially in that part of New England , a fever of excitement and speculation as to india rubber manufacture , resulting in utter failure , and in losses so great and so widespread in the community , that anybody who would speak of any fnrther effort in that direction was intolerable . Almost no one would hear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child on the subject . Another reason was that difficulties , befbre unseen or not understood , were , by experience , developed in the material . IRepeatedly our friend , by the greatest effort in that state of the public mind , would obtain from some one the means of making some articles to demonstrate the utility of his improvements , and it would be found that from some cause , that could not be known except by new experience , they would in a few months become worthless , to the prostration of his credit and that of his invention . Yet he still applied himself with unabated ardor to detect and remove the causes of difficulty , until , in the year 1839 , he made his greatest discovery , called " the vulcanization of rubler2 ' lie found that this substance , which will only be melted by the application of heat in quite high degrees , will , by the application of heat in very high degrees , with the addi // tion of some other substances , become a new material , with all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imperviousness to water ; and acquiring the long sought quality of insensibility to cold , and to heat except in very high degrees . This , when at length demonstrated , was the subject of patent , and established his reputation and success . But during the year before lie made this discovery , and indeed the year after he made it , and was well satisfied of its value , Mr. Goodyear was in his greatest distress ; and at times it seemed as though he would perish from poverty , anxiety and hardship , and his discovery would perish with him A few incidents from his own narrative will convey some idea of what lie and his suffered at this period : During the winter of 1839- ' 40 , a year after he was fully satisfied of the value of his discovery , " in one of those long and severe snow storms which in New England sometimes occur , when even those who are blessed with health are confined within doors , he found that his family were without fbod or fuel . His feelings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his condition-cold and cheerless . But the recollection of a kind greeting received some time previous from an individual who resided some miles distant , and nearly a stranger , ( this was in Woburn , Mass. , ) induced him , enfeebled by illness , to attempt to reach his house through the storm . After being by turns exhausted by walking through the driving smiow and rested upon its drifts , he reached the dwelling of this individual , * and stated to him briefly his condition , and the hopes he entertained of success from his discovery , if he should ever be able to convince others of the facts relating to it . He was cordially received , and not only supplied with a sum adequate to his immediate wants , but also furnished with facilities for continuing his experiments on a small scale . " Again , speaking of the very unfavorable state of things at this period for the promulgation of his discovery , lie says : // 784 Dr. Dutton ' 8 Di8course . " He felt , however , in duty bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the discovery should be lost to the world and to himself . In the event of the writer 's death it could hardly be expected that his theory , which he afterwards found it so difficult to establish , could survive him . The invention was fully appreciated by him at that time , and was considered as valuable as it now proves to be . * * * Want of sympathy , want of means to go forward with experiments , or even to provide sustenance from day to day for those dependent on him , only increased the solicitude consequent on the state of suspense as to the result of those efforts . How he subsisted at this period , charity alone cam tell ; for it is as well to call things by their right names , and it is little else than charity when the lender looks upon what he parts with as a gift . The pawning or selling some relic of better days , or some article of necessity , was a frequent expedient . His library had long since disappeared ; but shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) he collected and sold at auction the school-books of his children , which brought the trifling sum of five dollars . Small as the amount was , it enabled him to proceed . At this step lie did not hesitate . The occasion and the certainty of success warranted the measure , which , in other circumstances , would be sacrilege . " Wishing at one time to take some specimens to New York , where he hoped for a more favorable reception , " he received assurance from an individual in Boston , once employed by him , that on coming to Boston he would lend him fifty dollars , whereby his family could be maintained during his absence , and his expenses paid to New York . Arriving at Boston , he was disappointed in this . He remained at the hotel from Monday until Saturday , hoping to obtain from some source the sum required . lie at last applied , where he had reason to expect it , for the sum of five dollars , with which he might return to his famnily . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented . Mortified and chagrined , he walked , meditating on his condition , till late at night . lie strayed into East Cambridge and stopped at the house of a friend , who received him kindly and made him comfortable for the // night . Early next morning he walked ten miles to his home , and was met at the door by one of the family , saying that hiz youngest boy , two years of age , who was in perfect health when he left home , was dying . Tie thanked God for being turned back to the rescue of his family ; for they had already been denied the subsistence promised by a dealer when he left . " The United States Commissioner speaks of the evidence be . fore him that Mr. Goodyear 's family , at this time , had to endure privations almost snrpassing belief , " being frequently without food in their house , or fuel in the coldest weather ; " " represented as gathering sticks in the woods and on the edges of the highways , with which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potatoes of their little garden before they were half grown , while one of his hungry children , in a spirit worthy of his father , is heard expressing his thanks that this munch had been spared to them . " Indeed , the full account of the hardships endured by himself and family during that year , when he had actually attained the knowledge of this great secret of nature for the world 's welfare , would be as painfully interesting as the harrowing recitals of a tragic romance . Truly with him it was darkest just before day-in one sense , even after dawn ! I ought here to turn aside to say that , during all these struggles and trials , Mr. Goodyear had what can be well described only by the Scriptural word " helpmeet , " in the wife of his youth , Clarissa Beecher . He could confide in her discretiori as well as her affection . To her intelligence and wisdom , and her eminent faith and piety , he could entirely entrust , amid his absorbing occupation and frequent absence from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the alternations of his fortune , and especially in its deepest depressions , he experienced in her the gentleness , the patience , the equanimity , of an angel , and more than the syn*pathy of an angel , even the sympathy of a true Christian woman and wfe . She lived to share the joy of his complete success . And going with him to Europe , to partake with him in new trials and new triumphs , the result of her long labors and sacrifices // culminated there in her death . Her body , with that sweet , serene , upborne expression of face , which now beams in our memory , was buried in a foreign land . But one of the directions of her husband 's last days was that it should be removed , to sleep ,  --  till the morning of the resurrection , beside his own . I ought not to be prevented by his presence from also saying that Mr. Goodyear always found scientific counsel and hopeful encoura ement from an eminent professor of science* in Yale College , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generosity . And he always gratefully appreciated it . But valuable for his support as were these aids , and those of many other friends , some of them in New haven , who can not here be mentioned , Mr. Goodyear 's chief support through those years of toil , privation , suffering and sorrow , was his faith in God , and his loyalty to the divine call which he heard to this peculiar work . lie saw in this immense and nearly worthless product of nature , boundless capability for the welfare of man , and for that progress in God 's material kingdom which , under his providence , moves in even step with the progress of his spiritual kingdom . By the ear of reason and faith he heard God 's voice , calling him to be " the interpreter and minister " of it for human use . And that voice he desired and determined to obey , counting no sacrifice or suffering dear in the sacred service . His inventive work was his religion , and was pervaded and animated by religious faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work ; and he said to his niece and her husband , who went , with his approbation and sympathy , as missionaries of the gospel to Asia , that lie was God 's missionary as truly as they were . By the aid and kindness of a brother-in-law , now residing in this city , t who for a time furnished the means to conduct the manufacture , Mr. Goodyear , in the autumn of 1841 , was enabled to proceed with his improvements , and was just about to demonstrate practically the value of his invention , at Spring *V Benjamin Si1Lm*n , *en jX*Ti11i*n* DeFcrcst , E*q. // field , when he was thrown into prison for debt , and interrupted in his work just as that work was blooming into its consuinmate flower . This induced him to obtain a release by the bankrupt law . This law , he says , was " odious " to him . " lie had always opposed it , and firmly resolved not to accept of any advantages it offered . " But he now saw the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers for human welfare , and for the benefit of his creditors . And as soon as he was enabled by pecuniary success , considering himself discharged by that law from no moral obligation , he b gan to look up and pay his debts , which he did , in the course of a few years , to the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars . This first part of the subject , the illustration of Mr. Goodyear 's ruling religions spirit , found in his early life and in his struggles and privations till his first full success , has so grown on my hands , that the remaining parts of the subject must be given in outline , rather than with the fullness which I desire and had purposed . IT . I proceed , then , to observe , secondly , that this ruling benevolent and religious spirit of Mr. Goodyear is illustrated by his continued and life-long devotion to the improvement of his chief inventions , and to their application in a great variety of modes , to human welfare . When he received his patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharged all indebtedness , and accumulated large wealth , by his receipts froni licenses under that patent . And many , not to say most men , would have yielded to that temptation . But he saw that his invention was capable of being applied for human benefit in a multitude of forms , each of which forms needed inventive genius for its construction . And he heard the same voice of philanthropy and piety calling him to the applica*ion8 of the invention , which had called him to the invention itself . And so , for the last sixteen years , really without any rest , he has been employed in inventing new articles for human use , out of his invented material . And this he has done , not for money , for all the money almost he could get he has devoted to the same beneficent purpose , keeping himself poor , notwithstanding his very large receipts . his be . // nevolent and religious principle , and his inventive genius too , have been illustrated in this , as conspicuously , perhaps , as during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , that " independent of all pecuniary considerations , he has taken great satisfaction in trying to invent and improve articles of necessity and convenience for the use of man . " " Whatever ( he adds ) of misfortune may hereafter befall the inventor , he xviii have the satisfaction of knowing that his efforts have been successful , and of witnessing on every 4de , and in every civilized country , the growing importance of the numerous branches of manufacture already established , and which may in his lifetime be established , under these inventions and improvements . " Mr. Goodyear went to Europe in 1852 , and returned in 1858 . His object was the establishment of his patents , and the introduction and improvement of the articles manufactured under them . He had already received for his inventions the highest honors at the Exhibition of the World 's Industry in London , in 1851 . He received the highest honors , also , for his inventions , at a similar Exhibition in Paris , in 1855 . From a desire to have his inventions suitably appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American department honorably represented in these Exhibitions of the World 's Industry , he expended very large sums ( almost a fortune ) upon them. * He had a return of honor for himself , and honor for his country . But this was all that he received . He could not obtain , what he richly deserved , his patents ; but others reaped unjustly the reward of his inventions . And not only this , he was ilnprisoned for debt , both in France and in England , suffering in mind most keenly ; and he returned to his own country poorer than when he left it ; indeed , absolutely poor , had it not been for the renewal of his patent for seven years , very justly obtained soon after . ITT . The ruling spirit of Mr. Goodyear is illustrated , in the third place , by his special devotion to the humane instead of the lucrative bearings of his inventions . His question was not // what applications of my inventions will make most money ? but what will most promote human welfare , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Coinmissionei ' justly says : " A large portion of these fabrics is intimately connected with human comfort and the preservation of human life . Not to enumerate more of the articles produced by this process , it would be hazarding nothing to say that the shoes and wearing apparel , perfected by it , and now cheaply and abundantly made , and almost universally in use , have saved thousands from a premature death , and may save millions in the ages which are to come . " I may add , that Mr. Goodyear , especially of late years , has paid great attention to the invention of articles for the relief and comfort of invalids and the sick , and of cellular garments for security of life on the water ; and all in utter disregard of his own profits . LW . And , once more , we find a fourth illustration of Mr. Goodyear 's ruling , benevolent and religious spirit in his work , in the fact that he persevered in his work under constant suffering from miserable health . Most men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty or thirty years , would have considered themselves excused from all labor , certainly from all except that absolutely necessary for subsistence . Yet he has constantly performed , in making his chief inventions , in his numerous ingenious applications of them , in his attention to obtaining and defending his patents , and in supervising the varied and general interests of the who&gt; work , an almost incredible amount of labor ; and this not for himself-certainly not chiefly for himself  --  but as the servant of God and the friend of man . There was one fault in Mr. Goodyear , which ought to be mentioned , both for the purpose of impartiality , and also for the purpose of giving such excuse for it , as is presented in his nature , circumstances and peculiar history . lie was , especially in his later years , improvident ; so that , though in the receipt of large sums of money , he was yet often embarrassed with debt , to a degree which was a discomfort to his family and friends , and a disadvantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should judge him according to his nature // and circumstances . He was always ready and glad to pay debts . And no one ever asked payment in vain , when he had any money . But he had become accustomed to being in debt during the many years of his necessity , when he could not avoid it . lie had the enthusiasm of genius , and counted money nothing in comparison with success in a humane invention , and for that purpose used it profusely , and so became habituated to profuse expenditure . Then he felt justified in this free use of it for his inventions , though he was indebted , because he felt confident that his object was benevolent , and that the final result would be the discharge of all pecuniary obligations . When we consider these things , and add to them the fact , that among his first acts , after his first full success , was the searching out and paying debts , to the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars , from which he had been legally discharged , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heart and intention , honorable and upright . Still his improvidence was a fault to be regretted . his charac. ter would have been more complete if this had been otherwise . There was in Mr. Goodyear an admirable combination of gratitude and generosity , and also a beautiful regard for his kindred and relatives . When the days of his prosperity at length came , he remembered those who had aided him in his adversity and extremity . And he was not satisfied with a full payment of their clues . But when any of them were in pecuniary misfortune he aided them with a princely generosity . Indeed , some of them with their families were really supported by him for years . LIe , also , as soon as he was able , afforded modes of remunerative employment and ways of advancement for many of those who were allied to him or his by kindred . In his manifold experiments , and through his influence in connection with the extensive manufacturing under his patents , a large number of them have been employed , and have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all objects of benevolence he had an open heart and hand , giving to them cheerfully and unsparingly , whenever he had money at his disposal . Mr. Goodyear 's remarkable charity and forbearance toward // those who had wronged him , should be noticed . He had been greatly injured , and that by those whom he had greatly benefited . On this point the United States Commissioner thus speaks : " The public stipulated with him that he should peacefully enjoy for fourteen years the monopoly created by his patent , and , had he been permitted to do so , he would no doubt long since have realized an ample remuneration ; but , so far from this having been the case , no inventor probably has ever been so harrassed , so trampled upon , so plundered by that sordid and licentious class of infringers known in the parlance of the world , with no exaggeration of phrase , as pirates . ' The spoliations of their incessant guerilla warfare upon his defenseless rights have unquestionably amounted to millions . In the very frout rank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double and most convenient character of contestant and witness ; and it is but a subdued expression of my estimate of the deposition he has lodged , to say , that this Parthian shaft  --  the last that he could hurl at an invention which he has so long and so reinorsely pursued-is a fitting finale to that career which the public justice of the country has so signally rebuked . " Yet through the whole narrative which Mr. Goodyear has written , there is not one severe or unkind word , even towards the man who so greatly defrauded him , and who compelled him to the trouble , anxiety and enormous expense of constant litigation . His humility , reverence and loyalty towards God were most exemplary . One who knew him thoroughly , says that " the most marked features of his religious character were deep consciousness of the evil of sin , and of his nothingness before God . Self.reliant as he appeared as a business man , his soul was more humble before God , and he seemed more deeply conscious of his dependence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbearance , than any other person with whose religious experience I have any intimate acquaintance . " He might , if any among us dependent and sinful creatures might , have felt pride in the beneficence of his // works . But lie allowed himself nothing in that respect . And in his last days , when reference was made to his useful works , he said : " What am I ? To God be all the glory . " The piety which sustained him through the peculiar struggles and trials of his life , sustained him in death . He died in faith . " I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord , from henceforth , yea , saith the Spirit , for they rest from their labors , and their works do follow them . " And now only a few words more , to indicate some of the lessons of this remarkable life . Most of them lie on the surface , and need but a word to bring them to your thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an incident of Mr. Goodyear 's life that has not yet been brought to your notice , should be more distinctly developed . That is , God 's providence in the working and results of inventive genius . Mr. Goodyear 's chief discovery , the vulcanization of rubber , was immediately caused by what is termed an accident . The United States Commissioner , to whose able and eloquent decision I have so often referred , thus describes it : " In one of those animated conversations so habitual to him , in reference to his experiments , a piece of India rubber combined with sulphur , which he held in his hand as the text of all his discourses , was by a violent gesture thrown into a burning stove near which he was standing . When taken out , after having been subjected to a high degree of heat , he saw-what it may be safely affirmed would have escaped the notice of all others-that a complete transformation had taken place , and that an entirely new product , since so felicitously termed elastic metal , ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling conviction burst upon him that success had at length crowned his efforts , and that the mystery he had so long wooed now stood unveiled before him . His history in this respect is altogether Parallel with that of the greatest inventors and discoverers who have preceded him . " Mr. Goodyear , in his account , though lie justly claims that , // owing to his long search for such a result , and his intense attention to everything that might produce it , he perceived it , when others would not-in fact others thought nothing of it when their attention was directed to it-he perceived it , and saw that the great object was gained ; yet , he reverently adds , that , as it was not what any known facts or principles would have indicated , " it should be considered as one of those cases where the leading of the Creator providentially aids his creatures , by what are termed accidents , to attain those things which are not attainable by the powers of reasoning he has conferred upon them . " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and aids inventive genius . To its keen eye , peering earnestly into the darkness , he shows the light . For the rest , the lessons are plain , and very practical and urgent for us. 1 . In the first place , find out what your peculiar endowments are , what talents are entrusted to you , what you are called to do . 2 . Then , in the second place , do it-do it industriously and earnestly . But this is not enough . 3 . In the third place , do it unselfishly , benevolently , religiously , as the servant of God and the friend of man . But , finally , the special lesson of this personal history is this : that every n*an should regard himself as called of God to his life 's work , the particular thing for which he is fitted , a sacred calling , a sacred coinrni6ion . You are called of God to be a lawyer , a physician , an inventor , an artisan , a merchant , a teacher , or to any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a minister of the gospel , or a missionary , is called of God . And your work , if done aright in spirit and outward form , is as truly divine . Regard yourself , then , as called and commissioned of God for your life 's work ; and do it witim a sublime and ennobling sense of being God 's appointed officer . Do it with loyalty , with faith , and with fidelity .
