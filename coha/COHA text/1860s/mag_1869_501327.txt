IF we turn from the splendid sunrise of our national morning to the misty veil that enshrouds the future , we shall see * giant spectre slowly defining its shadowy form against the Western heavens . Let us look and reflect ; for it is the mirage of a distant empire , a looming of one-third of the human race . It is the foreshadowing of a problem which only time can solve ; but which is none the less one of the most important in the world 's history . Let us examine the elements of this problem : On the Western shore of the Pacific there is a country , not much larger than the United States east of the Mississippi , in which a population of more than four hundred millions treads closely upon the capacity of the soil for supporting existence . So true is this , that those years in which the productiveness of the earth falls below the average , witness widespread famineand all the horrors that foiow in its train . By untiring patience and industry , by intelligence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these qualities in wrestiug from Nature the last atom she can yield , and , finally , by returning to Mother Earth , with scrupulous care , all that has been taken from her , with interest drawn from sea and river , this race maintains its vitality unimpaired . But it is a struggle for life . So long as the throes of this tremendous struggle were confined to China by strong natural and political barriers , they found a remedy in decimation by famine and pestilence . But the past twenty years have effected as great breaches in the political barrier which the Chinese had raised about them , as twenty centuries have made in their ancient wall of brick and stone . The social and political restraints which have opposed emigration are disappearing , and the first consciousness of an expansive power is beginning to show itself in the maritime provinces of the empire . A few years since , the confines of Asia and its archipelagoes were the horizon of the world to every Chinaman . The small fields therein opened to a peaceful race attracted many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the facilities for reaching them great enough to initiate any very important movement . The discovery of gold in California and Australia and the demand for labor on the distant shores of the Pacific Ocean , gave the needed impulse . Timidly , at first , small numbers went abroad ; then tens of thousands , until now there must be nearly two hundred thousand Chinamen on the American continents alone . During these years there has been , also , a continuous stream returning to Asia , and carrying home , in the aggregate , a large amount of money and information . Thus , the number of Chinamen who have seen the outside world can not be far from one per cent . of the whole male population of the empire . These act as a leaven on ever-growing circles at home , spreading among hundreds of millions those stories of adventure in distant lands , of wonders , of boundless demand for labor and of high wages , which make individuals think and become restless . Thoughts arise which , when they become common to large numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the masses swayed by them , until the sympathetic attraction of remote countries produces the tidal wave and currents of emigration . The measure of this movement is the exact resultant of all the social and physical forces which operate in its action . These are , of course , intricate and obscure beyond computation ; // but they are resolvable , in general terms , into one set of favorable and opposing forces in China , and other sets , with different resultants , for each country outside of China . In China we have one-third of the human race , suffering from an excessive death-rate and all the misery of an incessant struggle for life , with no remedy but the ability to overflow into other lands , until the population at home shall stand in a proper ratio to the means of support . Leaving out all other questions , the capacity of America for receiving emigrat ion is at present boundless , as compared with the capacity of all the world to supply it . An eminent English geographer has carefully calculated that the two Americas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room and subsistence are not wanting . The capacity for absorption of labor is scarcely more limited . The end of the long-continued exodus from Europe can not be far off ; to think otherwise is to believe unjustiflably in a rapidly-approaching decay of the nations beyond the Atlantic . Social and political reforms raising the condition of the people , especially that of the women of the lowest classes , the increase in industrial prosperity , and the continued drain of skilled labor to foreign countries , seem to be silently working throughout Europe toward the establishment of a proper balance between population and means of support . The Chinaman in this country was for years excluded from all participation in the development of the national prosperity , and was grudgingly allowed to work only in those gold diggings which were considered worthless by the American . But when a pressing necessity arose for labor on the public works of California and Nevada , the Chinaman was found to answer every need ; and now , having become identified with our internal improvements , he has obtained recognition as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is b2sed on his co-operation . For *veal or woe , the Pacific Railroad is uniting more distant extremes than the two shores of our continent . The facilities for crossing the Pacific are yearly increasing ; and so is also the knowledge of America in China . Unless obstacles be placed in the way , immigration will increase rapidly ; with additional encouragement it will soon become enormous . Having no rights , exposed to continued extortion , treated with contempt and indignity , branded as an idolator , and charged with every vice by his scrupulously just , religious , and virtuous neighbors , the Chinaman , feeling that he has no position here , seeks California , as the pearl diver does the bottom of the sea , and returns as soon as possible to the free air of his native soil . Place these Chinamen on the same footing with other immigrants , and the result will be that , while many will return to the home of their forefathers , a large portion will make this the home of their descendants . This was and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less oppressed than in California . Under these circumstances , if this immigration should be proportionate to the necessity for relief that exists in China , or to the capacity for receiving it here ; or , again , if it should bear the same relation to the parent population that the emigration from Ireland and Germany bears to the home population of those countries , the male adults of Mongolian origin on this continent would soon outnumber those of the European race . Vhen we consider that the I ) rejudice of race is , with us , a part of the foundation of politics ; that the moral characteristics of various nationalities become important parts of the framework on which parties are constructed ; that the // LJULY , opposing armies which fight with the ballot , and at times threaten the sword , are , to a large extent , massed by races ; when we consider this , and then turn to the prospect of a homogeneous mass of people among us , their male adults outnumbering largely those of all other component parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language , traditions , or , so far as it goes for anything , their religion ; then the social and political importance of this great problem dawns on the mind . To the thinker who has come to look upon the Americas as the birthright of the European under the tutelage of the Anglo-Saxon ; as presenting the prospect of a hemisphere peopled with a new race built up from the best elements of the European , numbering more than twice the present population of the globe ; a race which will be homogeneous , enjoying the most complete means of intercommunication by steam and electricity , having one language , one form of government and one idea of God ; to him the startling possibilities involved in the problem before us come as the discovery of neglected data , which may invalidate the results of years of calculation . If the probabilities of the case bear any proximate relation to the possibilities , the teeming population of our hemisphere two or three centuries hence may have more Chings and Changs in their geneological trees than Smiths and Browns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood will be that of the race best able to maintain an undiminished rate of increase ; and the vitality of the Chinese nation during a constant struggle for life seems to bespeak for it at least equally favorable prospects in less crowded homes . With an emigration from China standing in the same ratio to the home population that the drain from Germany holds to the population of that country , we should have an influx of more than one million Chinese yearly . Ten years of this rate would place upon our soil a preponderance of male adults of Mongolian blood over those of all the other families of man among us . The perception of this possibility can not but awaken in the mind of the true American the gravest thoughts . The social , political , and ethnological questions involved are of transcendent importance . The question of the prohibition or the heavy taxation of Chinese immigration is almost sure to be one of the earliest and most bitterly fought political issues of the Far West . The hostility to the Chinese of the white laborers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself openly in the most violent acts of intimidation . But it is not difficult to foresee that any legislation , which has for its object the suppression of any social element or force that has once shown itself to be a necessity in rapidly carrying forward the system of internal improvements on which a large part of our material industry rests , must ultimately fail . We may therefore assume that the recognition of the necessity of Chinese labor in the Far West insures an influx of Chinese proportionate at least to the extent of the great system of public works , which will be needful for the growth of the Western States and Territories . We shall see , further on , that these Asiatics are obtaining strong foothold in almost all other branches of labor , because they answer the requirements better than any other class of people . It is therefore not improbable that they will find their way , in large numbers , to this side of the Rocky Mountains . Is it probable that the party warfare of the country will leave this enormous quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens ? // Gaining the right to vote means gaining citizenship , the removal of disqualifications , and the protection of their distinctive interests and customs to a degree proportionate to the number of their votes . Having obtained these , the Chinese emigrant will become , beyond a doubt , a permanent citizen . With this prospect before us it may not be uninteresting to glance at the characteristics of this race , both in countries to which they have emigrated , and in their own home . Twenty years of contact between the two races in California have done little toward removing the prejudice against the Chinese . They have poured steadily into and out of the country ; but , surrounded by barriers , they have been forced to form a world of their own . XVithin this some fifty thousand men have been thriving , while any of them have amassed large fortunes . Many an enterprise , too , has swamped in failure , which would have given brilliant returns but for the tyranny of white workmen who prevented the employment of cheap Chinese labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court-room , where the Chinaman is denied the right of giving evidence in mixed cases , to the " gold diggings , " where white rowdies , acting as self-appointed collectors , levy the mining tax which is never assessed upon Americans . Recently , however , various manufacturers , farmers , and others , braving that wild beast , the Irish mob , have begun to employ Chinese labor , and with such success that capitalists see in it the sine*v and muscle of the Far West . A writer in the " Overland Monthly , " March , 1869 , says of the Chinamen : What they want is employment and such pay as will support them and leave something over to send hack to the father and mother , or to the wife and the children , left at home . So accustomed have they always been to give a full and honest day 's labor to tlsose who have hired them , that they expect to give their employer the service of their muscle and their skill during all the hours of the day , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulated wages when their work is done . The owners of woollen factories praise them as the best of workmen . The officers and foremen of the Central Pacific railroad-on which some ten thousand Chinamen are said to be at work-speak no less highly of them . Their work is full and honest , no lagging and story-telling , no whiskey drinking , and few fights . Overseers declare that they can drill more rock and move more dirt with Chinamen than with an equal number of men who claim this kind of occupation as their specialty . What they lack in bodily vigor is made up in persistency and steadiness . Indeed , California is just beginning to feel how suicidal her course toward Asiatic labor has been , and she is finding that her material prosperity is increasing apace with the innovation upon that policy . The Chinese are found now in woollen , paper and powder mills ; in th. borax works ; in the hop plantations , fruit orchards and vineyards ; following the reaping machines on farms , and working the salt-pits on the coast ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of branches of industry that would be impossible without their cheap labor . The sure result of this will be that , in a few years , the small savings of these workmen will , by accumulation , transform the coolie of to-day into the capitalist , contracting to build railroads , owning large farms or factories and lines of ships , and making great commercial combinations . This is certain , for no people on the face of the earth advance so unswervingly in the accumulation of capital ; and in its investment from childhood upward they combine the shrewdness of the Jews with the many-sidedness of the Yankee . What the Jews have been in banking , the Chinese may easily become in general commerce and industry on the Pacific coast . // On the island of Java , where they have long been tolerated , the Chinese number not far from 150,000 , the greater part having more or less Javan blood . The oppression of the Dutch is the cause of the population not being larger . " They are obliged to pay a mulct for leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit , " besides a poll-tax ; none of which imposts are levied on other foreigners . During the last century they were so badly treated that they revolted , and in i**o were attacked in their quarter in Batavia , when ten thousand of them are said to have been slaughtered . Sir Stamford Raffles , writing in i8 17 , says : The most numerous and important class of foreigners in Java are the Chinese , who do not fall short of soo , ooo , and who , with a system of free trade and free cultivation , would soon accumulate tenfold , by natural increase within the island and gradual accessions of new settlers from house . They arrive at Batavia to the amount of a thousand or more in junks , without money or resources ; but by dint of industry soon acquire comparative opulence . There are no women in Java who came directly from China ; but as the Chinese often marry the daugbters of their countrymen by Javan women , there results a nunserous mixed race which is often scarcely distinguishable from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junks , but by BO means in the same numbers as they arrive . They are governed in matters of inheritance and minor affairs by their own laws , administered by their own officials appointed by*tbe Dutch governor . They are distinct from the natives and are in a high degree more intelligent , more laborious , and more luxssrious . They are the life and soul of the commerce of the country . In the native provinces they are still the farmers of the revenue , having formerly been so thoughout the island . Beginning on their arrival as coolies and laborers , they soon accummulate enough to work independently , and many of them amass large fortunes . They have obtained nearly the monopoly of the native produce and an uncontrolled command of their market for foreign commodities . Their industry embraces the whole system of commerce , from the greatest wholesale speculations to the most minute branches of the retail trade . In their hands are all the manufactories , distilleries , potteries , etc. , and they have large coffee and sugar plantations . Their means are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , and their mutual confidence . They are equally well adapted for trade or agriculture . In the English colony of Singapore 50,000 , out of a population of 8o , ooo , are Chinamen , chiefly from the island of Hainan . Here the Chinese have obtained a strong foothold , and , under the full protection of English law , are accumulating great fortunes . Nearly all the trade is under their control , and this represented , in 1867 , $35,000,000 imports and $a8,700,000 exports . Carrying with them and retaining their innate energy in a country where both the natives and Europeans succumb , morally if not physically , to the enervating climate , they are absorbing every department of labor . The writer was told some years since that the English owners of a large machine shop at Singapore were gradually removing their English workmen and replacing them with Chinamen , having found the latter more docile , sober and enduring , and , with the same amount of instruction , equafly skilful . So successful is their competition that Parsees , Jews and Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of Chinese population and industry in the East Indian Archipelago is already a matter of great significance . In it we may see the coming solution of an important problem . The vast areas of tropical lands , insular and continental , have hitherto been , comparatively speaking , a closed world . And yet " the warm regions yield larger returns of those plants they have in common with the temperate zones , and have peculiar plants which yield more nourishment from the same area . Thus maize , which yields fortyfold or fiftyfold in France , gives one hundred and fiftyfold , on an average , in Mexico . " " Humboldt estimates that an aey5ent ( five-sixths of an acre ) which will barely support two men , when sown in *vheat , will feed fifty with bananas .

Productiveness xoo 90 65 35 12 1-2 It is this excessive bounty of tropical nature that feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during ages , of the necessity for labor in these regions , has unfitted the natives for active participation in making their countries contribute their full share to the needs of mankind . But the time must come , sooner or later , when these vast forests and jungles will be the granaries from which the deficiencies in the production of other lands will be made good ; when they will stand in the same relation to other countries that our prairies and the wheat-fields of Russia hold to manufacturing England , or that Siam is just beginning to hold to China ; and when the great wealth of raw material-greater by far than we as yet appreciate-which is contained in the vegetable world of the trol ) ics , will be a necessity to countless manufactories , supplying comforts and luxuries to largely increased populations over the whole world . The Chinese alone , of all races , have shown themselves able to maintain vigorous moral and physical vitality in the unwholesome and enervating climates of the South . Wherever they go and are allowed a fair field , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of the land in every direction known to their experience , and with fully as much good judgment , energy , and success as are shown by the European . Indeed , they possess , in an eminent degree , the qualities that are essential in colonizers , especially that strongly-marked national individuality which enables them to retain the best characteristics of their race in the midst of the effeminate customs of the inferior natives . The ability to thrive in the most extreme climates is a remarkable characteristic of this people . We have just seen how well they resist the enervatincr and unwholesome climate of the tropics . The writer has also seen them - collected together from different parts of the Chinese Empire-pursuing , in considerable numbers , the different branches of their industry , on the confines of Tartary and Siberia , where the mean annual temperature is thirty-two degrees ( Fahrenheit ) and where the mercury sinks , every winter , to sixty degrees below zero . Whate-er may be the future of China Proper , it is perhaps not too much to foresee in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the germ oj a growth in which the best elements of their own and the Western civilizations will blend to raise the offshoots of China to the rank of great Powers in the councils of the world . But it is in their own home and in the record of their national growth that we must seek the most important data for estimating the Chinese character . The necessary brevity of a magazine article admits of only a superficial glance at the outlines of this record , and the principles on which the social and political organization rests . For the practical worth and working of these principles , we have a measure in the present social and political condition of the Empire . The most striking features in the history of China , are the persistency of its civilization , and its national vitality which seems still undiminished , notwithstanding the great age of the Empire . This civilization is native to the soil . At every step we find unmistakable proofs that in remote times the ancestors of the race lived under a patriarchal government . The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know that in that direction , upon the high table lands of Central Asia , between Thibet and the Tienslian , there // existed a civilization which was partly pastoral , but acquainted also with many arts , and in which the use of iron was known at the remote period preceding the separation of the earlier branches of the Arian race . Our own ancestors , and those of the Chinese , were perhaps near neighbors , at that epoch . In entering China , the latter found it occupied by an aboriginal race , of which remnants live to this day unconquered , in the southern and western mountains . The earliest records and traditions carrying us back far into the uncertain period of history , show us the founders of the empire gradually forming colonies through the land , and carrying on defensive wars against the northern hordes , at the same time that they conquered both the natives of the soil and the natural obstacles in the way of their expansion . Already in the dawn of their written history , we find them carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of the Yellow River-one of the most ungovernable streams of the earth-by confining it between dykes several hundred miles in length , to prevent its destructive inundations ; at undertaking , the maintenance of which even at the present day , forms a heavy tax on the whole Empire . Thus , in the infancy of the nation , there existed the germs that were necessary to its wonderful growth. , Every essential feature of their civilization , moral , social , political , industrial , is the offspring of their own minds . More than this , from China there have radiated many of the fundamental features of Asiatic and even of European civilization . The mariner 's compass , printing , and gunpowder , were early inventions of that country , and there is little doubt that they were directly or indirectly introduced into the West during the reign of the Mongol dynasty , when so many Europeans wandered freely through all Asia . It has been claimed that the first printed copy of the Bible was made in China . The observing traveller in that country will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common use with us and in Europe . It has often been made a reproach to the Chinese , that their inventions have remained unperfected . This is certainly a remarkable fact , when we consider the fertility of mind necessary to have originated , throughout , such a civilization ; but it would seem that the perfecting of the results of thought and labor is , to a certain extent , dependent on their transplantation into other countries , and on the reaction upon each other of different kinds of civilizations . China has ever been too isolated to enjoy the benefits of this interchange , although there is. reason to hope that such an era is now dawning . It must also be remembered that China has ever been a world within itself ; sufficient to itself . Having no competitors , their inventions stopped at the point where the desired end was attained ; they were intended to be labor-aiding rather than labor-saving . It would seem that with this isolation , the very fact that the Chinese civilization is indigenous would go far toward explaining the persistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and political fabric of the Empire is based had already been established , and had taken a firm root in the national mind in early historical times ; and so firmly were they fixed that every attempt to overthrow them has ended in the extinction of the aggressive dynasties . These principles are , paternal and filial duty , and individual resj5onsibillty for the public welfare . As the Emperor is the son of Heaven and the father of the people , he is responsible to heaven for the *vell-being of the nation ; a portion only of his power is delegated to the officers of the government . So also , in the family , the parent is supreme , but also responsible for the conduct of the children . The entire population of a city is responsible for the // citizens ; each ward , for its families ; each family , for its members . No crime is greater than the violation of filial duty in the family relation , and all crimes acting against the public good , are brought to the doors of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical a people to vest the control of the imperial will in heaven alone , established , so far as we know , first among mankind , the principle that the will of the people and the will of heaven are synonymous . In the Shu-King , compiled by Confucius , 500 B. C. , from authorities much more ancient , we find the following axiom : " That which heaven sees and hears , manifests itself in that which the people see and hear . " " That which the people judge worthy of reward and of punishment indicates what heaven desires to reward and to punish . " Again it is said in the Chung-King , " The wise Emperors of ancient times used the eyes and ears of the Empire to see and hear , for the wishes of the people were their wishes , since it is in the wishes of the people that the intentions of heaven are manifested . " Believing thus firmly that * " the voice of the people is the voice of God , " a council of the wisest men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever surrounded the throne , holding the position of censors , memorializing the Emperor on the state of the country , and generally not hesitating to risk their lives in criticising a wrong policy . As the people are the children of the Emperor , they are all equal , as members of one family . There is no distinction of class . The descendants ofCon* fucius have indeed by that title certain privileges of nobility , and the members of the Imperial family form , during the existence of a dynasty , a class of nobles but they enjoy only a few slight prerogatives , which end with the ninth remove . Whenever a citizen has rendered some signal service to the State , advancing the public good , he is ennobled , receiving certain titles and privileges , but these cease at his death , his descendants having no further share in them , than the honor of being his offspring . As no man can be greater than his father , the whole line of ancestors is ennobled . Thus , an aristocracy is formed , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All being equal , competition for office is open for all . Education is universal , and proficiency in scholarship forms the basis of this competition . The government , it is true , appoints most of the officials , but they are chosen from those who , in the successive competitive examinations , take the highest honors . That these principles have not merely been acknowledged , but that they have been the true mainspring , acting weakly at times it is true , the Chinese nation at this day is a standing proof . Among them alone , of all peoples , has the principle that forms the basis of our own government , the equality of man , existed through all history . The early philosophers of China taught these doctrines , as a moral and political code , and as the only just basis of government . At that time , the country was split up into numerous feudal kingdoms , but when , some time after the death of Confucius , the Empire was consolidated , the doctrines of the great teacher became gradually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have never lost ground in their hold upon the national mind . As a code of morals , it is not venturing too far to say , that the writings of Confucius have been and still are as much respected , as is the creed of any other people . The universal esteem in which scholarship has ever been held , has made education one of the chief aims of life , to a greater degree in China than in most other nations . An aristocracy of intellect assumes here the position which in other countries is assigned to birth or wealth ; schools are universal , // and the proportion of the inhabitants who are unable to read and write is very small . The classics and history of their own country are very generally studied . That their ability to learn is not confined to the groove of their own system of study is shown by the instances of Chinese educated in the West . About twenty years ago , two b ox 's , children of very poor families , were sent to America to be instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Yale , and in graduating took the highest place in English composition ; the other carried off the highest honors in Surgery and Botany in the University of Edinburgh . Since that time the first has carried the experience gained in the West into the conduct of his business in China , and the other is esteemed by the European residents of the English Colony of Hong-Kong , as one of the best surgeons in the East . The science of war is considered inferior to scholarship , and the Chinese are essentially a peaceable people , although they have carried on great wars during different periods of their history . The power of the central government is felt but lightly throughout the Empire . There is a practical decentralization which leaves a wide scope for free action to the provinces and their subdivisions ; this is exemplified in the application of the revenues , excepting maritime customs , to the use of the districts in which they are raised . The government of China is really one type of democracy , as that of Japan is of despotism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that , though all the principal offices are filled by the Emperor , they are filled from the people by competitive examination . This is the theory ; practically many offices are sold to raise money , as during the wars with England , and the rebellion . The Central government is felt chiefly when its appointees are corrupt ; but the power of the people is generally great enough to cause removals in such cases . Their faculty of organization and self-government showed itself repeAtedly during the late rebellion . The British Consul at Ning-Po paid them a high tribute in this respect , in praising the perfect order and self-government which was shown for a long time at that place , when its *population , greatly increased by the crowds fleeing from the rebels , was abandoned by its officials and left to take care of itself . Having no fear of the future world , they meet death with great courage , dreading it less than continued pain . The family ties are very close , and family honor is the strongest check on their actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own experience , in Central and Northern China , leads me to think that honesty is quite as general there as in other countries . The existence of hospitals , founded by private charity for the sick and for foundlings , and for other purposes , proves that the Chinese are not negligent of social responsibilities . They- are proverbially industrious , and could we measure the amount of productive manual labor performed throughout the world , without the aid of modern labor-saving machinery , we should l ) robably find that this third of the human race accomplishes not less than from six-tenths to seven-tenths of the whole . It is no slight tribute to say that during nearly 5,000 miles of travel in this closely peopled land , the writer never saw a drunken Chinaman . The Chinese have been charged with being , as a people , corrupt beyond measure , given over to every abomination , and practisin* infanticide to the extent of destroying one quarter of the female children . But it is the opinion of Dr. Lockhart , an eminent medical missionary who has studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the latter crime is ( in proportion to the population ) no more frequent , or perhaps less common , than it is in its // various forms , in England and America . And it should seem that the healthy and moral condition of society is proved by the vitality of the nation , the overflowing population , and the rapidity with which gigantic wounds in the national body are healed . Of course the aggregate of crime must be very large , especially in the great cities ; but it is doubtful whether it is greater , in proportion to the population , than among the nations of the West . Vith all the admiration a careful observer must have for China , it is certainly not a pleasant country for a foreigner to live in , unless he recognize and keep always before him the fact that organic matter in decaying and giving nutriment to plants loses every vestige of its former character . There is too much of the human element ; go where you will , look where you will , it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by a turbid stream of life , while he treads a soil , almost human , the ashes of the unnumbered millions of the past ; the very dust which he breathes and swallows is that of a charnel house . The water of wells is everywhere impregnated with the products of organic decay , and the rivers are the sewers of countless cities . On the densely-peopled plain all the organic and much of the mineral ingredients of the soil must have made many times the circuit of plant and animal life : in other words , every thing that goes to make and maintain the human body has formed part of human bodies which have passed away . Few foreigners have the courage to enter the larger southern towns in summer , so horrible is the air . In the neighborhood of great cities on the delta plain , where water is found just below the surface , one may ride for miles , always in sight of coffins bursting in the scorching heat of the sun , and breeding the pestilence that yearly sweeps off the surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the spirit of the Chinese , as shown in their enterprise and energy as colonizers , in their commercial character and faculty of organization , in the democratic idea of the political equality of man , in the practical decentralization of their government , and in the universality of education and the making of education a necessary qualification for office , is in harmony with the spirit of the present age . This is the strong armor of the race , its safeguard in the future struggle for existence , by which it is clearly distinguished from those inferior races whose social and political systems belong to periods long past , and differ so much from our own that they fall at the first contact with us . Ve have seen that there exists in China a boundless source of emigration , and the necessity for emigration ; that the capacity of America for receiving this emigration is comparatively unlimited ; that the emigration will be at least proportionate to the encouragement offered ; that the encouragement is springing into existence through the recognition of the Chinese as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Far West ; that the immense influx of these people will constitute a possible political power which can not remain latent and that the attainment of the privileges of citizenship will make of them a fixed instead of a floating population , which , so far as anything we know to the contrary , may at no distant date largely outnumber the European element . The first question which naturally rises , is , in what can this people contribute to our material prosperity ? It is not difficult to answer to this that by reason of their many sidedness , their adaptability to all branches of industry , they can contribute more than other foreign element in the first generation . They can supply labor for the house and field , for building railroads , for working in mines and factories , for every need on sea and land . Within the really impassable limits set // by nature , they alone can render productive vast tracts of land , the cultivation of which is essential to the prosperity of our mountain territories . They can contribute largely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of material and by forcing us , through competition , to become more economical in this respect . They can advance greatly our material prosperity , not only by the product of their labor in working for Americans , but by their independent enterprise as capitalists . Indeed , the lowering of the price of labor in America , through Chinese immigration , taken in connection with the ahnost certain rise in price in Europe , appears to offer the best solution of the vexed question of free trade , by placing us on an equal or superior footing with Europe , in the manufacture of those things which now require protection . It should seem that Chinese mmigration , organized on the most liberal plan , in conformity with the emigration laws of China and under the responsible guidance of Chinese contractors , would rapidly raise our Southern States to a height of prosperity never yet reached by them , and render possible the completion and maintenance of great works , necessary to control the overflow of the Mississippi , and to drain unproductive and malarious regions . Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too high ? Every one will answer this according to his ow n way of measuring the future by the past . But he who sees in events the resultants of social and physical forces , the operation of great laws , progressive in their action and tending toward that millennium when every part of the earth , according to its natural endowment , shall justify its existence , by contributing its full share , as a part , to the welfare of the whole ; toward the unification of mankind by the assimilation of the best parts of its different races into a new type-who believes that Through the ages one increasing purpose runs , will feel the least anxiety in contemplating the future . To the charge that they will largely outnumber the Americans , absorbing many branches of industry and competing in all , he will answer that they can do so only by being able to compete with the European element ; in other words , by being really equally efficient and thus justifying their right to citizenship . To the assertion that their use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have already , he will reply that the rapid spread of the use of this drug , a use of only some sixty years ' standing in China , was induced by natural causes , acting in a country which had reached an abnormal condition , and that it can exist as a national habit only where it is a natural necessity . The long-continued generations of temperance of this people show their normal condition , and we have little reason to fear that half a century of opium smoking can destroy the deepseated , inherited vitality of the race , or have fixed it as a constitutional vice upon those who will emigrate hither . The political aspect of the question is that of the most immediate importance , for many obvious reasons . Nothing is more certain than the impossibility of a foreign race continuing to live and increase , in America , in other than two conditions , viz. , either under the animal-breeding system of slavery , or ( and probably only ) by being equally strong with the European element , in the average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability of any people to prosper , multiply and co-exist among us , proves them to possess an average equality with us when measured by our standard , deficiencies in some points being compensated in others-these differences being desirable in the same degree that individuality is desirable . If an inferior race , or large bodies of vicious and criminal people , prosper and multiply , it does not invalidate this rule , but rather // 33 shows that our actual measure , on certain points , is far below our theoretical standard . If the Chinese , having the exercise of equal rights in a fair field , should prove themselves undesirable citizens , it would be proof of inferiority , of inability to contribute their full share to the general good , and the inability to compete with their neighbors would inevitably result in their disappearance from the arena as important rivals . In view of all the possibilities of the case before us , it becomes evident now , more than ever before , how important it is that we should turn our energies toward Americanizing the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest argument against immediate and unqualified suffrage . With the prospect of an unparalleled influx of Chinese , it is of immediate importance that we insist upon their understanding our social and political organization before giving them a voice , and this can be done only by insisting upon a residence of several years in the country , and by an educational test , which should not be less than the ability to read and speak the English language . Indeed , this is only an additional illustration of the necessity for an educational qualification , in the matter of citizenship in general , and it should seem sufficiently clear to convince even the most confirmed advocates of universal suffrage . The danger most to be guarded against , is the enactment or continuance of special legislation with regard to Mong*lian&amp; Everything which tends to exclude them from the rest of the community , and , in a greater degree , everything which denies to them-as do practically the laws of California  --  the common rights of humanity , not only affects seriously the character of the aliens and retards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most injuriously on the European element , producing those moral evils which were the worst results of slavery with us  --  a reaction which is Ihe curse following everywhere intercourse between the European and non-European races . To suppose that a whole state or nation is able to rise above all prejudice of race , to look upon such a question from a cosmopolitan standpoint , is almost the same as supposing the average intellectual level of the people to be on an equality with that of its most liberal minds ; but it should not be demanding too much to expect to find this quality in the lawgivers of a land which claims that " all men are created equal ; " especially should we look for it in the consderation of a question which presupposes an influx of Chinese by millions .
