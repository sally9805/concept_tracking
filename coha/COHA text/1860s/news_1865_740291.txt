txt I regret that a severe and painful illness , from which I am still Flittering , has prevented me from preparing for your consideration a more full and detailed stateHII:Dt. of the condition of public , affairs , and of the progress which has been made in restoring North Carolina to her natural position as a member of the Union under the Federal Constitution . I am gratified to state , however , that my health is improving , and I hope soon to be in a condition to impart to you at length se ? information in my possession in relation to public affairs , which you may desire . The progress thus far made in the work of restoration has been attended by a great labor ; and I have been very anxious to discharge my duties , as Provisional Governor , under the instructions of the President , in such a way as to promote the best interests of the State , and to insure a restoration of our con. stitutioual relations to the Federal Government at the earliest practicable period . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revived , or that our people can even begin to renew their former prosperity until the State shall have been fully restored to her place in the Union . The greatest good of the present and of all coming generations will be embodied in the practical fact that we are once more a part of the freest , proudest and most prosperous governments in the world . As long as this fact is unrealized , the State must necessarily languish in all its interests , and instead of availing herself of her great natural advantages , and springing forward its conlpetition with other States in the career of wealth and prosperity , she will become snore and more impoverished . Let us , then , omit nothhig which may be deemed necessary , or even expedient , to attain the great end we have in view , to wit : the complete restoration of the State in all rte constitutional relations to the common government . Let the divieloas and differences which exist among us , and which are calculate . ' to obstruct the or of reconstruction , disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted patriotism . He who does anything now , whether by word or set , calculated or intended to embarrass the National Administration , or to obstruct the work of restoration , incurs a grave responsibility , and can be uo friend either to the Federal Union or to North Carolina : The convention of the people of this State , recently in session , very wisely ordained 1 . That the so-called ordinance of secession . adopted the 20th day of May , 1861 , - is now , and at all times bath been , null and void ; " and that . " the ordinance of the Convention of the State of Nor Carolina , ratified on the 21st day of November , 1789 , which adopted and ratified the Constitution of the United States , and also all acts and parts of acts of the General Assembly , ratifying and adopting amendments to the said constitution , are now , and at all times since the adoption and ratification thereof have been , in full force and effect . 2 . That " slavery and involuntary servitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been duly convicted ; shall be ? is hereby forever prohibited within the State . " 8 . That it shall be the duty of the General Assembjy to provide for the payment of all debts and obligations created or incurred by the State otherwise than in aid of the late rebellion . But that " all debts and , obligations created or iffeurred by the State , in aid of the late rebellion , directly or indirectly , are void , and no General Assembly of this State shall have power to assume or provide for the payment of the same , or any portion thereof . " These are sale and proper steps in the right direction , and such as were expected of the representatives of a loyal people . But in order to remove the last obstacle in the way of restoration , it is indispensable that the Legislature shall ratify the amendment to the Constitution of the United States , prohibiting the existence of slavery throughout the United States . I herewith transmit to you a communication on this subject , from Hon. Wm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified copy of the jointresolution which has passed Congress on the subject , approved Feb. 1 , 1865 . I beg leave , gentlemen , must respectfully and earnestly to urge on you the propriety of ratifying this amendment unanimously , at the earliest practicable moment . It is the wish of our beet friend , the President of the United States , that this shall be done . Such ratification can not fail to hasten our restoration to the Union , and thus lay anew for us and our children the foundations of permanent prosperity and glory . Under the provisions of an ordinance passed by the convention at its late session , I have appointed Hon. B. F. MOURN , Hon. Ricnann S. DONNEDL and Wu saws S. Mason , Esq. , commissioners to prepare and report to the Legislature a system of laws upon the subject of freedmen , and to designate such laws and parts of laws now in force as should be repealed in order to conform the Statutes of the State to the ordinance of the convention abolishing the institution of slavery . In conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my readiness and anxiety to cooperate with you cordially and zealously in everything which may be calculated to relieve our unfortunate one beloved State from her present depressed and unhappy condition .
