Time : latter part of the sixteenth century . Main text Act I Scene I.  --  Venice . Grand Canal by moonlight . Bartolomeo Cappello and Patriarch d'Aquilea issue hastily from a palace , conversing in an excited manner . Aquilea . Patriarch d'Aquilea Peace ! peace , my lord ! This is a fruitless rage ; Husband thy forces for judicial acts . Cappello . Bianca Cappello Talk not of peace  --  war only is the word ! Already civil war is in my heart  --  Pride wrestles there with pride : that proud intent , To wed my only daughter with a Prince , Hath driven her from me with a beggar 's son , And thus the strife within which makes me mad . Aquilea . Patriarch d'Aquilea What ! hast no thought of vengeance ? now , by Heaven ! I thought our blood was nobler than the asp 's , Which turns to pierce itself with that same sting Whose venom might have worked its own escape ! I am for vengeance ! not ignoble war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . Being thyself her sire , wilt nothing do , But sting thy soul to frenzy , then  --  leave me ! I need no aid save what these veins can give , Each purple drop is loyal to my will . Adieu ! who acts , but loses force in words . Going . Cappello . Bianca Cappello Following . Stay ! I will go with thee ; I see thy bile Flows more in keeping with thy blood , than mine . They enter together a gondola in waiting , and depart . Scene II .  --  Florence . Mean apartment in the house of Buonaventuri . Costanza engaged in arranging the room . Costanza . C ostanza My wits must work to do the best I can , And at the best , this is no fitting place To lodge a high-born , gentle lady in . How could Pietro have forgot my words , That he who reaches higher than his height Loses all foothold , bringing to the ground , In his own fall , a lordly pride whose weight Must crush his humble fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wife , and you are ready strange young lady is as pale and sick Of her own will , as the green sailor grows Of sea-room , when the waves begin to swell . Costanza . Costanza Oh , yes ; and she 's but our poor daughter now ; So let us open to her parent-hearts . The harbor of our love is small and mean ; But now , let loose from any other hold , Her heart may gladly cast its anchor here . Buonaventuri . Buonaventuri Hark ! on the stair I hear approaching steps ; Haste , wife , adjust thy cap and brow , to suit An honest greeting , and a mother 's smile . Enter Pietro and Bianca : the parents encounter and embrace them . Buonaventuri . Buonaventuri To Bianca . As warm a welcome as warm hearts can give ! No worthier will our humble home afford . But , what it lacks in fitting ornament . Thy gentleness and beauty will supply . Costanza . Costanza To Bianca . Great honor dost thou to our meaner house To wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall prove to thee a husband true , As unto us he ever was a son , Thou hast not stooped from thy high rank for naught . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Thanks to ye , for the shelter and the love Proffered to me , a stranger , for his sake , To you as son , to me as husband dear ! Heaven make me worthy of your honest hearts ; And may you find that you 've not lost a son , But gained a daughter in my father 's loss . Weeps ; Costanza embraces her . Pietro . Pietro To his parents . And you shall prize in her no common gain ; Believe me , honored parents , if I dared To reach above me , ' gainst your staid advice , ' T was for a jewel worthy any risk . Bianca . Bianca Cappello To Pietro , assuming a gay smile . Your jewel will be brighter in the sun ; Too dull it looks now to confirm that boast . To Costanza . With your kind leave I will at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where broods parental love with careful wing . Buonaventuri . Buonaventuri Taking Bianca by the hand . First go with us and join our frugal board ; Dreams are but nourishment for empty heads ,  --  The empty stomach needs more solid food . Exeunt . Scene III .  --  The Same . A small chamber , the bed hidden by a curtain : enter Costanza , with a light in her hand , followed by Bianca . Costanza . Costanza It is a simple chamber , but thine own : Make thee at home then here as best thou canst . Bianca . Bianca Cappello All must be well that thoughtful love prepares ; Thanks for thy kindness , and to thee good night ! Costanza . Costanza Putting down the light , and approaching to aid her . First , let me help thee , or thou'lt miss thy nurse ; I never had a daughter , but , methinks , A woman can not be too old to learn The nicer cares which suit not lusty boys , And care makes up the sum of mother 's bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thou of me must learn That ' t is the daughter should the mother aid ; And this rough journey hath so seasoned me , That I shall never shrink to useless stuff , But serve thee in some manner  --  not thou me : So now , good mother , fare thee well till morn . Kissing her . Costanza . Costanza Going . And gentle be thy dreamings , as thy ways ! Good night  --  God bless thee ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Ay , and thee , kind heart ! Exit Costanza . Would that I were as worthy to be blest ! Looks about her . But whither have I come  --  is this my home ? Where are the dear familiar things , but late Unheeded for their very commonness ? Those every-day-used , unfelt luxuries ? Oh ! each , the smallest , here would grow in size To something that might break the staring void ; Had I but my poor nurse beside me now , Methinks this desert want would wear a smile ,  --  No place is sterile where lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her embrace , Leaving my fault to sting her innocence . Listens . Hark , ' t is Pietro 's step ! I must to bed . Disappears behind the curtain . Scene IV .  --  The Same . Morning . Mean apartment as in Scene II . Bianca alone , regarding herself in a small mirror . Bianca . B ianca Cappello Well , I slept soundly as a wearied child ; Pietro 's jewel looks in sooth more bright In this clear sun , than dimmed , as late , by tears . Enter Pietro with open letters in his hand . Pietro . Pie tro My own Bianca ! here 's sad news for us  --  But , turn not pale  --  Oh , I am all too rash ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Rising excitedly . Regard not me  --  come , quick , discharge thy load ! Suspense is a dull saw , that tortures slowly ; Harsh truth , at worst , the sharpened axe 's blade , Which does its execution at a blow . Pietro . Pietro Well , if thou wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath imprisoned mine , In our default ; and that thy father 's rage Is by the patriarch so goaded on , That it will end in our divorce  --  by Death ! Their emissaries now are on our track , And these are sworn  --  the oath made sure by gold  --  To bring their swords back reeking in my blood ; But I have told thee not to blanch thy cheeks ; I would consult thee of a plan proposed , Which may secure us strength to match our need . Bianca . Bianca Cappello And what think'st thou our simple wits could work , Against such force by haughty vengeance armed ? Oh ! if they touch a hair of thy dear head , The daughter 's blood shall pay the father 's wrath . Pietro . Pietro But it shall never have so dear a price : I am advised to ask the Prince 's aid . Already knows he of our misadventures , And predisposed is now to succor us . ' T is known that Cosimo , weary of state rule , Hath given his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And friendly to my other kinsman , too , ( The monk who entertained us by the way , ) And knows through him my uncle 's unjust fate ; Unto Serguidi then I will betake me , And he shall plead our cause before the Prince , Who is himself of such a kindly nature That , sure am I , he ' ll not deny the suit : So in the end we may defeat ill-luck . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Yes , go ; and promptness will secure prompt aid ; Something premonishes my heart , as thine , That we shall yet prevail o'er these proud foes ; The smallest chance of such a victory Is worth the largest effort . Pietro . Pietro Then adien ! Let hope call back the sunshine to thy brow . I see its dawn now in that rosy tint , And thus salute joy 's fair returning day . Kisses her forehead and departs . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Alone . Love , thou art sweet ! yet there 's a sweeter joy , Methinks , in conquering imperious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I own In that true heart , for which all else I sold , To drink the satisfying cup of triumph , Filled to the brim , before my enemies ! Yet , I know goodness is the strongest arm With which to shame them , or to conquer them . Pauses a moment . I should content me with this lowly lot , Punish with my own happiness my foes ; Or , through majestic pardon awe them down . I will go seek the honest pair ; with them My heart grew meek , my nature softer seemed : Evil comes nearest when we are alone . Exit . Scene V.  --  The Same . Cabinet in the royal palace . Enter the Prince Regent and Serguidi . Prince . Prince Regent Sitting down . Now tell me what is truth in this romance ; Give me a history of simple facts : For , to believe these many-tongued reports , Would be one day to bless propitious Luck For having brought a human angel here ; Another day to curse perfidious Fate For a sly devil in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have th ' ungarnished tale , With the true portrait of the heroine : Bianca is of that right noble blood Cappello  --  house of proud Venetian boast ! Her mother , of no less illustrious stock , Yielded life up in giving life to her ; And in her tender years , her father took A stately wife whose heart matched not her size ,  --  Having but room to take her own child in , And not a whit of love to spare from him For wasting on the offspring of another ; Nay , did forbid his larger , richer heart , To coin for her a sister 's precious name . In brief , the sum of her maternal care Was seeking , piously , a mother true For the fair orphan in the nursing Church . Prince . Prince Regent Not the first time the Church a pretext was , To serve a selfish end . Serguidi . Serguidi A woman 's art  --  True handmaid to her will  --  is seldom foiled ; The father , in the husband 's yoke subdued , Yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as luck would have it , good or ill , Bianca 's eyes encountered other eyes , And in that meeting of live passion 's sparks A fire was kindled reason might not quench ; Love burnt out pride ; and then stored all its wealth In this bold Florentine , by chance at Venice , Who matched her only in his daring flame . Prince . Prince Regent The same old tale , new told ! Serguidi . Serguidi They met by stealth : Now at , then going to , the holy mass ; And last at midnight , through false keys supplied By love 's necessity inventive grown  --  To them the golden keys of Paradise . But , as of old , the serpent lurked near by , And so it fell their Paradise was lost . Prince . Prince Regent The girl 's a heroine ! Serguidi . Serguidi She knew her chance  --  Her only chance of love  --  would soon be bound By the stern convent 's walls , and fain would taste One draught of sweet , before her lips were sealed Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened , an old Prince of wealth Asked for her hand , and in that asking spoiled The father 's good intent to wed his child To Christ , and gain for her Heaven 's heritage . Prince . Prince Regent Ah , gold and titles often buy the sum Of good intentions ! Serguidi . Serguidi So , the haughty sire  --  In pride o'ergrown before ' t was ripe  --  would give A foretaste of ambition 's fruit to her . She found it sour , the golden apple spurned , And , proving sweeter love 's forbidden fruit , Resolved to venture everything for this ; So , with a stranger fled in darkest night , Without acquainting even her trusty nurse . Prince . Prince Regent If equal be her beauty to her courage , Too rich such prize for a plebeian 's hand ! Serguidi . Serguidi Through perils on the land and on the sea , They hither came , and now , in wedlock joined , Are meanly lodged beneath the humble roof Of the youth 's father , honest Buon'venturi . Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask they our aid ? Serguidi . Serguidi The sequel of my tale is yet to tell : All Venice was in uproar at their flight ; But love , that sharpens even the dullest wit , Evaded every search ; while anger , foiled , Vented its spleen upon the innocent . Among its other wrongs , it hath imprisoned Pietro 's uncle , in his nephew 's stead , Swearing to take no other bail for him Than the girl 's presence , or her husband 's life  --  Threatened each moment , Prince , with violence . The facts are these : your Highness now will say What shall be done . Prince . Prince Regent Yes ; but not all is told : Thou , in the story , hast forgot to give The heroine 's portrait . Serguidi . Serguidi Hard were this to give : ' T were better that your Highness saw the face , Than that I painted it . Prince . Prince Regent Then she 's not fair : For beauty gives man 's tongue such vivid hues , That , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every grace . Serguidi . Serguidi And beauty too , Of certain force , strikes dumb ; and such is hers : If I should say she was so short , so tall . Had such and such decided traits , and such Known graces as pronounce all others fair , I should be just as far from painting her As reason would be from portraying love , Love ne'er was known except when it was felt ; Nor beauty of such kind e'er painted , save By its own self upon the heart . Prince . Prince Regent Enough ! To-morrow bid Bianca and her spouse To private audience here . Rising . Serguidi . Ser guidi It shall be done . Exit Prince . The bait has taken ; now my end is sure : His Princely appetite , thus keenly whetted , Will do the rest . O man ! thy ! boasted force , Backed even by the puissance of a throne , Is weaker than weak woman 's weakest charm , When armed to conquer by her sovereign will . Exit . Scene VI .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church . Enter rapidly Costanza and Bianca , on their way to vespers . Costanza . Costanza Stop here a moment , child , and take new breath ; The church is close at hand , and we are safe Now in its sacred shadow ; rest thy fears . ' T is right we go to prayer , for I believe That prayers of honest wives and mothers have A private entrance to the throne of Heaven , Which for their special wants stands ever open . The bell sounds . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Hark , there 's the bell ! come , mother , let us on : I tremble , and yet know not why , to pause , As some poor have with hounds upon her track . Costanza . Costanza Leading her on . Keep closer to me , then , and we 'll proceed : But slower , child , there is no need of haste . Noise behind arrests their steps . Enter armed Brigands dragging Pietro , while Buonaventuri follows expostulating with them . 1st Brigand. 1st Brigand Stand back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my son ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Running to her husband . Oh , it is he ! To 1st Brigand . It is my husband , man , Release him from these ruffians ! Costanza . Costanza Mercy , pray ! 1st Brigand. 1st Brigand Peace , women ! he 's our prisoner , and must go . Bianca clings to Pietro. 1st Brigand tries to force her away . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Unhand me , brigand ! To Buonaventuri . Go thou , call for help ! A Brigand seizes Buonaveturi , who is going . 1st Brigand. 1st Brigand Out on ye all ! Revenge must have its way : We come from Venice , and must take this rogue , Pointing to Pietro . Dead or alive , back there . Pietro . Pietro To Bianca . ' T is vain , love , vain  --  Take off thy dear hands  --  we must part ; adieu ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Never ! where'er they take thee , I will go ; Howe'er they serve thee , I will share thy fate . 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regent enters with Serguidi , Guards following them . Serguidi . Serguidi To the Prince . Heavens , ' t is Bianca ! Prince . Prince Regent Hold , assassins ! hold ! To his Guards . Secure these murderers , and lead them off ! Guards seize the ruffians. 1st Brigand. 1st Brigand In this lone hour and street our prey seemed sure ; We 've lost it , our reward , and freedom too . Exeunt Guards with Brigands . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Throwing herself at the Prince 's feet . O Prince ! as mercy 's angel have you come : Heaven bless your Highness ! Prince . Prince Regent Raising her up . Yes ; in blessing thee ! Pietro . Pietro Kneeling . The life my Prince has saved , he hence will use : This heart was ever loyal , but now owes Its blood , were each drop doubled , to its sovereign . Prince . Prince Regent We shall accept thy services , and find Some post of safety for thee ; fear thou not ! Buonaventuri . Buonaventuri Approaching with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks in blessings : Saving our son , Prince , you prolong our days , And while they last , each one anew shall bless you . Prince . Prince Regent A Prince 's subjects all are sons to him : Go ye in peace !  --  hence I will guard my own , And thus protect one dearer still to you . To Bianca , speaking low . To aid your cause , I needs must learn your tale , And those lips best will tell it : come to-morrow , At midday , with Pietro , to the palace : Till then , adieu ! your foes are in safe keeping . Costanza . Costa nza Taking Bianca 's hand and speaking to her husband and son . Come you to church now , with us , and give thanks . Exeunt , bowing reverently to the Prince . Prince . Prince Regent Looking after them . Is that a creature of this lower sphere ? The first-born smile of Heaven was not more fair ! How her voice , love-toned as soft summer airs , Played magic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its harmony  --  Herself as music 's very soul embodied , So I became all eyes , all ears at once . Various persons cross the stage slowly , regarding the Prince . Serguidi . Serguidi The street , Prince , will become all eyes , all ears , If we still tarry here . Prince . Prince Regent Yes  --  to the palace . Exeunt . ACT II . Scene I.  --  The Same . Audience-chamber in the palace . The Prince Regent seated , Serguidi standing by him . Enter an Usher . Prince . Pr ince Regent Conduct them hither without further form . Usher leads in Bianca and Pietro , and retires . Francesco rises and takes Bianca 's hand to seat her by his side , but she courtesies and continues standing , while he reseats himself . To Bianca . Proceed to tell thy tale ; have no reserve . Bianca . Bianca Cappello ' T is long to suffer , but ' t is brief to tell : Your Highness knows I am the only daughter Of a patrician , senator of Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hath nipped the budding joys of infancy , Robbed of its sunshine a fond mother 's smile . My noble father loved me , but his love Was more in praises than caresses shown ; Nor could his lofty wife e'er stoop so low As to dry childhood 's simple tears from one Who needs must weep that she was motherless . The first to love me was my tender nurse , Whose absence I had ne'er to mourn till now ; But she , to soften more my rigid lot , Trained me with such an over-fond indulgence , That my heart grew but sicklier for her care , Craving some aliment , ' twixt bitter scorn And sweetest fondness , which my father 's heart , So proudly kind , could never quite supply . When I met him who is my husband now , That twin-born sympathy awoke to life Which feeds the heart , while on the heart it feeds ; So strong I grew on this true nourishment , That , having feasted , I could hence have lived Upon its memory in a convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wed another , Repugnance pushed with force against his will , While love 's indissoluble cords still drew My fortunes with my heart to its true lord . Pardon ! your Highness knows the rest . Prince . Prince Regent Say on ! To pour thy heart will lighten it , at least . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Such bounty . Prince , as deigns to listen thus , Needs not the urging of weak words : yet these Would fain the guard of royal favor ask , To invest the life in which my own is bound . Throws herself weeping before the Prince ; Pietro kneels behind her . Oh , succor him who is my all on earth ! Prince . Prince Regent Raising her up . Rise ; weep no more ! Your dangers now are past . Puts a ring on her finger . This be the seal of our protection hence . We have sent back to Venice , under guard , The bold invaders of your peace and lives ; With such remonstrance as will hence secure Your persons and your rights from violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for change That shall procure you ease of circumstance , Adieu , until ye hear from us again . Exeunt Bianca and Pietro joyfully , accompanied by Serguidi . Did I e'er look on beauty  --  ever feel What woman 's charm was , till I saw that face ? Serguidi 's right ; no tongue could titly paint her , Unless it were the tongue of Love itself ; No pencil , save it stole ethereal colors . Her spiritual charm  --  ' t is like the sky , That , while the painter dips his brush to catch it , Changes its phase , and looks him to despair . Renter Serguidi . How now , Serguidi , has she gone ? what said she ? How looked she ? did she smile on going hence ? If so , haste , tell it ! ere I strike thee dumb For having seen a smile which I saw not : Come ! why so slow of speech ? Serguidi . Serguidi Your pardon , Prince ! I had no place to put a word till now ; She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To grace the thanks she bade me here to lay , Beside her husband 's , at her Prince 's feet . Prince . Prince Regent Name not her base-born spouse in naming her ! Serguidi . Serguidi Your Highness sees now what I could not paint . Perchance the fault was in too coarse a tongue ; Yet royal lips may have the finer touch Befitting royal beauty , and can paint her . Prince . Prince Regent She is not to be painted , trait by trait , As one paints easily mere dainty flesh . Serguidi . Serguidi Then hers are something more than mortal charms ? Prince . Prince Regent Out on thy bantering ! had I now my throne . The Church , which hath ignobly bound her once , Should , through its Head , release her from this bond , And she whom beauty crowns should share that throne ; But thus we can not use a father 's crown . By what means , then , to win her ? Serguidi . Serguidi Regal means , Have stronger proved than legal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do still . The meanest love , it seems , hath royal might , And love born royal should have power no less . Prince . Prince Regent The chance is worth the trial  --  we shall try ; Thou hast a ready faculty to see , And wit to serve it . Serguidi . Serguidi From your Highness ' wish Cometh the wit , as doth the will to serve ; I now bethink me  --  Prince . Prince Regent Speak ! what wouldst thou say ? Serguidi . Serguidi That Mandragoni 's wife should first be gained ; And leave a woman , then , to spy out for us The promised land , if Love would have possession ; Meantime the price  --  Prince . Prince Regent No price , save love , will buy What befits love . Serguidi . Serguidi But , what 's sold for love Must first re-purchased be with baser coin , Ere it can sell itself for love again ; So , while the wiles of the mastro 's wife Work with Bianca , buy her through her spouse ; My wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once blown up , ' t will give to air his love ; While gold will build him castles in the air , And stars of honor dazzle him to blindness . Prince . Prince Regent You 're right , Serguidi ; gain him , and we 'll blind him ! But , of Bianca ? Serguidi . Serguidi There 's no fear of her : Women love strongest where ambition draws . Your Highness thinks it but a paradox , Yet Love 's the greatest of all egotists , And he loves most , who most his own self loves ; Sometimes ' t is bliss of loving that Love loves , And for the joy of being loved again . Self-sacrificing love is but a name For friendship superfine , and does in truth , Self-sacrificing , sacrifice to self , To gain the soul 's applause and praise of Heaven . Prince . Prince Regent And in what better is the courtier 's love ? Serguidi . Serguidi In naught , your Highness ; though he who loves self , Best loves and serves his sovereign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Serguidi , for our plans : Serve best thyself , then , in best serving them . Exit . Serguidi . Sergu idi Ay , that I will ! and grow so in his need , That all the odds between us his crown makes Shall be , that he will wear it , and I use it . Exit . Scene II .  --  The Same . A gallery in the palace . Francesco seen walking thoughtfully alone . Enter , unseen by him , the Cardinal Ferdinando . Prince . Prince Regent I said that none could paint her , trait by trait ; Yet every charm seems of itself the painter , And on my heart has left its special image ! Cardinal comes forward ; Prince starts on seeing him . Well , brother ? Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici You 're preoccupied I see . Raving as wont , of some new beauty , Prince ? Prince . Prince Regent Ha ! did thought speak so loud ? Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici I heard alone ; ' T was lucky  --  others might perchance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets tell . Prince . Prince Regent What said I , then ? Cardinal . Cardi nal de Medici What I cared not to hear ; Something , I think , which nearer touches you Than your betrothal . Prince . Prince Regent Frowning . Brother , change your theme ; All other subjects now would better please . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici And one , it seems , above all others ; Prince , Would you repeat what I just heard you say ? Prince . Prince Regent First tell me what that was . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici What could it be , Save woman 's charms  --  best theme for reverie ! Some new divinity your heart enshrines , And hides her image from the envious day . Prince . Prince Regent At least you can divine  --  Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici What words declare ! Prince . Prince Regent Well , you shall share the secret of my thoughts . I 've seen a woman in whose single face All heavenly and all human charms unite . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray draw the veil aside ; Let me at least behold that portrait , Prince . Prince . Prince Regent It lies too deep even for a brother 's eye ; And words would fail to paint it yet again . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Let me put questions that will language teach To shape those charms , and color them aright ; That which crowns all , the hair , it first should paint ; What texture this ,  --  what color , black or fair ? Prince . Prince Regent Ask the sun that , whose beams nest in its curls ! Footnote : 1kb Her hair 's a wealth  --  it is " the golden fleece "  --  A living brightness , shooting up such rays As form an aureola round her head . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Then ' t is a crown itself  --  she 'll not need yours ; And has she eyes to match it ? what of these ? Prince . Prince Regent Her eyes  --  I seem still looking in their depths !  --  Are crystal wells , full ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they reflect ; To gaze in them , is each time to discern Some star that never dazzled sight before . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici I see that you have turned star-gazer , Prince , And so , perchance , no eyes had for her skin . Prince . Prince Regent Her skin ? ' t is like a pure white rose 's leaf , Mirroring by wax-light the pink one above it ; Her temples , the transparence of her neck , Mother of pearl , with turquoise veins inlaid . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Faith , you 're in love  --  you talk in poesy ! Has she a human form , and features such As suit a mortal 's taste ? Prince . Prince Regent If he be king : For Nature made a queenly soul the model When , moulding into life such form and traits , She curved her nostrils for the air of courts ; Pouted her proud lips for a royal kiss ; Between them strung the rarest pearls , for crowns ; And on her ivory shoulders set that neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hands were tapered to wear signet rings ; Her foot is light enough to tread on ermine . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici With displeasure . You talk in earnest , brother ; with your leave , I will retire ; Love needs no audience . Francesco bows assent ; exit Cardinal . Prince . Prince Regent Alone . What is a crown worth , if it may not win That which alone can crown our sovereign wish ? Shall monarchs reign to envy beggars ' bliss , Or , to possess it , through their royal right ? Could I by conquest gain earth 's kingdoms all , I should be powerless if I gained not her Who hath already conquered me  --  who shall In turn be conquered , if Love prove a god . Exit . Scene III .  --  The Same . Chamber in Buonaventuri 's house . Bianca leaning thoughtfully on her hand ; while Pietro walks up and down the room with an air of gayety . Pietro . Pietro Stopping suddenly before his wife . What now , Bianca ? as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad smile I 've seen these three days  --  since we saw the Prince . Bianca . Bianca Cappello But thy face brightens up with fortune 's smile , So , what my own of pleasure 's sunshine lacks , Thine can supply , for thou wast ne'er so gay . Pietro . Pietro And why keep brooding o'er a hapless past , Or thankless present , when a glowing future Laughs at them both , and beckons gayly on ? Bianca . Bianca Cappello Rising and approaching him lovingly . Ah , dearest ! if our life 's background be dark . The heaven of love such brightness on it sheds , That , from the present viewed , it seems all fair ; Those stolen kisses , snatched from midnight 's heart , Were sweeter to us than the breath of morn , And turned the darkness ever into day . Pietro . Pietro ' T was but a taste , then , while the future menaced To rob us even of that ; now we may take Our fill of love , with promise in advance To sweeten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . And art thou sure of that ? But what if with increase of fortune love Decreases , will it richer fortune prove ? Pietro . Pietro Why ask such questions ? does thy heart get cold , As Fortune 's warmer grows ? Bianca . Bianca Cappello And know'st thou not That love ,  --  which , destitute , could from itself Create its warmth and food , and weave its bower , As weaves her home the spider from within ,  --  When by capricious fortune once supplied From outer life with cheating luxury , Draws less and less from its warm inner source , Till that itself dries up ? Pietro . Pietro A living source , Dearest Bianca , is our pure , young love  --  It can not dry ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Oh no , it never can ! To me ' t would make an arid desert green ; Already hath it made this desert-home All redolent of flowers  --  Pietro . Pietro Say of one flower ! For all its sweetness is thy fond heart 's breath , And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bianca . Bianca Cappello Oh , keep for thine own bosom then thy flower ! Be it a decoration , richer far Than any gilded badge a crown could give . Pietro . Pietro Stars would be well enough to wear outside ; But , fear not ! I will keep my rose within . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Nor sell it to a Prince for gewgaws , love ? Pietro . Pietro Sell it ! what talk you of , Bianca , pray ! Enter Costanza , followed by Mandragoni ; Bianca starts back disconcertedly . Mandragoni .

Moonlight ; garden of Bianca 's palace ; in the centre a fountain with shrubbery and flowers around it ; seats here and there . On one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window by steps into the garden . In front is a large gate , and in the rear a small one . Bianca appears on the terrace , dressed in white , looking up to the moon . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Celestial Dian ! were I pure as thou , Sleep might descend as balmily on me As on thine own Endymion , when thy smile Lay on him , the bright spirit of his dreams ; But now thine eye on me is set so sharply That through the lids of mine , which fain would close , It pierces , lancing shame into my breast . I will descend , nor longer strive to face Thine argent arrows , which seem ever pointed Right at my heart . Descends into the garden . Fresh dew , thou bath'st my feet , As holy tears dropt on them from above ; Perhaps my angel-mother drops her tear Among the rest  --  the purest gem of all . Sweet little flowers ! ye hide your modest eyes ; But I can smell the perfume of your breath  --  Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe no prayer to blend with yours ? Perchance prayer would exorcise from my bed The fiends Remorse and Dread , whose venomed stings Have driven me out into the cooling night : Yes , I will kneel beside this crystal fount . And pray once more as I in childhood prayed . Goes to kneel , when the small gate opens softly and Francesco enters , wrapt in a mantle . She starts up alarmed , when he throws off his disguise and runs to her , supporting her in his arms . Prince . Prince Regent Sweetest Bianca , fear not thus thy friend ! I only crept  --  as I have done each night Since thou cam'st here  --  to breathe before thy gate A prayer for blessings on thee ere I slept ; When , through still midnight , tremblingly I heard A nightingale , whose pensive music stole Into my heart as Love 's own melody . How could I then resist ? Instinctively This hand from out my bosom plucked a key , And , ere I knew it , thus to me had oped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Then be not , Prince , the serpent to beguile My ear with flattery while my husband sleeps . Withdrawing from him . Oh , leave me ! leave me ! Prince . Prince Regent Canst thou banish me ? Have I not long enough been exiled , then , By austere Fate , which binds me now to one Whom I can only honor as a wife , While all my heart-strings tie me unto thee ? Pity thy Prince , Bianca ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Pity , Prince , The frail thing , that , with favors overborne , Bends like a reed weighed down , which strives to hold Itself up , from pollution in the mire ! Ay , pity your Bianca ! Prince . Prince Regent Seizing her hand . Speak again ! Oh ' t was a sweet sound , your Bianca ! Yes , Thou art my own , and I will pity thee  --  Ay , love thee , more than I do love myself : And wouldst thou only give me in return One drop from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall as balm upon a wounded heart , And not impoverish thine . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Ah ! would not mine Be poorer then in virtue , and in peace , For giving yours unlawfully the love Which it hath sworn another ? Prince . Prince Regent No ! Oh no ! Believe it not ! Thou didst forswear thyself In that oath , null and void by nature 's law ; Look not incensed ! Nay , had Pietro 's love Been noble , it had weighed against thy birth ; But , selling thee ignobly , it hath proved True to its parentage . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Alas , ' t is so ! And wherein would your love prove nobler , Prince , Save that you are the buyer , he the seller ? And if the poor toy , now so coveted , When gained should only weary royal hands , Then , thrown aside with other cast-off toys , What would its value be ? Prince . Prince Regent Ah , wrong me not ! I swear , Bianca , by my hopeful crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll prove to thee that love is not caprice  --  That mine is seed deep-planted in the heart , Which will require a lifetime 's growth to till The measure of its greatness . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Cheat not , Prince , Your royal self , nor try in vain to cheat A woman who was never born to prove The easy dupe even of a monarch 's vow . Prince . Prince Regent Bianca , hear ! not by yon changeful moon , But by those steadfast stars , I swear again , If thou wilt love me , and Heaven crowns our love With its kind smile , through opportunity , Thou shalt adorn , in wedlock by my side , A ducal throne ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Prince , pray , pray leave me now ! Prince . Prince Regent I will obey , if , as true woman , thou Wilt promise to obey what thy heart bids When I am gone . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Thus much I promise , Prince . Prince . Prince Regent While the dear vow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own seal upon it  --  thus : Kisses her . Now go ; dews bathe in fresher bloom the flowers , And stars grow brighter watching ; starry eyes Dim with late hours , and night airs steal from beauty The balmy freshness of the new-blown rose : Leave vigils to the planets ; these cold damps To the night-blooming vines ; thyself to me . Presses her to him ; going . Love 's choicest angels watch and keep thee safe , Each in the apple of such eyes as languish  --  Ay , in its very core ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Heaven keep my Prince ! Exit Francesco by the small gate . Bianca stands a moment looking after him , then advances a few paces and stops . Who sent him here to wither on my lips Prayer in the bud ? to kill its very root With noxious dews of an unholy love ? Am I the same I was an hour ago ? What ails me ? something strange within I feel . Who knows what this will breed ? the loss of fortune May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and taunted our downfall . Walks silently a moment , then stops with exultant air . To bring my lordly uncle to my feet ; To have my father kiss my hand in pride ; To see his tall , imperious wife stand back . And wait my leave t ' advance her stateliness ; I could resign all pure delights of earth  --  Yea , forfeit heaven , for such a victory ! But stop , I rave ! this quickening hope within Hath made me dream impossibilities . I had forgot , that ' twixt the thought conceived And its full growth and birth , a barrier Stands up , steel-clad , and strong as Death in armor . Pauses a moment . True , once a shepherd-boy forsook his flocks , To vanquish with a sling a giant armed , More terrible than Death : and feeble woman May prove too strong to shrink back from the monster . If I gain all , and lose at last myself . Which is to blame  --  my destiny , or I ? Fate seems to choose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and push them on With a resistless force to certain ends : Their haps and their mishaps all tend one way , And when they seem the farthest from success , Perchance they are the nearest : when most near , For general good or ill , used and thrown by : They only hang above the yawning gulf Where Fate will hurt them to a sudden end : Oft in her hand they are but instruments , Themselves as nothing  --  what their wits work , much ! Walks and stops . I now remember , when I was a child , An old hag , dingy as her art was black , Who hailed me as one born to wear a crown : These creatures are Fate 's prophets , I believe , And though the devil is himself a liar , He makes them speak the truth : I 'll trust to this , To Princely vows , and to that regal will , Which Nature gave me for great purposes . High hopes ! breathe into me henceforth new life : To towering minds ye 're instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to the terrace . Scene II .  --  The Same . Street before Bianca 's palace .

And Austrian pride , they say , bleeds more when hurt Than Austrian love : we all do pity her ; Though pity 's but skin-deep , when not entwined Round something which the heart holds : this good lady Too cold and formal is , it seems , to suit Our hot Italian blood . 2d Citizen . 2nd Citizen That 's not her fault ; Nor Nature 's , even ; but a colder climate 's : And love , you know , begets love , and can teach The art of pleasing , more than courtly rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bewitched our Prince so , ere his luckless marriage !

Enter the Archduchess . Regarding her sternly . Madam , your presence honors me too much . Archduchess . Archduchess of Austria Would that such honor were delight instead ! Prince .

Kneels . Francesco , what I lack is love  --  give this ! If not for my sake , yet to feed the life Which is a part of thine  --  which , thus preserved , Shall one day give back all thou givest me .

Prince . Prince Regent Lifting her up . I loved Bianca ere I saw thy face ; The wrong I did thee was not loving her , But wedding thee ; forgive the loveless act ! Could the heart banish , as the word can do , Her banishment might leave thee its sole queen ; But is that banished , which , sent from our sight , Stays ever with the unrenouncing heart ?

Poor Jeanne ! she crowns her with a puppet love , As children put on paper diadems , And play the real , while unreal kings , Let her play queen of my Francesco 's heart , And be as satisfied , a little hour , As if her power were actual ; all too soon She shall behold  --  what she is not made to feel  --  That regal love is more supreme than law .

Farewell , maternal Nature ! gentle tones Of breeze , and brook , and bird , farewell ! farewell ! Taunt me to action hence , defiant winds !

Serguidi It matters little when , or how , I came , If but my visit hath the honest end To serve your Eminence ; for doing which , I needed first to understand your plans . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Knave ! thou wert sent here as the spy of power , To which thy craftiness is but too loyal ! Serguidi .

Fra Fortunato . Fra Fortunato Regarding Serguidi obsequiously . If I dared advise Your Eminence , I should in justice say That he , who hath served long and faithfully One Prince 's will , may serve as well another . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Serguidi , to change masters argues change Of purpose , too : yet , mark  --  if in appearance Thou dost change only , worse the end for thee !

Sergu idi Oh , what a mockery is this religion ! What lying hypocrites its ministers ! There goes a wolf so hungry after gain That he can lap up blood which others spill ; And yet he wears sheep 's clothing : so does he Who hath employed him , Princely Ferdinand ! But the wolf ' s in his face ; while this false monk Puts on the sheep 's look too , and through it serves Better the ends for which he is engaged . Bad masters must have servants bad as they , Only dressed up in liveries of truth ; As Satan must have aids , and ca n't employ Angels for ministers ; so he takes fiends . On fiendish errands angels would be fools , Making lies visible in candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , Keeps his lies hidden underneath the mask . Thank Heaven ! I wear no Church 's livery  --  The court 's suits well enough my purposes ; And this I must maintain for future ends , Even at the sacrifice of ancient friends . Scene IV .  --  Near Florence .

Cardinal de Medici Brother , your sovereignty was pressed to-night ; But you are used to losing . Francesco . Francesco You to gaining ! Now , tell me , did you ever lose a game ? Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Not since I lost a boy 's smooth upper lip : But you are piqued ! come , drown the grudge in wine . Pours out two cups of wine , gives one to the Grand Duke , and applies his test ring to the other . Retakes the cup from Francesco . Stay ! drink it not ! Revenge hath passed this way , Breathed on our wine , and turned it into poison ! Francesco . Francesco What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ; or , on the point Of justice ' lance I 'll pluck it , piece by piece ! Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Nay , brother , be not angered !

Fran cesco Dost hurl lies at us ? in our proper face Dar'st thrust thy malice ? give me back the wine  --  I 'll drink it , and thus prove thee false as hell ! Cardinal .

But what is this I feel  --  can it be death ? No , ' t is not death  --  it is my heart-strings tearing ! Life 's ties may all be severed , throne and state Rent from me , yet give no such mortal pang As this  --  this violent parting of our loves ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Alas ! alas ! and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bianca . She kisses him . Oh , that kiss runs through Life 's shattered chords , as heaven 's electric shock Through the torn fibres of a tree uprooted ! Kiss me again , it mocks me with new life , Dead thing as now I am !

I ask no mercy for myself  --  I have to others been unmerciful  --  But let this true , sweet spirit pass aneled From every contact foul with mine , blood-stained ; Mercy , forgiveness , peace , kind Heaven , for him ! Francesco . Francesco Grant me no mercy , Heaven , which she shares not ; Else pardon to my spirit were not peace ; Nor mercy aught , save most unmerciful , If any stain of sin be found on her , That stain I own  --  its punishment be mine ; Or , pardoning that , save both souls from its curse ! Bianca . Bianca Cappello Amen ! alas , ' t is all crime dares to say ! Francesco . Francesco My lips grow icy  --  warm them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sweet ! Oh , joy ! for love there is a life to come ; There we shall grow , in loving , young again , There will I give thee an unfading ; crown ; Cling closer ! do not let me go alone , Come  --  I am going  --  one more kiss  --  one more  --  Dies . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Growing ill and rising with difficulty . We , who have slept on softest beds spread o'er With royal purple , must die here as dogs Upon the floor , uncared for and unwept . ' T is fearful , meeting death thus all alone ! Looks about terrified , going towards the corpse , but falls suddenly on her knees , fancying she sees the Archduchess Jeanne . What see I there ? O Jeanne ! O spirit good ! If greatness be forgiving , pray for me ; If gladness can to woe be pitiful . Pity me , for remorse is pitiless ! I did not hate thee ; frown not so on me  --  I took thy life but to enrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nay , look not thus ! I did not mean to kill him . Yet now I die atoning for the act . Turn off that eye  --  it sinks into my heart As cold and heavy as a leaden weight  --  The vision fades . O fiends , torment me not before the time ! Clasps her hands in agony , again seeing the vision . Smile once on me  --  forgive , pure shade , forgive ! If angels pardon , God may pardon too . Enter Cardinal Ferdinando , with Serguidi and Fra Fortunato . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Observing his dead brother . Justice is working  --  let us to its aid ! Dead monarch , thou no subject hadst so true Ah thou thyself wast servant unto love ; Cold recompense is death for such warm serving . To Bianca , who continues kneeling by the body .

Pours out wine and offer it to her . Bianca . Bianca Cappello ' T is drunk already : thou hast lost thy victim . Turn hate then into mercy , and forgive ! Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Crime 's Gorgon head hath turned my heart to stone , Nor could compassion 's subtlest alchemy Change into mercy hatred hard as mine . Bianca . Bianca Cappello Then pardon Heaven ! as I die pardoning thee . Falls on the body of Francesco and dies . Cardinal . Cardinal de Medici Justice be thanked , I am no murderer ! Fra Fortunato . Fra Fortunato Hell opens to receive her soul unshriven ! Cardinal . Cardi nal de Medici Stand ye as witnesses that her own will Herself hath punished ; that her dark intent  --  Hurled back  --  fell , blasting as the bolt of vengeance , Heaven-aimed , upon the fortress of her power . Fra Fortunato . Fra Fortunato So perish every enemy of God ! Serguidi . Serguidi So perish every foe of Ferdinand ! Cardinal . Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty body , To serve , with felons ' flesh , at wormy revels ; She thought , in dying with her monarch-lover , To lie still with him in a royal tomb  --  Lodged in the chapel of the Medici , No ! let Francesco sleep there with his spouse , While this , his mistress , rots with courtesans . To Fra Fortunato . Come thou with me  --  we must alarm the house , And double confirmation asks such deeds . Exeunt Cardinal and Fra Fortunato . Back matter THE END .
