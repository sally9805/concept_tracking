Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1866 , by KELLY &; PIET , In the Clerk 's Office of the District Court for the District of Maryland . Dedication . TO EVERY SOUTHERN WOMAN , WHO HAS BEEN Widowed by the War , I DEDICATE THIS RHYME , PUBLISHED DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE STRUGGLE AND NOW RE-PRODUCED -- AS A Faint Memorial of Sufferings , OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO FORGETFULNESS . M.J.P. * * * * * BEECHENBROOK ; A RHYME OF THE WAR . * * * * * I. There is sorrow in Beechenbrook Cottage ; the day Has been bright with the earliest glory of May ; The blue of the sky is as tender a blue As ever the sunshine came shimmering through : The songs of the birds and the hum of the bees , As they merrily dart in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchard , as sifting its snows , It mingles its odors with hawthorn and rose ,  --  The voice of the brook , as it lapses unseen ,  --  The laughter of children at play on the green ,  --  Insist on a picture so cheerful , so fair , Who ever would dream that a grief could be there ! The last yellow sunbeam slides down from the wall , The purple of evening is ready to fall ; The gladness of daylight is gone , and the gloom Of something like sadness is over the room . Right bravely all day , with a smile on her brow , Has Alice been true to her duty ,  - -  but now Her tasks are all ended ,  - -  naught inside or out , For the thoughtfullest love to be busy about ; The knapsack well furnished , the canteen all bright , The soldier 's grey dress and his gauntlets in sight , The blanket tight strapped , and the haversack stored , And lying beside them , the cap and the sword ; No last , little office , no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; All wife-work ,  - -  the sweet work that busied her so , Is finished :  - -  the dear one is ready to go . Not a sob has escaped her all day , not a moan ; But now the tide rushes , for she is alone . On the fresh , shining knapsack she pillows her head , And weeps as a mourner might weep for the dead . She heeds not the three-year old baby at play , As donning the cap , on the carpet he lay ; Till she feels on her forehead , his fingers ' soft tips , And on her shut eyelids , the touch of his lips . " Mamma is so sorry !  - -  Mamma is so sad ! But Archie can make her look up and be glad : I 've been praying to God , as you told me to do , That Papa may come back when the battle is thro ' :  --  He says when we pray , that our prayers shall be heard ; And Mamma , do n't you always know , God keeps his word ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father with sudden caress ; Then fast to his heart ,  - -  love and duty at strife ,  --  He snatches with fondest emotion , his wife . " My own love ! my precious !  - -  I feel I am strong ; I know I am brave in opposing the wrong ; I could stand where the battle was fiercest , nor feel One quiver of nerve at the flash of the steel ; I could gaze on the enemy guiltless of fears , But I quail at the sight of your passionate tears : My calmness forsakes me ,  - -  my thoughts are a-whirl , And the stout-hearted man is as weak as a girl . I 've been proud of your fortitude ; never a trace Of yielding , all day , could I read in your face ; But a look that was resolute , dauntless and high , As ever flashed forth from a patriot 's eye . I know how you cling to me , know that to part Is tearing the tenderest cords of your heart : Through the length and the breadth of our Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar of Country ; and Alice , sweet wife ! I never have worshipped you so in my life ! Poor heart ,  - -  that has held up so brave in the past ,  --  Poor heart ! must it break with its burden at last ? " The arms thrown about him , but tighten their hold , The cheek that he kisses , is ashy and cold , And bowed with the grief she so long has suppressed , She weeps herself quiet and calm on his breast . At length , in a voice just as steady and clear As if it had never been choked by a tear , She raises her eyes with a softened control , And through them her husband looks into her soul . " I feel that we each for the other could die ; Your heart to my own makes the instant reply : But dear as you are , Love ,  - -  my life and my light ,  --  I would not consent to your stay , if I might : No !  - -  arm for the conflict , and on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and best ! My heart -- it must bleed , and my cheek will be wet , Yet never , believe me , with selfish regret : My ardor abates not one jot of its glow , Though the tears of the wife and the woman will flow . " Our cause is so holy , so just , and so true ,  --  Thank God ! I can give a defender like you ! For home , and for children ,  - -  for freedoms -- for bread ,  --  For the house of our God , for the graves of our dead ,  --  For leave to exist on the soil of our birth ,  --  For everything manhood holds dearest on earth : When these are the things that we fight for -- dare I Hold back my best treasure , with plaint or with sigh ? My cheek would blush crimson ,  - -  my spirit be galled , If he were not there when the muster was called ! When we pleaded for peace , every right was denied ; Every pressing petition turned proudly aside ; Now God judge betwixt us !  - -  God prosper the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to fight : I grudge you not , Douglass ,  - -  die , rather than yield ,  --  And like the old heroes ,  - -  come home on your shield ! " The morning is breaking :  - -  the flush of the dawn Is warning the soldier , ' t is time to be gone ; The children around him expectantly wait ,  --  His horse , all caparisoned , paws at the gate : With face strangely pallid , no sobbings , no sighs ,  --  But only a luminous mist in her eyes , His wife is subduing the heart-throbs that swell , And calming herself for a quiet farewell . There falls a felt silence :  - -  the note of a bird , A tremulous twitter ,  - -  is all that is heard ; The circle has knelt by the holly-bush there ,  --  And listen ,  - -  there comes the low breathing of prayer . " Father ! fold thine arms of pity Round us as we lowly bow ; Never have we kneeled before Thee With such burden 'd hearts as now ! Joy has been our constant portion , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We would thank thee for it all . In the path of present duty , With Thy hand to lean upon , Questioning not the hidden future , May we walk serenely on . For this holy , happy home-love , Purest bliss that crowns my life ,  --  For these tender , trusting children ,  --  For this fondest , faithful wife ,  --  Here I pour my full thanksgiving ; And , when heart is torn from heart , Be our sweetest tryst-word , ' Mizpah , '  --  Watch betwixt us while we part ! And if never round this altar , We should kneel as heretofore ,  --  If these arms in benediction Fold my precious ones no more ,  --  Thou , who in her direst anguish , Sooth'dst thy mother 's lonely lot , In thy still unchanged compassion , Son of Man ! forsake them not ! " The little ones each he has caught to his breast , And clasped them , and kissed them with fervent caress ; Then wordless and tearless , with hearts running o'er , They part who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle ,  - -  the rein is drawn tight ,  --  And Beechenbrook Cottage is lost to his sight . II . The feathery foliage has broadened its leaves , And June , with its beautiful mornings and eves , Its magical atmosphere , breezes and blooms , Its woods all delicious with thousand perfumes ,  --  First-born of the Summer ,  - -  spoiled pet of the year ,  --  June , delicate queen of the seasons , is here ! The sadness has passed from the dwelling away , And quiet serenity brightens the day : With innocent prattle , her toils to beguile , In the midst of her children , the mother must smile . With matronly cares ,  - -  those relentless demands On the strength of her heart and the skill of her hands ,  --  The hours come tenderly , ceaselessly fraught , And leave her small space for the broodings of thought . Thank God !  - -  busy fingers a solace can find , To lighten the burden of body or mind ; And Eden 's old curse proves a blessing instead ,  --  " In the sweat of thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bless 'd relief in all labours that lurk , Aye , thank Him , unhappy ones ,  - -  thank Him for work ! Thus Alice engages her thoughts and her powers , And industry kindly lends wings to the hours : Poor , petty employments they sometimes appear , And on her bright needle there plashes a tear ,  --  Half shame and half passion ;  - -  what would she not dare Her fervid compatriots ' struggles to share ? It irks her ,  - -  the weakness of womanhood then ,  --  Yet such are the tears that make heroes of men ! She feels the hot blood of the nation beat high ; With rapture she catches the rallying cry : From mountain and valley and hamlet they come ! On every side echoes the roll of the drum . A people as firm , as united , as bold , As ever drew blade for the blessings they hold , Step sternly and solemnly forth in their might , And swear on their altars to die for the right ! The clangor of muskets ,  - -  the flashing of steel ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waving of banners ,  - -  the resonant tramp Of marching battalions ,  - -  the fiery stamp Of steeds in their war-harness , newly decked out ,  --  The blast of the bugle ,  - -  the hurry , the shout ,  --  The terrible energy , eager and wild , That lights up the face of man , woman and child ,  --  That burns on all lips , that arouses all powers ; Did ever we dream that such times would be ours ? One thought is absorbing , with giant control ,  --  With deadliest earnest , the national soul :  --  " The right of self-government , crown of our pride ,  --  Right , bought with the sacredest blood ,  - -  is denied ! Shall we tamely resign what our enemy craves ? No ! martyrs we may be !  - -  we can not be slaves ! " Fair women who naught but indulgence have seen , Who never have learned what denial could mean ,  --  Who deign not to clipper their own dainty feet , Whose wants swarthy handmaids stand ready to meet , Whose fingers decline the light kerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for from them ? Yet see ! how they haste from their bowers of ease , Their dormant capacities fired , to seize Every feminine weapon their skill can command ,  --  To labor with head , and with heart , and with hand . They stitch the rough jacket , they shape the coarse shirt , Unheeding though delicate fingers be hurt ; They bind the strong haversack , knit the grey glove , Nor falter nor pause in their service of love . When ever were people subdued , overthrown , With women to cheer them on , brave as our own ? With maidens and mothers at work on their knees , When ever were soldiers as fearless as these ? June 's flower-wreathed sceptre is dropped with a sigh , And forth like an empress steps stately July : She sits all unveiled , amidst sunshine and balms , As Zenobia sat in her City of Palms ! Not yet has the martial horizon grown dun , Not yet has the terrible conflict begun : But the tumult of legions ,  - -  the rush and the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . Along the Potomac , the confident foe Stands marshalled for onset ,  - -  prepared , at a blow , To vanquish the daring rebellion , and fling Utter ruin at once on the arrogant thing ! How sovran the silence that broods o'er the sky , And ushers the twenty-first morn of July ;  - -  Date , written in fire on history 's scroll ,  --   - -  Date , drawn in deep blood-lines on many a soul ! There is quiet at Beechenbrook : Alice 's brow Is wearing a Sabbath tranquility now , As softly she reads from the page on her knee ,  --  " Thou wilt keep him in peace who is stayed upon Thee ! " When Sophy bursts breathlessly into the room ,  --  " Oh ! mother ! we hear it ,  - -  we hear it ! .. , the boom Of the fast and the fierce cannonading ! it shook The ground till it trembled , along by the brook . " One instant the listener sways in her seat ,  --  The paralysed heart has forgotten to beat ; The next , with the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillock , and pauses to hear . Again and again the reverberant sound Is fearfully felt in the tremulous ground ; Again and again on their senses it thrills , Like thunderous echoes astray in the hills . On tip-toe ,  - -  the summer wind lifting his hair , With nostril expanded , and scenting the air Like a mettled young war-horse that tosses his mane , And frettingly champs at the bit and the rein ,  --  Stands eager , exultant , a twelve-year-old boy , His face all aflame with a rapturous joy . " That 's music for heroes in battle array ! Oh , mother ! I feel like a Roman to-day ! The Romans I read of in Plutarch ;  - -  Yes , men Thought it noble to die for their liberties then ! And I 've wondered if soldiers were ever so bold , So gallant and brave , as those heroes of old .  - -  There !  - -  listen !  - -  that volley peals out the reply ; They prove it is sweet for their country to die : How grand it must be ! what a pride ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only a boy ! " The fervid hand drops as he ceases to speak , And the eloquent crimson fades out on his cheek . " Oh , Beverly !  - -  brother ! It never would do ! Who comforts mamma , and who helps her like you ? She sends to the battle her darlingest one ,  --  She could not give both of them ,  - -  husband and son ; If she lose you , what 's left her in life to enjoy ?  - -  Oh , no ! I am glad you are only a boy . " And Sophy looks up with her tenderest air , And kisses the fingers that toy with her hair . For her , who all silent and motionless stands , And over her heart locks her quivering hands , With white lips apart , and with eyes that dilate , As if the low thunder were sounding her fate ,  --  What racking suspenses , what agonies stir , What spectres these echoes are rousing for her ! Brave-natur 'd , yet quaking ,  - -  high- souled , yet so pale ,  --  Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And shudder and shrink at the boom of a gun , As only a faint-hearted girl should have done ? Ah ! wait until custom has blunted the keen , Cutting edge of that sound , and no woman , I ween , Will hear it with pulses more equal , more free From feminine terrors and weakness , than she . The sun sinks serenely ; a lingering look He flings at the mists that steal over the brook , Like nuns that come forth in the twilight to pray , Till their blushes are seen through their mantles of grey . The gay-hearted children , but lightly oppressed , Find perfect relief on their pillow of rest : For Alice , no bless 'd forgetfulness comes ;  --  The wail of the bugles ,  - -  the roll of the drums ,  --  The musket 's sharp crack ,  - -  the artillery 's roar ,  --  The flashing of bayonets dripping with gore ,  --  The moans of the dying ,  - -  the horror , the dread , The ghastliness gathering over the dead ,  --  Oh ! these are the visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that troop through her brain ! She pauses again and again on the floor , Which the moonlight has brightened so mockingly o'er ; She wrings her cold hands with a groan of despair ;  --  " Oh , God ! have compassion !  - -  my darling is there ! " All placidly , dewily , freshly , the dawn Comes stealing in pulseless tranquility on : More freely she breathes , in its balminess , though The forehead it kisses is pallid with woe . Through the long summer sunshine the Cottage is stirred By passers , who brokenly fling them a word : Such tidings of slaughter ! " The enemy cowers ; "  --  " He breaks ! "  --  " He is flying ! "  --  " Manassas is ours ! " ' T is evening : and Archie , alone on the grass , Sits watching the fire-flies gleam as they pass , When sudden he rushes , too eager to wait ,  --  " Mamma ! there 's an ambulance stops at the gate ! " Suspense then is past : he is borne from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant it be not on his shield ! " And Alice , her passionate soul in her eyes , And hope and fear winging each quicken 'd step , flies ,  --  Embraces , with frantical wildness , the form Of her husband , and finds ... it is living , and warm ! III . Ye , who by the couches of languishing ones , Have watched through the rising and setting of suns ,  --  Who , silent , behind the close curtain , withdrawn , Scarce know that the current of being sweeps on ,  --  To whom outer life is unreal , untrue , A world with whose moils ye have nothing to do ; Who feel that the day , with its multiform rounds , Is full of discordant , impertinent sounds ,  --  Who speak in low whispers , and stealthily tread , As if a faint footfall were something to dread ,  --  Who find all existence ,  - -  its gladness , its gloom ,  --  Enclosed by the walls of that limited room ,  --  Ye only can measure the sleepless unrest That lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and days go , and she watches the strife So evenly balanced , ' twixt death and ' twixt life ; Thanks God he still breathes , as each evening takes wing , And dares not to think what the morrow may bring . In the lone , ghostly midnight , he raves as he lies , With death 's ashen pallidness dimming his eyes : He shouts the sharp war-cry ,  - -  he rallies his men ,  --  He is on the red field of Manassas again . " Now , courage , my comrades ! Keep steady ! lie low ! Wait , like the couch 'd lion , to spring on your foe : Ye 'll face without flinching the cannons ' grim mouth , For ye 're ' Knights of the Horse-Shoe ' ye 're Sons of the South ! There 's Jackson !  - -  how brave he rides ! coursing at will , Midst the prostrated lines on the crest of the hill ; God keep him ! for what will we do if he falls ? Be ready , good fellows !  - -  be cool when he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  we 'll turn them ,  - -  and then We 'll ride them down madly !  - -  On ! Onward ! my men ! " The feverish frenzy o'erwearies him soon , And back on his pillows he sinks in a swoon . And sometimes , when Alice is wetting his lip , He turns from the draught , and refuses to sip :  --  " ' T is sweet , pretty angel !  - -  but yonder there lies A famishing comrade , with death in his eyes : His need is far greater , ... Sir Philip , I think ,  --  Or was it Sir Philip ? ... go , go !  - -  let him drink ! " And oft , with a sort of bewildered amaze , On her face he would fasten the wistfullest gaze :  --  " You are kind , but a hospital nurse can not be Like Alice ,  - -  my tenderest Alice ,  - -  to me . Oh ! I know there 's at Beechenbrook , many a tear , As she asks all the day ,  - -  'Will he never be here ? ' " But Nature , kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulses with coolness and calm ; The conflict so equal , so stubborn , is past , And life gains the hardly-won battle at last . How sweet through the long convalescence to lie , And from the low window , gaze out at the sky , And float , as the zephyrs so tranquilly do , Aloft in the depths of ineffable blue :  --  In painless , delicious half consciousness brood ,  --  No duties to cumber , no claims to intrude ,  --  Receptive as childhood , from trouble as free , And feel it is bliss enough simply , to be ! For Alice ,  - -  what pencil can picture her joy ,  --  So perfect , so thankful , so free from annoy , As her lips press the lotus-bound chalice , and drain That exquisite blessedness born out of pain ! Oh ! not in her maidenhood , blushing and sweet , When Douglass first poured out his love at her feet ; And not when a shrinking and beautiful bride , With worshipping fondness she clung to his side ; And not in those holiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , as his wife ; And never in motherhood 's earliest bliss , Had she tasted a happiness rounded like this ! And Douglass , safe sheltered from war 's rude alarms , Finds Eden 's lost precincts again in her arms : He hears afar off , in the distance , the roar And the lash of the billows that break on the shore Of his isle of enchantment , his haven of rest ,  --  And rapturous languor steals over his breast . He bathes in the sunlight of Alice 's smiles ; He wraps himself round with love 's magical wiles : His sweet iterations pall not on her ear ,  --  " I love you -- I love you ! " she never can hear That cadence too often ; its musical roll Wakes ever an echoed reply in her soul .  - -  Do visions of trial , of warning , of woe , Loom dark in the future of doubt ? Do they know They are hiving , of honied remembrance , a store To live on , when summer and sunshine are o'er ? Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent by the tempest ,  - -  be swept by the blast ? Do they dream that afar , on the wild , wintry main , Their love-freighted bark must be driven again ?  - -  Bless God for the wisdom that curtains so tight To-morrow 's enjoyments or griefs from our sight ! Bless God for the ignorance , darkness and doubt , That girdle so kindly our future about ! The crutches are brought , and the invalid 's strength Is able to measure the lawn 's gravel 'd length ; And under the beeches , once more he reclines , And hears the wind plaintively moan through the pines ; His children around him , with frolic and play , Cheat autumn 's mild listlessness out of the day ; And Alice , the sunshine all flecking her book , Reads low to the chime of the murmuring brook . But the world 's rushing tide washes up to his feet , And leaps the soft barriers that bound his retreat ; The tumult of camps surges out on the breeze , And ever seems mocking his Capuan ease . He dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While his soil by the feet of invaders is prest : What brooks it though still he be pale as a ghost ?  - -  If he languish or fail , let him fail at his post . The gums by the brook-side are crimson and brown ; The leaves of the ash flicker goldenly down ; The roses that trellis the porches , have lost Their brightness and bloom at the touch of the frost ; The ozier-twined seat by the beeches , no more Looks tempting , and cheerful , and sweet , as of yore ; The water glides darkly and mournfully on , As Alice sits watching it :  - -  Douglass has gone ! IV . " I am weary and worn ,  - -  I am hungry and chill , And cuttingly strikes the keen blast o'er the hill ; All day I have ridden through snow and through sleet , With nothing , not even a cracker to eat ; But now , as I rest by the bivouac fire , Whose blaze leaps up merrily , higher and higher , Impatient as Roland , who neighs to be fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread ,  --  I 'll warm my cold heart , that is aching and lone , By thinking of you , love ,  - -  my Alice ,  - -  my own ! " I turn a deaf ear to the scream of the wind , I leave the rude camp and the forest behind ; And Beechenbrook , wrapped in its raiment of white , Is tauntingly filling my vision to-night . I catch my sweet little ones ' innocent mirth , I watch your dear face , as you sit at the hearth ; And I know , by the tender expression I see , I know that my darling is musing of me . Does her thought dim the blaze ?  - -  Does it shed through the room A chilly , unseen , and yet palpable gloom ? Ah ! then we are equal ! You share all my pain , And I halve your blessedness with you again ! " Do n't think that my hardships are bitter to bear ; Do n't think I repine at the soldier 's rough fare ; If ever a thought so unworthy steals on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ! Such chivalry , fortitude , spirit and tone , Make brighter , and stronger , and prouder , my own . Oh ! Beverly , boy !  - -  on his white steed , I ween , A princelier presence has never been seen ; And as yonder he lies , from the groups all apart , I bow to him loyally ,  - -  bow with my heart . " What brave , buoyant letters you write , sweet !  - -  they ring Through my soul like the blast of a trumpet , and bring Such a flame to my eye , such a flush to my cheek ,  --  That often my hand will unconsciously seek The hilt of my sword as I read ,  - -  and I feel As the warrior does , when he flashes the steel In fiery circles , and shouts in his might , For the heroes behind him , to follow its light ! True wife of a soldier !  - -  If doubt or dismay Had ever , within me , one instant held sway , Your words wield a spell that would bid them be gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could the veriest craven that cowers and quails Before the vast horde that insults and assails Our land and our liberties ,  - -  could he to-night , Sit here on the ice-girdled log where I write , And look on the hopeful , bright brows of the men , Who have toiled all the day over mountain , through glen ,  --  Half-clothed and unfed ,  - -  would he doubt ?  - -  would he dare , In the face of such proof , yield again to despair ? " The hum of their voices comes laden with cheer , As the wind wafts a musical swell to my ear ,  --  Wild , clarion catches , now flute-like and low ;  - -  Would you like me to give you their Song of the Snow ? Halt !  - -  the march is over ! Day is almost done ; Loose the cumbrous knapsack , Drop the heavy gun : Chilled and wet and weary , Wander to and fro , Seeking wood to kindle Fires amidst the snow . Round the bright blaze gather , Heed not sleet nor cold ,  --  Ye are Spartan soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet subdued a foe , Who but asked a blanket On a bed of snow . Shivering midst the darkness Christian men are found , There devoutly kneeling On the frozen ground ,  --  Pleading for their country , In its hour of woe ,  --  For its soldiers marching Shoeless through the snow . Lost in heavy slumbers , Free from toil and strife ; Dreaming of their dear ones ,  --  Home , and child , and wife ; Tentless they are lying , While the fires burn low ,  --  Lying in their blankets , Midst December 's snow ! Come , Sophy , my blossom ! I 've something to say Will chase for a moment your gambols away : To-day as we climbed the steep mountain-path o'er , I noticed a bare-footed lad in my corps ; " How comes it , "  - -  I asked ,  --  " you look careful and bold , How comes it you 're marching , unshod , through the cold ? " " Ah , sir ! I 'm a poor , lonely orphan , you see ; No mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wounded , or captured , or killed , in the war , ' Twill matter to nobody , Colonel Dunbar . " Now , Sophy ! your needles , dear !  - -  Knit him some socks , And send the poor fellow a pair in my box ; Then he 'll know ,  - -  and his heart with the thought will be filled ,  --  There is one little maiden will care if he 's killed . The fire burns dimly , and scattered around , The men lie asleep on the snow-covered ground ; But ere in my blanket I wrap me to rest , I hold you , my darling , close ,  - -  close , to my breast : God love you ! God grant you His comforting light ! I kiss you a thousand times over !  - -  Good night ! V. " To-morrow is Christmas ! "  - -  and clapping his hands , Little Archie in joyful expectancy stands , And watches the shadows , now short and now tall , That momently dance up and down on the wall . Drawn curtains of crimson shut out the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ; The soft lamp suspended , its mellowness throws O'er cluster 'd geranium , jasmine and rose ; The sleeping canary hangs caged midst the blooms , A Sybarite slumberer steeped in perfumes ; For Alice still clings to her birds and her flowers , Sweet tokens of kindlier , happier hours . " To-morrow is Christmas !  - -  but Beverly ,  - -  say , Will it do to be glad when Papa is away ? " And the face that is tricksy and blythe as can be , Tries vainly to temper its shadowless glee . " For you , pet , I 'm sure it is right to be glad ; ' T is a pitiful thing to see little ones sad ; But for Sophy and me , who are older , you know ,  --  We dare not be glad when we look at the snow ! I shrink from this comfort , this light and this heat , This plenty to wear , and this plenty to eat , When the soldiers who fight for us ,  - -  die for us ,  - -  lie , With nothing around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so light , and the rations they deal , Are only a morsel of bacon and meal : And how can I fold my thick blankets around , When I know that my father 's asleep on the ground ? I 'm ashamed to be happy , or merry , or free , As if war and its trials were nothing to me : Oh ! I never can know any frolic or fun ,  --  Any real , mad romps ,  - -  till the battles are done ! " And the face of the boy , so heroic and fair , Is touched with the singular shadow of care . Sophy ceases her warbling , subdues her soft mirth , And draws her low ottoman up to the hearth : " But , brother , what good would it do to refuse The comforts and blessings God gives us , or use Them quite with indifference , as much as to say , We care not how soon they are taken away ! I am sure I would give my last blanket , and spread My pretty , blue cloak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , covers herself with her shawl , Since we 've sent all our blankets , )  - -  but , then , it 's too small ! Would Papa be less hungry or cold , do you think , If we had too little to eat or to drink ? So I mean to be busy ,  - -  I mean to be glad ; Mamma says there 's time enough yet to be sad ; I 'll work for the soldiers ,  - -  I 'll pray , and I 'll plan , And just be as happy as ever I can ; I 've made the grey shirt , and I 've finished the socks :  --  So come , let us help ,  - -  they are packing the box . " How grateful the task is to Alice ! her cares Are quite put aside , and her countenance wears A look of enjoyment as eager , as bright , As Santa Claus brings little dreamers to-night ; For Douglass away in his camp , is to share The daintiest cates that her larder can spare . The turkey , well seasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a la mode " round ; " The great " priestly ham , " in its juiciest pride , Is there , with the tenderest surloin beside ; Neat bottles , suggestive of ketchups and wines , And condiments racy , of various kinds ; And firm rolls of butter as yellow as gold , And patties and biscuit most rare to behold , And sauces that richest of odors betray ,  --  Are marshalled in most appetizing array . Then Beverly brings of his nuts a full store , And Archie has apples , a dozen or more ; While Sophy , with gratified housewifery , makes Her present of spicy " Confederate cakes . " And then in a snug little corner , there lies A pacquet will brighten the orphan boy 's eyes ; For Beverly claims it a pleasure to use His last cherish 'd hoardings in buying him shoes . Sophy 's socks too are there ; and she catches afar --  " There 's somebody cares for me , Colonel Dunbar ! " What subtlest of essences , sovereign to cheer --  What countless , uncatalogu 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , Lie hidden , these grosser of viands between ! What food for the heart-life ,  - -  unreckon 'd , untold --  What manna enclosed in its chalice of gold ! What caskets of sweets that Love only unlocks ,  --  What mysteries Douglass will find in the box ! VI . The lull of the Winter is over ; and Spring Comes back , as delicious and buoyant a thing , As airy , and fairy , and lightsome , and bland , As if not a sorrow was dark'ning the land ;  --  So little has Nature of passion or part In the woes and the throes of humanity 's heart . The wild tide of battle runs red ,  - -  dashes high , And blots out the splendour of earth and of sky ; The blue air is heavy , and sulph'rous , and dun , And the breeze on its wings bears the boom of the gun . In faster and fiercer and deadlier shocks , The thunderous billows are hurled on the rocks ; And our Valley becomes , amid Spring 's softest breath , The valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the onset ,  - -  the plunge and the roll , Reach down to the depth of each patriot 's soul ; It quivers -- for since it is human , it must ; But never a tremor of doubt or distrust , Once blanches the cheek , or is wrung from the mouth , Or lurks in the eye of the sons of the South . What need for dismay ? Let the live surges roar , And leap in their fury , our fastnesses o'er , And threaten our beautiful Valley to fill With rapine and ruin more terrible still : What fear we ?  - -  See Jackson ! his sword in his hand , Like the stern rocks around him , immovable stand ,  --  The wisdom , the skill and the strength that he boasts , Sought ever from him who is Leader of Hosts :  - -  He speaks in the name of his God :  - -  lo ! the tide ,  --  The red sea of battle , is seen to divide ; The pathway of victory cleaves the dark flood ;  --  And the foe is o'erwhelmed in a deluge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the troubles , and tumults , and terrors , that crowd So closely around her :  - -  the willow 's lithe form Bends meekly to meet the wild rush of the storm .

The tidings and rumors come thick and come fast , As riders fly hotly and breathlessly past ; They tell of the onslaught ,  - -  the headlong attack Of the foe with a quadruple force at his back : They boast how they hurl themselves ,  - -  shiver and fall Before their stout rampart , the valiant " Stonewall .

With sympathy , womanly , tender , divine ,  --  With lint and with bandage , with bread and with wine ,  --  She hastes to the battle-field , eager to bear Relief to the wounded and perishing there : To breathe , like an angel of mercy , the breath Of peace over brows that are fainting in death . She dares not to stir with a question , her woe , One word ,  - -  and the bitter-brimm 'd heart would o'erflow : But speechless , and moveless , and stony of eye , Scarce conscious of aught in the earth or the sky , In a swoon of the heart , all her senses have reeled ,  --  But she prays for endurance , for here is the field . The flight and pursuit , so harassing , so hot , Have drifted all combatants far from the spot : And through the sparse woodlands , and over the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! the sickness ,  - -  the shudder ,  - -  the quailing of fear , As it leaps to her lips ,  --  " What if Douglass be here !

Let her doubt -- let her hug the suspense , if she will ! She watches each ambulance-burden with dread ; She loots in the faces of dying and dead : And hour after hour , with steady control , She bends to her task all the strength of her soul ; She comforts the wounded with pity 's sweet care , And the spirit that 's passing , she speeds with her prayer . She starts as she hears , from her stout-hearted boy , A wild exclamation , half doubt and half joy :  --  " Oh ! Surgeon ! some brandy ! he 's fainting !  - -  Ah ! now The colour comes back to his cheek and his brow :  --  He breathes again -- speaks again -- listen ! you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunbar ?

And here is Macpherson , our barefooted boy ! " Poor Alice !  - -  her grief has been tearless and dumb , But the pressure once lifted , her senses succumb : Too quick the revulsion ,  - -  too glad the surprise ,  --  The mists of unconsciousness curtain her eyes : ' T is only a moment they suffer eclipse , And words of thanksgiving soon thrill on her lips . To Beechenbrook 's quiet , with tenderest care , They hasten the wounded , wan soldier to bear ; And never hung mother more patiently o'er The couch of the child , her own bosom that bore , Than Alice above the lone orphan , who lay Submissively breathing his spirit away . He knows that existence is ebbing ; his brain Is lucid and calm , in the pauses of pain ; But his round boyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not touched with a shade of regret . No murmur is uttered -- no lingering sigh Escapes him ;  - -  so young ,  - -  yet so willing to die ! His garment of flesh he has worn undefiled , His faith is the beautiful faith of a child : He knows that the Crucified hung on the tree , That the pathway to bliss might be open and free : He believes that the cup has been drained ,  - -  he can find Not a drop of the wrath that had filled it ,  - -  behind . If ever a doubt or misgiving assails , His finger he puts on the print of the nails ; If sometimes there springs an emotion of fear , He lays his cold hand on the mark of the spear ! He thinks of his darling , dead mother ;  - -  the light Of the Heavenly City falls full on his sight : And under the rows of the palms , by the brim Of the river -- he knows she is waiting for him . But the present comes back ;  - -  and on Alice 's ear , Fall whispers like these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  - -  and who will care When I may pass away ,  --  Or how , or why I perish , or where I mix with the common clay ? They will fill my empty place again , With another as bold and brave ; And they 'll blot me out , ere the Autumn rain Has freshened my nameless grave . Only a private : it matters not , That I did my duty well ; That all through a score of battles I fought , And then , like a soldier , fell : The country I died for ,  - -  never will heed My unrequited claim ; And history can not record the deed , For she never has heard my name . Only a private ;  - -  and yet I know , When I heard the rallying call , I was one of the very first to go , And ...

" The breath of the morning is heavy and chill , And gloomily lower the mists on the hill : The winds through the beeches are shivering low , With a plaintive and sad miserere of woe : A quiet is over the Cottage ,  - -  a dread Clouds the children 's sweet faces ,  - -  Macpherson is dead ! VII . ' T is Autumn ,  - -  and Nature the forest has hung With arras more gorgeous than ever was flung From Gobelin looms ,  - -  all so varied , so rare , As never the princeliest palaces were . Soft curtains of haze the far mountains enfold , Whose warp is of purple , whose woof is of gold , And the sky bends as peacefully , purely above , As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as white asters in Autumn , are found The tents all bestrewing the carpeted ground ; The din of a camp , with its stir and its strife , Its motley and strange , multitudinous life , Floats upward along the brown slopes , till it fills The echoing hollows afar in the hills . ' T is the twilight of Sabbath ,  - -  and sweet through the air , Swells the blast of the bugle , that summons to prayer : The signal is answered , and soon in the glen Sits Colonel Dunbar in the midst of his men . The Chaplain advances with reverent face , Where lies a felled oak , he has chosen his place ; On the stump of an ash-tree the Bible he lays , And they bow on the grass , as he solemnly prays . Underneath thine open sky , Father , as we bend the knee , May we feel thy presence nigh ,  - -  Nothing ' twixt our souls and thee ! We are weary ,  - -  cares and woes Lay their weight on every breast , And each heart before thee knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift this weight away , Thou canst bid these sighings cease ; Thou canst walk these waves and say To their restless tossings --  " Peace ! " We are tempted ;  - -  snares abound ,  --  Sin its treacherous meshes weaves ; And temptations strew us round , Thicker than the Autumn leaves . Midst these perils , mark our path , Thou who art ' the life , the way ; ' Rend each fatal wile that hath Power to lead our souls astray . Prince of Peace ! we follow Thee ! Plant thy banner in our sight ; Let thy shadowy legions be Guards around our tents to-night . " Through the aisles of the forest , far-stretching and dim As a cloister 'd Cathedral , the notes of a hymn Float tenderly upward , now soft and now clear , As if twilight had silenced its breathing to hear ; Now swelling , a lofty , triumphant refrain ,  --  Now sobbing itself into sadness again . The Bible is opened , and stillness profound Broods over the listeners scattered around ; And warning , and comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of the Psalm . Then simply and earnestly pleading , his face Lit up with persuasive and eloquent grace , The Chaplain pours forth , from the warmth of his heart , His words of entreaty and truth , ere they part . " I see before me valiant men , With courage high and true , Who fight as only heroes fight , And die , as heroes do . Your serried ranks have never quailed Before the battle-shock , Whose maddest fury beats and breaks Like foam against the rock . Ye 've borne the deadly brunt of war , Through storm , and cold , and heat , Yet never have ye turned your backs Nor fled before defeat . Behind you lie your cheerful homes , And all of sweet or fair ,  --  The only remnants earth has left Of Eden-life , are there . Ye know that many a once bright cheek Consuming care , makes wan ; Ye know the old , dear happiness That blest your hearths ,  - -  is gone . Ye see your comrades smitten down ,  --  The young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turf ye tread to-day , May be to-morrow 's grave . Yet not a murmur meets the ear , Nor discontent has sway , And not a sullen brow is seen , Through all the camp to-day .

No mailed warrior ever bore Aloft his shining lance , More proudly through the tales that fire The page of old romance . Oh ! soldiers !  - -  well ye bear your part ; The world awards its praise : Be sure ,  - -  this grandest tourney o'er ,  --  ' Twill crown you with its bays ! But there 's sublimer work than even To free your native sod ;  - -  Ye may be loyal to your land , Yet traitors to your God ! No Moslem heaven for him who falls , A bribed requital doles ; And while ye save your country , ye , Alas ! may lose your souls ! No glorious deeds can urge their claim ,  --  No merits , entrance win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely let you in . Oh ! sirs !  - -  there lurks a fiercer foe , Than this that treads your soil , Who springs from unseen ambuscades , To drag you as his spoil . He drugs the heedless conscience , till , No wary watch it keeps , And parleys with the treacherous heart , While fast the warder sleeps . He captive leads the wavering will With specious words , and fair , And enters the beleaguered soul , And rules , a conqueror there . Will ye who fling defiance forth , Against a temporal foe , And rather die , than stoop to wear The chains that gall you so ,  --  Will ye succumb beneath a power , That grasps at full control , And binds its helpless victims down In servitude of soul ? Nay ,  - -  act like brave men , as ye are ,  --  Nor let the despot , sin , Wrest those immortal rights away , Which Christ has died to win .

" ' T is easy , while happiness strews in our path , The richest and costliest blessings it hath , ' T is easy to say that no sorrow , no pain , Could utterly beggar our spirits again ; ' T is easy to sit in the sunshine , and speak Of the darkness and storm , with a smile on the cheek !

" There 's a love that is tenderer , sweeter than this --  That is fuller of comfort , and blessing , and bliss ; That never can fail us , whatever befall --  Unchanging , unwearied , undying , through all : We have need of the support -- the staff and the rod ;  --  Beloved ! we 'll lean on the bosom of God ! " You guess what I fain would keep hidden : you know , Ere now , that the trail of the insolent foe Leaves ruin behind it , disastrous and dire , And burns through our Valley , a pathway of fire .  - -  Our beautiful home , as I write it , I weep , Our beautiful home is a smouldering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forlorn , Its chimneys stand stark in the mists of the morn !

" As well might I plead with the whirlwind to stay As it crashingly cuts through the forest its way ! I know that my eye flashed a passionate ire , As they scornfully flung me their answer of -- fire ! " Why harrow your heart with the grief and the pain ? Why paint you the picture that 's scorching my brain ? Why speak of the night when I stood on the lawn , And watched the last flame die away in the dawn ? ' T is over ,  - -  that vision of terror ,  - -  of woe ! Its horrors I would not recall ;  - -  let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suffered them for ; I grudge not the quota I pay to the war ! " But , Douglass !  - -  deep down in the core of my heart , There 's a throbbing , an aching , that will not depart ; For memory mourns , with a wail of despair , The loss of her treasures ,  - -  the subtle , the rare , Precious things over which she delighted to pore , Which nothing , ah ! nothing , can ever restore ! " The rose-covered porch , where I sat as your bride --  The hearth , where at twilight I leaned at your side --  The low-cushioned window-seat , where I would lie , With my head on your knee , and look out on the sky :  --  The chamber all holy with love and with prayer , The motherhood memories clustering there --  The vines that your hand has delighted to train , The trees that you planted ;  - -  Oh ! never again Can love build us up such a bower of bliss ; Oh ! never can home be as hallow 'd as this !

" The children -- dear hearts ! it is touching to see My Beverly 's beautiful kindness to me ; So buoyant his mein -- so heroic -- resigned --  The boy has the soul of his father , I find ! Not a childish complaint or regret have I heard ,  --  Not even from Archie , a petulant word : Once only -- a tear moistened Sophy 's bright cheek : ' Papa has no home now !

When fierce and fast-thronging calamities rush Resistless as destiny o'er us , and crush The life from the quivering heart till we feel Like the victim whose body is broke on the wheel --  When we think we have touched the far limit at last ,  - -  One throe , and the point of endurance is passed --  When we shivering hang on the verge of despair --  There still is capacity left us to bear . The storm of the winter , the smile of the Spring , No respite , no pause , and no hopefulness bring ; The demon of carnage still breathes his hot breath , And fiercely goes forward the harvest of death . Days painfully drag their slow burden along ; And the pulse that is beating so steady and strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore Of the winding and clear Rappahannock , the roar Of conflict so fell , that the silvery flood Runs purple and rapid and ghastly with blood .  - -  Grand army of martyrs !  - -  though victory waves Them onward , her march must be over their graves : They feel it -- they know it ,  - -  yet steadier each Close phalanx moves into the desperate breach : Their step does not falter -- their faith does not yield ,  --  For yonder , supreme o'er the fiercely-fought field , Erect in his leonine grandeur , they see The proud and magnificent calmness of LEE ! ' T is morn -- but the night has brought Alice no rest : The roof seems to press like a weight on her breast ; And she wanders forth , wearily lifting her eye , To seek for relief ' neath the calm of the sky . The air of the forest is spicy and sweet , And dreamily babbles a brook at her feet ; Her children are ' round her , and sunshine and flowers , Try vainly to banish the gloom of the hours . With a volume she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can trace not a line on the page , And the poet 's dear strains , once so soft to her ear , Have lost all their mystical power to cheer . The evening approaches -- the pressure -- the woe Grows drearer and heavier ,  - -  yet she must go , And stifle between the dead walls , as she may , The heart that scarce breathed in the free , open day . She reaches the dwelling that serves as her home ; A horseman awaits at the entrance ;  - -  the foam Is flecking the sides of his fast-ridden steed , Who pants , over-worn with exhaustion and speed ; And Alice for support to Beverly clings , As the soldier delivers the letter he brings . Her ashy lips move , but the words do not come , And she stands in her whiteness , bewildered and dumb : She turns to the letter with hopeless appeal , But her fingers are helpless to loosen the seal : She lifts her dim eyes with a look of despair ,  --  Her hands for a moment are folded in prayer ; The strength she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I can bear it now , Beverly ... read . " The boy , with the resolute nerve of a man , And a voice which he holds as serene as he can , Takes quietly from her the letter , and reads :  --  " Dear Madam ,  - -  My heart in its sympathy bleeds For the pain that my tidings must bear you : may God Most tenderly comfort you , under His rod ! " This morning , at daybreak , a terrible charge Was made on the enemy 's centre : such large And fresh reinforcements were held at his back , He stoutly and stubbornly met the attack . " Our cavalry bore themselves splendidly :  - -  far In front of his line galloped Colonel Dunbar ; Erect in his stirrups , his sword flashing high , And the look of a conqueror kindling his eye , His silvery voice rang aloft through the roar Of the musketry poured from the opposite shore :  - -  'Remember the Valley !  - -  remember your wives ! And on to your duty , boys !  - -  on - -  with your lives ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call --  Then reeled in his seat , and fell ,  - -  pierced by a ball . " He lives and he breathes yet :  - -  the surgeons declare , That the balance is trembling ' twixt hope and despair . In his blanket he lies , on the hospital floor ,  --  So calm , you might deem all his agony o'er ; And here , as I write , on his face I can see An expression whose radiance is startling to me . His faith is sublime :  - -  he relinquishes life , And craves but one blessing ,  - -  to look on his wife ! " The Chaplain 's recital is ended : no word From Alice 's white , breathless lips has been heard ; Till , rousing herself from her passionless woe , She simply and quietly says --  " I will go . " There are moments of anguish so deadly , so deep --  That numbness seems over the senses to creep , With interposition , whose timely relief , Is an anodyne-draught to the madness of grief . Such mercy is meted to Alice ;  - -  her eye That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The billows ' wild fury sweeps over her soul , And she bends to the rush with a passive control . Through the dusk of the night -- through the glare of the day , She urges , unconscious , her desolate way : One image is ever her vision before ,  - -  That blanketed form on the hospital floor ! Her journey is ended ; and yonder she sees The spot where he lies , looming white through the trees : Her torpor dissolves with a shuddering start , And a terrible agony clutches her heart . The Chaplain advances to meet her :  - -  he draws Her silently onward ; no question -- no pause --  Her finger she lays on her lip ; if she spake , She knows that the spell that upholds her , would break . She has strength to go forward ; they enter the door ,  --  And there , on the crowded and blood-tainted floor , Close wrapped in his blanket , lies Douglass : his brow Wore never a look so seraphic as now ! She stretches her arms the dear form to enfold ,  --  God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is silent and cold ! X. " Break , my heart , and ease this pain --  Cease to throb , thou tortured brain ; Let me die ,  - -  since he is slain ,  - -  Slain in battle ! Blessed brow , that loved to rest Its dear whiteness on my breast --  Gory was the grass it prest ,  - -  Slain in battle ! Oh ! that still and stately form --  Never more will it be warm ; Chilled beneath that iron storm ,  - -  Slain in battle ! Not a pillow for his head --  Not a hand to smooth his bed --  Not one tender parting said ,  - -  Slain in battle ! Straightway from that bloody sod , Where the trampling horsemen trod --  Lifted to the arms of God ;  - -  Slain in battle ! Not my love to come between , With its interposing screen --  Naught of earth to intervene ;  - -  Slain in battle !

" ' T is thus through her days and her nights of despair , Her months of bereavement so bitter to bear , That Alice moans ever . Ah ! little they know , Who look on that brow , still and white as the snow , Who watch -- but in vain -- for the sigh or the tear , That only comes thick when no mortal is near ,  --  Who whisper --  " How gently she bends to the rod ! " Because all her heart-break is kept for her God ,  --  Ah ! little they know of the tempests that roll Their desolate floods through the depths of her soul ! Afar in our sunshiny homes on the shore , We heed not how wildly the billows may roar ; We smile at our firesides , happy and free , While the rich-freighted argosy founders at sea ! Though wrapped in the weeds of her widowhood , pale ,  --  Though life seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sorrowful brow ,  --  Is the cause of her country less dear to her now ?

By her pride in the soil that has given her birth --  By her tenderest memories garnered on earth --  By the legacy blood-bought and precious , which she Would leave to her children -- the right to be free ,  --  By the altar where once rose the hymn and the prayer ; By the home that lies scarred in its solitude there ,  --  By the pangs she has suffered ,  - -  the ills she has borne ,  --  By the desolate exile through which she must mourn ,  --  By the struggles that hallow this fair Southern sod , By the vows she has breathed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart that she worshipped ,  - -  the life That enfolded her own ; by her love , as his wife ; By his death on the battle-field , gallantly brave ,  --  By the shadow that ever will wrap her -- his grave --  By the faith she reposes , oh !

Good knights and true as ever drew Their swords with knightly Roland ; Or died at Sobieski 's side , For love of martyr 'd Poland ; Or knelt with Cromwell 's Ironsides ; Or sang with brave Gustavus ; Or on the plain of Austerlitz , Breathed out their dying AVES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With all the world to listen ,  --  If pride that swells a nation 's soul ,  --  If foemen 's tears that glisten ,  --  If pilgrims ' shrining love , if grief Which nought may soothe or sever ,  --  If THESE can consecrate ,  - -  this spot Is sacred ground forever ! A In the month of June the singular spectacle was presented at Lexington , Va. , of two hostile armies , in turn , reverently visiting Jackson 's grave . WHEN THE WAR IS OVER . A CHRISTMAS LAY . I. Ah ! the happy Christmas times ! Times we all remember ;  --  Times that flung a ruddy glow O'er the gray December ;  --  Will they never come again , With their song and story ? Never wear a remnant more Of their olden glory ? Must the little children miss Still the festal token ? Must their realm of young romance All be marred and broken ? Must the mother promise on , While her smiles dissemble , And she speaks right quietly , Lest her voice should tremble :  --  " Darlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such Christmas times , When the war is over ! " II . Underneath the midnight sky , Bright with starry beauty , Sad , the shivering sentinel Treads his round of duty : For his thoughts are far away , Far from strife and battle , As he listens dreamingly , To his baby 's prattle ;  --  As he clasps his sobbing wife , Wild with sudden gladness , Kisses all her tears away --  Chides her looks of sadness --  Talks of Christmas nights to come ,  --  And his step grows lighter , Whispering , while his stiffening hand Grasps his musket tighter :  --  " Patience , love ! keep heart ! keep hope ! To your weary rover , What a home our home will be , When the war is over ! " III . By the twilight Christmas fire , All her senses laden With a weight of tenderness , Sits the musing maiden : From the parlor 's cheerful blaze , Far her visions wander , To the white tent gleaming bright , On the hill-side yonder . Buoyant in her brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no fond fear , Flings its shade upon her . Though no mortal soul can know Half the love she bears him , Proudly , for her country 's sake , From her heart she spares him .  - -  God be thanked ! she does not dream , That her gallant lover Will be in a soldier 's grave , When the war is over ! IV . ' Midst the turmoil and the strife Of the war-tide 's rushing , Every heart its separate woe In its depths is hushing . Who has time for tears , when blood All the land is steeping ?  - -  In our poverty we grudge Even the waste of weeping ! But when quiet comes again , And the bands , long broken , Gather round the hearth , and breathe Names now seldom spoken --  Then we 'll miss the precious links --  Mourn the empty places --  Read the hopeless " Nevermore , " In each other 's faces !  - -  Oh ! what aching , anguish 'd hearts O'er lone graves will hover , With a new , fresh sense of pain , When the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharp with self-denial , Fraught with loftier sacrifice , Fuller far of trial --  Strews our flinty path of thorns --  Marks our bloody story --  Fits us for the victor 's palm --  Weaves our robe of glory ! Shall we faint with God above , And His strong arm under --  And the cold world gazing on , In a maze of wonder ? No ! with more resistless march , More resolved endeavor , Press we onward -- struggle still , Fight and win forever !  - -  Holy peace will heal all ills , Joy all losses cover , Raptures rend our Southern skies , When the war is over ! VIRGINIA CAPTA . APRIL 9TH , 1865 . I. Unconquered captive !  - -  close thine eye , And draw the ashen sackcloth o'er , And in thy speechless woe deplore The fate that would not let thee die ! II . The arm that wore the shield , strip bare ; The hand that held the martial rein , And hurled the spear on many a plain --  Stretch -- till they clasp the shackles there ! III .

Thou thought'st him vanquish'd -- boastful trust !  - -  His lance , in twain -- his sword , a wreck --  But with his heel upon thy neck , He holds thee prostrate in the dust ! V. Bend though thou must , beneath his will , Let not one abject moan have place ; But with majestic , silent grace , Maintain thy regal bearing still . VI . Look back through all thy storied past , And sit erect in conscious pride :  --  No grander heroes ever died --  No sterner , battled to the last ! VII . Weep , if thou wilt , with proud , sad mein , Thy blasted hopes -- thy peace undone ,  --  Yet brave , live on ,  - -  nor seek to shun Thy fate , like Egypt 's conquer 'd Queen . VIII . Though forced a captive 's place to fill , In the triumphal train ,  - -  yet there , Superbly , like Zenobia , wear Thy chains ,  - -  Virginia Victrix still !          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
