txt In a late letter I furnished a meagre account of as expedition of colored troops to Florida . A recent arrival from the scene of operations puts me in ' possession of details which are interesting , and ) Promise important results . The troops left Beaufort on the 6th inst. , in the United States transports Burnside , Boston and John Adams , and consisted of the First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers , Col. T. W. HIGOINEON , and the Second Regiment South Carolina Volunteers , Col. Janes MONTOONZRY . The destination of the expedition was known to few on board , but it was generally understood that a base of operations was to be established , and measures adopted with a view of encouraging the negroes toile ? from their masters , and accept the protection of the United States , and this was sufficient to fill the colored soldiers with earnestness and enthusiasm . On the 7th. the vessels reacited Fernandina , where they were delayed for a day until the plans of the commanders could be properly arranged , and on the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. John 's River , under the guns of the naval steamers Mecca , Capt . Wsmoe. and Norwich , CainDescuar . The sons of Mars and Neptune then consulted , and were not long in deciding to capture the town of Jacksonville , distant twenty miles up the river , which the fortunes of the war had twice before thrown into our bandit and which we had twice abandoned to the enemy , as it was not worth the holding . A necessary delay , before attempting the object they had in view , afforded an opportunity for a detachment of a dozen of Col. Mertroomarty 's mento go ashore on a foraging excursion . They proved themselves experts in that line of business , returning ? in an hour with a fat beef , slung on a pole , that had fallen a vie tim to good marksmanship . This prize , with a quantity of poultry and vegetables that came with it , and a superabundance of excellent fish , which those on board the vessels took while their comrades were on shore , aided the Commissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . On the 10th , the expedition steamed up the river . A few miles from the mouth , on the left bank , is the first highland , called St. John 's Bluff . At this point , a former expedition was stopped last Summer by a formidable rebel battery commanding the channel . The fortification was subsequently taken by a combined naval and land force , that destroyed the works , and brought away the guns . It was reasonable to suppose that an obstacle to the passage of the fleet would be again found here , and preparations were made for a fight , but no enemy appeared , and not a sign of resistance showed WWI during the further progress of the Yessels toward the town . At 8 o'clock the steamer John Adams , under cover of the gunboat Meats , ranged alongside the wharf at Jacksonville . and Col. Hueerases jumped ashore , followed by Capt.Domar 's company  --  the men scrambling off as best they could , neglecting , in their eagerness , to'avail themselves of a gang-plank . They immediately formed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad depot . The remainder of the force soon followed , and part of it advanced to the outskirts of the town , and holding the approaches . This movement was executed with such promptness , that the first knowledge of the invasion only came to the townspeople when they saw the black soldiers marching past their dwellings . As soon as the Burnside was fastened to the wharf , Col. MONTGOMERY , at the head of two companies , pushed out into the woods to find the rebel pickets . He was not long before coming up with a cavalry company . and a brisk skirmish ensued . His men behaved admirably , and routed the enemy , after killing and wounding a dozen or more , one of %shorn was the Captain , who was shot through the head . Ms own loss was one killed and . two wounded . It was afterwards ascertained that the town has not recentlyptien occupied by the rebels in force , a picket simply being established there . Three miles from the town there is another and much stronger picket station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles further out . Col. HIGGINSON immediately stationed pickets and adopted precautions against surprise , and so the time passed until the next morning without any alarm having been given . A dash was at last made by about 200 of the rebel cavalry , but this force was repulsed , and not a man on our side was injured . In the afternoon a scouting squad of the Carolinians crossed the river . and brought back one prisoner , a rebel flag , four rifles , a horse and a fat ox . finding a large force of the enemy in the woods about two miles from the town . Col. Ilioeissor , s headquarters are at the:residence of the rebel Col. Sena:Rees , a very elegant and commodious building . He was at first constantly pestered with applications on the part of the inhabitants for permission to pass beyond our lines , and in every instance he informed the applicants that if their choice led them to go among the rebels in preference to accepting the protection of the United States , they were privileged to leave . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight them . Those who decided upon remaining , must simply take the oath of allegiance and be faithful to their obligations , and their safety would be guaranteed . He nad not come to injure . but to protect loyal men  --  the rebellious alone were to be driven out . At ter an explanation of this sort , many withdrew their applications . The Sixth Connecticut regiment and Eighth Maine to-day left Beaufort to relieve the negro regiments at Jacksonville , and will hold that place while Col. flumason presses on further into the heart of the State . You have already been informed of the capture of a rebel naval officer named Bxvieut , by his own men , who deserted while on picket duty and brought him off with them . Yesterday a flag of truce was sent down from Savannah with a package of clothing and $100 in gold to meet BuyiLLE 's necessities , and a draft for $250 more upon Mr. Wesnixoroa Duanaow , of Hanover-street , New-York , made payable to him in Liverpool , was also forwarded for the same purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latevuax for Lieut . Ruse , the signal officer ; who was captured by the rebels last week from Spanish Welts Station . H. W.
