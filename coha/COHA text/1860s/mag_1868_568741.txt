ARTICLE VII. - DIVORCE . PART VI -- ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH TOWARDS DIVORCE LAWS : PRINCIPLES OF DIVORCE LEGISLATI ON . IN closing our essay on the subject of divorce we come to a very important field of inquiry ; to the relation , namely , between the view of divorce taken by the law of the land and that which is taken by Christian morals , and to the questions , what are the ' obligations of the Christian Church as to this matter , and what are the true principles of a healthy divorcelegislation . We shall touch on these points in the order named with all possible brevity , and not without the hope of helping in some slight degree as well the cause of sound morality as that of sound legislation . Marriage , as the starting point of the family and of the State , as a divine institution established both in our nature and by positive precept , and as involving the welfare of mutually dependent beings , has and must have iniportant relations to religion , morality , and law . Religion strives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which it is solemnized , and by the guilt which is made to attach to adultery . In other words , religion stands up in defense of the morality of the family state , and this it does in many heathen societies , as well as under the light of Christianity . So also law starts from a feeling of the sanctity of marriage ; it is built on a moral conviction at its very beginning . There are sacred obligations which are violated by adultery and must be protected . The question whether a man can have more than one wife is determined by the state of moral feeling in the community . Divorce can not in fact be separated from the ends and uses of marriage which lie within the province of morals , and adultery can not and never has been regarded as a mere breach of contract . And so the better the laws are , the more they watch over and exact the fulfillment of those obligations to which mafriage gives rise by bringing new beings into the world . Marriage is sometimes regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false inferences from the assumption that it is // such . If it be only a contract , it is natural to argue that it may cease at the will of the parties , as for instance after a certain number of years , or on failure of having children , or when inclination for each other has ceased ; just as other contracts , - those of service , partnership , or loan for instance-take the special form imposed on them by the contracting parties . And so , as contract is one of the commonest of the modes of intercourse , it has been used to explain and to belittle both the Church and the State . It has entered into theology and has put a covenant made by God with Adam into the place of a great law of race and a divine economy . The State has been built on compact made as if by men who had lived alone before . In the case of marriage the particular parties do indeed make a contract , but it contemplates an entrance into a special definite mode of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just as the voluntary nature of the Church presupposes such an unalterable type of Church existence as Christ and the Apostles laid down , and as the State in all its free varying forms presupposes the recognition of justice and the protection of the individual . Marriage then is more than a contract , and must be regarded by right law to have this nature . So the IRomans regarded it . The well-known definition of Modestinus , the eminent scholar of Ulpian at the beginning of the third century , as well as th' similar one of the Institutes which has passed into canonical law , contemplates the perpetuity of the marriage union of one man and one woman as essential to the nature of the institution . It runs as follows : Nupthe sunt conjunctio mans et fo*minne et consortium omnis vitte , divini et humani juris communicatio . And from the general principle contained in this definition no legislation of Christain lands for a long time together has diverged . It condemns polygamy , it frowns on divorce . The * Comp . Inst . Justin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et mulienis conjunctio , individuam vit*e consuetudinem continens . " In the decree of Gratian , part 2 , Caus. xxvii. , Quaest. ii. , c. 3 , we have the definition " consensus ergo cohabitandi et individuam vitte consuetudinem retinendi Linterveniens eos conj uges fecit . Individua vero vitLe , consuetudo est talem se in omnibus exhibere viro , qualis ipsa sibi est , et e converso. " // union of a marriage pair must at least continue until a formal act of the State shall pronounce it ended by some misconduct of one of the pair towards the other . But although Christian morality and a State where faith in Christ prevails will take fundamentally the same view of marriage , yet the State may require in certain minor points that which the Church forbids , or forbid that which the Church either ordains or allows , or it may at least allow that which the Church disapproves . The first procedure may be illustrated by the conflict between civil marriage and the sacramental theory of the Roman Church . The law of France , and of other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to go through a form of civil contract before a magistrate , and then the marriage is legitimurn . As for the rest , it leaves to their own consciences whether they shall apply to the priest , the minister of the sacrament , for the solemnization of their union , so that it may be rcttum according to the Church view . The Catholic Church has been obliged to endure this , although it considers the separation of the civil contract and the sacrament to be inadmissible , since the contracting Farties are the administrators of the sacrament . And with this feeling the Concordat between the Pope and Austria , made a few years since , did away , we believe , with the civil contract , which within this present year the force of public opinion has restored to its former place in the laws. * So also a state may prevent marriages which are valid according to Church law from having validity by civil law , as must happen if it admit into its legislation a greater number of cases of nullity than the ecclesiastical law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church law are of minor importance , especially in Protestant countries ; the most common attitude of the State , outside of the thoroughly Catholic lands , is to sanction by its legislation that which the doctrine of the New Testament and the general sentiment of Christian Churches condemns . Here tht*re is properly no conflict . The State says to the Church in regard to marriage and divorce you must take your own course and provide // for the purity of life and discipline by your own measures . The State is not bound to extend its legislation over all the depart.inei*ts of morality , still less is it required to protect religion by punitive statutes . We do not , in societies which have advanced far beyond the simplicity of the family state , generally punish lying or drunkenness , or filthy words or sabbath-breaking , or other outward offences which a Church may fairly notice by its discipline . Why is it obligatory on the State in the case of marriage and divorce to follow the strict rule laid down in the New Testament ? Were the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church requires , it would be tyrannical , it would be at war with a power co-ordinate with itself , in the end it would perish ; but when it simply allows married persons to separate from one another for causes not recognized by Christ , it lays no burthen on tender consciences , it comes into no conflict with religion , it leaves the remedy against the evils of an imperfectly moral code in the hands of the Church , which is the main support of morality in Christain lands . We admit the justice of the position that the State is not bound to forbid many things which the individual may do in his outward actions which are sins in the sight of God , and even injurious , on the whole , to society . There is a difference between doing this and legalizing what is considered by Christian people to be contrary to the law of the New Testament . All that they ask is , that , in the matter of divorce , the State should abstain from action ; that it should enact no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounty to immorality . When the State imposes no penalty on drunkenness , or lying and sabbath-breaking , its attitude is simply negative . And here it does not cut off a remedy , if by either of these sins , a man inflicts an injury on others , as through violent assault , or slander , or disturbance of the public peace . But when it grants a divorce for a year 's desertion , for instance , or for misconduct destroying the happiness of the marriage relation , its action is positive . It removes from the obligations of the marriage relation persons who otherwise would be under them ; it grants the power of marrying again to persons who otherwise would have no such power . Its // action , therefore , is not at all like its inaction in cases of individual immorality . And there is , moreover , a difference between the effects of the two . When sabbath-breaking is not punished by civil law no one would infer that the State thought it right , but when divorce is allowed for causes confessedly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a teacher of an opposite morality from that of the New Testament . Owing to the manifold relations of marriage , as well to the civil condition as to morality and to religion , people will be very apt to feel that divorce is perfectly right , and the influence of bad doctrine thus taught by the State will run over within the pale of the church , to divorce it from Christ 's law , to trouble it with many perplexing questions , to injtire its discipline and its purity . This must be true in Catholic lands , if the law of the church and the law of State are at variance ; how much more must it be so in Protestant or mixed countries , where there is no such distinct and sweeping law of church action as the Catholic doctrine of the sacramental quality of marriage . The law of the State , as it scems to us , can take only one of two positions in regard to marriage : either it must teach that it is neither bound nor inclined to support Christian law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce that the evils from a stricter law would be greater than those which attend the pfesent loose one . That this is a good ground Ibr impert*ct legislation , we admit ; but what a confession of impotence and of a corrupt civilization to be obliged to go back to the customs of a half barbarous society like that of the Jews under Moses , and to own that the ennobling conceptions of Christ , which must influence law if they are generally entertained , have even as yet no practical sway . Moreover , what if it should turn out that the laws themselves , by their own bad qualities , have multiplied divorces and corrupted opinion . * ew York and Connecticut , contiguous States , differ vastly in their divorce legislation . Is thet e naturally any greater " hardness of hearts* ' on this side of l3yram river to account for this difference , or is it due to the unwariness and unskillfulness of legislators ? But whatever be the attitude of the State , the Church must // stand upon the principles of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who are within her reach . The minister , if his celebration of marriage be not a farce , can no more join in marriage two persons who , in his view , have no right to form such a union , than he can aid any other immoral proceeding . Suppose the persons intending such a union to be a woman put away for other cause than that of adultery , and a man , whoever he be , to whom our Saviour ' s words would have application- " that he who marrieth her who is put away committeth adultery . " How can the fact that such a union is legal in the least degree justify a minister of Christ in giving a religious sanction to an act which he believes to be an adulterous one ? Ought he not to say , in solemnizing such a union , " whom God hath not joined together let not man put asunder . " Or can the minister take the ground that he is merely an official person in solemnizing marriage , whose duty extends only to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a most important relation ; while the question whether the two persons who ask for his blessing upon their nuptials have the responsibility of deciding whether their union is legal and Christian . But if he carried out this principle he would be an official person , and nothing more , in celebrating the Lord 's Supper , and thus any one who wished ought to have free admission to the Lord 's table . There could then be no discipline , because , even in the case of gross offenders , it must needs be left to themselves whether they have repented or not . In the case of celebrating marriage , the minister 's duty is comparati vely easy . A specific act is requested of him by persons whose past life is generally notorious , whose former relations are matter of common fame , if there be anything scandalous about them . The question what they think right is of minor importance for him . lie might as well indorse a forged note on the ground that it must be left to the conscience of the forger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help two persons to enter into a union which he regards as adulterous , on the same ground . In the case of giving access to all to the Lord 's table , the principle in question would be more justifiable , because in the strictest churches much must be left to // individual consciences just at that point . But it is a false principle in all ministerial acts , and would , if allowed , destroy the purity , if not the life , of the Christian Church . The duty of the minister , in the case supposed , seems to be clear . There is another and a more important point to be considered in reference to the duty of the Christian Church in the treatment of those of its members , who , under the law of the State , contract or dissolve marriages against the law of Christ . This , we say , is the most important question , and it is so for two reasons . The first is , that in all countries where a civil marriage is required , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , performed by some civil authority , has the san* validity as one celebrated by a minister of the Gospel , the refusal of the minister to act in a certain case has no great bearing , since the civil authorities can take his place . The minister satisfies his own conscience ; perhaps he awakens discussion in his parish , and that is all . But a loose , unchristian habit of the Christian Church , or of Christian Churches in a community , in reference to marriage and divorce , sets up an insurmountable obstacle to the recognition and observance of Christ 's law of marriage . It excnses bad civil legistation ; it inculcates bad principles on the members of the Church ; it fails to teach what it ought to teach , what principles of discipline were designed to teach . Practically it supports the State in its attitude of disregard to Christian law . It thus tends to break up the spirit of discipline , to put to silence the voice of the Church in favor of holiness , and to take away its power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian morals . The other reason for the importance of this inquiry in regard to the duty of the Church , as it respects divorce , is to be found in the occasional difficulty of the questions which may present themselves . Or , in other words , until State law comes nearer to Christ 's law , and until the churches cease to regard the State law of divorce as their standard of morality , multitudes of persons will be entrapped into forming unions which Christ forbids . These cases , and especially certain hard cases , where the unchristian marriage was long since consummated , may cause extreme perplexity to such as desire to obey Christ , and // at the same time are aware how harsh and grinding invariable rules of discipline must be , especially in a period of transition from a loose neglect to a healthy observance of Christian rules . We say " a period of transition , " implying thus that at present in this country Christian discipline in the matter of divorce by no means attempts to execute the law of the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of divorce passed over from the State to the Church ? As the one holds that its only concern iii questions of divorce is the maintenance of individual rights with a certain supervision of the welfare of society , does not the other , to a great extent , refer such questions to the consciences of the parties who have by divorce , or by marrying divorced persons , sinned against Christ 's law ? So far as we can learn , all Protestant churches in this country are loose and negligent in such cases . There are none , indeed , that would not exclude adulterers from the communion , even though the State rarely attempts to inflicts its slight penalties for this crime . But there are few cases , we apprehend , where persons legally married receive church censures , however unchristian their relation may be , whether judged by Christ 's law , or by Paul 's rule , as generally interpreted . This slackness of discipline may have arisen from the extreme rarity of such cases among the members of the Church : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding what was the meaning of the commands given by Christ or by his apostles , since cases of divorce within the Church , if known at all , were for adultery and desertion alone . Even after the State abandoned the Christian position usually taken by Protestants , the practice of divorce was confined to the more unprincipled classes of society . The Church was thus taken unawares , and its lay members , naturally thinking that divorce is a matter of State legislation , overlooking the religious side of marriage and the precepts of the New Testament , and regarding it in the light of a civil contract , were prepared for any slackness of discipline which was not intolerable . The ministers , we judge , are more enlightened than the laity , and a reform in discipline may be more difficult in those forms of Protestantisin where " the power of the keys " is entrusted to the congregation than in // those where the eldership and the minister , or the latter alone , exercise this authority , according to a general law of the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to our knowledge where ministers in Congregational churches refused to sanction mari:iages of divorced persons , and several others where the church sustained the looser view of divorce contained in State law against the opinion of the minister who , in one instance , resigned his place on account of the collision . In another case , an association of ministers refuscd to recommend one of their number to another body , because , in their opinion , he had put away his wife unlawfully . As the Congregational churches have always been comparatively strict in sustaining the discipline of the New Testament , it is likely that they will be , many of them , the foremost to restore it in case of divorce , while others of them will be the last to abandon a habit of slackness which the New Testament condemns . Our impression then is , that Christian churches in this country do not stand where they ought ; that the cause of this , in part at least , is the insensible influence of bad State law ; that the ministers , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purity and gospel order of their churches , but that many of the laity within the Church overlook the law of Christ entirely . It is cheering and a source of hope for the future welfare of society to observe that great bodies of Christians are moving for reform and for ret am to the old usage in respect to the discipline of divorce . We have had occasion to know that for some time many of the ministers of the Congregational churches in Connecticut have had their thoughts turned in this direction . The Episcopal Convention of Connecticut held at Middletown , in June of the present year , considered the same subject and expressed their sense of the evil of existing State legislation in decided resolutions . The Methodist Church , North , also , at their late triennial meeting in Chicago , enibraced divorce within the topics of discussion ; and although no general law of that Church . as far as we can learn , was passed , the attention given to this point is a favorable sign . We understand also that the subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Episcopal Church , which is to meet in a few days . Such movements can not fail to end in a removal of a part of the evils into which the churches of the land have fallen through the influence of bad legislation . Butt as long as the Church follows the law of Christ , and the State makes another law dissolving marriage on slighter grounds , there will be frequent cases of legal but unchristian divorce and marriage . What is the duty of the church when such cases arise in which one of the parties at least is a meinher of the church , and amenable to its discipline . First , we may take the ground that the parties in unchristian divorce and marriage have acted according to their own views of duty , and ought to be undisturbed . This might be a sound rule of action if the rule in the Scriptures were not a clear one ; if the churches had not formally reaffirmed the rule as their basis of discipline-as we suppose them to have one  --  and if there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is hardly conceivable that , when the Apostle bids the Christian wife , who has for certain causes departed from her husband , to be reconciled to him or remain unmarried , he did not take it for granted that a violation of this command would be visited with church censures . It is still less conceivable that when Christ calls putting away a wife for any cause- short of her fornication by the name of adultery , he did not intend that it should he treated as such by his church , at least , if not by the State . For these are tangible open acts , not like states of mind capable of two interpretations , but ascertainable by the ordinary rules of evi dence . Moreover , the individuals concerned , after the church or churches shall have taken a position , can no longer plead ignorance or the excuse of legality . Add to this that there is no barrier against bad law , no adequate protection of society within the sphere of those relations with which both Church and State have to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of a general rule , but makes use also of the single xveapon of self-defense and of terror to evil doers that is within its reac*h-exelusion from its privileges . Let the law not forbid polygamy , and let a man with ftur or with many wives seek to enter the Christian church . Is not the benefit // to society of a protest against polygamy , and of a refusal to admit a polygamist into or to continue him in the church so great , that there could be no doubt how the church ought to act in a case like this ? Ought a change of the law which forbids more than one wife to make Christians feel that discipline should be slackened in such cases5 or ought not this change to be a reason rather for enforcing discipline ? We conceive , then , that no believer in the gos pci and in the duty of retaining purity among believers , not even a Quaker , who limits discipline to its loxvest terms , can dissent from our position , that in cases of marriage and divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere ,  --  to prevent by its authority , and to censure by that essential power of excluding unworthy members , which belongs to all societies , even of the most voluntary character . The Catholic Church is not to be blamed for the ground it has taken in this matter . Its law of divorce may have gone beyond that of the gospel . Its system of prohibited degrees is an addition to Christian morality , as is confessed by the frequency of dispern sations ; but assuredly it is not wrong in refusing to make the law of the State its basis of action concerning divorce rather than the law of Christ , nor in feeling itself called , whatever be the law of the State , to educate the people and protect its own principles by ecclesiastical censures . But secondly , while recent cases of divorce or of marriage with a person unlawfully divorced may be of easy handling , when once the rules of the church are distinctly laid down , there still remains a class of cases which call for a separate consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of marriage occurred long since , where the parties in their irreligiousness only aimed to keep within the law of the State , and have for years reputably sustained the relations of man and wife , but now , having at last felt the influence of the gospel , are seeking to become members of some church of Christ . If they had lived in concubinage , the case would present no difficulty , for solemn marriage would repair the fault , they might repent and do honor to the sacred laws of morality by turning their condition into one allowed by God and by C*sar both . But in the case supposed , where the // sin of the individuals concerned was one of thoughtlessness at first , where the existing relation is not only permitted but the severance of it is forbidden by ci*il laws , what position shall the Church take ? Shall it take the position of the Catholic Church and require the entire discontinuance of their union , at least until the death of a previous husband and wife , or the similar position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , would require all slaveholders , under all circumstances , to make their slaves free or be cast out of the Church ? Shall it-we say-take this rigorous view of practical morality , or shall it say that cases may arise where , by a sort of equity , the ordinary rule ought to be *et aside , or where there is a sort of prescription against the original and in favor of the existing condition . We confess ourselves to be of this latter opinion , and to hold that the positive precept of marriage , like some other positive precepts , must bend to the necessities of the case . The peculiarities in such extreme cases , where the marriage relation is concerned , are due in part to the fact that marriage has a civil as well as a religious side ; that the State may even forbid the separation of persons who ought never to have been united in marriage at the outset ; and in part to the fact that marriage itself brings the parties to it into a unique relation , a relation *exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children . We take in fact the same ground which the Catholic Church takes in regard to prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity . The general rule is valuable , but there may be reasons for dispensation . As for prohibited degrees , the dispensation comes before the marriage , but there can be no permission beforehand , no *onsent of the church to such marriages as we now have in view , lit comes afterward , when , like heathen , the married pair forsake a life of ungodliness and seek the privileges of Christians . But the case differs from some which may present themselves when heathen seek admission into the society of Christ . A man must leave all his wives except the first , or , at least , except one , both because polygamy is directly opposed to the spirit of the gospel , and because it would almost ruin a newly founded church to allow part of its mcmbers to have many wives while others have but one . In the // case , however , which we have supposed the couple continue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they honor the holiness of the church by repentance , and a rest itutio ad integrum is impossible . But it may be said that there is a very plain course for parties thus married against the strli*tness of Christian law to take . Let them separate and lead a life of continence apart . This would be the Catholic way of cutting the knot . But here there are two obvious difficulties , the disaster to children from breaking up the family state , and the perils of an enforced celibacy . A better way , in our judgment , where such peculiar cases arise is to consent to the state defacto . It may be right even for the usurper to continue his sway against all justice in a certain condition of a people , when his power has stood the test of years , and all the relations of society have conformed themselves to the altered state of things . The same holds good in the case which we have been considering . Let the church , while it can not be a party to any violation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within certain limits without seeking to tear up or overthrow . As long as the State legislates on one set of principles and the Church on another , there must be a conflict between the two powers , or else the Church must succumb , for the State has the outward positive relations of life under its control . But the two powers may be brought near to one another , so as not to come into frequent conflict at least , by the efforts of the church , to teach the true doctrine concerning marriage and divorce , and by its healthy discipline over its members . There will then remain those pariahs of society who lie outside of all Christian influences and care nothing for the sanctity of marriage , and those civilized , refined heathens who look on marriage as a mere contract , or as a respectable kind of concubinage . Even now divorce and marriage with a person divorced against the rules of the New Testament are principally confined to these classes . It is for the benefit of these classes , then , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , that the law of divorce needs extensive reformations and improvements . The Protestant churches , if once awake to present evils for which State law and a low // conception of marriage are accountable , can take care of themselves and of the interests put into their hands . But how far ought a reformation to be carried and at what ought reformers to aim ? A Christian would be glad to have an end put to all conflict and possibility of conflict between the two authorities , to have divorce or separation granted only on account of adultery and malicious desertion . In the present state of Christian countries , however , this extent of reformation is altogether unlikely to be attained . In this country especially , where the divine in government and in social life is so generally overlooked , where doctrine concerning the State and the relations of men so generally takes the vulgar , apprehensible form of contract , where the desire of speedy enjoyment and the quick procurement of the means of it are degrading the moral sentiments , it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough . Lawmakers will say that they are not bound by the morality of the New Testament in their legislation touching rights and the common welfare , that you may as well separate two parties who hate and injure one another rather than vainly strive to reach the inaccessible ideal by your laws which the next legislature can alter , and that strictness in prohibiting divorce will not prevent social evil but will only force it to pour its fiery floods by a new crater upon society . We are disposed to take the ground , therefore , on which alone the defects of the Mosaic legislation can be justified-that the hardness of men 's hearts prevents a better system  --  and to inquire not what is the best possible law , but what are some of the features of a law that is at once desirable and feasible . A main feature of a good law will , of course , be to hold out no inducement to a husband or wife , who is dissatisfied with the present condition , to get a divorce , in order to contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings the petition or libel , and is able by forbearing to do so to prevent the other for an indefinite period from carrying out his or her purposes . And , of course , the lawmaker never intends to bring such a motive before the discontented consort . But the law offers in fact a premium for divorce whenever the disadvan // tages of such a step for the guilty party are inconsiderable . We maintain , therefore , in particular , 1 . That the adulteress and the husband guilty of adultery ought never to be allowed to marry the partner in his or her crime . We are disposed to go farther and preclude the guilty wife , perhaps also the guilty husband , from contracting marriage with any person whatsoever , at least until the death of the innocent partner . In the projet of the code civil , as it came before the Council of State , the adulteress could never marry again , and the guilty husband could never marry his concubine . M. Tronchet having said that this prohibition for the woman could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future lewdness on her part , the law was amended so as to enact that the culpable party in cases of adultery could never marry his or her accomplice . ( Art . 298 . ) We doubt the correctness of the conclusion while we admit that Tronchet has some reason for his opinion . Granting that some women thus branded by society will thus act , the question recurs whether it is worth while to save them at the expense of public virtue . Is it not better for society that such a woman lose her ordinary right by way of penalty-even as a citizen sometimes loses his right of office or of suffrage by fighting a duel or by bribery-than that the honorable state of the matron b*e degraded by her participation in its privileges . But , however this may be , we wonder that the law of England and a number of the United States should put nothing in the way of a divorced wife 's marriage to her paramour . And this is the more strange in those codes which , like the law of Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of adultery , while they permit such persons to marry whom they will the day after divorce has been decreed . The penalty is never inflicted , and the adulteress " wipeth her mouth " and takes the airs of an honest woman . 2 . But again , adultery ought to be made penal-as it is in almost all the States  --  and provision should be made that the penalty should follow the sentence of* divorce without any other trial . This suggestion will surprise some , perhaps , but it is simply borrowed from the Code Civil . ( Art . 298 , u. s . ) , " La fenm , e adult*re sera conda ? nrne par le mAmeugemeuta // Ut r*clusion , " etc . The authors and revisers of that wellconsidered code did not contemplate a loose procedure like that which prevails among ns , but a careful trial , and the same judgment which separated the parties was followed , simply on the requisition of the public officer , by the imprisonment of the woman . The question here arises whether adultery ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman , and the same penalty , whichever sex is guilty . According to all the ancient codes and many of the modern there is a distinction made between the sexes , and the distinction affects the law of divorce. * The crime is the same , except that it is justly regarded as a greater advance in wickedness for women as a class to be unfaithful in the marriage relation than for men . The harm done to society by such unfaithfulness is far greater for the women , when her guilt is so to speak inside of the family , than when the father of the family commits the crime . There are strong reasons for making a discrimination in punishment against the woman , and we incline also to set up those limitations on divorce for a husband 's adultery which appear , in the principle , in English law and the French civil code . 3. in all cases of divorce , where the blameworthy party is allowed to marry again , such marriage within a certain term ought to be made nnlawfbl . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the evidence submitted , which of the l ) artners is blameworthy , and it may happen that both are so in the same or in different degrees . The Prussian law requires such a decision . Among us , as outward specific acts are noticed almost exclusively , the parties can hardly share the civil blame , and the faulty party can not have a decree in his favor , with the 8eeming exception of cases where a wife deserts her husband on account of ill treatment . But whoever can have the fault fastened on him ought to be forbidden to marry for a considerable period . According to the code civil this interval is three years in the case of divorce by mutual consent . Beyond question such enforced delay for // a considerable period would act as a very powerful motive in favor of the good conduct of married parties . This is shown not only by the nature of the case , but by experience in the IRhenish Prussian districts under French law , where although divorce by mutual consent was allowed , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe that if parties divorced by the provisions of the omnibus clause in the law of Connecticut , could not marry again for two or three years , the number of divorces would be greatly lessened . Nay , if instead of that clause , the divorce by mutual consent were introduced into our code together with the French limitation above mentioned of three years , we should be much better off than we are now . 4 . Separation from bed and board without dissolution of wedlock may be resorted to in some cases and as a temporary measure . This kind of separation was unknown to the ancients , and owes its origin , we believe , to the Apostle 's words - " but if she depart , let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband , " - which refer , as we have given our reasons for supposing , not to separation for the cause of adultery but for minor faults . Being consistent with the doctrine that marriage is indissoluble and is a sacrament of perpetual efficacy , it gradually superseded divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree of Gratian was compiled , that is from about the year 1150 , the only separation known to the Catholic Church , and to Catholic countries fully obedient to its law , is from bed and board for a longer or shorter period , for life in the case of a woman 's adultery , for a time on account of smaller offenses against the law of marriage . The feelings of the Catholics , trained up for centuries by their theory of the sacraments , ought to be respected in the legislation of a country where religions live side by sid* on an equal footing . Hence in every case where divorce is allowed by our laws either the petitioner who gains his point ought to have the choice between absolute divorce and separation , or else the wishes of the two parties ought to determine in this respect . The latter appears in the present form of the code civil : " il sera libre aux 6poux de former demande en separation de corps . " The former was contained in the projet before it was // amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce pourra le borner a Ia demande en separation de corps et des biens . " We should unite the two in this way : if the parties can agree , the decree of the Court may pronounce a separation instead *f a divorce ; if they cannot-as , for instance , in the case of mixed marriage  --  the petitioner or libeller may decide . For he , being the inj tired party , ought to have his choice ; and he might have continued the state of marriage by taking no legal notice of the offence . But it is questionable whether his power to put a bar in the way of the other party ought to be perpetual . But aside from those instances where religious scruples , fairly respected by the law , incline the parties to qualified separation , we can not help feeling that this kind of divorce is liable to very grave objections . Such separation is only defensible on religious grounds , and if it prevailed in the law it would destroy the balance between the civil and the religious weight of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The offended party has rights which he claims have been invaded and demands reparation . But the law refuses him reparation , in order that the offending party may be held to repentance . In no other case of wrong is such a principle admitted . But a still greater inconsistency with justice lies in this , that he is deprived for the future , it may be for his life , of au important right . He can not marry again , because of the wrong done by his partner . It is like chaining a husband or wife to the corrupting body of a guilty consort executed by the law 's sentence . It is , moreover , a source of great temptation . Let the sentence be that of lifelong separation for adultery . Is it likely that the majority of husbands would remain continent under that legal constraint , and can not the toleration of concubinage in Catholic countries and the levity with which it is regarded be thus in part accounted for ? And , still further , the same cause will lead people to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation which has no effect on the marriage relation and a winking at the grossest violations of its sanctity ? Will not the parties be tempted to think that to continue as they are , with the allowance to each other of leading no very strict life , is // better than to make a noise about family matters which can have no other effect than that of giving liberty to a married pair to live apart ? Such are some of the moral and jural difficulties attendant on separation from bed and board , when looked at as a general substitute for divorce . But the evils mentioned exist in but a slight degree when it is applied as a temporary measure for those less grievous offenses against the family constitution which do not preclude *reconciliation . Cruelty and drunkenness , which are offenses , for the most part , of the husband , render the wife 's state of life intolerable ; desertion and crime , subjecting to a long imprisonment , break up the family state . But the violent man , the sot , the vagabond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better school can he be in than that where he can feel himself to be repairing injuries and recovering the love of a wife and of children . Let the separation , then , be reserved for cases like these , as a temporary expedient , until it can be seen whether reform is to be hoped for . Then after a long enough probation , let the separation be turned into divorce on petition of the injured party . The Massachusetts law allows this substitution , or , in other words , permits remarriage , after five years from the passage of the decree , on application of the innocent party , and after ten years , on application of either party . In the code civil , power is given to the party who was originally the defendant , in all cases excepting where the complaint is against a woman for adultery , " to demand a divorce from the tribunal " after three years of separation . This permission given to the defendant , it is alleged , does no injury to the other 's conscience , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry again , he may still consider himself bound by the law of his church . 5 . The consequences of divorce , as it regards property , ought to be such that the injured party shall sustain as little pecuniary loss or deficiency in the means of support as possible , and the culpable party shall be deprived of the benefits which the marriage or a marriage settlement placed within his or her reach . This was the great motive held out by Roman law , for although adultery was punishable from the time of Augustus , the penalty must have been rarely , if ever , inflicted , and // divorce on other gron nds enjoyed impunity . The arrangements in regard to this point are various in the different codes , and the adequate treatment of it would far transcend our limits . But the general principle is not only that the innocent and injured partner shall not loose the pecuniary advantages formerly derived from the connexion , but also that , in gross cases at least , the offending party shall actually suffer in his goods on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to the discretion of the court ; but there ought to be some positive law directing and limiting that discretion . 6 . The same may be said of the custody of the children , if there be any . The general principle here is that misconduct , which has broken up the family state and made light of all household endearments , shows unfitness to take charge of the children . They with the property sufficient for their maintenance must be entrusted to that one of the married pair who has been proved to be most regardful of the family interests , or , in case of such a person 's incompetence , to some third person . 7 . The laws ought to be specific and for determinate causes , and little discretion should be left in the hands of judges . To put the whole matter under the control of the judges without any specific legislation would , we are persuaded , be fruitful of evil . The judges would vary in their decreessome granting divorce for slight grounds , others being more rigid . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of short continuance , they might come to represent the public opinion , whatever it were , or there might be such a pressure of the bar upon them that they could not resist . Accordingly almost all our codes have been specific in their definitions of the causes justifying divorce , and have left but little freedom in the judge 's hands . Few of our statutes indeed give the courts too great power . The great error consists in the allowance of divorce for indeterminate causes , although neither of the parties has committed any act that can be taken hold of . Such causes are incompatibility of temper and conduct which permanently affects the happiness of the marriage relation . We have already called the attention of our readers to the mischief which the " omnibus " clause has worked in the // State of Connecticut . Such a law brings the judges oftentimes into extreme perplexity , for the happiness of the marriage relation is a very vague thing , and a thing capable of being painted in very false colors by an interested party . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkind words , by lasting differences of policy in the management of children , or by a husband 's refusal to give a wife money that she may dress ambitiously and above her rank . It adds strength , as Mr. Loomis observed in his Article , to other weak grounds of divorce . When a charge of habitual drunkenness or of failure to support is not sustained , this plea comes behind and props up a weak case . It tempts parties to marry improvidently , and opens the door through which they can escape from matrimony , for it amounts to not liking one another , and the dislike is enhanced by the prospect offered to the hopes of one or the other of making a more advantageous connexion . Let the acts then be palpable on which a decree of divorce is based , and if the state of society is such that it shall seem desirable to separate parties on such vague grounds , let there be no dissolution , or at least no immediate dissolution of the marriage tie . 8 . The procedure in petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States , amid the laws of the different States ought to be brought into a substantial , uniformity . With regard to the first point we leave reforms to those who are better able to judge  --  to the better class of lawyers who have no interest in encouraging applications for divorce by looseness of procedure , and who know what effect a change in practice is likely to have . But any one , lawyer or not , must be aware of the miserable state of things now existing in some of the States , and no one , who will compare the careful , thorough law of the code civil with most of our statutes relating to divorce , will feel any great respect for American legislation . Let us be allowed to illustrate the state of things by a single case occurring not a hundred miles from where we write . A woman had been married less than three months , when , on occasion of her making evening visits or a visit with a young man , her husband remonstrated , and high words took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in another // town . After about three months more she brought a petition for divorce , and the grounds alleged were adultery , habitual drunkenness , cruelty , and misconduct destroying domestic happiness . The three first the lawyer put in , it would seem , to strengthen his cause . The adultery was with a person unknown to the party complained of ; habitual drunkenness was a false allegation , and had it been true , drunkenness for three months ought not to be regarded as habitual in the legal sense ; cruelty he had scarcely a chance to commit . The man had of course a notice served on him , but , as we suppose , did not care to incur the expense , or to bring back to his house a woman whom he conceived to have injured him , and who did not want to keep him company . The divorce was allowed by the court . The woman apologized afterwards for the charge of adultery , and said that the lawyer put it in . What went on the re3ord we know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talse charges appear on their pages. * We are persuaded not only that they are unreliable , but that they tend to give a false impression of the number of adulteries which are annually cominitted . When the judge thinks that possibly one or more higher offenses may have given cause for divorce , and that at all events the suit , if not the non-appearance of the party complained of , furnishes proof of bad relations in a household , he will be apt , if an omnibus clause permits it , to decide favorably upon the pefition . And hasty examination of a case with pressure of an interested lawyer , may not only break up a family , but put a permanent stamp on a mans s or a woman * character . It has been suggested that in ex parte proceedings a state 's attorney should cx ojflcio be the guardian of the interests of * We add ex abundanti an extract from a letter written by a legal gentleman in Indiana . The seventh clause , to which reference is made , runs thus : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper that a decree shall be grant . ed . " It frequently happens , says that gentleman , " that the petition , which is not sworn to , contains several statutory cases , and perhaps also states facts which could only be the basis of a divorce under the seventh clause ; and as the evidence is heard orally , and no evidence is kept of it , probably in not one in five of the records of divorces can the real ground of the divorce be obtained from the paper with certainty . " // the absent defendant . The laws of Indiana , where there are many such cases , strive to make their peace with justice and righteousness by thus protecting the absent party , but as the attornies " have no acquaintance with the causes , their efforts are generally nominal. *** It would seem then that the laws ought to take greater care both of the absent defendant 's interests and of him who is too poor to incur the expenses of the suit . We add that when the suit is not ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , divorce cases , at least on the complaint of adultery , ouo'ht to be secret-that is , no report of them ought to be al-b lowed to appear in the public journals . The prurient curiosity of bystanders and the right of publicity do not weigh enough to counteract the interests of morality . The subject of divorce is complicated in this country by the number of jurisdictions and the ease of emigration . Just as a good paper currency was impossible when every State licensed its own banks , so it is with divorce laws . He who can not get what he wants under the severe laws of New York , can become a free man by a short stay in Indiana . The validity of a divorce there need not , it is true , be always admitted by New York . Yet the facilities for such proceedings are among the worst parts of our system . Those who seek to reform the laws in this important article , will be bound to endeavor to stop those leaks which loose legislation in one State occasions every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting the Christian church , and as affecting society outside of the company of professed Christians . But for the interests of the Church of Christ it is not essential and absolutely necessary that the laws in this parti*ular should be reformed . Indeed we may say that a greater facility of divorce than now exists , that even the allowance of divorce whenever the parties unite in desiring it , would assuredly awaken men of Christian principles to the evils of society ; the discipline of the church would become stricter ; and even in a country like ours , where // Christians are no corporate or united body , but an aggregate of persons belonging to different , and often jealous denominations , where their joint action is almost out of the question , the evils of society , the greater they became , would the more rouse all those who bear the name of Christian to a common feeling , if not to concerted measures for their suppression . Christianity developed the purest principles of family life , and the noblest conception of marriage , in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrained , and under Jewish law , where , besides this freedom of divorce , polygamy was tolerated . And this it did before the sacramental theory was formed , and marriage regarded as one of the sacraments . So now , if they have any vitality , that is if they are really Christian , Christian communities can take care of themselves . " Do your worst then , " we say , " in the matter of legislation . Make marriage in your codes a contract which the parties can dissolve at will , which either party can dissolve for very trifling reasons , which the State will dissolve for a great number of wrongs . Let your laws punishing adultery impose a penalty which nobody will mind , and let them be a dead letter . You but awaken then in the Christian communities an increasing sense of their responsibility as the guardians of morals ; you only quicken in them the purpose to introduce within their own pales a stricter discipline , and to seek to leaven society more with their pure principles . Thus , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the instinct of self-preservation in a society which has immense power when once fairly in motion ; you practically throw society into the hands of new legislators , and you will lead round a cycle of things when your laws will give way to stricter ones more consonant with the principles of morality , and when you will be looked upon as the enemies of social progress. ** Greatly to be desired then as is a reform in divorce legislation , if the direct interests of religion are considered , it is not for this reason absolutely necessary , because the Christian church can resist and counteract , and more than neutralize the existing laws , however bad they may be . But such reform is of immense importance , when we look at the effect of legislation on the general interests of society ; when we look especi // ally at those vast classes who , even in a country like ours , receive no direct influence from Christian truth and the Christian church . What is to be done with and for the lower classes of society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravest of questions for the mind of a benevolent man . In a country which is mainly Protestant , the noblest things  --  the right of private judgment , and the intellectual light which always accompanies an open Bible-are a " savour of death " to the neglected classes : they are made self-confident , vain , uneasy , ready to receive the crudest falsehoods , and to reject the most venerable truths . Religion appears to them a restraint , and religious people they are jealous of because these , in the natural order of things , get above them . So liberty also is another " savour of death , " as they know not how to use their political right , fall into the hands of demagogues , and become , as a class , a political power within the State . Their cry is for freedom from restraint . Free rum , free Sundays , free suffrage , free divorce , and the like are their watchwords ; and those who expect to get into power by their votes , if they have any better or higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate or purify these classes ? They stand aloof from the ennobling influences of religion ; politics do not wash them clean ; their " little learning is a dangerotis thing ; " their facilities for sensual gratification are less limited , perhaps , than those of the working class in any other land . There is no help for them , unless it lies in the voluntary movements of Christian enterprise , teaching the knowledge of Christ , and with it elevating the idea of family life . But loose divorce laws corrupt family life at its foundation , for it is hard for such persons to believe that what law sanctions is not right . Here then the conflict , between low views of marriage and divorce and the views contained in the New Testament , is waged with the greatest sacrifice of the interests of society . If one out of five or six of the marriages within a certain class is dissolved by law , and the law with the procedure in the courts almost offers a bribe to get rid of a husband or wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it to have for that portion of the community its venerable or holy character . And the low conception of marriage tends to creep up into higher circles , as some of // this class , from time to time , rise in respectability and wealth . Since , then , reforms in the divorce laws are especially needed for the lower stratum of society since this class is most demoralized and corrupted by the fatal facility of the existing laws , and since it has in itself no power of self-recovery , when once thoroughly debased , it becomes all Christian and all ben evolent persons , on their account mainly , to unite in an attempt to procure a reform in the laws concerning divorce , to bring legislation as near to the Christian standard as the people will bear . We do not conceive that a reform in law would remove all the evils to which the marriage state is subject . Law can not reform beyond a certain point , because " it is weak through the flesh . " But bad law can corrupt even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strict divorce law defeat its own end ? It certainly might , and that in two ways ; first , by creating opposition enough to obtain an alteration of the law , and then , in a corrupt state of society , by tempting to sin within the marriage relation , if a person can not free himself from its constraints . Yet it must not be supposed that , if divorce were confined to cases of adultery or at least to gross violations of marriage duties , such more flagrant crimes would be multiplied . This would be the case , if the law gave the adulterer the advantage of marrying again , but not if it took away the right from him or delayed the exercise of it for a term of years . And on the other hand loose divorce laws do not prevent adultery , as is abundantly shown by the history of Roman society under the emperors . We entertain no fear then that a system of divorce laws coming nigh-gradually , if it must be so  --  to the severity of the INew Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruptions of society into a worse channel . It is the defects of our present system that are corrupting . A system i*ore in accordance with the idea of marriage could not , if accepted , fail to purify society .
