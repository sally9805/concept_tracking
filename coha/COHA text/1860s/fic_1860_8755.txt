Enter Colonel Villiers hurriedly , D. L. H. 2 E. , as though pursued . Lucy . Lucy ( Without , C. D. L. H. ) Well , Mr. Brush , how did it all come off ? ( Colonel . Villiers hearing noise C. L. H. , hides behind the screen on L. H. 3 E. , and looks around . ) Enter Brush and Lucy , C. D. L. H. Well , Mr. Brush , tell me , how did it all come off ? Brush . Brush O , admirably , Mistress Lucy , admirably . The parson made a heart-rending address ; the bride almost fainted , the relatives shed tears ; and I , Lucy , ( sighing ) ' pon my honor , I began to feel sorrow for my lonely condition . Yes , Miss Lucy , I think I must marry . Lucy . Lucy Well , for my part , Mr. Brush , I shall wait a little before I make up my mind to matrimony , for I doubt if this marriage turns out well . Brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite condition ? Lucy . Lucy Yes , except love . What 's wedlock good for , unless hearts are joined ? Brush . Brush O , Mistress Lucy , where have you lived ? I see you have imbibed the vulgar prejudices of the day . Do n't you know that love , nowadays , has nothing to do with matrimony ? Besides , this marriage was peculiarly desirable ; it united two illustrious houses which were both dying out ,  --  sixteen quarterings , marry eighteen . The king himself gives the bride away , and the old earl their uncle furnishes the dowry of one hundred thousand pounds . Faith , it would need Old Nick himself to make that turn out badly . Lucy . Lucy That 's all very well , Mr. Brush , but my poor mistress might have been so happy ! Brush . Brush Ah ! a prior attachment . No matter ! School-girl affection is like the measles ,  --  a disease common to all children , but rarely dangerous  --  she 'll soon recover . Lucy . Lucy O Sir Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sacrificed to you ! Brush . Brush And so you think you are the only ones who have made sacrifices ? I know a great lady whom this marriage will certainly drive mad . Lucy . Lucy And I know a poor young man whom it will surely kill . Enter Thomas , C. D. L. H. Thomas . Thomas Mr. Brush ! Mr. Brush , there is a lady below in a close carriage who wishes to speak to you immediately . Brush . Brush Is she young and pretty , Thomas ? Thomas . Thomas Yes sir , very young and very pretty . Brush . Brush Then I will wait upon her . Tell her I am coming . ( Exit Thomas , C. D. L. H. ) Lucy . Lucy And who is this lady , Mr. Brush ? Brush . Brush Our forsaken one , probably . But you must excuse me , Mistress Lucy . You would not have me keep the lady waiting . We must respect misfortune . ( Exit Brush , consequentially , C. D. L. H. As Brush goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and the Colonel appears . ) Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( L. C. ) Hist , Lucy ! Lucy ! Hist ! ( Seizes and Kisses her . ) Lucy . Lucy ( R. H. , screaming . ) Ah ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Hush ! it is only I. ( Gives her a purse . ) Do n't you recognize me ? Lucy . Lucy O , yes , sir . But you took me so by surprise ? But what are you doing here in this house at the very moment when she you love is married to another ? How did you get here ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers How did I get here ? I scarcely know myself . Like a madman I was Wandering around the house ; I spied an open door , I entered ,  --  nobody saw me ,  --  I ran up a pair of stairs , crossed two or three apartments , rushed in here , heard voices , jumped behind that screen , and here I am . Lucy . Lucy Yes , I know very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , what do you want ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What do I want , Lucy ? To see her once again , only once  --  to tell her that I love her  --  that I shall always love her  --  that this marriage drives me mad  --  and that I shall die . Lucy . Lucy But you have told her all that a hundred times . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Well I will tell her again . ( Sits down . ) Lucy . Lucy But it is impossible ! Do n't you know , sir , that you are here in her husband 's house ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Know it ? of course I know it . What of it ? Lucy . Lucy Do n't you know they are now at the church ? that they may return every instant ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Will they ? I 'll wait for them . Lucy . Lucy Wait for them ! Heavens , these lovers are a curious race . Wait for them ! Are you mad ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lucy But she has not forgotten you  --  she loves you I ought not to tell you , but you make me pity you . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers She loves me , and she marries another ! Lucy . Lucy How could she help it ? You knew this marriage had long ago been decided on . You knew it on the first day you ever saw her ; and have n't you had time for the last two years to prepare for it ? Come , be reasonable . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Ah ! if I were only sure that she would keep the promise she made me . ( He rises . ) Do you think , Lucy , she will keep it ? Lucy . Lucy Of course she will keep it ; that is , as well as she can . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What do you mean by as well as she can ? Lucy . Lucy O , colonel , you must not ask impossibilities ; and when one marries , you know ,  --  why  --  one gets married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. H. ) Lucy , you drive me to despair ! Lucy . Lucy There , there you are sitting down again . ( Shaking him . ) But think that in ten , in five minutes , perhaps , they will be here . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Rising . ) Lucy , I will kill him ! Lucy . Lucy Kill who ? Sir Edward ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , Sir Edward . The husband of my Blanche . Lucy . Lucy But I thought he was your friend . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers He was ; but now he is my mortal enemy . Lucy . Lucy O Heavens ! you make me shudder . Does Sir Edward know you love his wife ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Thank Heaven , he do n't suspect it . Lucy . Lucy I breathe again . And now to business . You came here to see my mistress , did you not ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Alas , yes ! Lucy . Lucy You see that is impossible . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Impossible , Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wish to compromise , to ruin her , do you ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Heaven forbid ! But do you think she still loves me ? Lucy . Lucy Think ! I am sure of it . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Kissing her . ) Ah ! Lucy , if you only knew how much good you do me . Lucy . Lucy And as you ca n't see her , and are now acting sensibly , write her a letter , and I will give it to her . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Taking letter from his pocket . ) I have written one , Lucy . Lucy . Lucy What , beforehand ! O , he is not so mad as I thought . Give it to me . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And when you give it to her , tell her , Lucy , that I am dying  --  Lucy . Lucy There , there , I will tell her any thing if you 'll only go . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Going to the door , L. H. 2 E. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stopping him . ) But which way are you going out ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Why , the way I came in , to be sure ! Lucy . Lucy Stop ! stop ! Do you want every body to see you ? Here , go this way , through this room ; it is mine , and if you are seen I alone shall be compromised . Go , go ! ( Pushing him . ) Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And you will give her the letter ? Lucy . Lucy Yes , yes , any thing ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Then give her this too . ( Kisses her , and exit , D. R. H. F. ) Lucy . Lucy That makes three I must give her . Poor fellow , he must be very much in love . ( Turns and sees Brush standing at door , L. H. 2 E. , a letter in his hand . ) Brush . Brush Very well , Mistress Lucy , very well ! Poaching on my lady 's grounds , eh ! Lucy . Lucy Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brush Come , come , Miss Lucy , no secrets ! Lucy . Lucy And who was this beautiful lady ? Brush . Brush A countess whom we love . And who was this fine young gentleman ? Lucy . Lucy A colonel whom we love . And that letter ? Brush . Brush This letter ! O , that is for my lord . ( Puts it in his pocket . ) And that note ? Lucy . Lucy That note ? Ah , that is for my lady . ( Puts it in her bosom . ) Brush . Brush But why then , Lucy , did you say this marriage would turn out badly ? It seems to me to be wondrous well . We begin where others end . Lucy . Lucy Hush ! I hear them coming . Brush . Brush Then each to our post . Good luck to your colonel , Lucy ! ( Exit , D. L. H. 2 . E. ) Lucy . Lucy Good luck to your countess , Mr. Brush ! Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Calling without , C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy It 's my lady 's voice . ( Runs to C. D. ) Enter Lady Blanche , C. D. L. H. Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Languidly . ) Help me , Lucy ! a chair ! quick ! quick ! ( She sinks into the chair . ) Lucy . Lucy O madam , what is the matter ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Matter , Lucy ? I am married ! Lucy . Lucy O , is that all ? Lady B. Lady Blanche How can you speak so , Lucy , when you know I am in despair ? ( Leans her head upon Lucy . ) Lucy . Lucy My lady , are you going to faint ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I believe so . Where are my salts ? Lucy . Lucy I 'll run and get them , my lady . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Stopping her . ) No , do n't leave me . Lucy . Lucy But what have you done with Sir Edward ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I do n't know . I ran away from him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with the greatest languor . ) Have n't you any thing to revive me , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy No , but I have something to tell you . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Without opening her eyes . ) Speak . Lucy . Lucy I have seen the colonel . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Languidly . ) What colonel , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy What colonel ? why , Colonel Villiers ! Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Eagerly . ) You have seen him , Lucy ? here ? is he here still ? Lucy . Lucy O , no , he has gone . Lady B. Lady Blanche I breathe again . How you frightened me ! And what did he want ? Lucy . Lucy He wanted to see you for the last time . He was like a madman . He kissed me three times , and wanted to die . Lady B. Lady Blanche Poor fellow ! He is like me , Lucy , but we ca n't always die when we wish . But did he not charge you to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam ; he has left you a letter . Lady B. Lady Blanche A letter ! But he is very bold to dare to write to me . Lucy . Lucy But , my lady , he was in such despair . Lady B. Lady Blanche Was he very desperate , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy O , more than you would believe . Lady B. Lady Blanche No matter ; I wo n't read his letter , Lucy . Where is it ? Lucy . Lucy Here it is , madam . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Opening the letter as she speaks . ) It was very , very wrong in you to take this letter , Lucy . We must return it . Lucy . Lucy But , my lady , it is impossible , since you have opened it ! Lady B. Lady Blanche Opened it ? Why , so I have ! I vow , Lucy , I do n't know how it happened . But I suppose , since it is open , I may as well read it , Lucy . Lucy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you can do with it . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Reading . ) " Dear Blanche : If one could die of grief , I should now be dead . " Lucy . Lucy There , what did I tell you ? Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Continuing . ) " One hope alone remains to me . I rely upon your promise , that Sir Edward shall never be to you aught but a brother . " Lucy . Lucy Did you promise him that ! Hum ! Lady B. Lady Blanche " Postscript . It is useless to tell you that I shall pass the night under your window . Algernon . " Under my window ! Lucy , he will die of cold . Lucy . Lucy O , we must not let him die of cold ; we must find something to warm him . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Rising quickly . ) Lucy ! Lucy . Lucy What , my lady ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I hear Sir Edward coming . He must not find me here . Come with me quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Sir Edward Mordaunt , C. D. L. H. Seeing Lady Blanche and Lucy running off , he stops a moment on the threshold , then goes slowly to the door , R. H. 2 E. , which he tries . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Locked ! I thought so . If there is an attack , there will be a stout defence . Upon my word , my wife 's affection for me does not seem very strong . If she only knew what I am thinking of now , she might perhaps be glad of it . Enter Brush , D. L. H. 2 E. Brush . Brush Are you alone , Sir Edward ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Perfectly so . Brush . Brush Here is a letter for you , sir . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt A letter , and from where ? Brush . Brush From the Countess Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt From the countess ? Give it to me , quick , you rascal ! Brush . Brush I did not know whether you would find time to read it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Do n't you know I am desperately in love with the countess ? ( Opens the letter and reads . ) " Dear Edward : Yesterday you swore to me that I , and I alone , was the object of your love ; that your marriage was simply a matter of convenience , and that Lady Blanche should never be to you aught but a sister . " Brush . Brush Did you promise her that , sir ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Faith , yes ; what could I do ? I would like to see you , you rascal , paying your court to one woman and marrying another . Brush . Brush You know my principles too well , Sir Edward , to imagine that I would make a promise I did not intend to keep . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And who told you I did not intend to keep it , eh ? ( Reads , ) " and that Lady Blanche should never be to you aught but a sister . I ask for nothing more than to believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for me , I invite you to sup with me this evening . You will find me alone , and my servants are informed that I am at home only to you . " No signature . Brush . Brush O , there can be no mistake . The poor woman left it here herself . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Behold the inconsistency of woman . When I was free , she played the prude ; now I am married , she runs after me . And to whom did she give this letter ? Brush . Brush To me , sir . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt To you , Brush ? And how did she appear ? Brush . Brush O sir , in the greatest despair . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Brush , you are a flatterer . You say that to please me . Brush . Brush No , on my honor , Sir Edward ; and I am sure if you do not go , something terrible will happen . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Indeed ! And do you think she loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir ; her head is turned . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt That will do . You may go , Brush . ( Exit Brush , C. D. L. H. Sir Edward goes and knocks at door , R. H. 2 E. ) Lucy . Lucy ( Without , D. R. H. 2 E. ) Who is there ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt It is only I , Lucy . Lucy . Lucy ( Without . ) What do you want ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I desire a moment 's conversation with my wife . Ask her if she will do me the honor to receive me in her apartment , or prefers to join me here . ( A moment 's silence . ) They are consulting . Enter Lucy , D. R. H. 2 E. Lucy . Lucy My lady , sir , prefers to join you here . ( Exit , C. D. L. H. ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah ! I was not deceived . She fears me . That at least is flattering . Enter Lady Blanche , D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your orders , Sir Edward , I am here . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Say rather , madam , in answer to my prayers ; for it is I who must thank you for this condescension . Lady B. Lady Blanche O sir , I know well , the husband 's right is to command . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ' T is a maxim long since exploded . Years ago , husbands were fierce , wild creatures ; but they have long since been civilized , and to-day , madam , it is the wife who commands , the husband who obeys . Lady B. Lady Blanche O sir , I have no wish to rule , and were I only sure  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt That I would not command ; is it not ? Lady B. Lady Blanche At least , that you would not be too severe . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Reassure yourself , madam . Perhaps I may beg , perhaps I may beseech , perhaps I may implore you ; but never , never will I command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so terrible as I was told . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And ours , madam , least of all . But I pray you be seated , or I shall think you are in haste to leave me . Lady B. Lady Blanche O sir , now that I am no longer afraid , I will stay as long as you like . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Handing a chair . Aside . ) Upon my word I think I shall sup with the countess . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) Poor colonel ! I think he will be satisfied . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I was saying , madam , that our marriage is in some respects original . Our parents had disposed of us in their wills , and our uncle , the earl , was charged by them to see that their last wishes were fulfilled . How resist an uncle who gives you one hundred thousand pounds as a dowry , and promises at his death four times as much more ? You were at a boarding school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities of meeting . Besides , of what use would it have been , when we knew we were destined to be man and wife ? If we were fated to mutually please , well and good . If we were fated to love , there was plenty of time , for in that case , the less there is done the more there remains to do . Lady B. Lady Blanche O Sir Edward , I fear you will never love me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And why not ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Because I am full of faults , I forewarn you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And do you think I pretend to perfection ? Lady B. Lady Blanche But your faults , I am sure , are not so great as mine . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Who knows ? But come , tell me what indeed yours are . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , in the first place , I am excessively curious . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And I extravagantly so . Lady B. Lady Blanche Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinate . Lady B. Lady Blanche At the slightest contradiction , I pout . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And at the least opposition I storm . Lady B. Lady Blanche Then I tear my laces . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And I my ruffles . Lady B. Lady Blanche I break my glasses . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And I the furniture . Lady B. Lady Blanche I scold Lucy . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I beat Brush . Lady B. Lady Blanche But , Sir Edward , we seem to have the same faults . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Decidedly , madam ; we must have sympathetic souls . Lady B. Lady Blanche But is that all , Sir Edward ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt All ? O , no.  --  ( Aside . ) Now what the deuse shall I tell her ? Ah , I have it ! Women all love play ; I 'll be a gamester.  --  ( Aloud . ) Ah , I had forgotten ! I am a gamester . Lady B. Lady Blanche A gamester ! ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play high ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Extravagantly , enormously so ! And what is worse , I always lose . But do you play , madam ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I ? O , no , no . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O excuse me , but have n't you any other little fault to tell me in place of that ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes , I have one , but that I did not wish to tell you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What , secrets between us already ? O , fie ! there should be no secrets between man and wife . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , since you insist upon it  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah , madam , I have told you I should never insist . Lady B. Lady Blanche You beg me then  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes , madam , I implore you . Lady B. Lady Blanche I shall never dare . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt It is then so very terrible ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have said that you were curious . Tell me then this dreadful fault , and I will tell you something in my turn . Lady B. Lady Blanche You will ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Word of honor . Lady B. Lady Blanche Imagine then  --  ( She stops . ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I am listening . Lady B. Lady Blanche And I am trembling . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Taking her hand . ) Come , compose yourself . Lady B. Lady Blanche You must know then that at school I had a friend . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Well , there is nothing very terrible in that . Lady B. Lady Blanche No ; but this friend had a brother . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah ! she had a brother ! Lady B. Lady Blanche Alas , yes ! and whenever this brother came to see her , my friend , to give me some amusement ,  --  you know we had so little amusement there at school ,  --  took me with her into the parlor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great harm in that . Lady B. Lady Blanche No , but there 's where the harm begins . Little by little I began to like the colonel , and to anticipate with pleasure the days on which he came , which I had never done before . And as the colonel began to feel the same , he came twice a week instead of once , then three times , then four times , and at last he came every day . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And your friend always remained with you , I suppose . Lady B. Lady Blanche O , she never left us , and that caused all the trouble , for the colonel did not dare to tell me that he loved me , but he told his sister , and she told me . And I told her I liked to see the colonel , and she told her brother ; so that one morning we found we were in love , and had told each other so , without knowing how it was done . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt How happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , he was very happy , and so was I. But just then my uncle came to tell me I must get ready to marry you . If you did not dare resist , how could I ! Judge our despair ; we vowed eternal love and constancy , and I obey  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt So I perceive . Lady B. Lady Blanche What would you ? I knew not then how kind you were . I think I had a wrong idea of marriage . I was afraid . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And now you are reassured . Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes , a little . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And how do you intend to treat the colonel now ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I know my duty , sir : I know what I owe to a man who conducts himself with so much delicacy as you have done . I will never see him more . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt No ! no ! Blanche , no exaggeration . Do not promise more than you can perform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respect you ought to have for the name you have consented to bear . Neither seek nor avoid the colonel , and if you meet  --  well , if you meet him , try to treat him like the rest of the world , and I will be satisfied . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Taking his hand . ) O sir , I should be indeed guilty to betray such confidence ! ( He rises . ) But are you going ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Do you wish me to remain ? Lady B. Lady Blanche No , no ; but I thought you , too , had something to tell me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah ! true , I had promised ; but after a romance like yours , my story would be too monotonous . Lady B. Lady Blanche No matter , tell it . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Mine , madam , is no love story ; it is simply an engagement I have with a certain countess . Lady B. Lady Blanche Is she young ? Sir E. Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Charming . Lady B. Lady Blanche Married ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt A widow . Lady B. Lady Blanche And her name ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah , madam , I did not ask you the colonel 's name . Lady B. Lady Blanche You are right , sir . I will not detain you , sir . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I will trouble you no longer , madam . ( Hands her to door , H. 2 E. ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) Decidedly I think I shall keep my promise to the colonel . ( Exit Lady Blanche , R. H. 2 E. ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Well , upon my word , I think I shall remain faithful to the countess . This is indeed a curious wedding day ! Enter Brush , C. D. L. H. Brush . Brush Colonel Villiers , my lord , desires to see you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Colonel Villiers ! Colonel ! ah ! can he be the one ? Admit him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. L. H. Ah , my dear Algernon , how do you do ? I really thought you were dead . Where have you been these six months ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers My dear Sir Edward , what do you expect ? When we belong to the army we are no longer our own masters . For the last year I have been on duty , marching hither and thither ; but at last I have obtained leave of absence , and here I am in London . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And when did you arive ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Three days ago . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Three days in town , and I see you now for the first time ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers But I heard you were busy , and I did not wish to disturb you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah , yes ! that 's true . By the by , I was married this morning . Did you know it . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And when Sir Edward Mordaunt marries , think you all London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The affair had been arranged for a long time . I put it off as long as I could , but at last I had to submit . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And how do you like it ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , well enough ! It is one of those convenient marriages , you understand , that our grandfathers arrange for us . My cousin , pretty girl enough , with fifty thousand a year , so my lawyer tells me ; magnificent diamonds , so my valet tells me ; and an estate of six hundred thousand more , settled upon our first child , so my uncle tells me . Ah ! I forgot the principal attraction , a noble name , which will do honor to our genealogical tree  --  Blanche Mowbray . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Blanche Mowbray ! but stop a minute ; I have heard that name somewhere . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Doubtless ! You must have known her father , the old general ; besides , there is an aunt some hundred and twenty years old . Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was she not at school in Lincolnshire ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt That 's it . But how did you know that ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Because I have a sister at school there too . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah ! you have a sister at school there too ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes . Does that surprise you ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And why should that surprise me ? What could be more natural than to have a sister at school ! You are sure it was in Lincolnshire ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes ; and as I was stationed only a few miles distant  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt You went to see your sister very often ; did you not ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , very often ; two or three times a week , and sometimes more . Page 13 Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What an excellent brother ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers O , that cursed barrack life was so tiresome we needed some amusement ; and I should not be surprised if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor I. At any rate , my dear colonel , you will permit me to present her to you . If you do not know her , you will make her acquaintance ; and if you do , you can renew it ; that is all . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers The very favor I was going to ask of you ! Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Excuse me a moment ; I will announce you . ( Goes to the door . ) Ah ! the door is not locked now ! that is one step gained . Wait for me here , colonel ; I 'll not detain you long . ( Exit Sir Edward , D. R. H. 2 E. ) Col. Col.

Lucy I thought you were never coming here again . " Lucy , I will kill Sir Edward ! I will kill him ! " ( Laughing . ) This morning a tiger , now a lamb . But it is very imprudent in you to come here . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers O , there is no danger ; I have taken every precaution . Sir Edward knows that I had a sister at the same school , and consequently will not be astonished if Blanche does recognize me . Lucy . Lucy And who told Sir Edward ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Who told him ? Why , I did , to be sure ! Lucy . Lucy Upon my word , very well managed ; and I see , colonel , that a woman may without danger trust herself to you .

Think how many things we have to say , how many memories to exchange , how many thoughts hidden in our inmost hearts long for utterance . O , no , I can not leave you ! Lady B. Lady Blanche You are cruel , Algernon . Because I have confessed my love for you , you have become exacting and tyrannical . But remember , though I may not belong to another , yet do I no longer belong to myself . Col. Col.

Sir Edward Mordaunt What , colonel , left tte -- tte with a pretty woman and you say nothing to her ?  --  Madam , I pray you to excuse him ; you must not judge him from this first interview ; he is a fellow of wit ; only to-day he is somewhat sad . Lady B. Lady Blanche And are you indeed sad , sir ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Upon my word , Sir Edward must have imagined it , for I was never happier or more cheerful than at this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you shall see , madam , if he tells you true . ( He sits . ) You must know , in the first place , that the colonel is desperately in love . Lady B. Lady Blanche Ah ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Aside . ) What the devil does he mean ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And that he has a sister . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Slightly uneasy . ) Ah ! he has a sister ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes , who is at school in Lincolnshire ; and as the colonel is an excellent brother , he went very frequently , nearly every day , to see his sister . But it happened that this sister had a friend who was called  --  who was called  --  Ah , colonel , what was the young lady 's name ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Upon my word , Sir Edward , I can not understand what it is you mean . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Well , no matter about the name .

Sir Edward Mordaunt I warn you , colonel , that Blanche knows me too well to believe any such thing . Am I not right , madam ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I know , Sir Edward , you are incapable of deceiving me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt You see , colonel , she does me more justice than you , and yet she has known me scarce a day , while you have been my friend these ten years . But to finish my story . One day the colonel learned that she whom he loved  --  betrothed for I do n't know how long  --  was about to leave school to prepare for her approaching marriage . Is not that it , colonel ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I listen , sir , for I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Edward Mordaunt ( To Blanche , who rises very anxiously . ) But sit down , madam ; you can listen better . ( She sits . ) Well , as you may imagine , great was their despair ; tears were shed , promises made , oaths exchanged , in a word , all that is customary on such occasions . Nevertheless they must part ! It was a terrible moment , as you , madam , may imagine . The marriage took place , and the poor colonel thought he would die . But look , madam , look at the colonel ; think you now that he is gay and happy ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You are right  --  I am not well  --  I need air ! ( Going . ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Stopping him . ) Come , courage , colonel , courage !

You understand , madam , the situation of the poor colonel when he saw he was discovered . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Trembling ) And the husband  --  what did he do ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What did he do ? The husband was a man of sense . He acted as in such cases a man should act . He did not wish to appear ridiculous by seeming jealous ; besides , he knew it would do no good , and thought that gentleness was of more avail in such cases than a ridiculous scene . So he simply showed those who wished to deceive him that he was not their dupe ; then , as he had business in the city , he took his hat , ( takes his hat , ) and left them tranquilly together , relying upon the loyalty of the one and upon the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they deceive him  --  well ! if they deceive him , so much the worse for them . That , madam , is what the husband did . ( Exit Sir Edward , saluting them , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Sinking into a chair as Sir Edward goes out . ) But this man then has some familiar devil who tells him what is passing in the hearts of others . Lady B. Lady Blanche To you , colonel , I know not what to say ; but as for myself , I have deserved it all . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And how , Blanche , can you have deserved such an affront ? Lady B. Lady Blanche How ? By forgetting his kindness . He saw me this morning all pale and suffering , tears in my eyes , trembling as if about to die  --  he pitied me , and yet he was the master : if he had wished , I belonged to him ; but he respected me as his sister . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Lady Blanche Certainly . What other reason could there be ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Blanche , undeceive yourself ; for you must know , and strange as it may seem , ' t is no less true  --  it was from indifference . Lady B. Lady Blanche Indifference ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , and I might even add love for another . Lady B. Lady Blanche Love for another ? Ah , yes , I remember ; this very morning he himself told me of it ; but , it is very singular , I had almost forgotten it . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And now where think you he has gone ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I 'm sure I do n't know . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Well , he is with her ! Lady B. Lady Blanche With her ! How do you know ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers The letter he but now received was brought by her servant ; I recognized the livery through the open door  --  cherry and silver . Lady B. Lady Blanche Colonel , do you know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Desborough ? Lady B. Lady Blanche She is called Countess of Desborough ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You ask me if I know her . She is the most fashionable woman in London . Lady B. Lady Blanche Indeed ! Now answer me , Algernon , as though I were not a woman . Is she pretty ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , a pretty face enough , of which the expression is the greatest charm . Lady B. Lady Blanche Blonde or brunette ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Blonde . Lady B. Lady Blanche Black eyes or blue ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Blue . Lady B. Lady Blanche How pretty it must be to have blue eyes ! Tell me , Algernon , do you like blondes ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Ah , Blanche ! can you ask me such a question ? Lady B. Lady Blanche You are right ; excuse me . She has wit , this countess ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , but what is more important , she is such a mistress of all the arts of coquetry , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined woman-hater of them all is soon sighing at her feet . Lady B. Lady Blanche Indeed ! Coquetry then is a great attraction for you men . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Alas , I must confess it ! For the most of us it is every thing . Lady B. Lady Blanche Am I a coquette , Algernon ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You a coquette , Blanche ! would I have loved you as I do had you been a coquette ? No , it is your artlessness , your candor , your angelic purity , that enchain my heart . You a coquette , Blanche ! Thank Heaven , no ! Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Half unconsciously . ) I wish I were a coquette ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And why , Blanche , why ? No ; leave that to those who need it to be loved . But for you , whose simplicity is even now so dangerous , to have recourse to art , when every enchantment of nature is at your command , would be to drive to madness all mankind through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanche What ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers But come ; your mind is wandering in the seventh heaven . Permit me to recall it back to earth , by which I may be the gainer . Lady B. Lady Blanche Algernon , listen to me . After what has just passed , after the confidence and generous conduct of Sir Edward , you must understand that I can no longer permit you to talk to me of love . I shall know you love me  --  you know that I love you ; the promise I have made you I hope to keep , the easier perhaps , as Sir Edward is engaged elsewhere . But that is all ; and that is more than yesterday you dared to hope ; and this union of two souls , of which you have so much boasted , is it not sufficiently ethereal to do away with speech ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers But of what , then , can I speak to you , if not of love ? Lady B. Lady Blanche And of what do you speak with other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . I have a thousand things to say to them , for I do not love them ; but to you I have but one . I love you ! Lady B. Lady Blanche Again , Algernon ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Well , Blanche , I will do all that I can ; but the eyes will speak . Lady B. Lady Blanche O ! I do not wish to ask too much in one day . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You are adorable ! Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Rising . ) And now , Algernon , that we are of one mind again , do n't you think that a first visit would become inconvenient if further prolonged ?  --  not for me , but for my servants  --  for Sir Edward , should he return . I do not dismiss you . You know the world better than I do , and I appeal to you . You would not wish to compromise me . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Heaven forbid ! But when shall I see you again ? Lady B. Lady Blanche To-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors are always open to you . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Ah , Blanche ! perhaps it would be better for me were they closed . Lady B. Lady Blanche What do you say ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I say that it was not thus we were wont to say farewell in the little parlor of the boarding school . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Holding out her hand . ) Well , there ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Kissing her hand , sadly . ) Farewell , Blanche . Lady B. Lady Blanche Till to-morrow .

Coquetry  --  is the art of making men fall in love whether they will or no . Lady B. Lady Blanche Lucy , that is just what I want to know . And what is necessary to become a coquette ? Lucy . Lucy O , my lady , there are some people who have nothing to do , for they are naturally coquettes . Lady B. Lady Blanche How fortunate they are ! But for those who are not , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy Well , they must study the art ! Coquetry is divided into several branches . First , there is caprice ; you must never like the same thing two days at a time . Lady B. Lady Blanche But , Lucy , we can not always be the mistress of our hearts . Lucy . Lucy And what has the heart to do with it ? I do n't speak of men , I mean things  --  dresses , jewels , laces , carriages  --  ah ! speaking of carriages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ! such a carriage ! Lady B. Lady Blanche But it seems to me the streets are full of handsome carriages . I have seen any quantity . Lucy . Lucy O ! but not like that ! Imagine the most beautiful equipage  --  four gray horses , and a cherry and silver livery . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , what is the use of all that ? Lucy . Lucy Of what use is it , madam ? Why , in the first place , the turnout attracts all eyes ; then the eyes wander from the carriage to the lady who is in it ; if she is only well looking , she seems pretty ? and if she is pretty , she appears charming . Then in the evening it is spoken of in society . " Have you seen Lady Such-a-one to-day ? What a charming equipage ! " Those who have seen it join in the chorus ; those who have not are eager to do so . And before the elegant carriage and the pretty woman have been seen by all the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week nothing else is talked of . At the end of that time , you must invent something else , so as to keep your rivals perpetually in fear , and your lovers out of breath . Lady B. Lady Blanche Lucy , I will have four gray horses , and a cherry and silver livery . Lucy . Lucy O , do , madam ! and you will see how much you will gain by it . Lady B. Lady Blanche But , Lucy , has a coquette nothing else to do but to change her horses every week ? Lucy . Lucy O , yes ! there are the diamonds ! Lady B. Lady Blanche Diamonds ! O , mine are as beautiful as any in the city . Lucy . Lucy But , my lady , it is not their beauty , nor their number , which attracts attention ; it is the style of setting .

You , madam , who are always so pleasing , at a masquerade would be perfectly fascinating . Lady B. Lady Blanche Lucy , I will go to the masquerade . Is there any thing else ? Lucy . Lucy Be sure and always preserve a great control over yourself . When you are with the man you love , and whom you wish to love you , feign the most perfect indifference , and it is not bad to pretend to love another . Lady B.

Sir Edward Mordaunt Why , you see , uncle , she has chosen exactly the colors of the countess , ( gradually increasing astonishment of Lord Dorrington , ) who only bought that equipage yesterday , and appears in it today for the first time ; and if she should see my wife with one like it , she would tear my eyes out .

Lord Dorrington Well , are you going ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Certainly ; Blanche is coming , and the colonel , you know , has something to say to her in private . I beg you to leave them alone for a few moments , that this cursed carriage business may be satisfactorily arranged . Lord D. Lord Dorrington But will you not permit me to first embrace my niece ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , certainly ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington I shall see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will meet during the day , I hope . Good by . ( Exit , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Enter Lady Blanche , D. R. H. 2 E. Lady B. Lady Blanche O my dear uncle , how glad I am to see you ! Do you know we have been very anxious about you ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Well , my child , you see I have come in person to relieve all your anxieties . Lady B. Lady Blanche O , that is so kind in you ! and now you must not leave us again ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Advancing on L. H. ) Good morning , Blanche . Lady B. Lady Blanche Good morning , Algernon . Forgive me for not seeing you before ; but this dear uncle  --  Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Piqued . ) It is I rather who should apologize for my indiscretion in thus remaining a third party in a family conversation . ( Goes up . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( R. H. ) What is the matter with the colonel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington On the contrary , they appeared the best of friends . Lady B. Lady Blanche And Sir Edward left just as I came in . O uncle , I have so many things to tell you . Lord D. Lord Dorrington I begin to believe it , especially if you tell the truth . Well , you shall tell me all by and by . Lady B. Lady Blanche What ! you are not going already , are you ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington I have some orders to give . Lady B. Lady Blanche But you 'll return . Lord D. Lord Dorrington In ten minutes . Will you be alone ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I hope so . I will try to send the colonel away . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Is it , then , very difficult ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Ah , uncle , he is Sir Edward 's friend , and I must be very circumspect with him . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( Aside . ) I should think so , indeed .  --  Good by , Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Algernon Villiers ( Coming down , L. H. ) I do , indeed , regret , Blanche , to have chanced upon such an unfavorable moment . But I have to speak with you on serious matters . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( R. H. ) Which concern you , colonel ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers No ; it is for another that I speak . Lady B. Lady Blanche And , pray , who may he be ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Your husband . Lady B. Lady Blanche My husband ! he has chosen a strange ambassador , it seems . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Alas ! he thinks my influence with you is greater than it is . Lady B. Lady Blanche And why does not Sir Edward attend to his business in person ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers The truth is , he is very much embarrassed at your first request . Lady B. Lady Blanche O ! it is about my new equipage , then ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Precisely . Lady B. Lady Blanche Which he refuses . To say the least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think Sir Edward treats me abominably ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Abominably , madam ? Frightfully ! terribly ! and yet you must not blame him before you know the cause . Lady B. Lady Blanche So you excuse him ? ' T is well , sir , well . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I do not excuse him , Blanche ; but there is a reason  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , sir , what is this reason , or rather this pretext ? Speak , sir , speak . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Aside . ) Devil take me if I know what to tell her . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , sir , I am listening . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Hesitatingly . ) Yes , madam , I see you are . This reason he did not wish to tell me ; but I think that  --  that  --  he is  --  he is  --  a little straitened just now for money . I think he has lost , of late , at play . Lady B. Lady Blanche Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Eagerly . ) He told you so ? O , yes , that must be it ; he has lost at play . Lady B. Lady Blanche And do you think he has lost much ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Some fifty thousand pounds perhaps ; and , as just now he has bought this house and renewed the furniture  --  I think , in a word , he is much pressed . But you understand , Blanche , this is in confidence , and must not come to Sir Edward 's ears .  --  ( Aside . ) If it does , I wo n't answer for mine . Lady B. Lady Blanche O , be easy on that score  --  it is sacred . What a good friend you are , Algernon , thus to show me when I am wrong , and I like you all the better for it , if indeed that is possible . What did I want of new horses and a new carriage ? I asked for it as I would ask for any thing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always have enough . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers And so you give up the equipage ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Can I refuse you any thing ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers O ! now you are charming ! Lady B. Lady Blanche You know well the empire of my soul is yours . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Ah ! now you are my own Blanche again . How happy you have made me , for this empire of which you speak  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche Well ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I began to fear I had lost it . Lady B. Lady Blanche What nonsense ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You were so reserved with me yesterday , and again this morning how coldly you received me ! Lady B. Lady Blanche I received you coldly ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes ; you scarcely noticed me ; I thought you did not see me . Lady B. Lady Blanche Ah ! but , colonel , it was very natural . My uncle had just arrived  --  Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Pardon me . I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know I have a great mind to be jealous ? Lady B. Lady Blanche And of whom ? My uncle ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers No , but of his nephew . Lady B. Lady Blanche Come , colonel , do n't jest ; perhaps you would not be so far wrong . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I begin to believe it . Lady B. Lady Blanche Sir Edward is very agreeable . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers How long since you perceived it ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Of a charming disposition . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers So thoughtful of your pleasures , anticipating your every wish , for example , this equipage you asked of him . Lady B. Lady Blanche And which you refuse me in his name ; at least , he did not wish to give me the pain of a refusal , while you , colonel , did not hesitate . Enter Lord Dorrington , C. D. L. H. But excuse me  --  here is my uncle . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( C. ) Who comes just in time to interrupt a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when next I pay my duty to you , to find you in a better humor . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( Aside to Lady Blanche on R. H. ) Leave me alone with the colonel . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Farewell , Blanche . I obey you , and will withdraw . ( Going . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche No , you can remain , and I will yield the floor to you . Uncle , you know I am in my room . I have scarcely seen you , and shall expect you soon . ( Exit , D. R. H. 2 E. ) Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( Aside . ) That was a lover 's quarrel , or I am much mistaken . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Going to C. D. L. H. ) Excuse me , my lord . Lord D. Lord Dorrington A moment , if you please . If you are in haste I will come quickly to the point . Colonel , I see you to-day for the first time ; but I knew your father . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told me . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Well , I repeat it ; your father , sir , was a brave and loyal gentleman , a man who considered friendship as sacred , and who would have thought it a crime to have betrayed it . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( L. H. ) Excuse me , my lord ; but your words seem to conceal some allegory , which , I regret to say , I do not understand . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( R. H. ) Then I will be more explicit . I say that if your father 's friend had been married to a young and beautiful woman , he would have respected that woman as his sister ; and if he had unfortunately loved her , as might easily have happened , he would have taken it upon himself , seeing his friend 's confidence , to have abstained from his house , and that of his own accord ; without waiting till he had been requested to do so by some one of those old relatives , whose business is to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what your father would have done , and that , sir , is what a son worthy of your father would do in a similar situation . You understand me now , do you not ? Reflect upon it , sir , reflect upon it . ( Exit into Lady Blanche 's room , D. R. H. 2 E. ) Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Looking after him in astonishment . ) Hang me if I understand a word of all this . What business is it of yours , you old meddler ? What is the matter with every body ? First it was Blanche , and now it 's the uncle . Whose turn will it be next I wonder ? ( As he is going towards C. D. , enter Sir Edward , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( L. H. ) A moment , colonel . My commission ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( R. H. ) Your commission is done , and well done . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Mordaunt And renounces it as a woman always does what she desires , with loud complaints against the tyrant who demands such a sacrifice ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers On the contrary she was very reasonable , and happy to do any thing which pleased us . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( A little annoyed . ) Well , then , you are satisfied ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes , with her ; but I ca n't say as much for all your household . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What is the matter ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You have an uncle . Tell me , are you going to keep him here long ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What ! Lord Dorrington ? He is a noble old fellow , a little rigid in his principles , and strongly attached to the customs of the good old time ; but he sincerely loves me , and watches over my interests like a father . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Faith ! I should think so , indeed . But I am not so fortunate as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in his good graces . He almost turned me out of the house just now . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Turned you out of the house ! and why ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Because he pretends that I am in love with your wife , and that I betray friendship , and that it is immoral , and a hundred other nonsensical speeches of the same kind . Why the devil did n't he stay at home ? If he belongs to another age and another time , very well ; let him remain with his ancestors , and not come here to trouble their descendants , with his long wig , and old-fashioned coat , and highheeled shoes . Ah ! my dear fellow , he is not an uncle ; he is a family portrait ; put him in the lumber room , and get rid of him . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Excuse me , colonel , but he is an uncle , and a very good one ; the proof of it is , that we inherit forty thousand a year from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for if you quarrel , you understand , in spite of my friendship and of the services you have rendered me , and which you hope to render me still , I should be obliged to side with him . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What ! if your uncle should insist upon your turning me out , you would do it  --  me , your best friend ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I should be very sorry ; but what could I do ? You would know that it was not my fault , and that I loved you still . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers That makes three . He , the only one I thought I could depend upon , abandons me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Eagerly . ) Eh ! What were you saying ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Nothing . I was only saying I was in bad luck to-day . Good by . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Good by ! When shall we see you again ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I do n't know ; your uncle frightens me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Alone . ) Well , that is cool ! To think that I would sacrifice my uncle to him ! an uncle , too , who takes such interest in my affairs ,  --  that is slightly impudent , even for Villiers ! ( He sits , L. H. ) I suppose the countess expects me to take her to the masquerade to-night . Well , I must go . Upon my word , I 'm almost sorry I did not let Blanche have her horses and her livery . But then the countess would have raved and stormed ! O countess ! countess ! If you but knew the trouble that you give me ! ( Continues sitting , lost in thought . ) Enter Blanche D. R. H. 2 E. Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) Now for my first essay in coquetry ! I hope I 've learned my lesson well , for I have staked my heart upon success . Ah ! there he is , lost in thought ! He must be thinking of that countess ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his vulnerable point ,  --  for all men are somewhere vulnerable ,  --  then straight attack his heart and win the citadel , which once mine , I 'll see he 'll not again be soon possessed of . ( To Sir Edward , approaching him . ) My lord , are you alone ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Starting up . ) Ah , is that you , Blanche ? Unfortunately , yes , I am alone . Lady B. Lady Blanche And why unfortunately ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Because I dare not hope that you were seeking me . Lady B. Lady Blanche There you are wrong ; on the contrary , I was seeking for you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Indeed ! then pray be seated . ( He places chairs ; they sit ; Sir Edward listens , distractedly . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) Now , how shall I begin ! Ah ! I 'll talk to him of the countess , and with herself I 'll win him from her .  --  ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I was very curious , and I have heard so much about this countess , that I have come to ask you to describe her . Is she indeed very beautiful ? Has she the fairest skin , the finest hair , hands , shoulders , arms , of all the court ? for so I 've heard .  --  ( Aside . ) I 'll wager now , that mine surpass hers far , would he but look at them !  --  ( To Sir Edward . ) And has she , too , such throngs of suitors ? I , too , know many men who watch my eyes to read my very thoughts . But what are throngs to us , if we ca n't have the only man we want ? ( Archly . ) And yet , the day may come ,  --  nay , I believe it nearer than I thought it yesterday , when at the altar I became your bride ,  --  when he I wish will learn to read my eyes ,  --  ( Aside . ) Why , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've said .  --  ( To Sir Edward . ) You do not hear me , sir ; where are your thoughts ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Madam , at your service . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) Pretty service , that ! such service will not do for me.  --  ( To Sir Edward . ) But tell me , Edward  --  they say the countess looks much like me . Can it be true ?  --  ( Aside . ) My face ' gainst hers , if he would only look !  --  Well , sir , well ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Distractedly . ) I 'm thinking . Lady B. Lady Blanche Thinking , when he should be looking ! The man 's a stone ! Where are his eyes ? Poring upon his feet , and mine beside them ! I 'll try again !  --  ( To Sir Edward . ) They say her foot is beautiful , and when she dances , she does not fear to show it . ( Showing her foot . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller . How is it , sir ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt It may be a little smaller . An inch or two . Lady B. Lady Blanche An inch or two a little in a foot ! Pshaw , he do n't know what he 's saying ! I am very much afraid he loves the countess ! If he does , I 'll tear her eyes out ; yes , I will indeed ! But one more question , and I 'll know the truth !  --  ( To Sir Edward . ) And do you really love this countess ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I ?  --  O , I love all womankind ! Lady B. Lady Blanche O , I mean not that ; but one particular love  --  a blissful cherishing , which makes of our own happiness a casket wherein to safely keep another treasured heart ? Love you in this way , sir , or do you lightly love ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Both rising . ) Love lightly , Blanche ! He who loves lightly does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierce the surface only of the heart . It is a tree of most mysterious growth , deep rooted in the centre of the heart , where once embedded , nought can pluck it out  --  once dead , the heart that was its soil , and gave it strength , can never love again . ( He goes up stage . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) O that such love were mine ! Hang the fellow , how well he talks ! he 'll steal away my heart , before my face and eyes , nor leave his in exchange . Coquetry , farewell ! With men who have no hearts , mere butterflies of fashion , you may do , but not with such as he ! I 'll back to simple nature ; ' t is the best ! Henceforth no art for me !  --  ( To Sir Edward . ) Edward , I came here to ask you to forgive me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt To forgive you ! and for what ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Last night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere caprice ! Forgive me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Nay , Blanche , but ' t is I should ask forgiveness for refusing you . But the colonel must have told you , that any thing else I 'll give with pleasure . You 've but to ask . Lady B. Lady Blanche No , no ; nothing now ! Only one question ! Do you think me your friend ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt You ? Certainly ! Lady B. Lady Blanche O , then I must reproach you . If you think me your friend , why do you not confide to me your troubles , your embarrassments ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt My troubles ! my embarrassments ! What do you mean ? Lady B. Lady Blanche You have lost heavily at play ! Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I !  --  lost at play ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Now do n't deny it . The colonel told me all about it . I am not our uncle , and you , I hope , are not afraid of me . Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you not embarrassed ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Embarrassed ? No ! Ah , now I understand ; Villiers has told you this to obtain your consent  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Interrupting . ) O , you must not be angry with the colonel ! ( Taking his arm , and looking up into his face . ) Listen ! Here in my writing desk there are a thousand pounds  --  the parting gift of my old aunt . It is not much , I know ; but such as it is I freely give it to you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Blanche , if I let you speak , ' t is only that you speak so charmingly . But Colonel Villiers , to get himself out of a scrape , has told you a lie ! There is not one word of truth in it ; I have not lost at play ; I am not at all embarrassed ; and the proof is , that if now you have the least desire for this equipage , say the word , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Dorrington , 2d dress , C. D. L. H. , stands watching . Lady B. Lady Blanche No , no ! I do not wish for them now . I was too happy in making you this little sacrifice ! But do n't you ever play ? You know you told me so . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , yes , sometimes ; but , then , only for the suspense that fickle goddess , Fortune , alone creates  --  I never gamble . And should I chance , in some gay hour of careless revelry , to win a fortune , before I slept I would give it back , that the next morning I might wake a man ! ( Goes up to Lord Dorrington ; they converse apart . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) He is a man ; and I have found a master where I sought a slave . Heigh-ho ! Methinks I have a heart I could give him , had he a heart to give me in exchange . But has he one to give ? Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can not be ! Love her ? a pert coquette ! a forward minx ! a jilt ! a shrew ! and yet , whate'er she is , if he but loves her , would that I were she ! ( Exit Lady Blanche , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( R. H. ) But tell me , nephew , that was a very interesting conversation , was it not ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( L. H. ) O , no , not at all . Blanche and I were talking about business , money matters  --  that was all . Lord D. Lord Dorrington O , that was all , was it ?  --  ( Aside . ) The most tender business conversation I ever saw . Ah , I can not understand the fashions of to-day . I would have sworn they were a pair of lovers .  --  Now tell me candidly , how do you like Blanche ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I have already told you I think her charming . Lord D. Lord Dorrington But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you treat her as you do ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Coolly . ) Does she complain of my conduct ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington No , she does not complain , because she is an angel ; but every one can see how much she is annoyed . I have just been talking with her , and she has told me the strangest things . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Very coolly . ) Ah , indeed ! and pray what has she told you ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Why , of your connection with the countess , and indifference to her , poor child ! Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And did she tell you nothing more ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington More ! Why , is not that enough ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I mean , nothing about herself ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington No , not a word . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Nor of the colonel ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Colonel Villiers ? No ! Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Your niece then is very discreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Gradually warming up . ) I mean that she has only given you half her confidence . I mean that before knowing me , my wife knew Villiers ; that the colonel loves her , and that she loves him . That is what I mean . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And you have not shut your door in the face of this Villiers ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt No ; on the contrary , I have opened it to him . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And you have done that , knowing that your wife loved him ? And what , think you , will be the result ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , the result ! that can take care of itself . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And do you think I will permit it to take care of itself ? Do you think I will submit tamely to such work ? Do you think I will leave an estate of thirty thousand a year to a nephew who is not half a nephew ? Do you think I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down , L. H. , in a passion . ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I should like to know how you would help it . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Do n't be alarmed about that ; I will find a way . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But , uncle , I hope you wo n't do any thing to make me appear ridiculous . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Ridiculous ! ( Stops walking . ) Ah , that is the great bugbear ! that is the fear to which you would sacrifice a past reputation and future happiness . In my time , husbands were ridiculous when they were deceived ; but you , it seems , have changed all that . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But , uncle , what would you have ? We must keep in the fashion . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Fashion ! Fashion , indeed ! And what is this much-vaunted fashion ? A heartless tyrant , that compels you to conceal your true sentiments , and to affect those which are false  --  that forces you to despise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they despised  --  which exacts that caprice shall destroy the bonds of religion , and libertines those of society  --  which makes of marriage , not the union of two hearts , but the joining of two fortunes  --  in a word , a monster , that gives you a wife who belongs to your friend , and children who do n't belong to any body . Ah , nephew , nephew , ( going , angrily , ) do n't prate to me of fashion ! Throw fashion to the dogs , talk common sense , and be a man . Trust me , you 'll be a gainer by it . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But , uncle , where are you going ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington That is my business . ' T was my foolishness which caused this evil , and I must repair it . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But , uncle  --  Lord D. Lord Dorrington Have you not told me that your wife loved the colonel ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Faith ! you can judge of that yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored the countess ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt The fact is , I have some liking for her . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And have you not acknowledged that you and Blanche are man and wife only in name ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt For the truth of that , uncle , I pledge my honor . Lord D. Lord Dorrington That is all I care to know . I will take care of the rest . ( Going up centre . ) Good by , nephew , good by . ( Exit Lord Dorrington , excitedly , C. D. , L. H. ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Watching him as he goes out . ) Good by , uncle , good by . ( After a pause . ) What the deuse is he going to do now , I wonder ? No matter ; I suppose we will know in time .

Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great passion , and I do not exactly know where he has gone . Yet I think I could venture a shrewd guess , and if you are very anxious to see him , you will probably find him with his lawyer . Lady B. Lady Blanche And has he any lawsuit ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Not for himself , I imagine . Lady B. Lady Blanche And for whom then ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I am afraid it must be on our account , Blanche . Lady B. Lady Blanche On our account ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes , I fear so ; you know he takes every thing so seriously . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Well , Blanche , he is shocked at having caused a marriage in which there is so little love as ours . Lady B. Lady Blanche But you must have told him then  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah , Blanche , since you spoke to him about my countess , I was forced to say a few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has that to do with his lawyer ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Why , I presume he has gone there to institute proceedings for our divorce . Lady B. Lady Blanche Good Heavens ! A divorce ! But , Sir Edward , do n't you think a divorce will create great scandal ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Undoubtedly . That was my first thought . A divorce is an extreme measure , and as our present position seems to me very tolerable  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Eagerly . ) O , I , Sir Edward , have not the slightest wish to change it . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Well , then , since it is so , we may be perfectly easy on that score , for without our consent a divorce is impossible . Lady B. Lady Blanche O , our consent is necessary ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes , it is of the first necessity  --  and  --  and unless you , Blanche , are disposed to give yours first  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche O , I  --  I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Blanche , I shall be only too happy to oblige you by withholding mine . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Aside . ) My heart feels lighter .

( Turning to Blanche . ) Blanche . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Turning towards Sir Edward . ) Edward . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt You were about to speak , madam . Lady B. Lady Blanche You were going to say , sir  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Only that in that case we need have no fear of our uncle ; and that we might live henceforth in peace , happiness , and good humor all our lives . Lady B. Lady Blanche I shall be so happy ; and I especially wish you to begin this very day with your good humor , for I have come to ask of you a little favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant it immediately .

Sir Edward Mordaunt Ah , madam , you make me deeply regret my refusal of your request this morning , which I am only anxious to repair as soon as possible . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , then , I was going to ask  --  but indeed it is only a folly , a caprice . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt No matter ; speak ; I promise to grant it . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , then ; there is , as you know , a masquerade tonight at Covent Garden , and I was going to ask you to accompany me there . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , was ever any thing so unfortunate ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Why ? How ? What do you mean ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt That yesterday , not dreaming that I should have the honor of your company this evening , I made an engagement with some friends which I can not break . Lady B. Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more , I beg . ' T is I who am indiscreet . I should have known that your pleasures could not be sacrificed to any wish of mine . ( Going . ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But , Blanche , do not leave me thus angrily . Lady B. Lady Blanche And why think you that I am angry ? Believe me , you attach to your refusal more importance than it merits , and far more , I assure you , than I give to it . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Excuse me , Blanche , but is not your wish to go to this ball something more than a mere caprice ? Lady B. Lady Blanche And what , sir , can it be ? Born and brought up in the country , never until now visiting the city , I know nothing of the gayeties and fascinations of the metropolis . But a masquerade has always seemed to me the beau ideal of amusement ; I heard there was one to-night ; I wished to go , and asked you to accompany me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you wish to go to this ball only for the ball itself ? Lady B. Lady Blanche And for what other reason , if you please , should I wish to go ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , nothing ; only I chanced to remember that a ball was a most convenient place for a lover 's meeting . Lady B. Lady Blanche But sir , it seems to me that if I wished to see a lover , as you do me the honor to insinuate , that instead of seeking him at a ball , I should profit by the liberty you allow me to receive him here . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes ; but if by chance our uncle , who , as you know , has the bad habit of meddling with things which do n't concern him , had taken it into his head that the visits of this lover were inconvenient , and had requested him to cease them , it might have happened that , not seeing the lover arrive at his accustomed hour , you had invented this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With dignity . ) I must thank you , sir , for the honor you do my imagination , though the compliment is but little flattering to my honor , on which you have already promised to rely , and I indeed regret that I have detained you only to be subjected to your insulting suspicions . I will detain you , sir , no longer ; you must be anxious to see the countess . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Your pardon , Blanche , but  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche No excuses , Sir Edward ; they are not necessary ; I would be alone . ( She sits on R. H. ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Going , L. H. ) I was mistaken ; my wife is far superior to the countess ; spite of myself , I fear that I begin to love her . ( Exit , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Enter Lucy , D. R. H. 2 E. Lucy .

Lucy . Lucy Refused you ! The barbarian ! And on what pretext ? Lady B. Lady Blanche On the pretext that he had a previous engagement with some friends . Lucy . Lucy And do you believe in this engagement , my lady ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I ? I believe every thing they tell me , Lucy . Lucy . Lucy Ah ! my lady , then you must be very happy . Lady B. Lady Blanche Why , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy Because you ought to be very happy to have such unbounded confidence . Lady B. Lady Blanche And do you think Sir Edward has deceived me , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy I think that if Sir Edward had a simple engagement with some friends , he would easily have found a way to get rid of it . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Eagerly . ) You think , then , that he is going to the ball with a woman , Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Lady B. Lady Blanche O Lucy , these men , these men ! Lucy . Lucy Yes , my lady , you are right ; these men , these men ! Monsters ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Hyenas , Lucy . Lucy . Lucy Roaring lions ! Ravenous wolves , my lady ! Lady B. Lady Blanche And when I think that only yesterday  --  Lucy . Lucy What happened yesterday ? Lady B. Lady Blanche In talking with me , he took me by the hands ; he looked into my eyes  --  Lucy . Lucy He took you by the hands ? He looked into your eyes ? O , the monster ! How lucky it was I locked the door last night ! Lady B. Lady Blanche Do you think it was lucky , Lucy ? Lucy . Lucy O , yes , indeed , my lady . Who knows what might have happened ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Lucy , I wonder if Sir Edward is really going to the ball with the countees . Lucy . Lucy You can easily find out , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy . Lucy By going there yourself . Lady B. Lady Blanche I go there ? Lucy . Lucy Yes ; why not ? Have not you and Sir Edward granted to each other full liberty ? Well , since Sir Edward profits by his , I do n't see why you should not do the same . Lady B. Lady Blanche But , Lucy , I think that a woman  --  Lucy . Lucy Well , am not I a woman , too ? And if any one should treat me in that manner  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche What would you do ? Lucy . Lucy I do n't know exactly , but he would not get off so easily , I promise you . Lady B. Lady Blanche But even if I should follow your advice , there is no one to go with me to this unlucky ball . Lucy . Lucy No one to go with you ? And what is the colonel good for then ? It is not worth while to keep him if you do n't use him for any thing . Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is impossible .

Lady Blanche O , some little thing or other . I do n't remember . Lucy . Lucy O , if my lady does not remember what it was about , it could not have been very terrible . Lady B. Lady Blanche So terrible , Lucy , that he left me , saying that he would not return till I recalled him . Lucy . Lucy Did he say that ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Those were his very words . Lucy . Lucy Well , then , you must recall him . Lady B. Lady Blanche But how can I recall him ? Lucy . Lucy How ? Why , the simplest thing in the world ; by a little note ; by three lines ; by a word .

If you will leave me alone with him for five minutes , I shall probably have something important to tell you . Lady B. Lady Blanche Well , and upon your report I will decide . But be prudent . Lucy . Lucy O my lady , trust me for that . ( Exit Lady B. , D. R. H. 2 E. ) Enter Brush , D. L. H. 2 E. Brush . Brush Ah , Mistress Lucy , what was your mistress recommending to you just now ? Lucy . Lucy Prudence with you , Master Brush . Brush . Brush And to what purpose ? ( Sir Edward 's bell is heard , D. L.

No more secrets ; no more profits . O , when I think of it ! ( Bell rings , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Lucy . Lucy It would be horrible ; but , Mr. Brush , I think I hear Sir Edward 's bell . Brush .

Brush But , sir , will you permit me to ask if you have changed your mind for this evening ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes ; my wife , poor thing , has begged me to take her to the ball . At first I refused ; but , faith , on reflection I think it will be somewhat original to be faithless to the countess for her sake . Brush . Brush But I fear , Sir Edward , that your resolution comes too late . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Too late ? How ? What do you mean ? Brush . Brush I fear , sir , that in the interval , my lady has made other arrangements . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Other arrangements ! What arrangements ? Brush .

Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Alone . ) Yes , go  --  go to the colonel , and give him my wife 's letter  --  for this letter can only be for him . O woman , woman , I thought I knew you ; yet again have I been nearly made your dupe ; but when the heart thinks one thing , and the eyes , the voice , the tongue , all speak another , it 's wonderful that we are not deceived more often than we are . And that hand , which but this morning trembled so lovingly in mine , has written to tell him all that her look told to me . But what matters it whether Blanche loves me or the colonel ? What matters it ? Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I jealous ? I , the gay , the dashing Sir Edward Mordaunt , the very soul of levity , the spirit of inconstancy  --  jealous ? And of whom ? My wife . O , if this were known , I should be dishonored , laughed at , as I laugh myself . ( He laughs . ) No , that 's not a laugh ; there 's something too gloomy in that sound to be called a laugh . But come , I ca n't be jealous ; it would be too ridiculous ; and to prove it , I 'll go , and leave the colonel a fair field ; yes , I 'll go . ( Going . ) No , I wo n't ; I wo n't go . I am a little curious to know if Blanche has really sent for him , and if he will have the impudence to come .

Sir Edward Mordaunt And do you mean to walk to-morrow , sir ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I had not thought of it ; but if I could hope to meet a friend , I would not fail to do so , provided that friend would tell me which way he should walk himself . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What think you of Primrose Hill ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers It is a charming place , where gentlemen may meet and transact business without fear of interruption . Sir E.

Lord Dorrington Trouble ! what trouble ? Lady B. Lady Blanche O uncle , if you only knew ! I know you are going to scold me ; but if you knew how I have suffered , you would find me sufficiently punished for my crime . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Crime ! what crime ? Lady B. Lady Blanche O , a terrible one , uncle ! I went last night to the masquerade ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington To the masquerade ! What ! alone ? Lady B. Lady Blanche No , not alone ; the colonel went with me . Lord D. Lord Dorrington With the colonel ? You went to the ball with the colonel ! What the devil were you doing there ? Lady B. Lady Blanche O uncle , I was jealous ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington Jealous ! and of whom ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I was jealous of Sir Edward . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Jealous of Sir Edward ! of your husband ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspected he was going to the ball with the countess . I wished to know if it was true , and to assure myself I was guilty of a great imprudence . I wrote to the colonel ; he came , he took me to the ball , and there I saw Sir Edward , with the countess hanging on his arm . O , I was furious ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington Furious because your husband was there with the countess , while you were there with the colonel ! Lady B. Lady Blanche But , uncle , that was n't any thing . Lord D. Lord Dorrington How ! that was n't any thing ? Lady B. Lady Blanche I mean that was nothing compared to what happened afterwards ; for when we were coming out , an officer , who , doubtless , mistook me for another , addressed some impertinent remark to me , which the colonel , who had been in a savage humor all the evening , overhearing , immediately demanded his name and address ; so I think that this morning they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight ! Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes ; and you know what a scandal there will be if it is known that I went to the ball with the colonel , and that he is going to fight for me . O ! then I shall be lost , and Sir Edward will never forgive me ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington And , by Jupiter , he will do right . Lady B. Lady Blanche But you , uncle , must help me out of this scrape . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Yes , that is the first thing to be done ; but afterwards  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche O , afterwards , I will do any thing you say . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Well ! well ! But who is this officer ? Lady B. Lady Blanche He gave his name as Captain Dashmore . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And did he recognize the colonel ? Lady B. Lady Blanche No , for the colonel wore his mask , and , doubtless , through delicacy for me , gave neither his name nor his address . Lord D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! You must send instantly to the colonel , and insist that he give up this duel . Lady B. Lady Blanche But , uncle , I have no right to insist upon any thing from the colonel . Lord D. Lord Dorrington What ! you have no right to insist upon any thing from the man who has led you from your duty  --  from the man whom you , the wife of another , are weak enough to love . Lady B. Lady Blanche But , uncle , I think , nay , I am sure , that I do n't love the colonel ; and that is not all . I fear I love another  --  I 'm afraid I love Sir Edward . Lord D. Lord Dorrington What ! Sir Edward ! Your husband ? You love your husband ? Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes ; for I do n't think I should be jealous if I did not love him . Lord D. Lord Dorrington You love your husband , and yet yesterday you signed the petition for a divorce ? Lady B. Lady Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this petition , and had agreed that neither of us would sign it ; but when , afterwards , he sent it to me signed  --  O , then I knew I was really abandoned , and then I signed it too ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington Faith , between you , you will drive me mad . But you know your husband does not love you  --  you told me so yourself . Lady B. Lady Blanche Alas ! yes . Lord D. Lord Dorrington You know , too , that he loves another . Lady B. Lady Blanche O uncle , do n't say that ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington But I will say it , and I will repeat it , for you must cure yourself of this love . Lady B. Lady Blanche O ! never , never ! But time flies , and perhaps the colonel  --  Lord D. Lord Dorrington Yes , you must send for him . Lady B. Lady Blanche O , no , uncle ! Send for him yourself ; for I would not do it now , to save my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right . ( Calling . ) Lucy , Lucy , where are you ? Enter Lucy , D. F. R. H. Lucy . Lucy Here I am , sir . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Take my carriage , drive quickly to the colonel 's , and tell him your mistress wants to see him immediately . Lucy . Lucy Yes , my lord . ( Exit , C. D. L. H. ) Lady B. Lady Blanche Thanks , my dear uncle ; and once out of this scrape , it will be a lesson to me all my life . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Hush ! I hear Sir Edward coming . Lady B. Lady Blanche Then I must run ; for I forgot to tell you , last night at the ball he followed me , and I think he recognized me . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( L. H. ) You think so ? Lady B. Lady Blanche ( R. H. ) I am not sure ; but I shall never dare to appear before him till I know the truth : I should die of shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he knows nothing , silence . ( Exit , D. R. H. 2 E. ) Enter Sir Edward , D. L. H. 2 E. Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( L. H. ) Your niece avoids me , it seems . I should think she would find it somewhat embarrassing to meet me after the occurrence of last evening . Lord D. Lord Dorrington You know , then  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes , all . I know that my wife went to the ball with the colonel , that the colonel quarrelled on her account with Captain Dashmore , and that he is to fight him this morning . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And how do you know all that ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt How do I know it ? Because I recognized them , followed them , and heard all . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And what do you intend doing ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt My duty ! nothing more ! Why , look you , uncle , when my wife has a caprice , let the colonel make her listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a ball , and I am engaged with the countess , let the colonel serve as her mentor ; very well ; but when my wife has been insulted , and needs a defender , then it is no longer the colonel 's business , but mine . Lord D. Lord Dorrington But do you think the colonel will permit  --  Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt And do you think I shall wait for his permission ? I know the name and the address of his adversary ; that is all that is necessary . The colonel was masked . Captain Dashmore expects some one , and provided this some one presents himself , I suppose he will have no preference . I only fear lest the colonel is already in the field . Lord D. Lord Dorrington O , there is no danger ; for he is coming here first . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What ! here ? again ! and why does he come here ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Listen . Blanche is in despair . She fears the public scandal , and I advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to renounce this duel . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt That is the least he can do for her . When a wife so far forgets herself as to publicly proclaim her love for a man who is not her husband , as she has done for the colonel , that man owes her , at least , some compensation . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And so you think your wife loves the colonel ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But it seems to me that , unless I were blind  --  Lord D. Lord Dorrington Well , you are blind . Blanche not only does not love the colonel , but she loves another . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Another ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington Yes ; and she was induced to go to the ball last night through jealousy alone . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Blanche jealous ! One moment , uncle . You have said either too much or too little . Blanche loves another ? Blanche jealous of another ? Tell me , then , who is this other ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What ? this other ? Can it be possible ? Is it I ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Yes , you . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Embracing him . ) O , my dear uncle  --  Lord D. Lord Dorrington What 's the matter ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt You are the very king of uncles . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Am I , then , in a madhouse ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Fool that I was not to have seen it all ! ' T is clear as day . But listen , uncle , for we have no time to lose . Captain Dashmore is , you know , an expert swordsman ; and if I should fall in this contest , as fall I may , take care of Blanche , uncle , take care of her ; for then she will have only you to protect her . Lord D. Lord Dorrington But wo n't you see her before you go ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt No . Should I see her now , with those sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  should I gaze now upon that lovely face , so long neglected , now so dear  --  should I listen to that voice so musically sweet , and think that in two hours I may have lost it all forever , I should be unmanned ; and to-day , uncle , I have need of all my firmness . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( At the height of astonishment . ) But , zounds ! you love her too ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes , madly , frantically , ridiculously perhaps , but I love her . But , uncle , do me a favor . Drive down to Lord Courtenay 's ; tell him I had a difficulty last night at the ball ; that I fight this morning , and beg him to be second . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And you ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt I will await the colonel ; I have something to say to him . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Good by , then ; but be calm  --  cool . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O , be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. H. ) She loves me ! And yet I sought a foolish quarrel with poor Villiers . But why the deuse did he wear such a joyous , triumphant look ?

Yesterday , colonel , I did not know what I was doing . I sought a foolish quarrel with you , I think , and now I ask your pardon . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What do you mean ? Sir E.

Algernon Villiers Tell me , is it true  --  this report of a divorce  --  a separation ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( Seriously . ) Most true . Blanche and I signed the petition yesterday . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Joyfully . ) Then you abandon the field ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Yes ; only understand  --  Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt That the moment I cease to be Blanche 's husband , I become her lover ; then we can both woo her , and he whom she prefers  --  Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Well ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Nothing , only he can marry her . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward , D. L. H. 2 E. ) Col. Col. Algernon Villiers He whom she prefers will marry her ! What nonsense is that !

Algernon Villiers Yes , madam , I am here , and very anxious too , I will confess . Lady B. Lady Blanche And why this anxiety , colonel ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Because every thing with me , seems to turn out badly . The day before yesterday , you opened to me your doors , and the same day gave me to understand that the most agreeable thing I could do for you was to go out of them . Yesterday you wrote to me to come to you , only to prove to me not only that I was indifferent to you , but that you loved another . To-day , you again send for me . Ah , Blanche , I may well tremble ; for as , at each apparent favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have doubtless bid me come only to drive me forever from your presence . Lady B. Lady Blanche No , Algernon , you are mistaken ; for this very day may you acquire eternal claims , not alone to my friendship , but to my gratitude . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Friendship ! gratitude ! those are cold words , Blanche ; but cold as they are , I wish at least to gain them , having lost all others . Lady B. Lady Blanche I was so agitated last night , Algernon , that I did not remember to speak to you of this affair . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What affair , madam ? I do not know , or have forgotten , to what you refer . Lady B. Lady Blanche O , no , no ! you can not have forgotten it ; and you even remember it so well , that this morning I know you are about to fight with Captain Dashmore . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Captain Dashmore ! And even were it so , how can it interest you , Blanche ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so great an interest at stake , that I have sent for you to implore you to renounce this duel . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers What , Blanche , you ask of me  --  Lady B. Lady Blanche I ask of you a great sacrifice , I know ; but listen . Captain Dashmore knows neither your name nor address ; and if for my sake ,  --  for my sake alone , Algernon  --  you will be silent , he will never know with whom he was to fight , and your honor will remain unsullied . But if you meet him , my honor will be compromised , an imprudence will from that time become a crime , and though innocent ,  --  innocent before Heaven ,  --  in the eyes of the world I shall be lost for ever . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers No , Blanche , it is not the judgment of the world you fear ; there is one , whose good opinion you prize more than that of all the world beside  --  your husband . Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes , Algernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past few days there has been a change  --  a strange and great one  --  in and about me ; a new and till now unknown light dawning upon my heart , has shown me objects as they really are . That which I thought an eternal passion , I have found to be  --  I will not say a caprice , but my heart 's mistake . In my husband , I found not only a good , brave , and noble soul , but a gentleman full of courtesy and kindness , who , instead of treating me as many another would have done , left me to myself , relying upon my sense of right , confiding in my honor . Then I became exalted in my own eyes , I grew in my own esteem ; and from that moment I would not , even in thought , deceive such a man . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( Bitterly . ) O madam , do not stop there : be frank and say you love him . Lady B. Lady Blanche Yes , Algernon , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too late for you did I perceive it , but thank God in time for me . I was on the brink of an abyss  --  a moment longer and I were lost . Now I am on the eve of happiness . My fate , my reputation , my honor , are in your hands . Algernon , by the name of your mother , in the name of your sister , I implore you to be generous . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Madam , it is too late . If your honor is engaged , so is mine . Captain Dashmore , it is true , knows neither my name nor my address , but he expects a gentleman , and I , madam , know I am expected . Should I fail to meet him , should I renounce this duel because I wore a mask upon my face , the whole British army would be dishonored . No , madam , it is impossible . Lady B. Lady Blanche But what then will become of me ? O , think , think of the terrible position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That position , madam , such as it is , you owe only to yourself . If it is a false one , it is not my fault ; and as it is not my fault I can not at the same time sacrifice to you both my love and my honor . Yes , my honor ; for were I to-day to do as you request , to-morrow you would be the first to despise me . Lady B. Lady Blanche Then all my prayers are useless ; all entreaties are in in vain ! You refuse me , and I am lost forever ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I must not only refuse you , madam , but as I have already too much delayed  --  ( As he is going , ) Enter Lord Dorrington , C. D. L. H. Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Rushing to him . ) O , uncle ! come , come to my aid ; Algernon is pitiless , and even now seeks Captain Dashmore . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( Very seriously . ) He will not find him . Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( C. ) No . Captain Dashmore is at this moment engaged in an affair of honor . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I know it ; for it is with me . Lord D. Lord Dorrington You are mistaken , sir ; it is with my nephew . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers With Sir Edward ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Yes , sir . Last evening at the masquerade , Captain Dashmore insulted Lady Mordaunt , and this morning Sir Edward Morduant has demanded satisfaction of Captain Dashmore . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers But this is a trick , a miserable trick . Lord Dorrington , I command you by all that you hold sacred , by your honor as a gentleman , to tell me where they are , that I may find them , that I may separate them tell them that this duel is mine , belongs to me . Where are they , sir , where are they ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington I do not know , sir ; but you can inform yourself at Captain Dashmore 's lodgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are right ! I will . ( Exit precipitately , C. D. L. H. ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( R. H. ) But , uncle , why did you tell the colonel that Sir Edward was fighting with Captain Dashmore ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( L. H. ) Because it is true , Blanche ! He knows all . Lady B. Lady Blanche He knows all ; and he does not abandon me , he does not despise me , but saves me ; saves me perhaps at the cost of his own life But if he is wounded , if he should be killed  --  if he should die ignorant of my love  --  die thinking me a coquette , a heartless , soulless woman  --  die with curses on his lips for her who caused his death  --  O , uncle , I can not , can not bear it ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington Listen to me , Blanche . I am an old man , belonging to another age , another time , understanding not the foolish vanities of to-day ; and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips to crush you with the responsibility of this duel . But when I see your grief , your tears , your despair , when I know by my own agony what you must suffer  --  I can not blame , I can only weep with you ; for I , Blanche , had made of him my son  --  he the last of our race ; and he dead , the old man is left alone again . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Throwing herself into his arms . ) O father , father ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington Yes , your father ! for you too are my child . I ought perhaps to leave you with your remorse , but I have not the strength to do it . Listen , Blanche ; I have told him all . Lady B. Lady Blanche He knows all , he knows that I love him , and yet he came not to me . O , this is more than indifference ; it is contempt ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington No , Blanche , it is love , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitately , C. D. L. H. Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( C. ) Has not Sir Edward returned ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( L. H. ) No , not yet . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( R. H. ) But you are agitated , you are pale ! O Heavens ! what has happened ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Nothing , nothing . ( He turns to go . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Wildly . ) No , no ! you shall not go till you have told us all ! What , what has happened ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I do not yet know myself . I hastened from here to Dashmore 's . He was not there ; they told me he had gone to Primrose Hill . I flew thither , but I arrived too late . Lady B. Lady Blanche Too late ! my God ! too late ! Speak ! tell me all ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Some men , who were working in the environs , and who had witnessed the encounter , told me that one of the gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Sinking into a chair on R. H. ) O Heavens ! it is my husband ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( In a low tone to the Colonel . ) Upon your honor , sir , do you know nothing more ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Upon my honor , sir , I do not . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Then all hope is not lost . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Suddenly rising . ) Listen ! ( Noise , L. H. 2 E. Momentary silence . ) Lord D. Lord Dorrington Some one is coming up . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( Rushing across to D. L. H. ) ' T is he ! ' t is he ! ( The door opens , Sir Edward rushes in , D. L. H. 2 E. Blanche throws herself into his arms . ) Dear , dear husband ! Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt My own dear wife . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( In his arms . ) You are not wounded ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Thank Heaven , no ! There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( L. H. ) And so you gave a lesson to this firebrand ? Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt ( L. C. ) Yes , a sword thrust through the body  --  I had no time to choose the place ; I was in a hurry . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Good ! and now you must be in a hurry to depart . Lady B. Lady Blanche ( R. C. ) Depart ! so soon ! and why ? Lord D. Lord Dorrington Because his majesty has strictly prohibited all duelling , and your husband , I suppose , is not anxious so soon to leave you for a prison . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( R. H. , aside , and recollecting . ) What have I done ? Lady B. Lady Blanche But I will go with him , I will not leave him ; I have the right ; I am his wife , and I will follow him . Lord D. Lord Dorrington And if you do n't make haste you will follow him to a prison . Lady B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instant . Enter Brush hastily , C. D. L. H. Brush . Brush My lord , the house is surrounded by the guards . Lord D. Lord Dorrington Ah , it is too late . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers ( R. H. ) Again am I to blame for this unfortunate interruption . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What , you ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Yes ; for when I learned that you meant to forestall me with Dashmore , all means seemed honorable to prevent you , and I placed the guards upon your track . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt Go to the devil ! Lady B. Lady Blanche What is to be done ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Do n't be alarmed ; I will save him yet . Brush . Brush They are coming up ! Shall we barricade the door ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers No ; on the contrary , open it . Enter an Officer , with a file of men , C. D. L. H. Sir E.

Algernon Villiers ( Delivering up his sword . ) You will permit me a moment 's conversation with my wife and friends ? ( The Officer bows , and retires up to his men . The Colonel comes down between Blanche and Sir Edward . ) Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt What does this mean ? Col. Col. Algernon Villiers It means that for once again I beg leave to take your place ; but this time , Sir Edward , it shall be the last . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But explain  --  Col. Col. Algernon Villiers Hush ! While they take me away in your carriage you can quietly depart in mine . To-morrow you will reach the continent . in two days I will prove that I am not Sir Edward ; in six weeks Captain Dashmore will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London as if nothing had happened . I shall be laughed at a little , but I shall know that you are happy , and that will console me . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt But , colonel , I can not suffer this ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers O Sir Edward , be generous , and allow me at least partly to repair the evil I have caused . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt My dear Villiers ! ( Takes him by the hand . ) Lady B. Lady Blanche Algernon ! Col. Col. Algernon Villiers You this morning offered me your friendship , madam ; I accept it ; I prefer even that to nothing . Off . Officer Sir Edward , we await you . Col. Col. Algernon Villiers I am ready , sir . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( To Officer . ) One moment , sir !

Sir Edward Mordaunt Remain here ? But you have no business in the city Lord D. Lord Dorrington No business in the city ! What are you thinking of ? ( Takes petition from his pocket . ) You forget that I must attend to your petition for a divorce . Sir E. Sir Edward Mordaunt O uncle , tear it up , tear it up ; we have no need of that now ; and should you insist upon divorcing us , the next moment would see me at her feet , beseeching her to be my wife .

Lady Blanche O , yes , uncle ; after all the trouble I 've had to win him , I ca n't afford to lose him now . Lord D. Lord Dorrington ( Joining their hands . ) Well , I suppose you must have your own way . I 'll keep this paper , though ; it may be of some use hereafter . If I ever catch you disobeying me again , I 'll take no pity on you . So beware ! Remember you are both on your good behavior . ( Colonel Villiers comes down L. H. ) Lady B.
