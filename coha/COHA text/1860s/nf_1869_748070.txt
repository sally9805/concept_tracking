txt /q/ , have grown , and they can weed the ground and assist him in removing the obstacles by which his progress is impeded . At another step , we find him burning a piece of the iron soil which surrounds him in all directions , and now he is enabled to obtain a real axe and spade , inferior in quality , but still much superior to those by which his labour has been thus far aided . He next , with the aid of his sons , grown to man 's estate , removes the light pine of the hill-side , leaving still untouched , however , the heavy oak of the river bottom . His cultivable ground is increased in extent , while he is enabled with his spade to penetrate still deeper than before , thus bringing into action the powers of the several soils lying within half a dozen inches of the surface . He finds , with great pleasure , that the light /z/ soil is underlaid with clay , and that by combining the two he obtains a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finds , too , that by turning the top soil down , the process of decomposition is facilitated , and that thus , with each new operation , he receives an increasing reward for his labour . His family has increased , and he has obtained the important advantage of combination of exertion . Things that were needed to be done to render his land more rapidly productive , but which were to one man impracticable , become simple and easy when now attempted by himself and his half dozen sons , each of whom obtains far more food than he alone could at first command , and in return for far less severe exertion . He next extends his operations downwards , towards the low grounds of the stream , girdling the large trees , and burning the brush , and thus facilitating the passage of air so as to render the land by degrees fitted for occupation . He now finds that his sons can perform all the labours of the field , and that by devoting his own attention to the cultivation of the iron soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour , than in any other manner . He invents a hoe , by means of which his grandchildren are enabled to keep the ground free from weeds , and to tear up some of the roots by w r hich his best lands - those last brought into cultivation are yet infested . He has succeeded in taming the ox , but as yet has had no use for his sendees . He now invents the plough , and by means of a piece of twisted hide is enabled to attach the ox , and to turn up a deeper soil , while extending his cultivation over land more distant from the place of his first little cabin , on the spot first occupied . His family grows , and with it grows his wealth . He has better marhinery , and he has reduced to cultivation more and better lands . Food and clothing are more abundant , and the air on the lower lands is improved by the clearing of /z/ the trees . His house , too , is better . In the outset , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such decayed logs as his unaided efforts could succeed in rolling and placing one upon the other . A chimney was an unhoped-for luxury , and he must live in perpetual smoke , or almost perish of cold . A window was a luxury unthought of . If the severity of the weather required him to close his doors , he was stifled with smoke , and he passed his days in darkness . His time , therefore , during a large portion of the year , was totally unproductive , while his life was liable to be shortened by disease produced by foul air within , or severe cold without , his miserable hut . With increase of population he has acquired wealth , derived from the cultivation of new and better soils ; and he has acquired also the power of combining his labour with that of others , thus rendering that of all more productive . They now fell the heavy oak and the enormous pine , and avail themselves thereof for the construction of additional houses , each in regular succession better than the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sons are now employed in the field , while others prepare the skins and render them more fit for clothing : and a third set make axes , spades , hoes , ploughs , and other implements calculated to aid the labours of the field , and those of construction . The supply of food increases rapidly , and with it the power of accumulation . In the first years , there was perpetual danger of famine . Now , there is a surplus , and a part is stored to provide against the danger of short crops . Cultivation extends itself along the hill-side , where deeper soils now laid open by the plough , afford a better return , while down the slope of the hill each successive year is marked by the disappearance of the great trees by which the richer lands have heretofore been occupied , the intermediate spaces becoming meanwhile /z/ enriched by the decomposition of the enormous roots , and more readily ploughed because of the gradual decay of the stumps . A single ox to the plough can now turn up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . A single ploughman can now do more than on the groun first cultivated could have been done by a hundred men armed with pointed sticks . The family are next enabled to drain some of the lower lands , and copious harvests of grain are obtained from the new soil now first cultivated . The oxen have heretofore roamed the woods , gathering w r hat they could . The meadow is now granted to their use , the axe and the saw enabling the family to enclose them , and thus to lessen the labour attendant upon obtaining supplies of meat , milk , butter and hides . Heretofore their chief domestic animal has been the hog , which could live on mast . Now , they add beef , and perhaps mutton , the lands first cultivated being abandoned to the sheep . They obtain far more meat and grain , and with less labour than at any former period , although their numbers have so greatly increased . The father and grandfather have passed away , and the younger generations are now profiting by the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily increasing advantage : and obtaining a constantly increasing return , with increasing power of accumulation , and decreasing severity of application . They now bring new powers to their aid , and the water no longer is allowed to run to waste : the air itself is made to work . Windmills grind the grain , and sawmills cut the timber , which disappears more rapidly , while the work of drainage is in course of being improved by more efficient spades and ploughs . The little furnace makes its appearance and charcoal is now applied to the reduction of the soil yielding iron , when it is found that the labour of a single day becomes more productive than was before that of half a dozen . /z/ Population spreads itself along the faces of the hills and down into the lower lands , becoming more and more dense at the seat of the original settlement , and with every step we find increasing tendency to combination of action for the production of food , the manufacture of clothing and household utensils , the construction of houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The heaviest timber : that growing on the most fertile land : now disappears , and the deepest marshes are now drained . Roads are next made to facilitate the intercourse between the old settlement and the newer ones that have been formed around it , and to enable the grower of corn to exchange his product for improved spades and ploughs , and for clothing and furniture . Population again increases , and wealth still further increases , and therewith man acquires more leisure for reflection on the results furnished by the experience of himself and his predecessors . His mind becomes more and more stimulated into action . The sand in the neighbourhood is found to be underlaid with marl , and by the aid of the improved machinery now in use , the two are brought into combination , thereby producing a soil of power far exceeding that of those heretofore cultivated . The return to labour increases , and all are better fed , and clothed , and housed , and all are incited to new exertions , while improved health and the power of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to apply their labour more steadily and regularly . Thus far , however , they have found it difficult to gather their crops in season . The harvest time is short , and the whole strength of the community has been found insufficient to prevent much of the grain remaining on the ground until , over ripe , it was shaken out by the wind , or in the attempt to gather it : and not unfrequently it has been totally ruined by changes of weather after it was /z/ fit to be harvested . The progress of cultivation has thereby been arrested , and labour has been superabundant during the year , while harvest produced a demand for it that could not be supplied . The reaping-hook takes the place of the hand , and the scythe enables the farmer to cut his hay . The cradle and the horse-rake follow , and all tend to increase the facility of accumulation , and thus to increase the power of applying labour to new soils , deeper or more distant , more heavily burdened with timber , or more liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as drainage . New combinations , too , are formed . The clay is found to be underlaid with the soil called lime , which latter , like the iron soil , requires preparation to fit it for the task of combination . The road , the wagon , and the horse facilitate the work , by enabling the farmer readily to obtain supplies of the carbon-yielding soil , called coal , and he now obtains , by burning the lime and combining it with the clay , a better soil than at any former period : one that will yield more corn , and that requires far less severe labour from himself , his oxen , or his horses . Population and wealth again increase , and the steam-engine facilitates the work of drainage , while the railroad and the engine facilitate the transportation to market of his products . His cattle are now fattened at home , and a large portion of the produce of his rich meadow-land is left at home , in the form of manure , to be applied to other soils , yet found incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food to fatten them at market , he now obtains from market their refuse in the form of bones , and the productiveness of labour is greatly increased . Passing thus , at every step , from the poor to the better soils , the supply of food , and of all other of the necessaries of life increases daily , and men consume more , while accumulating wealth with constantly increasing rapidity . /z/ The danger of famine and disease passes away . Increased returns to labour and daily improving condition render labour pleasant , and man applies himself more steadily as his work becomes less severe . Population increases , and the rapidity of its increase is seen to be greater with each successive generation ; and with each is seen an increase of the power of living in connection with each other , by reason of the power of obtaining constantly increasing supplies from the same surface : with each is seen an increase in the tendency to combination of action , by which their labours are rendered more productive their wants increased the desire and the facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and security of person and property among themselves , and with the world : accompanied by constant increase of numbers , wealth , prosperity and happiness . Nearly forty years have elapsed since Mr. Ricardo communicated to the world his discovery of the nature and causes of rent , and of the law of its progress . The work by means of which it was first made known has since been the text-book of that portion of the English community , who style themselves , par excellence , political economists , and any thing short of absolute faith in its contents is regarded as heresy , worthy of excommunication , or as evidence of an incapacity to comprehend them , worthy only of contempt . Nevertheless , imitating in this the action of the followers of Mahomet , in regard to the Koran , the professors , one and all , who have undertaken to teach this doctrine , insist upon construing it after their own fashion , and modifying it to suit their own views and the apparent necessities of the case ; the consequence /z/ of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is that he is required to believe . Having studied carefully the works of the most eminent of the recent writers on the subject , and having found no two of them to agree , he turns , in despair , to Mr. Ricardo himself , and there he finds , in the celebrated chapter on rent , contradictions that can not be reconciled , and a series of complications such as never before , as we believe , was found in the same number of lines . The more he studies , the more he is puzzled , and the less difficulty does he find in accounting for the variety of doctrines taught by men who profess to belong to the same school , and who all agree , if in little else , in regarding the new theory of rent as the great discovery of the age . In looking round , he sees that all the recognised laws of nature are characterized by the most perfect simplicity , and the greatest breadth . He sees that they are of universal application , and that those by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorting to narrow exceptions to account for particular facts . The simplicity of Kepler 's law of ' equal areas in equal times ' is perfect . Its truth is universal , and all to whom it is explained feel assured not only that it is true , but that it must continue to be GO in relation to all the planets that may be discovered , numerous though they may be , and however distant from the sun and from us . A child may comprehend it , and the merest novice may make himself so fully master of it as to enable him to teach it to others . It needs no commentary , no modification . Such is not the case with the law to which we now desire to call the attention of our readers . Whatever else may be its merits , it can not be charged with either simplicity or universality . At first sight , it . looks , however , to be exceedingly simple . Rent is said to be paid for land of the first /z/ quality , yielding one hundred quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes necessary , with the increase of population , to cultivate land of the second quality , capable of yielding but ninety quarters in return to the same quantity of labour : and the amount of rent then paid for No. 1 is equal to the difference between their respective products . No proposition could be calculated to command more universal assent . Every man who hears it sees around him land that pays rent . He sees that that which yields forty bushels to the acre pays more rent than that which yields but thirty , and that the difference is nearly equal to the difference of product . He becomes at once a disciple of Mr. Ricardo , admitting that the reason why prices are paid for the use of land is that soils are different in their qualities , when he would , at the same moment , regard it as in the highest degree absurd if any one were to undertake to prove that prices are paid for oxen because one ox is heavier than another : that rents are paid for houses because some will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ships command freights because some ships differ from others in their capacity . A certain portion of the world now thinks that it sees in this difference in the qualities of soils the reason why rent is paid for any soils . It is not a very large portion , for the theory has made but little way out of England . It is taught by a few in France , and by some in America , but elsewhere , it has , we believe , made no progress whatsoever , which w T ould certainly not have been the case had it been , like other of the laws of nature , characterized by that simplicity which is essential to universality of application . In former times it was obvious to the whole world that the earth remained unmoved , and that the sun performed a daily revolution around it . It was not to be doubted /z/ that such was the case , but if any one so far ventured , he was referred to the Scriptures for unquestionable evidence of the fact . Careful observers , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the one great and universally admitted fact . Further observation confirmed them in the doubts thus raised , and it was found , at length , that , patch the Ptolemaic theory as its professors might , it could not be made to cover facts whose existence was undeniable . It was too long for some , and too short for others . To disbelieve it , however , was rank heresy , worthy not only of excommunication , but of punishment by fire . Copernicus nevertheless dared to declare his disbelief , and to proclaim to the world that the sun stood still , and that the earth it was that moved . Persecution embittered the remaining years of his life , and his disciple Galileo was compelled , on his knees , to recant his declaration of belief in the monstrous doctrine , yet the whole civilized world now unites w r ith him in the assertion that still it moves . " The doctrine of Mr. Ricardo has , in like manner , been found quite too long for some facts , and as much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has undergone. * Every new teacher tries to stretch it * Among the earliest and most distinguished of the advocates of Mr. Ricardo 's doctrine was the author of the Templar 's Dialogues . In a recent work by the same author we find the following passage : " The tendencies of a natural law like that of rent it is always right to expose , and Ricardo first did expose them . Others had discovered the law ; he first applied his sagacious sense to its consequences upon profits , wages , price ; and through them upon universal economy . That was right ; for that we are irredeemably his debtors . But it was not right to keep studiously out of sight that eternal counter-movement which tends , by an equivalent agency , to redress the disturbed balance . This concealment has had the effect of introducing marvels into a severe science ; since else , what other than a miracle is it that rent has not long since absorbed the whole landed produce a result to which it so manifestly tends . * * * Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ruin . Either we must destroy rent , i. e. that which causes rent , or rent will destroy us , " &c.; Logic of Political Economy , p. 190. /z/ in the direction necessary to cover some well-observed fact , the consequence of which is , that others are left uncovered . In the effort to conceal the head and arms , the feet are exposed , and when the cloak is stretched so as to cover the feet and head , the arms present themselves to view . Such precisely was the case with the system of Ptolemy . It was neither broad nor simple . It was based on a few facts , omitting all reference to a thousand others , and hence its downfall , the necessary consequence of its untruth . Proposing , as we do , to submit some views in opposition to this doctrine of the cause of rent , we would beg leave respectfully to suggest to the disciples of Mr. Ricardo , into whose hands this volume may chance to fall , that their confidence in its truth is not greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence of the great fact upon which it rests is not as obvious as was that of the revolution of the sun ; nor the belief therein quite as universal : that as Ptolemy was ultimately proved to be in error , so may Mr. Ricardo , at some time , be : and that it is , therefore , within the bounds of possibility that it may not be an entire waste of time to read the brief examination of their favourite system that we shall now offer for their consideration . That theory , in its simplest form , is contained in the following propositions : First : That in the commencement of cultivation , when population is small and land consequently abundant , Mr. Ricardo taught that as population increased , the return to labour diminished , and the power of accumulation became less . Mr. De Quincey would have had him teach that as population increased , the power of accumulation also increased , and that by aid of the capital accumulated , the return to labour increased . Mr. Ricardo did not conceal this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it , and a very little reflection will satisfy him that the facts and the theory are totally inconsistent with each other . /z/ the best soils : those capable of yielding the largest return , say one hundred quarters , to a given quantity of labour : alone are cultivated . Second : That with the progress of population , land be comes less abundant , and there arises a necessity for cultivating that yielding a smaller return ; and that resort is then had to a second , and afterwards to a third and a fourth class of soils , yielding respectively ninety , eighty and seventy quarters to the same quantity of labour . Third : That with the necessity for applying labour less productively , which thus accompanies the growth of population , rent arises : the owner of land No. 1 being enabled to demand and to obtain , in return for its use , ten quarters , when resort is had to that of second quality : twenty when No. 3 is brought into use , and thirty when it becomes necessary to cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord tends thus steadily to increase as the productiveness of labour decreases , the division being as follows , to wit : Total . Labour . Bent . At the first period , when No. 1 alone is cultivated 100 100 00 " second period " No. 1 and 2 are cultivated 190 180 10 third period No. 1,2 and 3 270 240 30 fourth period No. 1,2 , 3 and 4 340 280 60 fifth period No. 1,2 , 3,4 , and 5 400 300 100 " sixth period No. 1,2,3 , 4 , 5 and 6 " 450 300 150 seventh period " No. 1,2,3,4 , 5 , 6 and 7 " 490 280 210 and that there is thus a tendency to the ultimate absorption of the whole produce by the owner of the land , and to a steadily increasing inequality of condition : the power of the labourer to consume the commodities which he produces steadily diminishing , while that of the landowner to claim them , as rent , is steadily increasing . Fifth : That this tendency towards a diminution in the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion , always exists where population increases : and most exists w r here population increases most /z/ rapidly : but is in a certain degree counteracted by increase of wealth , producing improvement of cultivation . Sixth : That every such improvement tends to retard the growth of rents , while every obstacle to improvement tends to increase that growth : and that , therefore , the interests of the landowner and labourer are always opposed to each other , rents rising as labour falls , and vice versa . We hope that this statement of the theory will be deemed by its advocates unexceptionable . We desire to state it with perfect fairness , but we know of few things more difficult , because of the numerous exceptions and modifications that have been required to make it fit the facts . So difficult , notwithstanding , has the operation of fitting been found , that some of its most distinguished advocates have seemed much disposed to think the fault is in the facts themselves. * It will be perceived that the whole system is based upon the assertion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the commencement of cultivation , when population is small , and land consequently abundant , the soils capable of yielding the largest return to any given quantity of labour alone are cultivated . That fact exists , or it does not . If it has no existence , the system falls to the ground . That it does not exist ; that it never has existed in any country whatsoever ; and that it is contrary to the nature of things that it should have existed , or can exist , we propose now to show . /z/ * " The one the practical man draws his notion of the universe from the few objects which compose the furniture of his counting-house ; the other the philosopher having got demonstration on his side , and forgetting that it is only a demonstration nisi a proof at all times liable to be set aside by the addition of a single new fact to the hypothesis denies instead of examining and sifting the allegations which are opposed to him . " / . S. Mill . /z/ The picture presented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consideration of the reader . Mr. Ricardo places his settler on the best lands , and the children of that settler on those which are inferior . He makes man the victim of a sad necessity , increasing with his numbers , whereas , we have shown him exercising constantly increasing power , derived from combined exertion by those numbers . He had never witnessed , as at this moment we do from the window at which we write , the progress of a new settlement . Had he done so , we doubt not his strong mind would have enabled him to study out the true cause of rent , and the law of its progress and decline . We propose now to show that in every part of the world , and in every age , the order of events has been such as we have stated it to be , and if this can be done to the satisfaction of our readers , it will be obvious that the theory of Mr. Ricardo has no foundation . It rests on the assumption of a single and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no existence , the system must be abandoned , and we must seek elsewhere for the cause of rent : and it may prove that we shall find the law of its progress to be directly the reverse of what it is , by many , supposed to be . We shall commence our examination with the United States . Their first settlement is recent , and the work being still in progress , we can readily trace the settler , and mark his course of operation . If we find him invariably occupying the high and thin lands requring little clearing and no drainage : those which can yield but a small return to labour : and as invariably travelling down the hills and clearing and draining the lower and richer lands , as population and wealth increase : then will the theory we have offered be confirmed by practice : American practice at least . If , however , we can thence follow him into Mexico , and through South America ; into /z/ Britain , and through France , Germany , Italy , Greece and Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his invariable course of action , then may it be believed that when population is small , and land consequently abundant , the work of cultivation is , and always must be , commenced upon the poorer soils : that with the growth of population and wealth , other soils , yielding a larger return to labour , are always brought into activity , with a constantly increasing return to the labour expended upon them : and that with this change there is a steady diminution in the proportion of the population required for producing the means of subsistence , and as steady an increase in the proportion that may apply themselves to producing the other comforts , conveniences and luxuries of life . The first settlers of the English race are found establishing themselves on the barren soil of Massachusetts , and founding the colony of Plymouth . The whole continent was before them , but , like all other colonists , they had to take what , with their means , they could obtain . Other settlements are formed at Newport and New Haven , and thence they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but occupying in all cases the higher lands , leaving the clearing of timber and the draining of swamps to their more wealthy successors . Were the reader desired to designate the soils of the Union least calculated for the production of food , his choice would , we think , fall upon the rocky lands first occupied by the hardy Puritans , and thus we find that here at least the most fertile lands are not first taken into cultivation . If we look to New York the process is the same . The unproductive soil of the island of New York , and the opposite shore of New Jersey , and the higher lands on Long Island , claimed . early attention , while the more productive soils came later into cultivation . Here . **am , we find population spreadD /z/ ing and following the course of the Hudson towards the Mohawk , but in all cases it will be found keeping the higher and drier lands , away from the river bank . The settlers desire food , and if they undertake to clear the forests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey we find them occupying the higher lands towards the heads of the rivers , while neglecting the lower grounds that require drainage. * That state still abounds in fine timber that covers rich lands , which need only to be cleared to yield larger returns to labour than any of those cultivated a hundred years since , when land was far more abundant than now . On the shores of the Delaware , we find the Quakers selecting the light lands that produce the pine : and that , even now , with the aid of manure , will scarcely produce wheat : while forests of oak still cover the opposite shore of Pennsylvania . Every settler selects , too , the higher and drier parts of his farm , leaving the meadows , many of which have remained until now in a state of nature , while others have been drained within the last five years . The best portions of every farm are , invariably , those which have been most recently brought into cultivation , while the poorest lands of the various neighbourhoods are always those on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further through the sandy lands of New Jersey , we shall find hundreds of little clearings more than half a century old , long since abandoned by their owners , who have left behind their little orchards and other evidences of their existence , to attest the character of the soil that men cultivate when population is small , and fertile land most abundant . Having cleared the lands that produce the oak , or drained those which yield the white-cedar , /z/ they abandon those which produce the pine of that state , the poorest of all pines . The Swedes settle Lewistown and Christiana , on the sandy soil of Delaware . Crossing that state towards the head of Chesapeake Bay , we find in the little and decaying towns of Elkton and Charlestown , once the centres of a somewhat active population , further evidence of the poverty of the soils first occupied , when fine meadow-land , on which are now the richest farms in that state , was abundant , but held as worthless . Penn follows the Swedes , and profits by their expenditure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware , about twelve miles north of the site which he afterwards chooses for his city , near the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill . Starting from this latter point , and tracing the course of settlement , we find it not at first extending downwards towards the rich meadow-lands , but upwards along the ridge between the two rivers , where the village of Germantown , which half a century since exceeded three miles in length , and was for a village very closely built , remains to mark the tendencies of early colonists . If , now , we pass , right or left , to the river banks , we shall see , in the character of the buildings , evidences of later occupation and cultivation . If further evidence be desired , and we look to the maps of that early day , we find the fertile lands in the vicinity of the Delaware , from New Castle almost to the head of tidewater , a distance of more than sixty miles , marked as held in large tracts , and dotted over with trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper lands are divided into small farms. * Passing northward and westward , and keeping near the Schuylkill , we see the oldest habitations always most distant from the river ; but later times , and increase of population and wealth , have carried cultivation to the water 's edge . With every additional mile , we find stronger evidence of the recent cultivation of the best soils . The original /z/ timber still stands on beautiful meadow-land . The trees ana shrubs in and near the fence rows on the lower lands become more abundant . The valleys in the rolls of the hills , a little distant from the river , become studded with trees . The lowest ground in the meadow-field , from time immemorial a ditch in which leaves have rotted , remains in a state of nature , from want of drainage . The banks of the little tributaries of the river become more and more wild . Long strips of meadow land are met waiting for embankment . Cows are seen pasturing in fields the character of whose vegetation shows that the operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a proper system of drainage is , as yet , unthought of . Little islands appear , capable of yielding a large return to labour , but as yet covered with weeds and shrubs . Everywhere around we see the higher lands in a high state of cultivation , and affording proof of the length of time that has elapsed since they were cleared . Arriving in the vicinity of Reading , we see in lands abandoned , evidence of the want of fertility in the soils first cultivated , and other evidence of the superiority of the new soils now coming into activity , in the fine fields that have been restored by combining the inferior lime with the superior clay . In our further progress up the river we meet , at every step , farms on the hillsides , while the lower lands become more and more wild and rough . Patches of wood standing thereon are now of frequent occurrence , while the stumps in others attest the recent date of their subjugation to the plough : and finer crops standing among the stumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-cleared dry land of the hills , first cultivated . The rough and undrained land nearest the river will , with increased population and wealth , furnish fine meadows , but in its present state is of small value . Further on , cultivation almost leaves the river bank , and if we would seek it we must pass outward , where , at the distance of half a mile or more , we may find farms half a cen- /z/ tury old . If we travel up the little stream that leads to Orvvigsburg , the seat of justice for Schuylkill county , we shall find a beautiful valley with the hill-sides cleared to the top , while below , the rivulet meanders through patches of wood-land , and the flat is interspersed with remnants of the timber that originally covered the whole : the intermediate spaces being frequently occupied by fields the date of whose clearing may readily be determined by the greater or less decay of the stumps with which they are in part covered . If now we follow the old road , winding about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quire the cause of thus lengthening the distance , we find that it was made to suit the early settlers : but if we follow the new roads , we find them keeping near the stream , on the low and rich lands last cultivated . Returning to the river and passing on our course , the trees become more and more numerous , and the meadow-land less and less drained or occupied ; and at length , as we pass up the little branches of the river , cultivation disappears , and the original woods remain untouched , except so far as the wants of the recently established coal trade have tended to their extermination . If we desire to see the land chosen by the early settlers , we have but to ascend the hill-side , and on the flat above will be found houses and farms , some of them half a century old , many of which are now abandoned . If , passing northward from the river , we trace its little tributary , Mill Creek , to its source , we see miles of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but here and there a patch of cleared land : while on the hill-sides may be seen occasional little farms , the houses on which bear every mark of considerable age . Arriving at the little town of St. Clair , the site of which three years since was covered with timber growing on land fitted to make the finest meadows , but much of it then a mere marsh , we see , far up the hill , the residence of the first owner of this large body of fertile land , and may judge for ourselves the original character of the soil selected fo /z/ cultivation from the small pines and hemlocks on that immediately adjacent ; and yet the style of the house proves him to have been of the better class of the settlers of half a century past , when population was thin , and good land abundant , but wealth scarce . Crossing Broad and Locust mountains , we see near their tops the habitations of early settlers , who selected the land of the pine , easily cleared , and whose pine-knots afforded at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles that they were too poor to buy . Immediately afterwards we find ourselves in the valley of the Susquehanna , on meadow-lands whose character is proved by the great size of the timber by which they are covered : but upon which neither the spade nor the plough has yet made its mark . Passing onward , we meet a row of small farms occupying a ridge between the mountains , while below them , distant two or three hundred yards , the little stream runs through fine white-oak timber lands , upon which the axe has scarcely yet been heard . Good land thus abounds , but the settler prefers that which will yield the largest return to labour , which the richer lands would not , as the cost of clearing them would be more than they were worth when cleared . Descending the little stream , we reach the Susquehanna , and with every step of our progress , we find cultivation descending the hills . The valleys become more cleared of timber , and meadows and cattle appear , the most certain signs of increasing population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susquehanna , the order is again inverted . Population diminishes , and cultivation tends to leave the river bottom , and to ascend the hill-sides . Arriving in the vicinity of Muncy , if , leaving the river and ascending the bank , we pass to the foot of the Muncy hills , our road will cross fine limestone land whose food-producing qualities being less obvious to the early settlers , whole tracts of it , containing hundreds of acres , passed from hand to hand in exchange for a dollar , or even a jug of whiskey . They preferred the oak-producing soils , whose trees they could /z/ girdle , and afterwards destroy by fire . With increasing population and wealth , we find them returning to the lands at first despised , combining the inferior and superior soils , and obtaining greatly increased returns to labour . If now we tould take a bird's-eye view of the country , we might trace with perfect accuracy the course of every little stream , by the timber still standing on its banks , conspicuous among the higher and cleared lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find the timber in the low lands increasing in quantity , and if we desire to see cultivation we must seek it at the head- waters of the Bald Eagle , in the county of Centre : or we may pass up the Sinnemahoning , amid tens of thousands of acres of timber , much of which would yield , as we are assured , a hundred thousand feet of lumber to the acre , which yet have felt no implement but the axe of the lumberman . So nearly valueless are the fertile soils which produce these fine trees , that we have just now heard of the sale of two thousand acres , estimated to average thirty thousand feet to the acre : the whole for the sum of $1250 or .260 . Attaining the head of the stream , we find ourselves again in the midst of cultivation , and see that the settlers here , as everywhere else , have selected the high and dry lands upon which they might commence with the plough , in preference to the more fertile soils that required the axe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we advance northward to the newly settled counties of Potter , McKean and Tioga , we find the centre of population of each occupying the highest lands , near the head of the several little streams which there take their rise . If , passing westward , we cross the ridge of the Alleghany to the head-waters of the Ohio , we find again the order of things inverted . Population at first is scattered , and occupies the higher lands , and the best timber is still standing : but as we descend the river , population and wealth gradually increase , the lower lands become more and more cleared , and at length we find ourselves ai Pittsburgh , , in the midst of a dense population , /z/ actively employed in bringing into connection the several soils containing carbon , lime , and iron , with a view to the preparation of machinery to enable the farmer of the west to sink deeply into the land of which heretofore he has but scratched the superficial soil , and to clear and drain the fertile soils of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has heretofore derived his supplies of food . The early settlers of Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , uniformly selected the higher grounds , leaving the richer lands for their successors . The immediate valleys of streams , fertile a ? were the soils , were and still are avoided on account of danger to be apprehended from the fevers which even now sweep off so many of the emigrants to the new states . The facility of getting some small crop always prompted , as it still prompts , to the selection of the land which was most readily brought into cultivation : and none so well answered the purpose as that which was slightly clothed with timber , and clear of undergrowth . The constant fall of leaves had by their decay kept the ground covered with a light mould , and prevented the growth of grass : and by deadening the trees to let in the sun , they could obtain a small return to labour . The first great object was to have a dry place for the dwelling . Land which is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settler was found always selecting dry ridges of land on which to begin the work of cultivation ; for the same reason which prevented him from commencing the work of artificial drainage to secure a place for his dwelling equally prevented him from so doing for any other purpose . In the prairies , the richest land is found in the centre of the prairie , and there can water be most readily obtained ; while on the outer edges , as the surface descends towards the timbered land , it is less healthful , and water is obtained only by boring to a considerable depth , while the soil is far less rich : yet here inv ? riably does the settler /z/ commence , as the centre requires drainage , and three or four yoke of oxen to break up the tough sod . With each step in the progress of wealth and population , the new settlers are seen approaching nearer to the centre and obtaining better soils at less cost of labour . While thus passing inward towards richer portions of the prairie , others gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins of the streams , but for want of drainage these are frequently overflowed , and then the labour is in a great measure lost . Descending the river from Pittsburgh , we reach the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi , where we lose sight of all signs of population , except that of the poor wood-cutter , who risks his health while engaged in providing wood for the numerous steamboats . Here , for hundreds of miles , wf pass through the most fertile land , covered with timber of gigantic size . With all its powers of production , it is valueless for all purposes of cultivation . Unembanked , it is liable to occasional overflow from the river , and its neighbourhood is destructive to life and health : for which reason hundreds of thousands of acres that , when population and wealth shall have further increased , will yield the largest return to labour , remain uncleared and undrained : while the higher lands , whose " original and indestructible powers " are less , are in a state of cultivation . Descending further , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico . Embankments , or levees , keep out the river , and the finest plantations are seen on land corresponding in every respect with the wild and uncultivated region through which we have just passed . If , now , we desire to seek the habitations of the early settlers , we must leave the river bank and ascend the hills , and with every step we shall find new proof that cultivation invariably commences on the poorer soils . If we interrogate the pioneer settlers why they waste their labour on the poor soil of the hill-tops , while fertile soils abound , their answer will invariably be found to be , that the one they can cultivate /z/ as it stands , while the other they can not . The pine of the hills is small , and easily cleared . It gives them good fuel , and its knots furnish artificial light . To attempt to clear the land that bears the oak would ruin them . If , instead of descending the Mississippi , we ascend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red River , we find invariably that the more dense the population and the greater the mass of wealth , the more are the good soils cultivated : and that as population diminishes with our approach to their headwaters , and as land becomes more abundant , cultivation recedes from the river banks , the timber and the undrained meadow-lands increase in quantity , and the scattered inhabitants are seen obtaining from the superficial soils a diminishing return to their labour , accompanied with diminishing power to command the necessaries , conveniences , and comforts of life . If we cross the Mississippi into Texas , and mark the site of the town of Austin , the centre of the first American settlement , we find it to have been placed high up on the Colorado , while millions of acres of the finest timber and meadow lands in the world , totally unoccupied , were passed over , as incapable of paying the cost of simple appropriation . If we look to the Spanish colony of Bexar , we find further illustration of the same universal fact . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know of no exception to the rule , and we feel assured that none exists , or can exist . That it should do so , would be contrary to the laws of nature . The same reason that prompts the settler to build himself a log-house , to provide shelter while waiting until he can have one of stone , equally prompts him to begin cultivation where he can use his plough , and not to risk the starvation of his family by endeavouring to do so where he can not : and where fevers , perhaps to be followed by death , would be the inevitable result of the attempt . In every case on record , in which settlements have been at tempted on rich lands , they have either failed totally , or /z/ their progress has been slow , and it has been only after repeated efforts that they have thriven . The reader who desires evidence of this fact , and of the absolute necessity for commencing with the poorer soils , will obtain it if he study the history of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures with the steady growth of those formed in the region of the St. Lawrence , where numerous and somewhat prosperous settlements were formed at places where the land is now held to be almost utterly valueless , because better soils can be obtained elsewhere , by sinking deeper into the earth , or removing to a little distance . He may obtain additional evidence , if he will compare the gentle , but steady , growth of the colonies planted on the sterile soils of New England , with the repeated failures of colonization upon the richer lands of Virginia and Carolina , which latter could not be reduced to cultivation by men working for themselves ; and hence we find the richer colonists purchasing negroes , and compelling them to perform the work , while the free labourer seeks the light sandy lands of North Carolina . Slavery would never have existed there could free labourers have been obtained , but no man , left to himself , will commence the work of cultivation on the rich soils : because it is from those soils that the return is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the new countries of the world , that the condition of the labourer is the worst , where the work is undertaken in advance of the wealth and combination that come , or ought to come , with time . The settler who sought the high light lands obtained food , although the return to his labour was small . Had he undertaken to drain the rich soils of the Dismal Swamp , he would have starved , as did those who settled the fertile island of Roanoke . If the reader will now cross with us the Rio Grande , into Mexico , he may find further illustration of the universality of this law . At his left , near the mouth of the river , but at some distance from its bank , he will see the city of Matamoras , of recent date . Starting from that point , he may fol- /z/ low the river through vast bodies of fine lands in a state of nature , with here and there a scattered settlement occupying the higher ones , to the mouth of the San Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in a somewhat populous country , of which Monterey is the centre . If , standing here , he cast his eyes to the north , he sees cultivation advancing among the high lands of Chihuahua , and keeping , invariably , away from the river banks . The city of that name is distant twenty miles even from the little tributary of the great river , and more than a hundred miles from the mouth of that tributary . If he pass west from Monterey , through Saltillo and thence south , his road will lie over sandy plains whose existence is evidence of the general character of the region . Arriving in Potosi , he finds himself in a country without rivers , and almost without the possibility of irrigation , and where any failure of the periodical rains is followed by famine and death , yet if he cast his eyes downwards towards the coast , he sees a magnificent country , watered by numerous rivers , and in which the cotton and the indigo plant grow spontaneously : a country in which the maize grows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world with sugar , and in which the only danger to be apprehended from the character of the soil is , that the crops might be smothered by reason of the rapid growth of plants that spring up in the rich earth , without aid , or even permission from the man who might undertake to cultivate it : yet there he sees no population . The land is uncleared and undrained , and likely so to remain , because those who should undertake to work , with the present means of the country , would starve , if they did not perish by the fevers that there , as everywhere , prevail among the richest soils until subjected to cultivation : and often long afterwards . Passing on , he sees Zacatecas , high and dry like Potosi , yet cultivated . Keeping the ridge , he sees on his left Tlascala , once the seat of a great and wealthy people , far removed from any stream whatsoever , and occupying the high land /z/ from which descend little streams seeking the waters of both the Atlantic and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , a land capable of yielding the largest returns to labour , that by slow degrees , with the growth of population and wealth , was once drained and rendered fit for cultivation . In the time of Cortes , the people were numerous and rich , and the fertile soils they had brought into activity produced food in abundance for forty cities . Population and wealth have declined , and the remaining people have retired to the high lands bordering the valley , to cultivate the poorer soils ; and the single city that still remains draws its supplies of food from a distance of fifty miles , in a country where roads scarcely exist , the consequence of which is that corn is higher in price than in London or Paris while wages are very low . Fertile land is here superabundant , over which roam half-starved cattle , seeking to obtain from the top soil : the only one used in this second childhood of agriculture : that nourishment which would be afforded in endless abundance , did the people possess the means and the industry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounded . Not an acre in the hundred is cultivated at all , yet even with their imperfect machinery each one would yield twenty bushels . The people fly from it , whereas , according to Mr. Ricardo , it is that which would be first appropriated . Passing southward , we see Tabasco almost unoccupied , " yet possessing highly fertile lands . Next we reach Yucatan , a land in which water is a luxury : yet here we meet a large and prosperous population , near neighbours to the better soils of Honduras that are covered with trees of the most enormous size , and that , when population and wealth shall have sufficiently increased , will yield returns to labour as large , if not larger , than any hitherto known : yet now they are a wilderness , affording subsistence but to a few miserable logwood and mahogany cutters . If , now , the reader look northward , towards the Carib- /z/ bean sea , he will see the little dry and rocky islands of Montserrat , Nevis , St. Kitts , St. Lucia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his right stands Trinidad , with the richest of soils , remaining almost in a state of nature . If he will cast his eyes on the map and mark the position of Santa Fe de Bogota , and the city of Quito , the centres of population , where men cluster together on the high and dry lands while the valley of Oroonoko remains unoccupied , he will see exhibited on a great scale the same fact which , on a small one , we have shown to exist on the banks of the Schuylkill and the Susquehanna . If , next , he will take his station on the peaks of Chimborazo and look around , he will see the same great fact in relation to all southern America . He will see the only civilized people of the days of Pizarro occupying high and dry Peru , drained by little streams whose rapid course forbids the possibility that marshes should be formed in which vegetable matter may decay , to give richness to the soil for the production of timber before the period of cultivation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wanted no artificial drainage . It was therefore occupied . If , now , he turn his face to the east , he will see before him the rich valley of the Amazon , affording soils inferior to none on earth , yet to this day a wilderness . Let him next trace the numerous tributaries of that great river to their sources , and he will there meet the various Portuguese towns and cities , occupying the high lands , and waiting the further growth of population and wealth for the clearing and draining of the rich soil lying between them and the ocean : soils whose crops , transported on steamboats , will at some future day yield to the labour employed a return ten times greater than can now be obtained by cultivating the poor ones , and transporting the produce across hills and mountains on the backs of mules . The laws of nature require that if man would improve his condition he must work , and he must let others work in peace . He must let wealth /z/ and population grow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit wholesale robbery and murder under the pretence of making wars for " the public good , " or the hollow one of maintaining " the liberties of Europe : " she punishes him by shutting him out from those lands that would yield the largest return to his labour , and compelling him to travel on foot across barren mountains , when he might have a railroad car that would transport him rapidly through fertile valleys , where at every step he would see evidences of prosperity and happiness . Let the reader now cast his eyes south , and compare the steep declivity occupied by the people of Chili , advancing rapidly in population and wealth ; with the great valley of the La Plata , and its tribes of barbarians encamped upon lands capable of yielding the largest return to labour : and that will do so when man shall relinquish the trade of war , and permit the earth to enrich himself and his neighbour . Here , as everywhere , he has evidence that cultivation invariably commences on the poorer soils . Crossing now the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , and after a little study determine for himself where agriculture should first take root . Throughout the southern portion of the island , Britannia Prima , he will see the small streams passing almost directly to the ocean , and thus affording evidence of a tolerably rapid fall , and of the absence of marsh and heavily-timbered land : and here , accordingly , we find the commencement of cultivation . As he approaches the valley of the Thames , he may see the marks of population on the high lands bordering it , but in the valley itself he sees little except in the existence of a single town . Passing northward , population is everywhere seen on the flanks of the central ridge , occupying the high grounds at the , heads of the streams , but we look in vain for signs of life in the lower lands : on the banks of the Humber or its tributaries , or on those of the several streams emptying into the Wash . If , now , he inquire for the seats of early cultivation , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to those parts of the kingdom in which men who can neither read nor write , still live in mud-built cottages , and receive nine shillings per week for their labour : and those commons upon which , to so great an extent , cultivation has recommenced. * If he seek the palace of the Norman Kings , he will find it at Winchester , and not in the valley of the Thames . If he ask for the forests and swamps of the days of Richard and of Ivanhoe , he will everywhere be shown cultivated lands of the highest fertility . If he seek the land whose morasses had nearly swallowed up the army of the conquering Norman , on his return from the devastation of the north : that which daunted the antiquary Camden , even so late as the age of James I. : he will be shown South Lancashire , with its rich corn-fields covered with waving grain , and meadow r s on which pasture the finest cattle . If he ask for the land most recently taken into cultivation the newest soils he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late sandy wastes of Norfolk ; where his companion will exhibit to him the marl , yielding the largest and best crops of England : and then perhaps will accompany him on an excursion to Northumberland or Cumberland , counties occupied two centuries since by a population who found plunder more profitable than labour . Southern England possessed the land best fitted for early cultivation and for that reason least fitted for a more advanced state of population and wealth . Peru and Chili stood first on the list , but Brazil will win the - race . Cultivation commenced in upper Brazil , but the banks of the Amazon will give food to a population ten times , and perhaps fifty times , greater . Lower Canada took precedence of Louisiana , but the latter has left her competitor far behind . New England preceded Pennsylvania , but * Such are the lands described by Eden , about fifty years since , as the sorry pastures of geese , hogs , asses , half-grown horses and half-starved cattle , " and existing by thousands of acres , but which wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as rich and as valuable as any lands now in tillage. " /z/ the soil of the latter will , at some future time , enable her to produce food for ten times the number of inhabitants per acre that can be supported from that of Massachusetts or Rhode Island . The highest cultivation will ultimately be found where there exists the greatest variety of soils , and where man is enabled to pass in succession from the poor to the better , and thence to the best : the last resulting from the compounding of new soils by aid of the machinery which constitutes wealth , and which increases most rapidly where there exists the greatest tendency to an increase of population . The variety of soils in the north of England is far greater than in the south , and hence the superiority of the former over the latter : a superiority that will continue to be maintained . If we pass north , into Scotland , and inquire for the ancient seats of cultivation , and the residences of the great chiefs by whom the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find them in the higher regions of the country . If we desire to see what has been styled the granary of Scotland , " we shall be referred to the light and easily cleared and cultivated soils of the Moray Frith . If we ask for the newest soils , we shall be taken to the Lothians , or to the banks of the Tweed , inhabited but a short time since by barbarians , whose greatest pleasure was found in expeditions , for the purpose of plunder , into the adjacent English counties . If we seek the forests and swamps of the days of Mary and Elizabeth , we shall find the finest farms in Scotland . If we ask for the poorest people , we shall be taken to the isles of the west : Mull or Skye : which were occupied when meadow-lands were undrained : or to the Orkneys , deemed in former times so valuable as to be received by the King of Norway in pledge for the payment of a sum of money , far greater , we doubt not , than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included the land itself as well as the right of sovereignty . If we stand on the hills of Sutherland , we see around land that has /z/ been , from time immemorial , cultivated by starving Highlanders ; but if we cast our eyes on the flats below , we see rich crops of turnips growing on soil that was , but a few years since , a waste . Stand where we may : on Arthur 's Seat , or Stirling 's towers ; or on the hills which border the great valley of Scotland : our eyes rest on fertile soils , almost , even when not wholly , undrained and unoccupied , while around may be seen high and dry lands that have been in cultivation for centuries . In the days of Caesar , the most powerful nations of Gaul are seen clustering round the Alps , and occupying the lands that now yield the smallest return to labour . If we seek on the map for the cities with whose names we are most familiar , as connected with the history of France in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis , and of Philip Augustus : Chalons , St. Quentin , Soissons , Rheims , Troyes , Nancy , Orleans , Bourges , Dijon , Vienne , Nismes , Toulouse , or Cahors , once the great centre of the banking operations of France : we shall find them far towards the heads of the rivers on which they stand , or occupying the high grounds between the rivers . If we seek the centres of power at a later period , we may find them in wild and savage Brittany , yet inhabited by a people but little removed from barbarism : at Dijon , at the foot of the Alps : in Auvergne , even yet a " secret and safe asylum of crime , amidst inaccessible rocks and wilds , which natare seems to have designed rather for beasts than men : " * in the Limousin , which gave to the church so many popes that the Limousin cardinals at length were almost enabled to dictate the proceedings of the Conclave , yet is now the poorest part of France : or on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armagnacs , and of crimes almost unparalleled . If we look , at any of these periods , towards the lands further down the slope , we find the tend- /z/ encyto their occupation very small indeed , in regard to any of those forming a part of the kingdom of France : but greatly increasing as we reach Guienne and Normandy , the two provinces in which population and wealth increased most rapidly , by reason of their connection with England , under whose sway their rights were respected to a degree entirely unknown to the other provinces . In these grew up the love of labour and the habit of trade . In the others , the love of plunder and the contempt for all honest industry , common to all men who cultivate the poorest soils . If we look to the state of France at present , we shall see that the poor soils alone are almost universally cultivated . Immense forests : the same in which roamed the hogs raised by the Gauls for the market of Rome : still cover many of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frequently but thrice the seed , because of the extreme imperfection of the machinery used in the work of ploughing and drainage : the poor farmer doing little more than scratch the surface to bring the top-soil into use . France is buying bad land in Algeria , at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of treasure , which , if applied to bringing into activity the best soils of her old lands , now dormant because of the poverty of the people , would perhaps enable her to maintain the position in the world she appears to be so rapidly losing . In that country population increases very slowly , and wealth but little faster , as must be the case always with those who can not clear and drain the better soils , invariably last in being cultivated . The mountains and moors of Limburg and Luxemburg were occupied far in advance of the rich meadows of Holland , and while the fertile soils of Flanders and of Zealand presented to view only salt marshes and sandy wastes . In the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by forests and marshes covering the most fertile lands , but living on islands of sand , and forced to con- /z/ tent themselves with eggs , fish , and very small supplie , of vegetable food of any kind . Their extreme poverty exempted them from the grinding taxation of Rome , and the unceasing vexations of Roman proconsuls , and by slow degrees they grew in numbers and wealth . Unable by means of agriculture to obtain food , they sought it from commerce . With further growth , we see them then extending themselves over the land that could be cultivated , and gradually clearing the woods and draining the marshes , until at length we find a nation the wealthiest in Europe . In this case population and wealth appear to have spread rather upwards than downwards , because they had their origin in commerce and not in agriculture . Here , however , we have further illustration of the fact that men always commence with the poorest soils . Commerce sought a shelter from Roman tyranny in the marshes of Holland , as we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behind the rocks of Amalfi , and the mountains of Liguria . These were the worst commercial soils , but they were those that could alone be cultivated , for they were those in which alone could security of person and property , so necessary to success in commerce , be obtained . In Germany , we see the mass of the early population on the higher part of the eastern slope of the Alps , and as we pass towards the mouths of the rivers it becomes less and less dense , and the low lands are seen to exist more and more in a state of nature . Passing into Italy , we see a numerous population in the high lands of Cisalpine Gaul , at a period when the rich soils of Venetia were unoccupied . As we advance southwards , along the flanks of the Apennines , we find a gradually increasing population , with an increasing tendency to the cultivation of the better soils , and towns whose age may almost be inferred from their situation . Thus Veii and Alba were built when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled a place in Roman history /z/ which was denied to the little place that then occupied the site of modern Pisa . In Greece , we mark the same great and universal fact . The meagre soil of Attica , every foot of which drains itself , was among the earliest fitted for cultivation , and there population and wealth grew rapidly ; while the fat Boeotia , requiring to be cleared and drained , followed slowly in the rear . Passing south , along the Isthmus , we have full in view on the left the short and steep eastern slope of Argolis , long since abandoned as incapable of yielding a return to labour ; yet there stand the ruins of Mycenae , of Tirynth and Troezene , witnesses to the fact that the least fertile soils of Peloponnesus : those which were too dry to require drainage , and too poor to require to be cleared : were first selected for cultivation . On the opposite side of the ridge , the slope is much longer , and the movement of the waters more sluggish . Vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded a larger return to labour had it been accessible ; but here we find precisely the same state of things that was observed in South America , where Peru was so early cultivated , while the great valley remains to this day an impracticable wilderness . On the short , steep , slope of Achaia we find another witness in the State of Sicyon , whose territory was cultivated when the richer lands of Arcadia and Elis , watered by the Alpheeus , were still unoccupied . If , now , we cross the Mediterranean and ascend the Nile , we find cultivation becoming more and more ancient as w r e rise , until at length far towards its head we reach Thebes , the first capital of Egypt . With the growth of population and of wealth , we find the city of Memphis becoming the capital of the kingdom : but still later , the Delta is occupied , and towns and cities rise in places that to the earlier kings were inaccessible , and with every step in this progress , there was increased return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific , we may see innumerable rich islands , whose lower lands are un /z/ occupied , because of their superior richness rendering them dangerous to life , while population clusters round the hills . Farther south , are rich valleys in Australia , uninhabited , or , if inhabited at all , by a people standing lowest in the catalogue of the human race ; while on the little high-pointed islands of the coast , distant but a few miles , are found a superior race , with houses , cultivation , and manufactures . Here we find precisely the facts offered by South America and Argolis . Turning our steps northward , towards India , we meet Ceylon , in the centre of which are found the dominions of the king of Candy , whose subjects have the same aversion to the low and rich lands , unhealthy in their present state , that is felt by the people of Mexico and of Java . Entering India by Cape Comorin , and following the great range of high lands , the back-bone of the peninsula , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while below , near the coast , are seen the European cities of Madras , Calcutta and Bombay , the creation of a very recent day . Intermediate between the two , are seen numerous cities , whose positions , sometimes far away from the banks of the rivers , and at other times near v their sources , show that the most fertile lands have not been those first cultivated . Standing on the high lands between Calcutta and Bombay , we have on the one hand the delta of the Indus , and on the other that of the Ganges . The former remains yet entirely unoccupied . Through hundreds of miles that river rolls its course , almost without a settlement on its banks , while on the higher country , right and left , exists a numerous population . On the Ganges , the first city that we meet , Patna , is distant from its mouth almost five hundred miles . Then follow Benares , Agra , and , at length , far up towards its head , we meet Delhi , the capital of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its native sovereigns . Here , as everywhere else , man avoids the low rich soils that need clearing and drainage , and seeks in the high lands that drain themselves the means of employing his labour in the search for food : /z/ and here , as everywhere else where the top-soil of the dry land alone is cultivated , the return to labour is small ; and hence it is that we find the Hindoo working for a rupee , or perhaps two , per month : sufficient only to give him a handful of rice per day , and to purchase a rag of cotton cloth with which to cover his loins . The most fertile soils exist in unlimited quantity on land that is untouched , and close to that which the labourer scratches with a stick for want of a spade , making his harvest with his hands for want of a reaping hook , and carrying home upon his shoulders the miserable crop , for want of a horse and a cart . We have here precisely the state of things that , were Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet famine and pestilence are frequent , and men rob and murder on the highway , to an extent and with a coolness unknown in any other country ; because of the impossibility of obtaining subsistence by honest industry where land abounds and man is scarce . Passing northward , by Caubul and Afghanistan , and leaving on our left the barren Persia whose weak dry soils have been cultivated through a long series t ) f ages , we attain the Himalaya range , the highest point of the earth 's surface . Looking down , we see immediately around the cradle of the human race , where head the streams that empty into the Frozen Ocean and the Bay of Bengal , the Mediterranean and the Pacific . It is the land , of all others , suited to the purpose : that which will most readily afford to the man who works without a spade or an axe , a small supply of food . Here we are surrounded by man in a state of barbarism : and standing here , we may trace the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive lands , yet compelled in all cases to seek the route that is least disturbed with water courses , and therefore keeping the ridge that divides the waters of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean from those of the Baltic : standing here we may mark them , as they descend the slope , sometimes stopping for the purpose of cultivating the poor land that can , /z/ their indifferent machinery , be made to yield a small supply of food ; and at other times marching on and reaching the neighbourhood of the sea , there to place themselves , not on the rich lands , but on the poor soils of the steep hillside those on which water can not stand to give nourishment to trees , or to afford annoyance to settlers whose means are inadequate to the draining of swamps and marshes : or on little peaked islands , from which the water passes rapidly , as in the case of those of the Egean , cultivated from so early a period . We mark some of these tribes gradually reaching the Mediterranean , where civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of successive waves of emigration , while others are seen passing farther west , and entering Italy , and France , and Spain . Others , more adventurous , reach the British isles . Again , after a rest of a few centuries , we see them crossing the broad Atlantic , and commencing the ascent of the slope of the Allegheny , preparatory to the ascent and passage of the great range that divides the waters of the Pacific from those of the Atlantic ; and in all cases we mark the pioneers , gladly seizing on the clear dry land of the hillsides , in preference to the rich and highly wooded land of the river bottoms . Everywhere we see them , as population gradually increases , descending , equally gradually , the sides of the hills and mountains towards the rich lands at their feet : and everywhere , with the growth of numbers , penetrating the earth to reach the lower soils , to enable them to combine the upper clay , or sand , w r ith the lower marl , or lime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they have been provided by the Deity , a soil capable of yielding a larger return than that upon which they were at first compelled to expend their labours . Everywhere , with increased power of union , we see them exercising increased power over land . Everywhere , as the new soils are brought into activity , and as they are enabled to obtain larger returns , we find more rapid increase of population , producing increased tendency to combination /z/ of exertion , by which the powers of the individual labourer are trebled , quadrupled , and quintupled , and sometimes fiftyfold increased ; enabling him better to provide for his immediate wants , while accumulating more rapidly the machinery by means of which he hopes further to increase his power of production , and to bring to light the vast treasures of nature . Everywhere , we find that with increasing population the supply of food becomes more abundant and regular , and clothing and shelter are obtained with greater ease ; famine and pestilence tend to pass away ; health becomes more universal ; life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and more free . In regard to all the wants of man , except the single and important one of food , such is admitted to be the case . It is seen that with the growth of population and of wealth men obtain water , and iron , and coal , and clothing , and the use of houses , and ships , and roads , in return for less labour than was at first required . It is not doubted that the great work produced at a cost of ten millions , by means of which the Croton river is carried through the city of New York , enables men to obtain water at less cost than was required when each man took a bucket and helped himself on the Hudson 's bank . It is seen that the shaft which has required years to sink , and to discharge the water from which the most powerful engines are required , supplies fuel more cheaply than at first , when the settlers carried home the scraps of half-decomposed timber for want of an axe with which to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain into flour at less cost of labour than was needed when it was pounded between two stones : and that the gigantic factory supplies cloth more cheaply than the little loom : but it is denied that such is the case with food . In regard to every thing else , man commences with the worst machinery and pro- ' ceeds upward towards the best : but in regard to food , and that alone , he commences , according to Mr. Ricardo , with the best and proceeds downward towards the worst : and with every /z/ stage of the progress finds a decreasing return to his labour , threatening starvation and admonishing him against raising children to aid him in his age , lest they should imitate the conduct of the people of India and of the islands of the Pacific , ( where land however is abundant and food should be cheap , ) and bury him alive , or expose him on the river shore , that they may divide among themselves his modicum of food . How far all this is true , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of nature are broad and universally true , and we are disposed to hope that he may now agree with us in believing that there is one law , and one alone , for food , light , air , clothing , and fuel : and that man , in all and every case , commences with the worst machinery and proceeds onward to the best ; thus enabled , with the growth of wealth , population , and the habit of union , to obtain with constantly diminishing labour an increased supply of all the necessaries , conveniences , comforts , and luxuries of life . The second proposition is , that with the increase of population it becomes necessary to resort to soils of inferior fertility , yielding a smaller return to labour . If man begins always with the best soils , then is this proposition true , and with every step in the progress of popula tion , he loses more and more the control over his own artions becoming the victim of an overruling necessity . If , on the contrary , he begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best , every step should be accompanied by increasing power to select such soils as are best suited to his purpose , taking sometimes the light sand , and at others the heavy marl : at one time the clay , and at another the lime : at one time the iron and at another the coal : the hilltop or the river bottom : the near or the distant : the superficial or the profound : as he deems them best calculated to /z/ minister to his wants and those of his family , and to enable him to accumulate the machinery required for exercising still greater power over the materials provided by the Creator for his use , and awaiting his draft . If increasing population produce necessity , the standard of man , physical , moral , intellectual , and political , must fall . If it give him power , the standard must rise , and he must feed better , clothe himself better , lodge better , act better , think better , and exercise in relation to all the actions of his life a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the material world . Which of those two classes of phenomena it is that has been seen to appear , we propose now to examine . In 1760 , the population of England and Wales was 6,479,000 . It is now about 16,000,000 . The total quantity of grain produced in the former period was estimated at 15,349,000 quarters , and the exports exceeded the imports by 400,000 quarters . The whole quantity of land is about 37,000,000 of acres . Of this , a very large portion was unenclosed and uncultivated , so recently as the closing years of the last century . Eden , writing in 1797 , speaks of Great i Britain as a country disfigured and burdened everywhere " with " immeasurable wastes , commons , and heaths , " and resembling " one of those huge unwieldy cloaks worn in Italy and Spain , of which a very small part is serviceable to the wearer , while the rest is not only useless , but cumbersome and oppressive . " He regarded it as containing , " in proportion to its size , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , Russia itself not excepted . " How great must have been the extension of cultivation since the period first named , may be judged from the fact that , independently of all private land that has since been cleared and drained , and manured , and limed , and marled , and thus rendered fit for the production of food , about eight millions of acres of commons and wastes : almost one-fourth of the whole surface : have been enclosed under acts of Parlia- /z/ ment . We suppose it fair to infer that the quantity now in cultivation is , at the lowest calculation , twice as great as at the accession of George III. , in 1760 . With this extension over the surface , there has been a corresponding descent into the bowels of the land , and the lower soils have been to a wonderful extent combined with the superficial ones . The underlying marl of Norfolk and Lincoln has been combined with the sand , and throughout the kingdom lime has been , to an extent not to be estimated , combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cultivation of the iron and coal soils , always among the last to be brought into full activity . The effect of this may be judged from the fact that the same land which in the former period yielded , in addition to " the grain , but about forty tons of straw , now yields the same grain and more than five hundred tons of straw , hay , and turnips , as food for the cattle required to meet the demands of the meat markets of the kingdom : demands thrice exceeding those of the former period . The weight of food , per acre , is considerably more than twice as great as was then obtained , and the number of acres being doubled , we have five times the quantity of food to be distributed , while the population has increased but one hundred and L fifty per cent . To this must , however , be added the vast quantity of animal and vegetable food obtained from Ireland and Scotland , the imports from America and the continent of Europe : the sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea from China : the commerce in all of which existed to a very small extent in 1760 . The weight of these three articles now consumed exceeds 300,000 tons , or 1,200,000 quarters , being nearly one-twelfth part as much as all the grain produced in 1760 , when the export exceeded the import . The amount of food now imported is almost equal to the whole quantity consumed at that period , and this , added to the product of agriculture at home , would give six times the quantity of food , with only two and a half times the population /z/ making the average about two and a half times as much per head for the whole community . The number of families in England and Wales , in 1831 , was 2,900,000 , and of these but 835,000 were engaged in agriculture . The average size of families is about five persons , and this would give about 4,200,000 as the amount of that class of the people . In 1760 , the mass of the population was of that description , and we are disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . If so , the result would be , that while the number of persons employed in agriculture had increased by only onethird , the product had increased five times , and that the return to the labour employed was , per head , almost four times greater than at that period . Such being the case , the new soils must be far better than the old , and the great increase of population , which , according to Mr. Ricardo 's doctrine , should have brought with it increased necessity , has been accompanied by a steadily increasing power to consume the produce of rich meadow-lands that now yield fat beef , where , before , forests and sw r amps gave but the meat of the half-starved ox , or half-fed hog , upon which landlords banqueted when land was abundant : and thereto to add the produce of the soils of China and India , Mexico and Brazil , Cuba and Carolina . Wealth has grown faster than population , and the man of England has become lord of all the soils of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : whereas , when the poor soils alone were cultivated , he took what he could get , and as necessity had no law , the worst bread was then welcome , and a herring at harvest time was a luxury . Nearly three millions of families are to be fed , where in 1760 there were but little over 1,200,000 , and with the exception of the quantity of food imported , the whole is produced by the labour of a number of persons but little greater than was then employed in agriculture , which could not be the case did not the labour employed on the soils since brought into cultivation yield a greatly increased return . That they /z/ do yield such increase is evident from the fact that in 1760 the great mass of labour of the country was required for the production of vegetable food , whereas much of it is now employed in the cultivation of animals that yield hides that are almost equally with food essential to the comfort of man : much in producing the fuel required to keep him warm and preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabrication of clothing , of which such vast quantities are consumed at home : other portions being exchanged for sugar , tea , coffee , rice , cheese , butter , &c.,; which millions have learned to regard as absolute necessaries , though but recently luxuries unattainable even by some who were ranked among the rich . At every step there is an increased consciousness in man of the existence of power to improve his condition , producing increased desire of improvement . Desire produces determination , and determination creates power . At the close of the fourteenth century , the population was probably about two and a half millions . Fertile land abounded , but men cultivated the poor soils , because unable to clear and drain the rich ones . Of this we have evidence in various statements that have come down to us of the actual contents of farms and messuages , some of which are given by Eden . Six of these , of various dates from 1359 to 1400 , contained one thousand one hundred and forty-two acres of arable , and but one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the . husbandman averaged less than a quarter to the acre , and if from this be deducted two bushels for the seed , we have six bushels as the product of labour . The population is now about six and a half times greater , but the number of persons who live by the labours of the field is not three times greater , while the land in cultivation is probably ten times as great ; and the average yield per acre , estimating green crops as beef and mutton , and looking to the vast yield of potatoes and various other articles of vegetable food , is at least six times as great : probably even far more . If this be so , . the return to labour /z/ employed on the soils brought into use since the days of the Edwards , is more than twenty times as great as when good land abounded , and when , according to Mr. Ricardo , none were required for cultivation but those which would yield the largest return . Hence it is that so large a population can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel , clothing , and machinery of every description fitted to promote the comfort and happiness of man . In the good old times " of Ivanhoe and Richard , when fertile land was abundant and people rare , the Saxon hogs roamed the woods , living upon acorns produced from oaks that Cedric lacked the means to fell . Later , half-starved sheep fed upon lands incapable of yielding grain , but cows and oxen were few , because the fine rich meadow was covered with wood and so saturated with moisture as to be inaccessible . Maids of honour then luxuriated on bacon , and labourers banqueted upon " the strength of water-gruel , " as did sixty years since many of the people of those northern counties , * which now present to view the finest farms in England , the rich soils composing which were then awaiting the growth of population and of wealth . A piece of fat pork was , in those days , an article of luxury rarely to be obtained by the labourer . Even within a century , the bread consumed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rye , and oats , the consumption of wheat being limited to the rich ; the quantity produced being small . It is now in universal use , although so recently as 1727 an eight acre field of it , near Edinburgh , was deemed a curiosity . As late as 1763 , there was no such person as a public butcher known in Glasgow . It was the custom of families to buy a half-fed ox in the autumn and salt down the meat as the year 's supply of animal food . The state of things there is an index to that which existed in the Lothians , and in Northumberland and other counties of the north of England , where Eden . 5b MAN AND LAND . may now be seen the most prosperous agriculture of Britain . At that time men cultivated , not the best soils , but those which they could cultivate , leaving the rich ones for their successors : and in this they did what is done now every day by the settlers of Illinois and Wisconsin . While wheaten bread has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acorns , once denominated bread , and which was supposed to afford more nourishment , because it remained longer in the stomach , and was less easily digested : an idea repeated in the present day by the poor Irish peasant , who prefers the miserable potato called the lumper , because it has , as he says , a bone in it : fat mutton and beef have succeeded the salt herring on the table of the artisan and labourer , and the mast-fed bacon on that of the landlord . Within a century the average weight of cattle has risen from three hundred and seventy to eight hundred pounds , and that of sheep from twenty-eight to eighty pounds , and the number consumed has increased more rapidly than the weight . The quantity of wool , of hides , and of other materials for manufactures of various kinds , is immense , and yet the agricultural population is certainly not three times as great as in the days of the Black Prince . The return to labour has therefore largely increased as , with increased numbers , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep or distant to be cultivated with the means at his command , but now required for the supply of the greatly increased and thriving population . Mr. Ricardo 's proposition is diametrically opposed to all the facts presented by the history of the United States : of England : and of the World : whereas the following is in strict accordance therewith : With the increase of population there arises a habit of union , tending to promote the growth of wealth and to facilitate the acquisition of machinery to be used in aid of labour ; and with each step in this progress , man acquires increased power over the materials of which the earth is composed , and increased power to determine for himself which to select /z/ for cultivation , as being most likely to promote the object v of maintaining and improving his condition ; and with every increase of this power he is enabled to obtain a larger return to his labour , and to consume more , while accumulating with still increased rapidity the machinery required for further improvement . The third proposition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thus accompanies the growth of population , rent arises : the owner of land No. 1 , yielding one hundred quarters , being enabled to demand and to obtain in return for its use , ten quarters when resort is had to those of second quality , yielding ninety quarters : and twenty when No. 3 is brought into use , yielding only eighty quarters . / ' Were all land of precisely equal productive power , this necessity could not be supposed to arise ; yet compensation would still be paid for the use of a farm provided with buildings and enclosures , that would be denied to the owner of one which remained in a state of nature . That compensation is regarded by Mr. Ricardo as being only interest upon capital , and to be distinguished from what is paid for the use of the powers of the soil . When lands of different capabilities are in use , and all equally provided with fences , houses , barns , &c.,; he supposes the owner of No. 1 to receive the interest upon his capital , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of yielding , and the ninety , eighty , or seventy quarters that may be yielded by the soil of lowest power that the necessities of man have compelled him to cultivate . This difference he holds to be the true rent . If , however , cultivation always commence on the poorer soils , and proceed from them to the better ones , the reverse course should be pursued ; and the owner of the land first cultivated should receive interest , minus the difference between its powers and those of other lands that may , with the increase of population and wealth , be brought into activity /z/ with the same quantity of labour that had been expended upon it . The first little clearing on the hill side , with its miserable cabin , has cost a thousand days of labour , whereas a meadow of greater extent may now be cleared , and a gctod log-house erected , with half that quantity . If the first settler desire to let his land to his new neighbour , the latter will jjive him not profits plus difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that such is the course of proceeding , and that land obeys the same law r s as all other /commodities and things . The old ship cost a vast amount of labour , but she can carry only five thousand barrels ; whereas a new ship , capable of carrying ten thousand barrels , can be built with half the labour . The owner of the first receives , as freight , profits minus the difference . The old house cost the labour of ten thousand days , but it will accommodate only ten persons . A new one , capable of affording better accommodation to twenty , can be produced with five thousand days of labour . The owner of the first will receive , as rent , profits minus the difference . And so is it with early steam-engines , railroads , mills , and all other machines . The price of land is more or less in proportion to the rent that is paid . If the doctrine of Mr. Ricardo is true , the selling price should be the capital invested , plus the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man always commences with the poor soils , and proceeds onward towards the better ones , the price should be the capital , minus the difference between its power of paying rent and that of other land which could Hoe brought into cultivation by aid of the same capital . If his doctrine is true , the power of the land and its representative over man , increases as population and the necessities of man increase : but if it is not true : if man commences always with the poor soils , and proceeds onwards to the richer ones : then must the power of man over land and its representative always increase ; and then must he be enabled to obtain , at every step , land of equal powers with diminished labour ; and then must those heretofore cultivated tend steadily towards /z/ diminution in their labour value . That such is the fact , we propose now to show . The whole land rental of England and Wales is about thirty millions , which , at twenty-five years ' purchase , represents a capital of seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics average about .50 per annum . The landed property of England and Wales thus represents the labour of fifteen millions of men for one year , or that of half a million of men for thirty years . Let us now suppose the island reduced to the state in which it was found by Caesar ; covered with impenetrable woods , ( the timber of which is of no value because of its superabundance , ) abounding in marshes and swamps , and heaths and sandy wastes ; and then estimate the quantity of labour that would berequired to place it in its present position , with its lands cleared , levelled , enclosed , and drained ; with its turnpikes and railroads , its churches , school-houses , colleges , courthouses , and market-houses ; its furnaces , forges , coal , iron , and copper mines ; and the thousands and tens of thousands of other improvements required to bring into activity those powers for the use of which rent is paid , and it will be found that it would require the labour of treble the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machinery of modern times the best axe and the best plough , the steam-engine , and the railroad car. * The same thing may now be exhibited on a smaller scale . A part of South Lancashire , the forest and chase of Rossendale , embracing an area of twenty-four square miles , contained eighty souls at the beginning of the sixteenth century ; and the rental , in the time of James I. , little more than two cen- * Those who reflect for a moment on the many hundreds , or rather thou sands of millions , that have been expended in fencing , draining , manuring , and otherwise improving , the land of Great Britain , and in the erection of farm buildings , must be satisfied that the return for this capital , though miserably inadequate , very greatly exceeds the other portion of the gross rental of the kingdom . " McCulloch . Such being the case , it might have been obvious that all rent was paid for the use of these improvements , and that there really was no other portion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .122 13 8 . It has now a population of eighty-one thousand ; and the annual rental is .50,000 , equivalent , at twenty-five years ' purchase , to 1 , 250,000 . We have never seen this land , but we have no hesitation in saying that if it were now given to Baron Rothschild , in the state in which it existed in the days of James , with a bounty equal to its value ; on condition of doing with the timber the same that has been done with that which then stood there , he binding himself to give to the property the same advantages as those for which rent is now paid , his private fortune would be expended in addition to the bounty long before the work was completed . The amount received as rent is profit upon capital , and is interest upon the amount expended , minus the difference between the power of Rossendale to yield a return to labour , and that of the newer soils that can now be brought into activity by the application of the same labour that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with the rents of London and Paris , New York and New Orleans . With all their advantages of situation , their selling prices represent but a small portion of what it would cost to reproduce them , were their sites again reduced to a state of nature . The power of man over mere brute wealth thus grows with every increase in the ratio of wealth to population . There is not , throughout the United States , a county , township , town , or city , that would sell for cost ; or one whose rents are equal to the interest upon the labour and capital expended . Every one is familiar with the fact that farms sell for little more than the value of the improvements . When we come to inquire what " improvements " are included in this estimate , we find that the heaviest are omitted ; that nothing is put down for clearing and draining the land , for the roads that have been made , the court-house and the prison that have been built , with the taxes that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been built /z/ by subscription ; for the canal that passes through a piece of fine meadow-land , the contribution of the owner to the great work ; or for a thousand other conveniences and advantages that give value to the property , and induce men to feel willing to payment for its use . Were all these things estimated , it would be found that the price is cost , minus a large difference . The great landholder of the world is the People of the United States , as represented by their Government . He obtains his land at a price that is apparently very low , yet he would be ruined were it not for his exemption from contributions . Population gradually approaches his limits . Canals and roads are made to or through them . By degrees a portion acquires the small value of $1-25 , the minimum price , per acre . Settlers make new roads , and build churches and school-houses . He pays no taxes , but they do . Another section reaches the minimum price , and he sells it . Population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more churches and school-houses are built , but still he pays no taxes for these purposes . At length the whole is sold ; and when he comes to foot up the account , he finds that by omitting many of the heaviest items of cost those attendant upon affording protection to the settlers until they were able to protect themselves a small profit is made to appear . ' The price that is paid for land represents a portion , and often a very small portion , of its cost . Labour is frequently thrown away upon it , because it does not consist of the peculiar kind of soil that is needed at the moment . The settler that begins with clearing swamps , throws away his labour and dies of fever , unless he prevent that occurrence by running away . The land is rich , but its time is not come . The man who sinks into granite , searching for coal , throws away his labour . The land will be valuable when granite quarries come to be wanted , but its time is not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rich meadow land yet uncleared , throws away his time . The /z/ land is rich , but its time is not come . All soils have qualities tending to render them useful to man , and all are destined to come into activity ; but it is the decree of nature that the best soils those most fitted to yield a large return to labour shall be obtained for his use only at the price of labour ; and their attainment is the reward held out to him as the inducement to steady exertion , prudence , economy , and a constant observance of the great law of Christianity , which requires that every man shall respect in others those rights of person and property that he desires others to respect in himself . Where these exist , he is seen passing steadily and regularly from poor soils to those which are more productive ; and with every step there is an increase of population , wealth , prosperity , and happiness . The last historian of the world , prior to its dissolution , will have , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron said of the skies of Italy : " Parting day Dies like the dolphin , whom each pang imbues . With a new colour as it gasps away , The last still loveliest , till ' t is gone and all is gray . " Rent is paid for the use of the improvements which labour " has accomplished for , or on , land , and which constitute items of wealth . Wealth tends to augment with population , and the power of accumulating further wealth increases with constantly accelerating pace as new soils are brought into cultivation , each yielding in succession a larger return to labour . Rent tends , therefore , to increase in amount with the growth of wealth and population . It is greatest in England , the wealthiest country of Europe . It diminishes as we pass thence to the poorer countries of France , Germany , Italy , and Spain , and at length disappears totally among the Rocky Mountains and the Islands of the Pacific . The fourth proposition is , that as with the increase of population recourse is necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labour , the proportion of the land-owner tends to increase . If cultivation begins with the rich soils and proceedstothe poor ones , the power of the man who represents land , over its products , must always increase , and he must take a larger proportion , attended with increasing inequality of condition ; but if , on the contrary , it always begins with the poor soils and proceedstothe rich ones , then must the power of man over land and its representative always increase , he being enabled to demand a constantly increasing proportion , leaving to the representative of land a constantly diminishing one ; and thus with each step in the progress of cultivation there must be an increasing tendency to equality of condition . It was observed , half a century since , that the proportion of the landlord was decreasing . Mr. Malthus admitted the fact , and regarded it as a proof that there was increased difficulty in obtaining food . The common impression , however , was , that men lived better than in olden times ; that now they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee ; whereas , in times long past , they were obliged to be contented with barley , rye , and acorn bread . To prove that this was not the fact , Mr. Malthus asserted that whereas in the latter half of the fifteenth century the labourer could have one hundred and ninety-two pints of wheat as wages for a week , he then 1810 could have but eighty pints . Since then another writer has gone still further , and has asserted that in 1495 he could have one hundred and ninetynine pints , or more than three bushels , for that amount of labour . What were the precise annual wages of a labourer at that moment we have no means of ascertaining ; but the change from century to century was very slow , and we shall not err very greatly in taking those of the last years of the previous one . In 1389 , a plough driver had 7s. , and a carter 10s. per annum , without clothing , or any other perquisite ; and it /z/ is esteemed doubtful if , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On an average of years these wages would command not more than a quarter of wheat , or eight bushels , and yet are we told that a labourer could earn three bushels per week ! In the same year , four hundred and fifty days ' ' labour were required for the harvesting of the produce of two hundred acres of land ; and the average net yield was about six bushels per acre : in the whole , twelve hundred bushels , or two and two-third bushels harvested for each day 's work . The week 's return , at same rate , would be sixteen bushels , of which almost exactly one-fifth is allowed as the wages of every week in the year . Of the people who worked nearly all were employed in agriculture , and very few in manufactures or trade . Had all been so employed , with precisely similar returns and similar wages , it would follow that five weeks ' wages would be equal to the whole annual crop ; and such statements are put forth gravely by writers who know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds , leaving but one-third for the labourer . The harvest labourer of the present day receives probably one-fortieth of the quantity harvested . He has work all the year , and harvest wages do not differ very greatly from those of other days ; but in the fifteenth century employment during the year was rare , and those wages constituted an important portion of the year 's revenue ; as we see to be even now the case with the labourers of Ireland . Increased wealth facilitates the distribution of employment throughout all seasons of the year , and thus increases greatly the productiveness of labour . / The proportion of the landlord w r as supposed by Mr. Malthus , at the time he wrote , to be about one-fourth of the whole product . Recently Mr. McCulloch has reduced it to one-fifth ; although , during the period that has elapsed , the quantity of labour and capital applied to the cultivation of new soils has been prodigiously great , and the proportion /z/ should have increased , there being more capital to draw inte- / rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the best soils , and man is compelled , as population increases , to descend to those yielding a less and less return to labour , the proportion of the landlord must increase . He must take profits , plus a constantly increasing difference ; and he must ultimately absorb the whole product , except so far as he may find it to his interest to give something to his slave to keep him alive . If , however , cultivation always commences on the poor soils , and man proceeds , as population and wealth increase , always to the better soils , then the reverse must happen , and the landlord must have profits minus the difference , giving him a constantly decreasing proportion , and leaving to the labourer a constantly increasing one . In the one case the power of the land and its representative over the product must increase , and that of the labourer must diminish . In the other , the power of the labourer must rise , and that of the land must fall . That the latter does fall , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The English landlord 's proportion , formerly two-thirds , or more , was , in the days of Mr. Malthus , one-fourth ; in those of Mr. McCulloch , one-fifth ; and if population and wealth be permitted to increase , the day is not far distant when it will be one-tenth , or less , while the amount will be greater than now . If we look to other parts of the world , we shall see abundant evidence of this . In Prussia , forty years since , it was assumed that the peasant who retained one-third of the product had a decent subsistence . In France , where population and wealth grow very slowly , the proportion of the landlord is much greater than in England , and probably greater than in Prussia . In Spain and Sicily it is greater than in France . In Mexico it is greater than it is in Sicily . In India , greater than in Mexico . In all these countries the most fertile soils abound , uncultivated ; and men scratch the surface , obtaining from the superior soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever the time shall come when the rulers of their destinies shall permit population and wealth to increase and they can not be separated the more fertile soils will be cultivated , the return to labour and the amount of rent will both be increased , and the landlord 's proportion will be diminished . In the time of the Plantagenets , the owner of land took the whole product , and gave what he pleased to his serf . From that day to the present , as population and wealth have increased , the labourer has obtained a constantly increasing control over the application of his labour , and over the distribution of the commodities that he produces ; the result of which is that the labourer of England , where the various soils , superior and inferior , are cultivated to an extent elsewhere unknown , receives for his own use a larger proportion , and thus exercises more power over the product of his labour , than the labourer of any other portion of Europe . At no period has his proportion increased so rapidly as within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before unexampled ; and in no part of England is his proportion so great as in that in which population has most rapidly increased ; yet it is precisely there that the lower soils have been to the greatest extent brought into cultivation . How these facts are to be reconciled to the fashionable doctrine of rent , it is difficult to conceive . Seeing them , it is not extraordinary that one of the earliest and most enthusiastic admirers of Mr. Ricardo should have found occasion recently to reproach him with having furnished no explanation of these " miracles . " The real miracle , " however , appears to us to be the fact that such a doctrine should have obtained so extensively , and should have so long continued to obtain . Wealth tends to grow more rapidly than population , because better soils are brought into cultivation ; and it does grow more rapidly , whenever people abandon swords and muskets and take to spades and ploughs . Every increase in the ratio of wealth to population is attended with an in- /z/ crease in the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other capital . We all see that when ships areJ more abundant than passengers , the price of passage is low and vice versa . When ploughs and horses are more plenty than ploughmen , the latter fix the wages , but when ploughmen are more abundant than ploughs , the owners of the latter determine the distribution of the product of labour . When wealth increases rapidly , new soils are brought into cultivation , and more ploughmen are wanted . The demand for ploughs produces a demand for more men to mine coal and smelt iron ore , and the iron-master becomes a competitor for the employment of the labourer , who obtains a larger proportion of the constantly increasing return to labour . He wants clothes in greater abundance , and the manufacturer becomes a competitor with the iron-master and the farmer for his services . His proportion is again increased , and he wants sugar , and tea , and coffee , and now the ship-master competes with the manufacturer , the iron-master and the farmer : and thus with the growth of population and wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its increased productiveness , and the consequently increased facility of accumulating wealth are followed necessarily and certainly by an increase of the labourer 's proportion . His wages rise , and the proportion of the capitalist falls , yet now the latter accumulates fortune more rapidly than ever , and thus his interest and that of the labourer are in perfect harmony with each other . If we desire evidence of this , it is shown in the constantly increasing amount of the rental of England , derived from the appropriation of a constantly decreasing proportion of the product of the land : and in the enormous amount of railroad tolls compared with those of the turnpike : yet the railroad transports the farmer 's wheat to market , and brings back sugar and coffee , taking not onefourth as large a proportion for doing the business as was claimed by the owner of the wagon and horses , and him of the turnpike . The labourer 's product is increased , and the /z/ proportion that goes to the capitalist is decreased . The power of the first over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter has diminished . Nothing is more frequent than references to those " good old times , " when the labourer obtained food more readily than at present , but no idea can be more erroneous . The whole quantity of food at this time consumed in England is at the lowest estimate sixty times as great as in the days of Edward III. , while the population is but little more than six times greater . Divided among the whole people , the average per head would be ten times as great , in quantity , with out taking into account the difference of quality . In those days of barbarous wassail , the waste among the nobles and their followers was prodigiously great . In our day economy prevails everywhere , arid it prevails necessarily , for as the standard of living rises with the increase of production , the proportion that falls to the land , or to capital in any other form , tends to decrease . Increase of wealth tends therefore to beget economy , and economy begets wealth ; and the more fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labourer , and the greater the necessity for economy on the part of those who represent landed or other capital , and who do not themselves work . The proportion now consumed by the wealthy and their attendants by those who consume and do not produce is very small compared with what it was in those " good old times , " and therefore the proportion going to the labourer is very large , while the quantity to be divided is so greatly increased . The great mass of the present large product goes directly to the tables of those who work , while a very small proportion of it is prepared for the tables of those who do not work , and even of that a large portion is eaten at last by people whose position in society renders employment desirable . The Queen eats less in weight than the man who mines the coal that is used in her palace . Lord John Russell consumes less than any London /z/ porter , and Sir Robert Peel is , we doubt not , outdone by most of his servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , nine-tenths are eaten by the labouring class . If any be disposed to deny that this view is correct , let them endeavour to satisfy themselves what else becomes of it . That the whole is eaten is certain . That the class who do not labour is small , and that they can not consume much more , per head , than others , are equally certain ; and if so , it must be obvious that the proportion which their consumption bears to the quantity consumed must be very small indeed ; and equally so that what they do not eat must be eaten by the great class who do labour . Such is likewise the case with clothing . The quantity " " " ! consumed is thousands of times greater than it was at the period to which we have referred , and it is chiefly consumed by the class who work . Ladies and gentlemen buy more than colliers and farm-labourers , but they do not wear out as much . They change frequently , but their cast-off clothesJ pass from hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In no part of Europe is the mass of rent , or of profits of capital employed otherwise than on land , so great as there : yet in none do the people who pay that rent , or those profits those who work enjoy so large an amount of the conveniences , comforts , and enjoyments of life . In none is there so great a tendency to an increase of the labourer 's proportion , of his power over the product of his labour , while in none is the quantity to be divided so great . In none , therefore , is there so great a tendency to elevation and equality of physical , moral , intellectual and political condition , because in none do wealth and population grow so rapidly , facilitating the cultivation of the lower and more productive soils . In no time past has there been so rapid an increase as now . Never has the tendency to cultivate those soils been so great , and yet never has the product of labour increased in so great a ratio : and never has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of Mr. Ricardo true , such " miracles " could not happen . The following table of the results of the two systems may be compared by the reader with what is now passing before his eyes , and he may then determine for himself which is most in accordance with the facts . /z/ qwq The fifth proposition is , that wealth tends to counteract these laws , and to prevent the necessity for resorting to less productive soils , by producing improvements in cultivation . This proposition was interpolated by Mr. Ricardo into his system , because of the absolute necessity for leaving a place of escape for some of the thousand exceptions to his laws that presented themselves to his consideration , and its presence there is a direct admission of the unsoundness of his whole doctrine . Wealth should grow , according to Mr. Ricardo , most rapidly when and where land is most abundant , and when and where the best soils only are cultivated . That his followers think so , is obvious from the fact that they , one and all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the abundance of land . Improvements of cultivation should , then , be most rapid where land is most abundant , but such /z/ has not been the case in England , nor is it now in any country of Europe . On the contrary , wealth grows more rapidly at this moment , when resort is daily had to the lower and more distant soils , than it has done in any time past , and the only manner in which it promotes improvements in cultivation is in facilitating the resort to those soils . The plough enables the farmer to go deep into the lower soil . The spade enables him to reach the marl . The wagon enables him to transport it . The railroad enables him to bring the coal to the lime , and thus facilitates the compounding of a new soil : and with each new one thus brought into activity the produce of labour and the growth of wealth should diminish , and therewith we ought to see a diminished power of effecting such improvements ; yet with every extension of cultivation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase . The new soils are better than the old ones , or they are worse . If the first , Mr. Ricardo 's theory is false . If the second , then with every soil that is cultivated , the power of accumulation must diminish , and as population still goes on to increase , the necessity for applying labour with diminished return must go on , let man do what he may to prevent it . The law of nature in regard to the production of food can no more be arrested than that in relation to the gravitation of matter . All her laws are simple and universally true . That of Mr. Ricardo is complex and universally false . Had it been otherwise , he would have experienced no necessity for providing escape-valves for troublesome facts . The sixth and last proposition is , that every such improvement tends to retard the increase of rent , while every obstacle to improvement tends to accelerate that increase ; and that , therefore , the interests of the landlord and the labourer are always in opposition to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile /z/ soils , and if with the progress of population there does arise a necessity for resorting to those of less fertility , yielding a constantly decreasing return to labour , such must be the case . The slower the increase in the supply of food , the more rapid will be the increase in the power of the owner of land in cultivation , and the greater will be the tendency to starvation and disease among those who work. * The landlord will take a constantly increasing proportion , and the labourer must eventually become his slave , thankful to be allowed to live and work , even although compelled to live on acorn-bread . Mr. Ricardo has , here , carried out his doctrine to its legitimate results , and those results must be reached at some future day , if his theory is correct . It signifies nothing to say that the downward progress may be arrested . Man must be always tending in that direction , and there must he arrive at last : even if it be a thousand years hence . f The experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that of America for the last three centuries , would lead us to opposite conclusions , but Mr. Ricardo says that such is the law . If so , when is it to begin to become operative ? We know of no other of the natural laws thus hung up in terrorem over man : none , the action of which is thus suspended , in order that it may at some future time fall with a force increased immeasurably during the period of suspension . Population is growing daily , and with great rapidity , and the necessity for resorting to less productive soils must be increasing with every hour ; yet man is permitted to go on to increase his species , in blind and blissful ignorance of the fact that his children , grandchildren , or great grandchildren * " How slow soever the increase of population , provided that of capital be still slower , believed by Mr. Mill to be the case , wages will be reduced so low that a portion of the population will regularly die from the consequences of want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and permanent causes , the increasing sterility of the soil is sure , in the long run , to overmatch the improvements that occur in machinery and agriculture , prices experiencing a corresponding rise , and profits a corresponding fall . " McCulloch. /z/ must inevitably see themselves deprived of the means of subsistence , while owners of land are to revel in abundance greater than ever before : the one class becoming masters and the other slaves . If , on the contrary , cultivation commences invariably on the poorer soils and proceeds to the better , the reverse must be the case , and every improvement must tend to accelerate the growth of rent ; and every obstacle to improvement , be it what it may , must tend to arrest that growth ; and therefore must the interests of the landlord and those of the labourer be in perfect harmony with each other . Improvement of cultivation results from the increase of wealth . The more spades and ploughs , and the better their quality , the larger is the return to labour , and the greater is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger is the return to labour , and the greater is the rent . The more steam-engines , the easier is the work of drainage , the larger is the return to labour , and the greater is the rent . The more mills , the easier is the conversion of the grain into flour , the larger is the return to labour , and the greater is the rent . The more factories , the less is the labour required to procure a supply of clothing , the greater is the quantity that may be given to improving the land by making drains , roads , bridges and school-houses , the larger is the return to labour , and the greater is the rent . The interests of the landlord would seem therefore to be directly promoted by every measure that tends to augment the wealth of the nation and to aid in the improvement of cultivation . How stands it with the labourer ? He sees that with every increase in the number and quality of spades and ploughs : of engines and roads : of mills and factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees that with every increase in the ratio which spades and ploughs , engines and mills , bear to the men by whom they are to be employed , he takes a larger proportion ; and that whereas , when the land in cultivation yielded a net product of six bushels to the acre , the owner took half , br more , leaving him three , 01 less ; /z/ now when it yields forty bushels , he takes but one-fifth , leaving him thirty-two . He feels , therefore , at every instant of his progress , that his interests are , like those of the landlord , directly advanced by every measure tending to the augmentation of wealth , and to the promotion of improvements in cultivation . Here we have perfect harmony of interests , and it is only necessary that the two parties should fully understand that it exists , to have all unite in the removal of restrictions that tend to expel capital by rendering it unproductive ; and to expel labour , to be employed elsewhere less productively than it might be employed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kindness and good feeling would take the place of jealousy and discopd . The few would no longer believe that their interests were to be promoted by the waste of wealth on large fleets and armies ; and the many would cease to feel that they were borne down by taxes . Wealth would increase more rapidly , as would the power of production and consumption . Neighbouring nations would be unwilling to lose rich customers , and equally unwilling to be deprived of their accustomed supplies of commodities needed for the gratification of their wants , and would carefully avoid all cause of hostility . The harmony of classes would thus beget the harmony of nations . The love of peace would diffuse itself throughout the earth . All would become satisfied that in the laws which govern the relations of man with his fellow man , there reigns the same beautiful simplicity and harmony everywhere else so abundantly evident : all by degrees would learn that their own interests would be best promoted by respecting in others those rights of person and property that they desired to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfied that the whole of the socalled Science of Political Economy is embraced in the brief words of the great founder of Christianity , " Do unto otrs as ye would that others should do unto you . " Mr. Ricardo 's system is one of discords . Its parts do not /z/ agree with each other , and its whole tends to the production of hostility among classes and nations . ' He professes free trade , while teaching that the monopoly of land is in accordance with the laws of nature . He professes a love for freedom of action , while teaching that if men and women will unite themselves together in marriage , thus doing that which tends most to stimulate them to exertion for the improvement of their condition , physical , moral , intellectual , and political , the consequence must be an increasing tendency to starvation : and thus he affords countenance to the thousand restrictions by which marriage is prevented and profligacy promoted . He is for free trade in corn , but he teaches the landlord that his interests will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth , but he informs the landlord that all wealth appropriated to the improvement of cultivation must diminish the progress of rent . He would have the rights of property respected , while teaching the labourer that the interests of the land-owner are to be promoted by every measure tending to produce starvation and misery ; and that rent is paid because of an exercise of power on the part of the few , who have appropriated to themselves that which a beneficent Deity intended for the common good of all . His book is the true manual of the demagogue , who seeks power by means of agrarianism , war , and plunder The lessons which it teaches are inconsistent with those afforded by the study of all well observed facts , and inconsistent even with themselves ; and the sooner they shall come to be discarded the better will it be for the interests of landlord and tenant , manufacturer and mechanic , and mankind at large . The PAST says to the landlord of the PRESENT : Study economy , private and public . Give your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands . Permit wealth to grow , and your rents will rise , while you will be surrounded by happy and prosperous people . You will lose in power , but you will gain in happiness . " v /z/ To the labourer it says : Economize your time , your labour , and their proceeds . Improve your mind . Study to promote the growth of wealth , and your labour will become more productive , while your power over its product will increase , and you will experience a steady improvement in your physical , moral , intellectual , and political condition . " To all it says : " Respect the rights of your neighbour , as you would desire that he should respect your own . " To all it says : " I have sinned . I have failed to respect the rights of others , and I have suffered heavily in consequence . Take warning by my example . " /z/ MAN commences by cultivating the poor soils . He works alone , and his labour is unproductive . As his numbers increase he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-men , and to subdue to cultivation the better soils , obtaining a constantly increasing return to his labour ; enabling him , while consuming more and better food , to accumulate more rapidly the machinery required to facilitate his further progress . The prevailing doctrine of the time is that of Mr. Malthus , ' who teaches I. That population tends to increase with great rapidity . II . That the tendency to increase in the supply of food is less than in the numbers of mankind . III . That with every step in the progress of population there is a tendency to starvation . IV . That improvements in cultivation may increase pioduction , but that they are invariably followed by a still more rapid increase of population , neutralizing their effect by compelling a resort to less productive soils . V. That the remedies provided by nature for preventing this excess of population over food , are war , pestilence , famine , vice , and misery , to be avoided only by the exercise of that moral restraint which shall tend to diminish the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world will be so fully occupied that there will not be even standing room , but we may safely leave that distant future to the benevolent care of the Deity . We know well that there is now , and always has been , an abundance of unoccupied land ; and the question to /z/ be settled is : What are the phenomena which in time past have attended the increase of mankind up to the present point : with a view to determine what are those which may be expected to mark the further progress of our race towards the occupation of that almost infinite extent of soil capable of yielding food , which in both old and new countries yet remains unoccupied and unproductive . Mr. Malthus thought he saw that they were such as indicated a constant effort in the population to increase beyond the means of subsistence , " as constantly tending " to subject the lower classes of society to distress , and to prevent any great permanent melioration of their condition ; " and this effort appeared to him quite as obviously to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square mile , as in those in which it amounted to a hundred . Of course his theory refers , not to the state of things which may be supposed to arise when the whole earth shall come to be occupied , but to that which now exists and has existed for centuries past . In support of these views his book furnishes an infinite number of small facts , while the great and really important ones are totally overlooked . His work throughout wants breadth . His theory is , nevertheless , perfectly sound , if men commence the work of cultivation with the rich soils , and proceed downwards to the poor ones . If , however , they always commence with the thin , dry soils , and always proceed onward to the rich ones , then the reverse thereof must be true , and food must tend to increase faster than population , permitting wealth to increase , and combination of action to arise as men are enabled to live in closer connection with each other . The first cultivator can neither roll nor raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes himself a hole in the ground , which serves in lieu of one . He cultivates the poor soil of the hills to obtain a little corn , with which to eke out the supply of food derived from snaring the game in his neighbourhood . His winter 's supply is deposited in another hole , liable to injury from the water which filters /z/ through the light soil into which alone he can penetrate. * He is in hourly danger of starvation . At length , however , his sons grow up . They combine their exertions with his , and now obtain something like an axe and a spade . They can sink deeper into the soil ; and can cut logs , and build something like a house . They obtain more corn and more game , and they can preserve it better . The danger of starvation is diminished . Being no longer forced to depend for fuel upon the decayed wood which alone their father could use , they are in less danger of perishing from cold in the elevated ground which , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family new soils are cultivated , each in succession yielding a larger return to labour , and they obtain a constantly increasing supply of the necessaries of life from a surface diminishing in its ratio to the number to be fed ; and thus with every increase in the return to their labour the power of combining their exertions is increased . If we look now to the solitary settler of the west , even where provided with both axe and spade , w r e shall see him obtaining , with extreme difficulty , the commonest log hut . A neighbour arrives , and their combined efforts produce a new house with less than half the labour required for the first . That neighbour brings a horse , and he makes something like a cart . The product of their labour is now ten times greater than was that of the first man working by himself . More neighbours come , and new houses are wanted . A bee " is made , and by the combined effort of the neighbourhood the third house is completed in a day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of far more severe exertion . These new neighbours have brought ploughs and horses , and now better soils are cultivated , and the product of labour is again increased , as is the power to preserve the surplus for winter 's use . The path becomes a road . Ex- /z/ changes begin . The store makes its appearance . Labour is rewarded by larger returns , because aided by better machinery applied to better soils . The town grows up . Each successive addition to the population brings a consumer and a producer . The shoemaker wants leather and corn in exchange for his shoes . The blacksmith requires fuel and food , and the farmer wants shoes for his horses ; and with the increasing facility of exchange more labour is applied to production , and the reward of labour rises , producing new wants , and requiring more and larger exchanges . The road becomes a turnpike , and the wagon and horses are seen upon it . The town becomes a city , and better soils are cultivated . for the supply of its markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more distant . The tendency to union and to combination of exertion thus grows with the growth of wealth . In a state of extreme poverty it can not be developed . The insignificant tribe of savages that starves on the product of the upper soil of hundreds of thousands of acres of land , looks with jealous eyes on every intruder , knowing that each new mouth requiring to be fed tends to increase the difficulty of obtaining subsistence ; whereas the farmer rejoices in the arrival of the blacksmith and the shoemaker , because they come to eat on the spot the corn which heretofore he has carried ten , twenty , or thirty miles to market , to exchange for shoes for himself and his horses . With each new consumer of his products that arrives he is enabled more and more to concentrate his action and his thoughts upon his home , while each new arrival tends to increase his power of consuming commodities brought from a distance , because it tends to diminish his necessity for seeking at a distance a market for the produce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the knowledge how to use them , and the power of association will begin . The supply of food becoming more abundant , they hail the arrival of the stranger who brings them knives and clothing to be ex- /z/ changed for skins and corn ; wealth grows , and the habit of association the first step towards civilization arises . The little tribe is , however , compelled to occupy the highland . The lowlands are occupied by dense forests and dreary swamps , while at the foot of the hill runs a river , fordable but for a certain period of the year . On the hill side , distant a few miles , is another tribe ; but communication between them is difficult , because , the river bottom being yet uncleared , roads can not be made , and bridges are as yet unthought of . Population and wealth , however , continue to increase , and the lowlands come gradually into cultivation , yielding a larger return to labour , and enabling the tribe to obtain larger supplies of food with less exertion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roads are made in the direction of the river bank . Population increases more rapidly because of the increased supplies of food and the increased power of preserving it , and wealth grows still more rapidly . The river bank at length is reached , and some of the best lands are now cleared . Population grows again , and a new element of wealth is seen in the form of a bridge , and now the two little communities are enabled to communicate more freely with each other . One rejoices in the possession of a wheelwright , while the other has a windmill . One wants carts , and the other has corn to grind . One has hides to spare , while the other has more shoes than are required for their use . Exchanges increase , and the little towns grow because of the increased amount of trade . Wealth grows still more rapidly , because of new modes of combining labour , by w y hich that of all is rendered more productive . Roads are now made in the direction of other communities ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two are now combined , and because the machinery used is more efficient . One after another disappear forests and swamps that have occupied the fertile lands , separating ten , twenty , fifty , or five hundred communities , which now are brought into connection with each /z/ other ; and with each step labour becomes more and more productive , and is rewarded with better food , clothing , and shelter . Famine and disease disappear ; life is prolonged ; population is increased , and therewith the tendency to that combination of exertion among the individuals composing these communities , which is the distinguishing characteristic of civilization in all periods of the world , and in all nations . With further increase of population and wealth , the desires of man , and his ability to gratify them , both increase . The nation , thus formed , has more corn than it wants ; but it has no cotton , and its supply of wool is insufficient . The neighbouring nation has cotton and wool , and wants com . They are still divided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid rivers . Population increases , and the great forests and swamps disappear , giving place to rich farms , through which broad roads are made , with immense bridges , which enable the merchant to transport his wool and his cotton to exchange with his now rich neighbours for their surplus corn or clothing . Nations now combine their exertions , and wealth grows with still increased rapidity , facilitating the drainage of marshes and thus bringing into activity the richest soils ; while coal mines cheaply furnish the fuel for converting limestone into lime , and iron ore into axes and spades , and into rails for the new roads that are needed to transport to market the vast products of the fertile soils now in use , and to bring back the large supplies of clothing , sugar , tea , coffee , and the thousand other products of distant lands with which intercourse now exists . At each step population and wealth , and happiness and prosperity , take a new bound ; and men realize with difficulty the fact that the country which now affords to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and luxuries of life , is the same that , when the superabundant land was occupied by tens of thousands only , gave to that limited number scanty supplies of the worst food : so scanty that famines were frequent and sometimes so severe that starvation was followed in its wake by pestilence , /z/ which , at brief intervals , swept from the earth the population of the little and scattered settlements , among which the people were forced to divide themselves when they cultivated only the poor soils of the hills . Such is the course of events , when man is allowed to follow the bent of his inclinations , which , however , he rarely is . When men are poor , they are compelled to select such soils as they can cultivate , not such as they would . Although gathered around the sides of the same mountain range , they are far distant from each other . They have no roads , and they are unable to associate for self-defence . The thin soils yield small returns , and the little tribe embraces some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than by their own . The scattered people may be plundered with ease , and half a dozen men , combined for the purpose , may rob in succession all the members of the little community . The opportunity makes the robber . The boldest and most determined becomes the leader of the gang . One by one , the people who use spades are plundered b'y those who carry swords , and who pass their leisure in dissipation . The leader divides the spoil , taking the largest share himself , with which , as the community increases , he hires more followers . He levies black mail on those who work , taking such portion as suits his good pleasure . With the gradual increase of the little community , he commutes with them for a certain share of their produce , which he calls rent , or tax , or faille . Population and wealth grow very slowly , because of the large proportion which the non-labourers bear to the labourers . The good soils are very slowly improved , because the people are unable to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make roads into the dense forests . Few want leather , and there is no tanner on the spot to use their hides . Few can afford shoes , and there is no shoemaker to eat their corn while making the few that can be bought . Few have horses , and there is no blacksmith . ComHnation of effort has scarcely an existence . By /z/ very slow degrees , however , they are enabled to reduce to cultivation better lands , and to lessen the distance between themselves and the neighbouring settlement , where rules another little sovereign . Each chief , however , now covets the power of taxing , or collecting rents from the subjects of his neighbour . War ensues . Each seeks plunder , and calls it " glory . " Each invades the domain of the other , and each endeavours to weaken his opponent by murdering his rent-payers , burning their houses , and wasting their little farms , while manifesting the utmost courtesy to the chief himself . The tenants fly to the hills for safety , being there more distant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands thus abandoned , and the drains fill up . At the end of a year or two , peace is made , and the work of clearing is again to be commenced . Population and wealth have , however , diminished , and the means of recommencing the work have again to be created . Meanwhile the best lands are covered with shrubs , and the best meadows are under water . With continued peace , the work , however , advances , and after a few years , population and wealth , and cultivation , attain the same height as before . New wars ensue , for the determination of the question which of the two chiefs shall collect all the so-called rent . After great waste of life and property , one of them is killed , and the other falls his heir , having thus acquired both glory and plunder . He now wants a title , by which to be distinguished from those by whom he is surrounded . He is a little king . Similar operations are performed elsewhere , and kings become numerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king covets the dominions of his neighbours . Wars ensue on a somewhat larger scale , and always with the same results . The people invariably fly to the hills for safety . As invariably , the best lands are abandoned . Food becomes scarce , and famine and pestilence sweep off those whose flight had saved them from the swords of the invader . Small kings become greater ones , surrounded by lesser chiefs /z/ who glorify themselves in the number of their murders , and in the amount of plunder they have acquired . Counts , viscounts , earls , marquises , and dukes , now make their appearance on the stage , heirs of the power and of the rights of the robber chiefs of early days . Population and wealth go backward , and the love of title grows with the growth of barbarism. * Wars are now made on a larger scale , and greater " glory " is acquired . In the midst of distant and highly fertile lands occupied by a numerous population , are rich cities and towns offering a copious harvest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be robbed with impunity , always an important consideration to those with whom the pursuit of " glory " is a trade . Provinces are laid waste , and the population is exterminated , or if a few escape , they fly to the hills and mountains , there to perish of famine . Peace follows , after years of destruction , but the rich lands are overgrown : the spades and axes , the cattle and the sheep are gone : the houses are destroyed : their owners have ceased to exist : and a long period of abstinence from the work of desolation is required to regain the point from which cultivation had been driven by men intent upon the gratification of their own selfish desires , at the cost of the welfare and happiness of the people over whose destinies they have unhappily ruled . Population grows slowly , and wealth but little more rapidly , for almost ceaseless wars have impaired the disposition and the respect for honest labour , while the neces- * It is amusing to trace with each step in the progress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificence of titles : and so again with the decline of modern Italy . In France , titles became almost universal as the wars of religion barbarized the people . The high-sounding titles of the East are in keeping with the weakness of those by whom they are assumed , as are the endless names of the Spanish grandee with the poverty of the soil cultivated by his dependents . The lime isfast approaching when men of real dignity will reject the whole system as an absurdity , and when small men alone will think themselves elevated by the title of Esquire , Honourable , Baron , Marquis , or Duke . Extremes always meet . The son of the duke rejoices in the possession of half a dozen Christian names , and the little retailer of tea and sugar calls his daughter Amanda Malvina Fitzallan Smith , or Pratt : while the gentleman calls his son Robert , or John . /z/ sity for beginning once more the work of cultivation on the poor soils , adds to the distaste for work , while it limits the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more honourable implements than spades and pickaxes . The habit of union for any honest purpose is almost extinct , while thousands are ready , at any moment , to join in expeditions in search of plunder . War thus feeds itself by producing poverty , depopulation , and the abandonment of the most fertile soils ; while peace also feeds itself , by increasing the number of men and the habit of union , because of the constantly increasing power to draw supplies of food from the surface already occupied , as the almost boundless powers of the earth are developed in the progress of population and wealth . These views are not in accordance with the doctrine of Mr. Malthus , yet look where we may , we shall find confirmation of their truth . If to India , we may see the rich soil relapsing into jungle , while its late occupant starves among the forts of the hills .

If to Italy , we see a growing people subduing to cultivation the rich lands of the Campagna and of Latium , to be again gradually abandoned , and now affording miserable subsistence to men , many of whom go clothed in skins of beasts , and whose number scarcely exceeds that of the cities that once there flourished . If we pass farther north , we may see the rich lands of the Siennese republic in cultivation until the sixteenth century , when the ferocious Marignan drove to the hills the small remnant of the population that escaped the sword , and gave to /z/ the world a pestilential desert , in lieu of the highly cultivated farms which before abounded . Still further north , may be seen the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soils , while its late inhabitants perish by pestilence within the city walls , or transfer themselves to the head of the Arno , to seek there the subsistence no longer afforded by the richer lands near its mouth . In France , we may see the perpetual ravage of the rich lands of the south by the ferocious tribes of the north , from the days of Clovis down to the period of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , and at every fresh invasion , the people are seen flying to the hills and mountains for safety . In the days of the English wars , we may see the lower and richer countries ravaged by bands of fierce mountaineers : the wild Breton , the ferocious Gascon , and the mercenary Swiss : united for the plunder of the men who cultivated the more fertile soils , and driving them to seek refuge in the wild and savage Brittany itself . We may see the lands of the richer soils rendered utterly desolate : la Beauce , one of the most fertile parts of the kingdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhine not a house , unprotected by city walls , is left standing , nor a farm that is not stripped . In later times we see Lorraine reduced to a desert : and fine forests but recently stood , if even now they have ceased to stand , where formerly the rich soil yielded liberal returns to labour . Throughout France are seen the effects of per-J petual war , in the concentration of the whole agricultural population in filthy villages , at a distance from the lands they cultivate : there inhaling a foul atmosphere , and losing half their time in transferring themselves , their rough implements , and their products , to and from their little properties , whereas , the same labour bestowed upon the land itself would give to cultivation the richer soils . If we trace the external history of that country , we see hosts of gentlemen followed by bands of savage Bretons , G xscons , and Swiss : all , noble and gentle , equally greedy /z/ and rapacious : engaged for successive centuries in the work of plundering and exterminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile soils : the people of the Netherlands and Germany : of Italy and of Catalonia : and compelling them to abandon their rich fields and to seek refuge within the walls of cities , there to die of famine and pestilence . War is thus , everywhere , the trade of the barbarian who cultivates the poor soils and looks with greedy eyes upon the wealth of other men , whose honest industry and exertion have enabled them to bring into cultivation the better soils , with a constantly increasing return to labour . If next , we desire to see the countries in which men cultivate the poorest soils , we must turn to those in which constant wars and oppression have most prevented the growth of wealth and population : to India and Sicily : and there we shall find the habit of combined exertion least existing . If we cross the Atlantic , and look to Mexico , we may see the fertile valley that surrounds the city , and that once afforded food for a vast population , now in a state of desolation : its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the poorer lands that border the valley , strings of mules bring from a distance of fifty miles loads of provisions to supply the wants of the city . For a specimen of the next class , we must turn to France , whose population requires for its duplication above a century ; and whose labourer uses poor machinery that enables him to penetrate but little into the upper soil , leaving the more fertile soils beneath and around him for some future race that shall have learned that real glory and grandeur are not to be attained by endless wars. * If now we seek the countries in which the reward of the labourer most rapidly advances , we must turn first to Prussia , that has , since 1763 , with the exception of the few years that followed the battle of Jena , enjoyed the blessings of peace : and there we shall find population /z/ and the habit of union advancing with a rapidity unknown to the rest of continental Europe . Next , we must look to England , where we shall find vast wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing in numbers with a force constantly accelerated as the accumulation of that wealth has enabled them to bring into activity the better soils . In the days of the Edwards , it numbered two millions and a half . In 1700 , it but little exceeded five millions . The increase was small , and the improvement of the condition of the people was slow . In the first seventy years of the past century , the increase was forty per cent . In the following thirty years , it exceeded twenty-five per cent . Population increased rapidly , and with it grew wealth and the power and habit of union , and cultivation was extended , with a rapid increase in the return to labour . It is now doubling itself in forty-six years , thus proceeding with accelerated force , and with its increase we see more fertile soils coming into cultivation , and affording larger returns : giving increased wages to the labourer and larger reward to the capitalist than is obtained in any other part of Europe .

The Welshman and the Englishman , the Highlander and the man of the lowlands , have long since ceased to view each other with dislike : and the Cornishman and the Yorkshireman have learned at length to speak the same language . Lastly , we turn to the United States , which , during more than two centuries from the first landing of the Pilgrims , never were engaged in war but when forced thereto in self-defence , and whose history presents a course of peaceful action unparalleled in the world .

Beginning necessarily with the poorest soils , they were widely separated from each other . Had they , like their neighbours of Canada , been perpetually engaged in war , they would have remained poor and scattered ; but they worked while the others sought alliances with the Indians , and prosecuted the work of conquest . Few in number , and poor , they still cultivated poor soils , when England was already the wealthiest nation of the world , and had the power to bring into activity the best soils , if she would : but England preferred a war of twenty years attended with incalculable waste of life and treasure , the result of which is that she stands now but second in point of wealth . Look where we may , we shall find similar results . If we desire to see men in a state of high prosperity , w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods in which their numbers grow . In Italy we shall find it in the . days of Servius , before Rome undertook the mission of plundering the world and exterminating the free population , to be replaced by slaves . In Tuscany we shall meet it in the fourteenth century , before French princes and nobles had learned to interfere in their affairs , expelling the most useful of her citizens , and introducing a habit of war : to result in building up the colossal fortune of Cosmo de ' Medici , derived chiefly from the profit of loans to the state for purposes of war , at enormous interest paid out of the proceeds of taxes on provisions , and collected at the gates of the city by his own * That tenacious spirit of unity which has hitherto so singularly characterized them . " Edinburgh Review . MAN AND FOOh. 91 clerks . In Athens it will be found in the days of Solon and the Pisistratidae , before the depopulation and poverty produced by Persian armies gave power to men like Cimon and Pericles : men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of ruinous wars , the means of acquiring that distinction which otherwise they could never have obtained . In Egypt , in the days of the Ptolemies , before proconsuls drew from the impoverished inhabitants the means of maintaining their canals , to be applied to the support of the profligate and worthless people of Rome . In Spain , on the banks of the Guadalquiver , before the fortune of war had given power to Isabella and her successors to plunder and exterminate the industrious and prosperous Moors . In all these cases , increasing w r ealth gave man the power to cultivate the better soils . If , now , we desire to see man in poverty and distress , a prey to famine and pestilence , we must turn to those periods in which population decreases ; and be they where they may , we shall be sure to find the object of our search . War diminishes population , but it destroys wealth . The farmer may live to return to his fields ; but his house is burned , his crops are carried off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plough and his harrow broken up ; and he returns to the city a beggar , to die of famine : for his neighbours are like himself . Their property is gone , and they have no means of employing him , even as a labourer . Everywhere poverty goes in advance of depopulation , w r hile everywhere increasing wealth goes far in advance of increasing numbers . Such being the case , we may well doubt if war , which forces man to abandon the best soils and seek the poorer ones , be really the panacea furnished by the Deity for restraining population within the limits of food . It would rather seem to be one of the weak " inventions " of man , for counteracting the great law of nature which prescribes that if men will live well they must labour , and thus provide themselves with the machinery necessary for the development of the productive powers of the earth : powers so wonderfully great /z/ that it would oe absurd , with our present limited knowledge , to attempt a definition of their extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labour , is the reward offered to man for good conduct for the full observance of the great law of Christ : and in every country he profits by their use in the precise ratio of his obedience . Mr. Malthus recommends " moral restraint . " Where shall it be found ? Certainly not among the Esquimaux , where every woman is ready to prostitute herself for a nail , or a bead , nor among the savages of the Rocky Mountains , or those of the islands of the Pacific , nor any where , where population does not grow . It prevails to a certain extent in France , in whose great city , according to M. Dupin , it is only every third child that is a bastard ; but it prevails more in Prussia , where labour is better rewarded , and men marry more freely ; still more in England , where matrimony is still more common ; and most in America , where everybody marries . In all countries population increases nearly in the ratio of morality ; but where marriage is deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals will be needed . f The remedy of Mr. Malthus would thus appear to produce the disease for the cure of which it was intended , and to stimulate instead of repressing , population .

With its growth production increases , and the labourer is enabled to take as his reward a larger proportion , thus producing a tendency to equality of condition . The people have everywhere loved peace , for such were its fruits . TJieir masters have everywhere loved war , because it tended to the maintenance of inequality ; yet if they had been governed by the sense of an enlightened self-interest , they would have seen that the injury to themselves was as great as was that experienced by the labourers and mechanics by whom they were surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Avoid war !

It destroys population and wealth , and the value of land is dependent upon the growth of both . " To the labourer it says : " Avoid war ! It destroys wealth more rapidly than population . It diminishes your power over the product of your labour , and it tends to increase the existing inequality of condition . " /z/ THE first cultivator commences his operations on the hillside . Below him are lands upon which have been carried , by force of water , the richer portions of those above , as well as the leaves of trees , and the fallen trees themselves ; all of which have there , from time immemorial , rotted and become incorporated with the earth , and thus have been produced soils fitted to yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they inaccessible . Their character exhibits itself in the enormous trees with which they are covered , and in their power of retaining the water necessary to aid the process of decomposition ; but the poor settler wants the power either to clear them of their timber , or to drain them of the superfluous moisture . He begins on the hill-side , but at the next step we find him descending the hill , and obtaining larger returns to labour . He has more food for himself , and he has now the means of feeding a horse or an ox . Aided by the manure that is thus yielded to him by the better lands , we see him next retracing his steps , improving the hill-side , and compelling it to yield a return double that which he at first obtained . With each step down the hill , he obtains still larger reward for his labour , and at each he returns , with increased power , to the cultivation of the original poor soil . He has now horses and oxen , and while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manure that had accumulated for ages , he has also carts and wagons to carry it up the hill : and at each step his reward is increased , while his labours are lessened . He goes back to the sand /z/ and raises the marl , with which he covers the surface ; or he returns to the clay and sinks into the limestone , by aid of which he doubles its product . He is all the time making a machine which feeds him while he makes it , and which increases in its powers the more he takes from it . At first it was worthless . It has fed and clothed him for years , and now it has a large value , and those who might desire to use it would pay him a large rent . The earth is a great machine , given to man to be fashioned to his purpose . The more he fashions it , the better it feeds him , because each step is but preparatory to a new one more productive than the last ; requiring less labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , yet the return is small . The earth is covered with stumps , and filled with roots . With each year the roots decay , and the ground becomes enriched , while the labour of ploughing is diminished . At length , the stumps disappear , and the return is doubled , while the labour is less by one-half than at first . To forward this process the owner " has done nothing but crop the ground : nature having done the rest . The aid he thus obtains from her yields him as much food as in the outset was obtained by the labour of felling and destroying the trees . This , however , is not all . The surplus thus yielded has given him means for improving the poorer lands , by furnishing manure with which to enrich them ; and thus he has trebled his original return without further labour : for that which he saves in working the new soils suffices to carry the manure to the old ones . He is obtaining a daily increased power over the various ' treasures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , the result is the same . The first step is , invariably , the most costly one , and the least productive . The first drain commences near the stream , where the labour is heaviest . It frees from water but a few acres . A little higher , the same quantity of labour , profiting by what has been already done , frees twice the number . Again the number is doubled , /z/ and now the most perfect system of thorough drainage may be established with less labour than was at first required for one of the most imperfect kind . To bring the lime into connection with the clay , upon fifty acres , is lighter labour than w T as the clearing of a single one , yet the process doubles the return for each acre of the fifty . The man who wants a little fuel for his own use , expends much labour in opening the neighbouring vein of coal . To enlarge this , so as to double the product , is a work of comparatively small labour ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a drift- wagon , giving him a return fifty times greater than was obtained when he used only his arms , or a wheelbarrow . To sink a shaft to the first vein below the surface , and erect a steam-engine , are expensive operations ; but these once accomplished , every future step becomes more productive , while less costly . To sink to the next vein below , and to tunnel to another , are trifles in comparison with the first , yet each furnishes a return equally large . The first line of railroad runs by houses and towns occupied by fifty or a hundred thousand persons . Half a dozen little branches , costing together far less labour than the first , bring into connection with it three hundred thousand , or perhaps half a million . The trade increases , and a second track , a third , or a fourth , may be required . The original one facilitates the passage of the materials and the removal of obstructions , and three new ones may now be made with less labour than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioning the great machine is but the prelude to the application of further labour , with still increased returns . With each such application , wages rise , and hence it is that portions of the machine , as it exists , invariably exchange , when brought to market , for far less labour than they have cost . The man who cultivated the thin soils was happy to obtain a hundred bushels for his year 's work . With the progress of himself and his neighbour down the hill into the more fertile soils , wages have /z/ risen , and two hundred bushels are now required . His farm will yield a thousand bushels ; but it requires the labour of four men , who must have two hundred bushels each , and the surplus is but two hundred bushels . At twenty years purchase this gives a capital of four thousand bushels , or the equivalent of twenty years ' wages ; whereas it has cost , in the labour of himself , his sons , and his assistants , the equivalent of a hundred years of labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , it has fed and clothed them all , and the farm has been produced by the insensible contributions made from year to year , unthought of and unfelt. * It is now worth twenty years ' wages , because its owner has for years taken from it a thousand bushels annually ; but when it had lain for centuries accumulating wealth , it was worth nothing . Such is the case with the earth everywhere . The more that is taken from it the more there is left . When the coal mines of England were untouched , they were valueless . Now their value is almost countless ; yet the land contains abundant supplies for thousands of years . Iron ore , a century since , was a drug , and leases * It will be observed that we consider the owner and farmer always as one and the same person , and it is when they are so that this operation is the most complete , and yet the most insensible . Such it is in the United States . All who write of land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Land asks no such expenditure . It gives capital , when properly treated . In that country , the tenant starves it that he may gather up the rent , and if the landlord permits a small portion of its gifts to go back to the great producer , he considers himself as having given it something , for which it is his debtor . Had the tenant been the owner of the ill-treated machine , he would have given it twice as much , making no charge ; but , on the contrary , crediting it with the portion that he retained for his own consumption . When English landlords talk of spending five and ten pounds per acre , it sounds very grand ; but as in all other cases , the real grandeur is in the inverse ratio of that which is apparent . The man who cultivates his own land , puts on twice as much ; but , he does it from year to year , insensibly , and the land is rendered twice as productive by the one operation as by the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but steadily , and the nearer that man approaches her , the more nearly is he right . The man who improves his own land works with a long lever , and little power is required ; whereas , the landlord works with a short lever , and greater power is needed to produce smaller effect . /z/ were granted at almost nominal rents . Now , such leases are deemed equivalent to the possession of large fortunes , notwithstanding the great quantities that have been removed , although the amount of ore now known to exist is probably fiv times greater than it was then . The earth is the sole producer . Man fashions and exchanges . A part of his labour is applied to the fashioning of the great machine , and this produces changes that are permanent . The drain , once cut , remains a drain ; and the limestone , once reduced to lime , never again becomes limestone . It passes into . the food of man and animals , and ever after takes its part in the same round with the clay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gradually passes into soil , to take its part with the clay and the lime . That portion of his labour gives him wages while preparing the machine for greater future production . That other portion which he expends on fashioning and exchanging the products of the machine , produces temporary results , and gives him wages alone . Whatever tends , therefore , to diminish the quantity of labour necessary for the fashioning and exchanging of the products , tends to increase the quantity that may be given to increasing the amount of products , and to preparing the great machine ; and thus , while increasing the present return to labour , preparing for a future further increase . The first poor cultivator obtains a hundred bushels for his year 's wages . To pound this between two stones requires twenty days of labour , and the work is not half done . Had he a mill in the neighbourhood he would have better flour , and he would have almost his whole twenty days to bestow upon his land . He pulls up his grain . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparation of the machine of production . He loses his axe , and it requires days of himself and his horse on the road , to obtain another . His machine loses the time and the manure , both of which would ave been saved had the axe-maker been at hand . The real /z/ advantage derived from the mill and the scythe , and from the proximity of the axe-maker , consists simply in the power which they afford him to devote his labour more and more to the preparation of the great machine of production , and such is the case with all the machinery of preparation and exchange . The plough enables him to do as much in one day as with a spade he could do in five . He saves four days for drainage . The steam-engine drains as much as without it could be drained by thousands of days of labour . He has more leisure to marl and lime his land . The more he can extract from his machine the greater is its value , because every thing he takes is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid further production . The machine , therefore , improves by use ; whereas spades , and ploughs , and steam-engines , and all other of the machines used by man , are but the various forms into which he fashions parts of the great original machine , to disappear in the act of being used ; as much so as food , though not so rapidly . The earth is the great labour savings ' bank ; and the value to man of all other machines is in the direct ratio of their tendency to aid him in increasing his deposits in the only bank whose dividends are perpetually increasing , while its capital is perpetually doubling . That it may continue for ever so to do , all that it asks is that it shall receive back the refuse of its produce : the manure : and that it may do so , the consumer and the producer must take their places by each other . That done , every change that is effected becomes permanent , and tends to facilitate other and greater changes . The whole business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the earth rewards him for his kindness by giving him more and more food the more attention he bestows upon her . The solitary settler has to occupy the spots that , with his rude machinery , he can cultivate . Having neither horse nor cart , he carries home his crop upon his shoulders , as is now done in many parts of India . He carries a hide to the place of exchange , distant , perhaps , fifty miles , to obtain for it leather , /z/ or shoes . Population increases , and roads are made . More fertile soils are cultivated . The store and the mill come nearer to him , and he obtains shoes and flour with the use of less machinery of exchange . He has more leisure for the preparation of his great machine , and the returns to labour increase . More people now obtain food from the same surface , and new places of exchange appear . The wool is , on the spot , converted into cloth , and he exchanges directly with the clothier . The saw-mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tanner gives him leather for his hides , and the paper-maker gives him paper for his rags . With each of these changes he has more and more of both time and manure to devote to the preparation of the great foodmaking machine , and with each year the returns are larger . His power to command the use of the machinery of exchange increases , but his necessity therefor diminishes ; for with each year there is an increasing tendency towards having the consumer placed side by side with the producer ; and with each he can devote more and more of his time and mind to the business of fashioning the great instrument ; and thus the increase of consuming population is essential to the progress of production . The loss from the use of machinery of exchange is in the ratio of the bulk of the article to be exchanged . Food stands first ; fuel , next ; stone for building , third ; iron , fourth ; cotton , fifth ; and so on ; diminishing until we come to laces and nutmegs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth has most co-operated , and by the production of which the land is most improved ; and the nearer the place ' of exchange or conversion can be brought to the place oi production , the less is the loss in the process , and the greater the power of accumulating wealth for the production of further wealth . The man who raises food on his own land is building up the machine for doing so to more advantage in the following year . His neighbour , to whom it is given , on condition of /z/ sitting still , loses a year 's work on his machine , and all he has gained is the pleasure of doing nothing . If he has employed himself and his horses and wagon in bringing it home , the same number of days that would have been required for raising it , he has misemployed his time , for his farm is unimproved . He has wasted labour and manure . As nobody , however , gives , it is obvious that the man who has a farm and obtains his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay also for transporting it ; and that although he may have obtained as good wages in some other p'ur$i ( i$J bis farm , instead of having been improved by a year 's cultivatjpn , , is worse by a year 's neglect ; and that he is -a poorer ijin thajt he would have been had he raised his own food . The article of next greatest bulk is fuel . While warming his house , he is clearing his land . He would lose by sitting idle , if his neighbour brought his fuel to him , and still more if he had to spend the same time in hauling it , because he would be wearing out his wagon and losing the manure . Were he to hire himself and his wagon to another for the same quantity of fuel he could have cut on his own property , he would be a loser , for his farm would be uncleared . If he take the stone from his own fields to build his house , he gains doubly . His house is built , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his neighbour bring him stone , he loses , for his fields remain unfit for cultivation . If he work equally hard for a neighbour , and receive the same apparent wages , he is a loser by the fact that he has yet to remove the stones , and until they shall be removed he can not cultivate his land . With every improvement in the machinery of exchange , there is a diminution in the proportion which that machinery bears to the mass of production , because of the extraordinary increase of product consequent upon the increased pow r er of applying labour to building up the great machine . It is a matter of daily observation that the demand for horses and men increases as railroads drive them from the turnpikes , and the /z/ reason is , that the farmer 's means of improving his land increase more rapidly than men and horses for his work . The man who has , thus far , sent to market his half-fed cattle , accompanied by horses and men to drive them , and wagons and horses loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , and to fatten them when at market ; now fattens them on the ground , and sends them by railroad ready for the slaughter-house . His use of the machinery of exchange is diminished nine-tenths . He keeps his men , his horses , and his wagons , and the refuse of his hay or turnips , at home . The former , are - employed in ditching and draining , while the latter fertilizes ' the soil heretofore cultivated . His production doubles , and he accumulates rapidly , while the people around him have more to eat , more to spend in clothing , and accumulate more themselves . He wants labourers in the field , and they want clothes and houses . The shoemaker and the carpenter , finding that there exists a demand for their labour , now join the community , eating the food on the ground on which it is produced ; and thus the machinery of exchange is improved , while the quantity required is diminished . The quantity of flour consumed on the spot induces the miller to come and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour of exchanging is diminished , and more is given to the land , and the lime is now turned up . Tons of turnips are obtained from the same surface that before gave bushels of rye . The quantity to be consumed increases faster lhan the population , and more mouths are needed on the spot , and next the woollen-mill comes . The wool no longer requires wagons and horses which now are turned to transporting coal , to enable the farmer to dispense with his woods , and to reduce to cultivation the fine soil that has , for centuries , produced nothing but timber . Production again increases , and the new wealth now takes the form of the cotton-mill ; and , with every step in the progress , the farmer finds new demands on the great machine he has constructed , accompanied with increased power on his part to build it - up higher and stronger , /z/ and to sink its foundations deeper . He now supplies beef and mutton , wheat , butter , eggs , poultry , cheese , and every other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate is suited ; and from the same land which afforded , when his father or grandfather first commenced cultivation on the light soil of the hills , scarcely sufficient rye or barley to support life . In the natural course of things , there is a strong tendency towards placing the consumer by the side of the producer , and thus diminishing the quantity required of the machinery of exchange ; and wherever that tendency does not grow in the ratio of the growth of population , it is a consequence of some of those weak " inventions " by which man so often disturbs the harmony of nature . Wherever her laws have most prevailed , such has been the tendency , and there have wealth and the power of man over the great machine , most rapidly increased . Rent is the price paid for the use of that power , and it increases with every diminution in the - quantity required of the machinery of exchange . In Attica , in the days of Solon and the Pisistratidae , wealth and population grew rapidly . Cultivation passed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens consumed what was produced by the farmer of Attica . Led , unhappily , to meddle in the affairs of Persia , and thus to employ a portion of their labour upon the more distant soil of Asia , they soon found themselves driven from the better ones of Attica to those within the walls of Athens , there to perish of starvation . Population and wealth diminished , and thenceforward we find them cultivating the lands of distant and subject cities , through the medium of their citizens : substituting weapons of offence for machinery of production : and becoming poor and dissolute . Poverty begets tyranny and rapacity , and both beget a love of war . That of the Peloponnesus follows . Attica is ruined , and Athens passes gradually from poverty to starvation , and at last to ruin . Sparta begins with the poor soils . She refuses to permit the growth of population or of wealth . She assassinates her /z/ slaves , while employing their masters on the distant lands of Attica , or of Asia ; working the apparently rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich soils at home . Poor and rapacious , perfidious and tyrannical , she continues ever weak and contemptible , and passes out of existence , leaving as her sole bequest to posterity , the record of her avarice and her crimes . Rome , in the days of Servius , cultivated the fertile soils , and population and wealth grew rapidly , with a diminishing necessity for the machinery of exchange , as towns and cities grew in extent , filled with men engaged in fashioning the products of the earth , in exchange for the portion of those products required for the satisfaction of their wants . His successor preferred the distant soils , and employed his subjects in carrying arms and plundering their neighbours ; and in building up great works that were to immortalize him with posterity , but which developed none of the powers of the great food-producing machine . The product of labour diminished , and the proportion of the few increased , while that of the many diminished . Inequality of wealth begot inequality of power , and that , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be cultivated by force of arms . Passing through Italy and Sicily , we find her citizens in Greece ; in Africa , Asia , Spain , Gaul and Britain ; thus going from the rich soils to the poorer ones , and increasing at every step the necessity for the machinery of exchange ; and with each step we find the many becoming poorer and more debased , and the few becoming greater and more depraved ; until at length , decayed at the heart , the empire passes away : having existed for almost a thousand years , a model of rapacity , dishonesty , and fraud , and having in the wiiole period produced scarcely a single man whose name has come down to posterity with an untarnished fame . The people of Florence commenced their cultivation on the light soils at the head of the Arno . With increasing wealth , the products of the land increased : and as food be- /z/ came abundant , the fashioner came . Wealth and population again increased , and the town became a city : and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church , she is found cultivating the distant soils of Bologna , Milan , and the ghibelline Pisa , and with each remove from home , wealth and population diminish , until at length , impoverished and depopulated , the better soils pass out of cultivation , and the once free and happy people become the slaves of the Medici . She increased her machinery of exchange and diminished its power . Bows , and swords , and muskets became more numerous as spades and pickaxes disappeared , and the product of the former proved to be far less than had been that of the latter . Spain expelled that portion of her people which used little machinery of exchange , and which therefore had a larger proportion of their time to devote to cultivating the powers of the great machine . Another portion , with arms in their hands , cultivated Sicily , Naples , Tuscany and the Milanese : a third , the distant soil of the Netherlands : and a fourth those of Peru and Mexico : and thus she increased her machinery of exchange while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process she became poorer , and men now may starve in Andalusia while the silos of Castile are filled with grain , the mere cost of transportation on the Backs of mules placing it beyond the reach of the poor Andalusian 's purse . Her people are still in a state of barbarism , from having been forced to abandon the rich soils , and take to the poor ones , having used too much bad machinery of exchange . For more than a thousand years , the sovereigns , nobles , and gentlemen of France , have been engaged in the cultivation of the soils of the Netherlands and Germany , Catalonia and Piedmont , the Milanese and Naples : and more recently they have extended their operations as far as Russia ; while Canada and Cayenne , India and Egypt have at various times claimed their attention . The study of that /z/ nation has been to increase the machinery of exchange , and diminish that of production . Swords have abounded while spades were rare . Cannon were numerous , while roads scarcely existed . Forts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines unknown . Ships of war were numerous , but merchant ships were scarce . Camps grew and cities decayed . Gentlemen became more numerous as ploughmen disappeared . The soil they cultivated , however , bore " Dead Sea fruits that tempt the eye , But turn to ashes on the lips . " * France is poor . She cultivates the poor soils , for want * " From 1803 to 1815 , twelve campaigns cost us nearly a million of men , who died in the field of battle , or in the prisons , or on the roads , or in the hospitals , and six thousand millions of francs . * * * Two invasions destroyed or consumed , on the soil of old France , fifteen hundred millions of raw products , or of manufactures , of houses , of workshops , of machines , and of animals , indispensable to agriculture , to manufactures , or to commerce .

Behold , in twelve years , nine thousand millions of francs , " ( seventeen hundred millions of dollars , ) " taken from the productive industry of France and lost for ever . We found ourselves thus dispossessed of all our conquests , and with two hundred thousand strangers encamped on our territory , where they lived , at the expense of our glory and of our fortune , until the end of the year 1818 . " Dupin . The results of this course of operation are found in the following statement by an eminent French engineer : I have frequently traversed in different departments , twenty square leagues , without meeting with a canal , a road , a factory , or even an inhabited estate . The country seemed a place of exile abandoned to the miserable , whose interests and whose wants are equally misunderstood , and whose distress is constantly increasing , because of the low prices of their products , and the cost of transportation .

Farmers allow their children to beg along the roads . On saints ' days , especially the festivals of celebrated saints , the aged , infirm , and children of poor farmers , and labourers , turn out . Some small hamlets are even totally abandoned by their inhabitants for two or three days . All attend the festival to beg . * * The principal cause of misery is inebriety ; its frequency among the lower orders keeps them in poverty .

For a population of thirty-five millions , she raises five hundred and twenty millions of bushels of wheat , rye , barley , oats , Indian corn and buckwheat , and about half that quantity of potatoes . Her wheat lands vary from five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her cattle are few and poor : as are her sheep . Her manure diminishes , and her seed increases . Her horses , her food and her fuel , to a vast extent , she imports : and pays for them in the produce of looms that yield but little , because of the universal poverty that forbids improvement of machinery , or combination of action . Her production of solid food , divided among the whole people , gives the equivalent of three hundred and forty-three pounds of bread , and thirty pounds of meat , per annum , to each individual ; while of wine , beer , cider , perry and brandy , the amount is one hundred and sixty pounds per annum , or nearly half as much . The labour that water-drinkers would employ in producing corn , is in France given to producing wine and other liquors ; of which the consumption averages twenty gallons per annum , for every man , woman , and child in the kingdom . Of what is the actual distribution of food an idea may be formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds of the population is but six cents per day , yielding twenty-four cents for the support of a man , his wife and two children : and that in a country in which the average price of wheat , from 1816 to 1835 , was about $1.20 per bushel , and where the profits of the retailer , and the cost of transportation are large ; so that ten pounds of wheat may be taken as the value of the earnings of the whole family . Under such circumstances it is not matter of surprise that ignorance of true economy should so far exist as to render it exceedingly difficult to introduce improvements in the machinery of exchange at home , as has been shown in the case of the ingenious Jacfuard , whose life was unsafe because he invented a ma- /z/ chine of greater power than those already in use . The turbulence of French workmen is in the direct ratio of their poverty , and that is exceeding great . France now proposes to transport a portion of her people to Algeria , that they may there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the everwretched artisans of Lyons and Sedan , who are surrounded by fertile soils that would yield largely , and require no troops to protect their labourers . The effort of that country , from the days of Clovis to the present time , has been to increase the quantity of her machinery of exchange , and to prevent any improvement in its quality : thereby precluding any increase in the quantity of labour that might be applied to the development of the powers of the great food-producing machine . Population doubles in about a hundred and twenty years , and wealth scarcely more rapidly . Those who labour are but little removed from starvation , and those who do not , divide among themselves the great mass of the products . The government takes thirty per cent , of the product of land for taxes on the land itself , and on the registration of deeds , mortgages , &c.; Interest on the innumerable mortgages with which the country is almost literally covered , absorbs nearly forty per cent. , leaving thirty per cent , to be divided between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all past times , are numerous beyond imagination , and live on the endless litigation to which poverty gives rise . Vast machinery and small production is everywhere the characteristic of France , and has been so from the days of Charlemagne . Under such circumstances , the exceeding poverty of the people is not matter of surprise ; nor is it extraordinary that wealth and population can not , and do not , increase . At all periods of her history , her people have shown themselves well disposed to honest industry , and Jacques Bonhomme has , at times , manifested the possession of all the qualities required in a good citizen ; but labour , or the care of labourers , was not the business of gentlemen , i. e. of people who carried arms , /z/ and who generally owed their place in the world to the fact that their fathers , or grandfathers , had profited largely by the cultivation of the rich soils afforded by the plunder of the cities of Italy or the Netherlands : or who like La Hire , Saintrailles , Dammartin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had distinguished themselves as ecorcheurs , i. e. flayers , of the unhappy class at home engaged in preparing the great machine required for the production of food . It was their especial privilege to seek plunder and glory , and to collect taxes for the payment of their assistants in the work : and the payment of those taxes exhausted , as it now still exhausts , the power of the country ; and meadows are abandoned , while men cultivate thin soils which yield five bushels to the acre , or about three times the seed . The insular position of England gave her security from invasion . Security tended largely to promote the growth of wealth and freedom , and comparative freedom tended to facilitate the further growth of wealth . That wealth , however , was not permitted to be applied to the improvement of the great food-producing machine . The Church had an interest , amounting to one-tenth , in all its products , increase as they might ; and the owner of the land was unwilling to invest his means in improving property liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed to exert himself when so large a portion of his products was not to be subject to his own disposition . The owner of the remaining nine-tenths was rarely a free agent . In some cases , his property was entailed , and if he began to cut the timber , his son regarded the act as waste , and an injunction followed . If his lands required drainage , he could not pledge the income beyond his life , and it remained undrained . When not entailed , it was burthened with endless settlements , dowers , remainders , lifeinterests , &c.,; while lawyers surrounded it with forms so endless that a conveyance was one of the most serious affairs of life . The law of succession gave the whole to the eldest /z/ son , who was thus made sufficiently rich to desire to do nothing , while his brothers and sisters were rendered too poor to be able to do any thing for themselves , and were generally thrown on the bounty of the state . Wealth grew rapidly , for internal peace prevailed , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek an outlet . It sought manufactures and commerce , there to obtain , by aid of expensive machinery , temporary in its duration , a less reward than could have been obtained at home while making the great machine . The consequence was that capital , and ships , and manufactures , and gentlemen , and labourers , were all superabundant , and food alone was scarce . To find a market for manufactures , employment for ships , and poor gentlemen , and labourers , colonies were needed : and then , in order that they might use as much as possible of the machinery of exchange , it became necessary to compel them to send their raw materials to England ; and they were prohibited from making even hob-nails , or from effecting exchanges among themselves , except through the medium of English ports and English merchants . Other powers were equally desirous to preserve the power of taxing their colonies , but England deemed it right to resist in others what she practised herself , and her colonists were encouraged to engage in the trade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to use . Smuggling led to wars , and wars gave occasion to freebooters like Drake and Hawkins , to immortalize themselves by plundering and burning towns and murdering their inhabitants . Wars were expensive , and involved a necessity for heavy taxes , but colonies were to be maintained in order that employment might be had for the looms and ships of England ; and taxes gave support to the sons of gentlemen who would not permit their shares of the great machine to be improved . Navigation laws drove the ships of other nations from the ocean , while " Rules of ' 56 , " and other rules , and later , " Orders in Council " drove them from WEALTH . Ill the sea in time of war . " Ships , colonies , and commerce " were the great wants of England . For these , she has involved herself in endless wars . For these , she has committed enormous crimes : and . all because she has pertinaciously insisted upon using the inferior in preference to the superior machinery of production . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant nations , and has maintained the most expensive fleets and armies : her sole object being the sale of cloth , and knives , and china ware. * England was to be made the workshop of the world at any cost . France marched with the sword alone . England with the sword in one hand and a piece of cloth in the other . Manufactures were too cheap at home , and food too dear . Manufacturers wanted cheap food , and the landlord gave them corn laws to enable him to waste his capital and still get rents : but he gave them also ships and men to enable them to prevent the world abroad from placing the consumer by the producer , and to compel them to do that which he himself would not do , i. e. increase the supply of the raw produce of the earth : to be transported in British ships , wrought in British looms , and re-transported in British ships to the place of consumption . The necessary consequence of such a course of action has been an unceasing disturbance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted , in England , to seek employment on the great machine of production , and it was superabundant and cheap . Capital , in like manner , was denied employment , and it too was cheap . Both these were then placed under the control of ship-owners and manufacturers , to enable them to force upon other nations cloths produced by women and children who had little food , and very * " The history of the colonies for many years is that of a series of loss , and of the destruction of capital ; and if to the many millions of private capital which have been thus wasted , were added some hundred millions that have been raised by British taxes , and spent on account of the colonies , the lotal loss to the British public of wealth which the colonies have occasioned , would appear to be quite enormous . " Parnell . /z/ little to spare for clothing ; * many of whom went in rags , and some absolutely naked , f that other nations might have clothing cheap . In the natural course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool , takes his place by the side of the producer of the food he is to consume , because the transportation of food requires the use of a quantity of the machinery of exchange so far exceeding that required for the transportation of all other commodities required by the labourer . The policy of England was opposed to this course of action . She had forced herself into the position of being the great fashioner of the world , and there she was disposed to remain . It was , however , an artificial state of things , and , as is always the case where capital and labour are denied permission to take their natural course , it was liable to perpetual change . The thirst for colonies produced wars , and then her armies consumed foreign food , paid for with manufactures . Peace came , and she wanted no food . The other parties then could take no cloths or knives , and her artisans perished by thousands . Sometimes cloths and knives were dear , because she had found employment for her people and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other nations then attempted to place the consumer by the producer . Peace made capital and labour , cloths and knives , cheap , and manufacturers elsewhere were ruined . Prices rose again . Another effort was made . Prices fell , and again were they ruined . * By reference to the report of the Assistant Commissioner charged with the inquiry into the condition of women and children employed in agriculture , it will be seen that a change of clothes seems to be out of the question . The upper parts of the under-clothes of women at work , even their stays , quickly become wet with perspiration , while the lower parts can not escape getting equally wet in nearly every kind of work in which they are employed , except in the driest weather . It not unfrequently happens that a woman , on returning from work , is obliged to go to bed for an hour or two to allow her clothes to be dried . It is also by no means uncommon for her , if she does not do this , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she took them off . f See Parliamentary Report on the Coal Mines of Great Britain . /z/ In India , she killed the cotton manufacturer . The Hindoo then exported cotton . In America , she drove the people to the west to raise food , when they would have preferred to remain at home and consume food , while making cloth . Food was rendered so cheap that the planter abandoned food and went to cotton . Cotton was rendered so cheap that the Hindoo was ruined . The Hindoo , deprived of his two great trades , turned his attention to opium . The Chinese government did not like the trade , and tried to put it down . England made war , destroyed a few thousand lives , and many , very many , millions of property , and thus established the right of her subjects to furnish to the Chinese the means of intoxication . The planters of the south , driven from food to cotton , first ruined the Hindoo , and then were nearly ruined themselves . They now raise food , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them convert their own cotton into cloth . They are placing the Consumer by the producer , and the consequence is , that they are better paid for the cotton they have to sell , having greatly diminished their machinery of exchange , while rendering it more efficient . England now threatens them with the Hindoo as a rival producer of their great staple . Such is the character of the whole system . It is one of endless interference , and it has tended to produce elsewhere other interferences with trade , having for their great object security against its effects . Tariffs of protection are universal ; and with every new one has arisen in that country a desire for new colonies , to be governed by laws made at home , by virtue of which she may compel her subjects to use the machinery of exchange she thus insists upon providing for the use of the world . She employs her people in cultivating poor soils in Canada , South Africa , Australia and New* Zealand , while the richest soils of Britain are yet undrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive machinery of exchange , commodities that could be produced at home with half the labour . /z/ The eyes of England have always been turned from home . She must and would have ships , colonies , and commerce . To that desire is due the waste of thousands of millions : of more than would have sufficed to cover the island with railroads ; to render every field a garden ; to ! provide food in abundance for a population five times greater than now finds subsistence on her soil , and composed of a healthy , hardy race , capable of guarding their own rights , and regulating for themselves the hours of labour , the drainage of houses , the mode and expense of interments , and a thousand other things , in reference to which they are now compelled to claim parliamentary interference : by which is indicated an extreme inability to protect themselves . The state of things that has existed during the last thirty years is the strongest commentary on the system . It is impossible to look at any work on British agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingdom , when compared with what might naturally have been looked for in a country so abounding in wealth and population . The cry is everywhere that the people are too numerous ; yet the best lands in many of the counties are badly cultivated , although wealth so much abounds that it has been made a matter of question whether it might not be too abundant for the prosperity of a nation ! * So abounding , it has , however , been almost as often the question where to get it , as how to be rid of it . For the first few years that followed the Congress of Vienna , it was lent to all the arbitrary sovereigns of Europe . In 1825 , it was sent throughout Spanish America . In 1835 , it was sent to all North America . Between each of these , however , was a period of extreme distress to manufacturers and ship-owners ; of starvation to operatives , and of ruin to tenants ; and such would continue to be the case were the system to be continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , /z/ without the aid of war , the progress of a nation . It has succeeded in rendering men ami wealth superabundant in a nation that imports food , which yet can , even now , produce it at less cost of ' labour than any other of the world , America not excepted ; and it has also succeeded in causing the waste of hundreds of millions in loans , mines , colonies , &c.,; of which but a small part will ever return . A change has come over the system , and England is now making a market at home for labour and capital . She is at present fairly engaged in building up the great food-producing machine , and preparing to bring the supply of the necessaries of life up to a level with the demands for consumption . She is substituting the permanent for the temporary ; and , with each step of her progress in this direction , capital and labour are becoming more valuable . A century since consols were at 107 . They are now at 80 , after having been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have referred , forced up to par . England is the richest nation of Europe ; and she owes that distinction to the fact that she has enjoyed peace at home , although she has grievously disturbed the peace of others abroad . She has , on many occasions , failed , totally , to respect in others the rights she desired others to respect in herself . To these failures is due the anomalous position in which she stands . With fertile lands and immense wealth , her soil is covered with alms-houses . A continuance of the system which is now in course of being pursued , will lead , if even the experience of the last few years has not already led , to the conclusion , that the judicious employment of labour and capital begets a market for both . The railroads that have been made have caused the absorption of a vast amount of both in agricultural improvement , which , in its turn , produces a demand for new roads , and they produce a demand for labour . Wages rise , and houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marl , and clothing ; and the demand for labour and capital again increases ; and thus on and on , each producing , and produced by , the other , /z/ with a constantly augmenting wealth , and constant improvement of condition. * For more than two hundred years from the landing of the Pilgrims , the people of the United States never struck a blow , except in defence of their rights . f Their movement westward was of the most gradual kind ; and although occasional difficulties have arisen with the aborigines , the change of occupants has , uniformly , been effected with less trouble , and less effusion of blood , than has been witnessed in any other portion of the world except , perhaps , Australia , where the wretched inhabitants were too miserable to think of resistance . During the whole period , we may trace the natural effort to place the consumer by the side of the producer and thus to diminish the loss resulting from the use of costly machinery of exchange ; and during the whole we see the effort counteracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . Laws were passed prohibiting various species of manufactures in the colonies , while others forbade their trading with each other , and thus North Carolina and Massachusetts were forced to exchange their products through the medium of the ports of England . Twentytwo years of European war produced a great demand foi food , and tended to the dispersion of the people for raising it to supply the wants of people who thus preferred the use of swords to that of ploughs . Years of disturbed relations with England tended to produce concentration , and labour and capital were applied to fashioning the produce which otherwise might have been exported in its rude state . Robbery and oppression on the high seas forced them to this effort to place the consumer by the side of the producer . Peace came , and the whole wealth of England was turned to manufactures , while armies ceased to waste food . . The farmers * Such would be the effect of this operation , gently and quietly pursued ; but what are to be the momentary effects of a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be done in ten , remains yet to be seen . We should be glad if we could say the same of the past two years . /z/ and manufacturers of the United States were both ruined , and hence arose the first demand for protection by means of a tariff . A few years passed by , and then the years of " prosperity , " so loudly vaunted by the Premier as permanent , were followed by the universal ruin of 1826 , in which were swept away a new set of manufacturers engaged in finding a market at home for the supplies of food no longer needed abroad . The consequence was the tariff of 1828 , which was followed by the act known by the name of the Compromise ( 1832 ) ; and it would be difficult to find in history an instance of more equitable and quiet adjustment of a difficult question . From the time of its passage until the year 1836 , however , capital was steadily accumulating in England , and seeking a vent abroad , as railroads then were scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , in the form of iron and cloth , to be applied to the making of roads , or of clothing for the people employed in making them . The roads half-made , the collapse came , and all again was ruin . The Compromise was killed , and the tariff of 1842 took its place . That of 1846 has succeeded it ; and now we have another collapse . English factories are closed , and artisans are discharged , and thousands of houses are vacated because of the impossibility of paying rent . Railroads still go on , and furnaces are still employed , but panic is the order of the day , and all may stop : and then the iron-makers of America will be ruined . It is scarcely possible to study this brief history without seeing that the interferences which have existed have been the result of a natural effort at self-preservation . In the regular course of human affairs , the man who makes the shoes eats the food produced by the man who desires to wear them ; and he does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lapstone , by aid of which he may make ten thousand pairs of shoes , than it is for the farmer to carry to him the food necessary for his support while doing it . This tendency struggles incessantly to develope itself , and is seen on every occasion making its appearance , but it has almost /z/ invariably been crushed ; the effect of which has been that the people of the United States are now far more widely scattered , and far less wealthy , than they would otherwise have been . They have been compelled to use a vast quantity of inferior machinery of exchange , in the form of roads and wagons , in place of the superior machinery of steam-engines and mills : and they have been driven to begin on poor soils in the West , yielding ten bushels of wheat to the acre , when otherwise they might have worked their way down into the rich soils of the river bottoms farther east ; portions of which may at all times be bought for far less than the cost of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer can find a market at his door for milk and cream , and butter ; but in the mean time her citizens go west to seek other lands that may produce something that will bear carriage to the distant markets of the world . It is now obvious what has been the cause of this , the single case in which the policy of the Union has appeared to depart from the direction of perfect freedom of trade . We have always deemed such interferences erroneous , but are now well satisfied that the error has been with us . Man must everywhere commence with the poor soils , and the richer ones can not be cultivated until the consumer and the producer are brought together . Whatever foreign interference tends to prevent this union , tends to compel men to scatter themselves over poor soils , to prevent increase in the reward to labour , and to prevent advance in civilization : and resistance to such interference is a necessary act of self-defence . The article of chief consumptipn is food , of which rich soils would yield larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ones ; and half the difference would convert into cloth all the cotton and wool produced , and make the iron used , in the Union . Such being the case , the exports required to pay for English labour are so much absolute loss , while the great ' machine itself suffers in /z/ the loss of labour that would double it in product and in value . It has been an effort of the people to diminish their necessities , and to increase their power over their own actions . The case is not unlike one that has recently occurred , in which the people of a neighbourhood themselves did what the whole people have partially done in the other . The steamboat fare in a particular case was deemed too high . Opposition boats , at half price , were repeatedly attempted , and as repeatedly run off by reducing the fare so low that opposition could not live . Another was attempted , and the price of the old boat was reduced to one-fourth ; but the farmers , wiser grown , taxed themselves the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after two years of ineffectual contest , the price was fixed permanently at half the original price . The . resistance offered by the American tariff tended greatly to produce , if , indeed , it was not the absolute cause of the abolition of the corn law r s ; and that measure was precisely the one needed for giving the right direction to the capital of England . She will now become more extensively agricultural , and the United States may , at some future time , be enabled to concentrate their population upon the rich soils , instead of scattering so widely as they have heretofore done : and as , by degrees , these two effects shall be produced , the necessity for protection will disappear . If the view we have thus offered be correct , as we believe it to be , it will be obvious that the people of the United States have done in commerce as they have elsewhere done , and that they have engaged in no war of any description whatsoever , except for self-defence . The consequence of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sixty years since now constitute the wealthiest nation in the world . They have accumulated , within a very brief period , a larger property than is possessed even by the United Kingdom , the wealthiest community of the eastern hemisphere . They make a larger dividend on a larger /z/ capital , and that dividend is made among twenty-one millions ; whereas , that of the other is the portion of twentyeight millions . The consequence is , that they are better fed , better clothed , better lodged , better warmed , and better taught , than any other community . Such is the result of peace abroad , combined with abstinence from interference at home . That such should be the case , is the great triumph of freedom of trade . They have had no excise officers , or tax gatherers , to interfere with the exchanges of property within , while the interferences with exchanges abroad appear to have been even less than were absolutely necessary for self-protection . Indeed , so strong is the tendency to abstinence from interference , that it has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have been found a majority of the people to sanction any ; yet it now appears that it was the result of an instinctive consciousness of what was indispensable for the improvement of their condition : and that that instinct was a safer guide than the theories of those would have directed them . To many , the correctness of this assertion of the superior wealth of the Union may appear doubtful , but a little examination will satisfy them of its truth . That of Great Britain appears greater , because more centralized . The government can borrow money more readily ; but that it can do so is only evidence that capital is not invested as fast as it is produced : that it stagnates : which it never does except where there is some error in the system . At no period during the last sixty years was she so poor as in 1813 ; yet at none did the government make larger loans , or more readily . In the history of France , we are constantly struck with the facility of obtaining loans , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery and wretchedness . That misery was the result of enormous taxation , by which the few were enriched , and they were always ready to lend to the party by whose aid their taxes were collected . The people were too poor and miserable , and property was too insecure , to permit the exist- /z/ ence of a demand for capital ; and therefore it was that the government could borrow at five per cent , at a time when failure in the payment of interest was a matter of frequent occurrence . Such , likewise , was the case in Florence , in time of distress . The government could always borrow , and most readily when wars had rendered property so insecure that trade was almost at an end . The little states of Germany now borrow at four and a half per cent , from bankers and others who are enriched at the expense of the labourer and taxpayer ; but this is an evidence of poverty , and not of wealth . Of a thousand , or ten thousand men : or even hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely one will have- , at any time , a thousand dollars to lend , because each appropriates his profits as fast as earned to the improvement of his farm : to bringing the better soils into operation . Had they a landlord , they would be steadily engaged in laying up that which they would otherwise thus promptly have invested , and on rent-day the proprietor might have $20,000 or $50,000 to lend to government : but the fertile soils would remain inactive unless he chose to make them active , and he might not choose it . Had they a debt of hundreds of millions , quarter-day would see accumulated the large sums required for the dividends , and it would then rest with the public creditors to determine upon the mode of investment , and governments would borrow without difficulty ; whereas , had no such debt existed , each workman , each labourer , each farmer , and each manufacturer , would have invested for his own advantage , as fast as it was made , the amount that otherwise he would have contributed to this fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found , and hence she appears richer than she is ; while in the United States neither exists , and hence they are richer than they appear ; and the rapidity of increase where every man invests on the instant , and on his own property , his otherwise spare labour , or surplus proceeds of labour , is so prodigious as to defy calculation . They are now the wealthiest nation in the /z/ world : and their annual accumulations are at least double those of Great Britain and Ireland , although their average expenditure is greater . They spend more , and yet economize a greater proportion of their earnings than any people in the world . The man who employs his children in robbing his neighbours ' barns and hen-roosts , and lets his farm remain untilled : will continue poor . The soil he cultivates is apparently rich , but really barren . Such has been the course of France . The man who builds a mill in which to grind his neighbours ' grain , and sends a portion of his children to cultivate distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in hauling home their grain , while his own farm remains untilled , will continue poor . He loses labour and manure . The man who does these things , and half-cultivates a large farm , the profits of which make some amends for losses elsewhere , may grow rich slowly . He loses much labour and manure . Such has been the course of England . The farmer who minds his own business , and thus attracts around him the miller , the tanner , the shoemaker , the blacksmith , the carpenter , the wheelwright , the hatter , the spinner , the weaver , and the paper-maker , performs all his exchanges with the most perfect and the least costly machinery of exchange ; and has almost all his labour and manure to put upon his farm , which yields him daily increased returns to that labour , and increases daily in value . He becomes rich . Such has been , so far as it was possible , the course of the United States ; and hence their greater wealth . Such being the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States of the Union have been involved in so much difficulty in regard to the payment of interest on the money borrowed for the construction of roads and canals ? The cause is , we think , easily explained . The tendency of the English system has been that of forcing manufactures and /z/ trade , the consequence of which has been that all other nations have experienced a difficulty in concentrating their population sufficiently to enable them to cultivate the rich soils ; and this in the precise ratio of their intercourse with her . The people of the United States have felt this in the highest degree . They have been forced to scatter themselves over the west , that they might raise food to send abroad to pay for clothing ; and what they needed was machinery of exchange in the form of roads . Those who did thus scatter were poor , for they cultivated soils that yielded small returns ; although surrounded by fertile soils covered with timber that they could not yet remove , or by swamps that they were unable yet to drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while timber abounded in her river-bottoms : and she still was obliged to depend upon her woods for fuel and fencing , while her lands abounded in iron and coal . She had tried to convert her ore into iron , but had suffered heavily by unceasing fluctuations resulting from the unnatural state of things in England . She had tried manufactures : every thing , in short , tending to bring the fashioner to the side of the producer , and thus diminish the cost of the machinery of exchange . Her people were leaving the coal and the ore , to travel w r est in quest of other lands on which to raise more of the already superabundant food . To get this food to market , or to render the vast deposits of coal and ore productive , roads and canals were needed : and this was the great w r ant of the whole country from the Hudson to the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi , because the policy of England limited them to these as their only machinery of exchange . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her periodical overflows of capital . It had been most abundant in 1825 , and all the world had been ruined in I8i6 by the excessive scarcity consequent upon its waste in the mines of Mexico and elsewhere . It overflowed again in 1831 , and the change of that year ruined many , and /z/ rendered very many others indisposed to encounter the risks of trade . In 1833 , it commenced again to overflow , the reason for which was to be found in the fact that the Legislature pertinaciously refused to permit its investment at home . The Liverpool and Manchester Railroad had succeeded , and there was a strong disposition to make other roads ; but peers did not approve of locomotives running near their mansions , and charters could not be obtained . Various applications , therefore , were rejected , after great expenditure by the applicants . One of these that we now recollect , the Rugby , spent .160,000 , or $800,000 , in the mere effort to obtain an act of incorporation , AND FAILED . As it could not be permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the people of Pennsylvania , Maryland , Indiana , and other States south and west , who desired to obtain for themselves better machinery of exchange in the form of roads , railroads , and canals . They had the food , and it could be eaten on the ground ; and England was ready to supply the iron for the roads , and the clothing for those who were to be employed in making them . To work they all went ; but before the roads or canals were so far completed as to be productive , the usual crash came . Capital became so scarce in England that the Bank was on the eve of stoppage ; and traders and manufacturers were ruined by thousands . She now wanted to be paid ; but trade was ruined . The downfall there had filled the markets of the world with cloths and iron , and the manufacturers and iron-masters of the Union were ruined by events over which they had no control , and against which they could not have guarded . Mechanics and workmen of all descriptions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture : and this at the moment when the market for agricultural products was so over-stocked that wheat scarcely paid the freight to the Atlantic cities , and corn w T as almost valueless . The half-made roads and canals produced nothing , and the farmers of the States by which they were made , /z/ could command no money with which to pay taxes by aid of which to meet the interest . Coal ceased to be mined , and the canals upon which it had been carried ceased to receive tolls ; while those who had invested their fortunes in opening mines were ruined . England had destroyed the market for corn at home , and she would receive none : not even to feed her starving workmen . The interest ceased to be paid , and then arose one universal yell throughout all England at the dishonesty of America : of that America whom she had temporarily ruined . Time , however , rolled around , and when corn could again be sold , all gladly co-operated in the effort to place the several States in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing was possible , Pennsylvania , by a unanimous vote of legislators elected by the votes of every man in the State , determined that payment should be resumed , and it was done : and now she is reducing the principal of the debt . Maryland has followed : and Illinois and Indiana , both of which were occupied at the time by a very scattered population , are now preparing to follow in her footsteps . A little while hence , and all will have done so , and none will feel so much satisfaction as those who pay the taxes . Many who have united in the abuse of Pennsylvania and of other States , and of Americans generally , were , doubtless , ignorant of the cause of difficulty ; and unaware that it was to the perpetual error of English policy , and the perpetual disturbance of which it was the cause , that the defalcation on that occasion was due : as well as the losses that on other occasions had fallen on their countrymen . It may safely be asserted that five-sixths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half century may be traced to these causes . In that period we have seen the revulsions of 1815 , 1819 , 1825 , 1831 , 1836 , 1839 , and 1847 , and against such changes no one could guard . Merchants and manufacturers found the markets filled with commodities from abroad , by which their business was destroyed : farmers and miners found their customers /z/ ruined : and perpetual failure was the result . In all countries in which peace has prevailed , wealth has grown ; and where such has been the case , the people have always been honest : and to this America is no exception . On the contrary , we think it safe to say that it is the only country in the world in which the whole body of the people , from the highest to the lowest : all tax payers : could have been found uniting in a determination that the debts of the State should be paid . Were such a question submitted to the whole people of England or of France , the one might do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not . The security for the debt of Pennsylvania is among the best in the world ; for those who are to pay it have resolved unanimously that it shall be paid . The gradual diminution of the consciousness of right , or power , on the part of those who administer the government towards the people , and the increase in the sense of duty towards them , that accompanies the growth of population and the cultivation of the better soils , may be traced in England upwards from the closing of the Exchequer by Charles II . to the latter years of the last century , when an exhausting war was diminishing the growth of both wealth and population . From that period , during twenty years , the government paid its debts in paper , sometimes worth but three-fourths of what the creditor had a right to claim . With peace came wealth , and an accelerated growth of population consequent upon the power of obtaining food in greater abundance ; and with peace returned the feeling of obligation to comply with contracts : and , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , as he must continue to do , so long as wealth and population shall increase ; and his security will increase with every application of labour to the development of the vast resources contained in the bowels of the earth beneath him ; for with every such application the return to labour will increase , and the necessity for armies , fleets , and taxes , will decrease . /z/ In France , perpetually engaged in war and in cultivating the poorer soils , there has been little sense of duty , and great consciousness of power on the part of the government ; and hence her history is one of unceasing failure in her duties to the public creditor : first in the refusal to pay interest , and next in the reduction or repudiation of the debt . The most striking case , and only so because the largest in amount , was that of the regent Duke of Orleans . A long period of comparative peace was accompanied by some increase of wealth and population ; and the growing sense of duty was exhibited in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power prevailed , and they were dismissed . The Revolution followed , with vast waste of treasure and of life . The strong men perished in the field , and the old , the young , and the feeble , combining their exertions with those of the weaker sex , obtained a miserable subsistence from the poorer soils . The public creditor disappeared . His rights were obliterated , and thus power prevailed over duty . Since that period , his rights have been more or less respected ; but the continuance of that respect is dependent upon the growth of population and of wealth . Some are now converting meadows into corn lands , while others are paying the government for the privilege of abandoning altogether their little inheritances . Whole departments are unable to produce a single horse for sale . Cattle and sheep are becoming poorer . Should this process long continue , the sense of power may prevail over that of duty , and the public creditor may again cease to exist . If the reader will now study the history of the public debt of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of interest , at those periods when her people were largely engaged in the cultivation of the distant soils of Mexico and Peru , Italy and the Netherlands , and neglecting the richer soils at their feet : of Austria , for a long series of years : of Denmark and of Holland : and , indeed , of every country of the world : he will find that public faith has grown with the cultivation of /z/ the rich soils , and failure has followed their abandonment : and thus may he acquire a standard absolutely infallible for testing the value of every public stock . So tested , the stocks of the American States present the best security in the world , and their values vary among themselves precisely in the ratio of the difference between the soils they cultivate . Massachusetts goes deepest into her hard soil , while Florida still cultivates the light soils , though abounding in river-bottoms and swamps that will at some future period afford great returns to labour . New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio and Maryland , Illinois , Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in the scale ; Lut all are growing in wealth and numbers , and all are gradually cultivating better soils , and all will soon place themselves side by side with the great State , the leader in American civilization. * The view which we have thus offered of the superiority of the result derived from labour employed in constructing the machine for producing food , to that derived from it-sing other machines of constantly diminishing power , differs greatly from that of the advocates-of Mr. Ricardo 's system . Thus , Mr. McCulloch says : " There are no limits to the bounty of nature in manufactures ; but there are limits , and those not very remote , , to her bounty in agriculture . The greatest possible amount of capital might be expended in the construction of steam-engines , or of any other sort of machinery ; and after they had been multiplied indefinitely , the last would be as powerful and efficient in producing commodities and saving labour as the first . Such , however , is not the case with the soil . Lands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to apply capital indefinitely even to the best soils , without obtaining from it a constantly diminishing rate of profit . " All this might be true if man did /z/ speedily exhaust the best soils ; but , as he is always going from a poor soil to a better , and then returning on his footsteps to the original poor one , and turning up the marl or the lime ; and so on , in continued succession : and as he has done so in every nation of the world where population and wealth have been permitted to increase : and as , at each step in this course , he is making a better machine : the converse of Mr. McCulloch 's proposition may prove to be true . It is held that there are no limits to the capital that may be profitably expended in engines , because all are equal to the first ; but that there are limits to that which may be employed in agriculture , because , the last is necessarily inferior to the first . If , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superior to the previous ones : then capital may be invested in agriculture with more advantage than in engines , because the last are only of equal , whereas the other is of superior , pcnver . A steam-engine produces nothing . It diminishes the labour required for converting wool into cloth , or grain into flour : for freeing mines from water : or for transporting wool , or grain , or coal . The gain from its use is the wages of that labour , minus the loss by deterioration of the machine . Labour applied to fashioning the earth produces wages , plus the gain by improvement of the machine . The more an engine can be made to yield the worse it will become . The more the earth can be made to yield the better will it become . The man who neglects his farm to employ himself and his engine in the work of fashioning or exchanging the products of other farms , obtains wages , minus loss of capital . He who employs himself on his own farm obtains wages , plus profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that that improvement exceeds the loss from the deterioration of the spades , ploughs , engines , or other machinery that is used . To test the correctness of this view , we submit two cases to the consideration of the reader . A. and B. have each a horse and cart , and a farm from which they can have three hundred bushels of wheat : or its equivalent . An offer is made to give them each that quantity , but the distance is so /z/ great that the hauling will occupy precisely the same time as the raising would do . A. accepts , and B. does not . A. spends his time , and that of his horse and cart , on the road . B. stays at home . When it rains , A. stops in the road-side tavern . B. spends the same day at home , repairing his house . When A. 's horse feeds and rests , his master has nothing to do . B. grubs up an old root , or repairs a fence . A. 's horse deposits his manure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . A. 's horse hauls every day , and the service performed , nothing remains . B. opens a marl pit , and puts on his land manure for two or three years . At the end of the year A. 's horse and cart are worn out , while B. 's are almost as good as new . The farm of A. has deteriorated , while that of B. is greatly improved . - Both have done the same number of days ' work , and both have received the same compensation , yet A. is poorer and B. richer than at first . Every diminution in the quantity required of the machinery of exchange tends to increase the quantity of labour , both of body and mind , that may be applied directly to production : and such labour is rewarded with an increased return , and an increase in the powers of the machine itself . Such has been the case in all time past , and such will it ever continue to be . It is by this almost insensible contribution of labour that land acquires value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin soils is to obtain food and clothing for himself and his family . His leisure is given to the work of improvement . At one place he cuts a little drain , and at another he roots out a stump . At one moment he cuts fuel for his family , and thus clears his land ; and at another digs a well to facilitate the watering of his cattle , and thus keep his manure in the stable yard . He knows that the machine will feed him better the more perfectly he fashions it , and that there is always place for his time and his labour to be expended with advantage to himself . A same , will scarcely command , 1000 . Why should this difference /z/ exist ? It is because the buyer of the first knows that it will pay him wages anjl interest , plus the increase of its value by use . The buyer of the other knows that it will give him wages and interest , minus the diminution in its value by use . The one takes three and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , minus the difference . The one buys a machine that improves by use . The other , one that deteriorates with use . The one is buying a machine produced by the labour of past times , and to the creation of which has been applied all the spare time of a series of generations : and he gives for it one-third or one-half of the labour that would be now required to produce it in its present state , were it reduced to its original one . That of the other is bought at the actual price of the labour that it has cost . The one is a machine upon which new capital and labour may be expended with constantly increasing return ; while upon the other no such expenditure can be made . We have now before us an account of the operations at Knowsley , where an expenditure of 7 , 105. per acre for draining has been rewarded by an increase of 205. in rent , or more than thirteen per cent . In another case , where land had been abandoned as totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been attended with a gain of 105. per acre to the owner , and 105. to the tenant , making fifty per cent , per annum : without taking into consideration the gain to the labourer in the increased facility of procuring the necessaries of life . Lord Stanley , who furnishes this statement , says , and we are sure most truly , that although he and his father have for several years laid a million of tiles per annum , they feel that they had only made a beginning. * We believe that they have , even yet , scarcely begun to think upon the subject . They are only beginning to waken up . We have also before us an account of a field so completely worn /z/ out that it produced , with manure , but five hundred weight of turnips , but which , by being treated with sulphuric acid and bones , was made to yield two hundred and eighty-fire hundred weight ; and another , which gave to coal ashes and coal Just but eighty-eight hundred weight , gave to the acid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits are not to be found in any other pursuit : and yet England has been wasting her energies on ships , colonies , and commerce , having at her feet an inexhaustible magazine asking only to be worked . The improvement above described is remarkable , only because concentrated within a short space of time . Had the land described by Lord Stanley been cultivated by the owner , and had he felt that agriculture was a science worthy of his attention ; the drainage would have taken place gradually , and the improvement would have been marked by a gradual growth in the power to pay better wages and more rent . We have before us a notice of land rented for nine hundred pounds , at the close of a long lease at one hundred and thirty pounds . During all this time , its owner has had interest on his capital , and at the close of the lease , his capital has increased seven times . His investment was better than it would have been in steam-engines at ten per cent. , because his engineer paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas , the steam-engineer would have required to be paid while wearing the machine out . Everybody is content with small interest , and sometimes with no interest , from land , where population and wealth are rapidly growing , because there capital is steadily augmenting without effort . The house in which we write has greatly augmented in value , while we have had interest in the use of it . Instead of six per cent. , we have twenty per cent. , and this is the experience of all men who own landed property where population and wealth are permitted to increase : for they will always increase if not prevented by interferences like those which have existed in England , and to a still greater ex- /z/ tent in France . The great pursuit of man is agriculture . There is none " in which so many of the laws of nature must be consulted and understood as in the cultivation of the earth . Every change of the season , every change even of the winds , every fall of rain , must affect some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our various domestic animals , some of the most abstruse principles of physiology must be consulted . Is it to be supposed that men thus called upon to study , or to observe the laws of nature , and labour in conjunction with its powers , require less of the light of the highest science than the merchant or the manufacturer ? " * It is not . It is the science that requires the greatest knowledge , and the one that pays best for it : and yet England has driven man , and wealth , and mind , into the less profitable pursuits of fashioning and exchanging the products of other lands : and has expended thousands of millions on fleets and armies to enable her to drive with foreign nations the poor trade : when her own soil offered her the richer one that tends to produce that increase of wealth and concentration of population which have in all times and in all ages given the self-protective power that requires neither fleets , nor armies , nor tax-gatherers . In her efforts to force this trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend themselves over vast tracts of inferior land when they might more advantageously have concentrated themselves on rich ones : and she has thus delayed the progress of civilization abroad and at home . She has made it necessary for the people of grain-growing countries to rejoice in the deficien- . cies of her harvests , as affording them the outlet for surplus food that they could not consume , and that was sometimes abandoned on the field , as not worth the cost of harvesting ; instead of being enabled to rejoice in the knowledge that others were likely to be fed as abundantly as themselves . Her internal system was unsound , and her wealth gave her power /z/ to make that unsoundness a cause of disturbance to the world : and hence she has appeared to be everywhere regarded as a sort of common enemy . The tendency of her navigation laws was greatly to increase the quantity required of the machinery of exchange : and the resistance thereto was an instinctive effort at self-protection . That resistance was led by the United States . American ships were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they therefore rendered it impossible for English ships to do certain things that American ships might do . For a brief time English ships came in ballast and went home loaded , and American ships went to England in ballast and brought home cargoes : and thus two ships were doing the work of one . The result was , that all were put upon a footing , and the quantity required of the machinery of exchange was so far diminished that exchanges were performed with far less labour than before ; the consequence of which has been that exchanges have increased greatly in number , while the loss by friction : or the cost of exchanging : has fallen , and the work is better done. * It would seem as if the general resistance to English shipping and manufactures had been the necessary effort for the establishment of perfect freedom of trade , and for securing to the world at large , eventually , the most perfect efficiency of exchange : while reducing the quantity of machinery required for the purpose . England could produce food and machinery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and every step in that direction would have tended to render production more and more easy . Other countries wanted machinery to enable them to concentrate their population and to consume their food at home . She refused ma- * Various devices were fallen upon to counteract the navigation system of the Americans , without in any degree relaxing our own : but they all failed of their object ; and at length it became obvious to every one that we had engaged in an unequal struggle , and that the real effect of our policy was to give u bounty on the importation of the manufactured goods of other countries into the Untied States , and thus gradually to exclude our manufactures and our shipping from the ports of the republic . " McCulloch. /z/ chinery , and sent cotton and woollen goods which they would have preferred to make ; and she fixed her prices high or low , as suited her own convenience : the result of which was , that with each successive effort they were ruined . So with ships . Sometimes she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were high . If she was at peace she had ships to spare . If at war , they were scarce , and freights were high . The whole system of that country , in past times , has been marked by a desire to force her own capital and labour off in a wrong direction : from the profitable to the unprofitable : and every step she is now making exhibits a tendency in the right one . Wiser grown , she now looks to home , and is experiencing , at every turn , the wonderful effect of self-cultivation . She is investing vast wealth in railroads , but it grows with the expenditure ; for she is now building up the great machine to produce food and raw materials of every description for which her climate is suited . She is expending , as we believe , an equal amount of labour in draining and clearing lands ; but her wealth grows with every step in this direction , for the great machine is producing the food and the clothing that are used in building it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is furnishing machinery to almost all Europe : a consequence of all of which is that her exports of cotton goods are no longer what they were . Every steam-engine she sends to the continent tends to produce a demand for railroad iron ; and every railroad makes demands for engines , and for finer commodities in lieu of the coarser ones she was before accustomed to export . Every new soil that is improved at home tends to produce a demand for engines , and every engine tends to increase the power of producing new and better soils . / The interests of all are ultimately to be promoted by perfect freedota of trade , and such has always been the case : but the persistence by a nation so wealthy as England in a course sTTadverse to the growth of civilization at home and abroad , tended to produce discords calculated to render its establish- /z/ ment absolutely impossible , and a long time may yet be required for its accomplishment . The PAST says to the landlord of the PRESENT : " I have erred . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted on armies , and fleets , and colonies . Your lands are far less valuable than they might have been made , and your children are forced to seek employment abroad , when they might be more prosperous and happy at home . Take warning by my example . Avoid war , and preparations for war , and your wealth will rapidly increase . " To the labourer it says : " I have erred , and you have suffered . Food has been high , and wages low . Labour to prevent war , and preparations for war . Your wages will then increase , and you will acquire power over your own actions , and may stay at home . " To the manufacturer it says : " I Jiave forced labour and capital into trade and manufactures , and the result has been universal unsteadiness . Study to promote economy and the growth of a home market , which will be more steady and more profitable than any foreign ones . The people abroad who eat their own food and make their own coarse clothing , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shall have ceased to disturb the world , you will see perfect freedom and perfect steadiness of trade . " To all it says : " Labour to acquire power over the land that has been given to you , and with each step the feeling of necessity will diminish ; while with each the consciousness of power over yourselves , your feelings , thoughts , and actions , will increase . " /z/ THE first cultivator occupies such spots as his small means will permit him to use . He has yet acquired no power to compel the land to yield him what is needed for his comfortable subsistence . With the acquisition of the spade he turns under , and thus expels , the wild grass : substituting for it the oats , or the barley , or the rye , as he deems one or the other best fitted for his purpose . In the outset he requires much land , because but small portions can be made to yield to his demands any return whatsoever . With the growth of his wealth : with the acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become productive ; and , by degrees , he finds , on a few acres , more continuous employment for his time than , in the outset , was found upon a thousand . His family , too , has grown . If all continue to cultivate the whole quantity , there will be great waste of labour . The territory he has occupied covers several square miles ; and the time required to walk to and from their work will be so much deduction from that which should be given to the cultivation of the soil , or of their own physical and mental powers . Each takes his share , and each builds himself a house . Each cultivates his own land ; and each calls upon his brothers for aid in harvest : or in building a barn : or rolling logs : or quarrying stone . All are separate , but all are therefore interested in making roads by which all may be enabled to unite . While ' all lived in the same house , their labours were wasted in bringing home the fruits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that all work separately ; that each man eats on his own land the rye or the oats needed /z/ for his support ; each feels more and more the advantage to be derived from increasing the facility of obtaining the aid that may be required : and thus the division of land consequent upon the increase of wealth in the form of spades and axes , tends to produce increase of wealth in the form of roads : thus increasing the power of union , while diminishing the necessity therefor . Each labours on his own land , and each labours faithfully , because labouring for himself . Each makes , or procures from elsewhere , some machine calculated to increase the powers of himself and his neighbour ; and all combine , at times , to procure those things which , important to all , are beyond the means of any . If we look to Attica in the days of her prosperity , we see a tendency to the division of land , and the union of men . If we look to her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal proprietor , and universal builder , while union among men has ceased to exist . If we look to Rome in the days of Servius , we see a vast body of small proprietors enriching themselves by the cultivation of their own land . If we look again , we see universal poverty : the numerous little and prosperous proprietors being replaced by Scipios and Pompeys , owning vast tracts and overwhelmed by debts , while disunited men have become slaves . So , again , if we look to Gaul , or Africa . Everywhere throughout the world , the tendency to division of land and combination of action among men has grown with the growth of wealth : while poverty has produced its concentration in the hands of a few proprietors , and disunion among its occupants . We see this now exhibited on a large scale in the south of Spain , where a few grandees have replaced the honest , industrious , and enlightened Moors , who combined their exertions for bringing into activity the best soils of their own land , and for fashioning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great business of mankind is the production of food , and the raw materials of commodities and things necessary to Enable man to enjoy the conveniences , comforts , or lux- /z/ uries of life . That he may do this , the Deity has given him the command of a great laboratory , in which exist all the elements of production , waiting only the application of the physical and mental powers with which he has been endowed , to render them available for his purpose . The gift was accompanied with the command to labour , that he might have food for himself and his children : to labour , that he might have clothing and shelter : to labour , that he might acquire knowledge : to labour , that he might enjoy leisure and repose . It is a great workshop , in which combination of effort yields largely , but can . scarcely have existence when men cultivate the poor soils . To combination division is essential , and where that does not exist , the progress of cultivation is always slow . Hence the wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exists the partial right of common , as on most of those of France , under the system of vaine pature . Starting from the point of absolute barbarism , when all land is held in common , it will be found that the cultivation improves with every approach towards absolute ownership . Thus , it is better now in every part of England than in any part in the days when men were serfs , and had in land no property whatsoever . It is better where short leases exist than where all are tenants at will . It is better where long leases exist than where they are short , and the highest cultivation is invariably found where the owner and occupant are one and the same , and where there exists every inducement to the most perfect economy of time and labour . Thus it is better in Cumberland , where heads of families are generally proprietors of a few acres , than in Wilts or Dorset , where it is held in large masses , and cultivated by hired labourers . This may again be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of the Arno ; in the rich fields and the neat and comfortable houses of the small landholders of Belgium ; and in the high ' prosperity of the same class in Norway . The division of land , and its cultivation by the owner for his /z/ own profit , are the necessary consequences of the growth of wealth ; and with each step in this direction agriculture becomes more and more a science , furnishing employment for minds of the highest order , and yielding the largest returns to their exertions . It ceases to be the labour of the slave , and becomes the refined and elegant occupation of the gentleman , who gives to the direction of a small estate all his faculties , and obtains a liberal reward for permitting a portion of its proceeds to be applied to its improvement ; while to those who execute with their hands what he plans with his head , large wages are afforded : and he finds in this employment greater happiness than was enjoyed by those of his predecessors whose thousands of acres were scratched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captor on the field of battle . Such is the tendency of things when wealth and population grow . War and waste produce a reverse effect , , and land concentrates itself in fewer hands . Hence it is that the age of barbarism , dignified with the title of that of the Feudal System , has been seen to inflict upon the world the right of primogeniture , another of the weak inventions by which man endeavours to set aside the great laws of nature : but over which she invariably triumphs when men remain at peace . The views of M. de Tocqueville in this respect are widely different . He says : " When the legislator has once regulated the law of inheritance , he may rest from his labour . The machine once put in motion will go on for ages , and advance , as if selfguided , to a certain point . When framed in a particular manner , this law unites , draws together , and vests property in a few hands its tendency is clearly aristocratic . On opposite principles its action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disperses both property and power . Alarmed by the rapidity of its progress , those who despair of arresting its motion , endeavour to obstruct it by difficulties and impediments : they vainly seek to counteract its effect by con- /z/ trary efforts : but it gradually reduces or destroys every obstacle , until by its unceasing activity , the bulwarks of the influence of wealth are ground down to the fine and shifting sand which is the basis of democracy . " In no part of Europe has the law of primogeniture been more firmly established than in England ; yet in none in which it has existed has there been seen a stronger tendency to the division of land , as has been shown by the numerous shifts and contrivances invented to bar entails , and to remove other obstacles to the division and sale of landed property : the result of which is seen in the fact that she possesses now more than 200,000 proprietors . Down to the commencement of the recent great war , such was the invariable tendency ; but during the period of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned together . The few became greater , and the many smaller ; and had the war been continued on the same scale for another period of twenty years , that country might have exhibited to the world princes like those of Esterhazy , wearing coats covered with diamonds and surrounded by serfs in rags . With the long-continued peace , a different state of things is gradually arising . Mechanics are purchasing freeholds , and landlords are forming cottage allotments ; a small beginning , it is true , but one that shows the tendency of the time . Tenants are claiming longer leases , and landlords are beginning - to perceive that short leases and large rents can not exist together . They themselves have already taken a perpetual lease , at a fixed rent , from the Church . Tenants are now claiming of them the right to be paid for their improvements , perhaps the first step towards perpetual leases , and eventual proprietorship . Each step in this direction is but the preparation for a new one . Railroads raise wages . Drainage raises wages for labourer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own land for their own profit . With each such step the proportion of the owner decreases , although his quantity of rent increases : and with /z/ each there is a tendency to a rise in the standard of living , and to equality of condition . The ability of the non-labourer to hold large tracts of land becomes less when compared with the ability of the labourer to buy it : while the inducement to the latter to obtain a piece of land that he can cultivate after his own fashion , tends daily to increase . The wages of skill and knowledge have risen : and the reward of mere wealth has failed , and must necessarily fail , to keep pace therewith . The great proprietor must work . He now does work , and he finds in the enjoyment of occasional leisure that happiness which a life of idleness and ennui had failed to afford . It is , we think , impossible to look to any part of England without seeing this operation either commenced , or about to commence . In some portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the memory of persons now living . In the north , where wealth grows rapidly , and the best soils are cultivated , the tendency to division is greater than in the south : and it is far greater in the neighbourhoods of rapidly-advancing Liverpool and Manchester , than in those of declining Winchester and Bristol . In the one direction we see a daily increasing tendency towards harmony and union between the owner of the land and the man who cultivates it : while in the other we see universal discord and disunion , marked by perpetual barn-burnings , poaching , Rebecca-riots , and trials for arson and for violations of the game laws : all tending to show a very demoralized condition of society . When wealth grows , men unite , morally and physically : and the more they tend to unite , the faster it grows , and the greater is the tendency towards division of land . When wealth diminishes and population declines , it invariably concentrates itself in fewer hands . In France , always at war , wealth could not grow . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Property concentrated itself in the hands of the church and the great nobles . The Revolution came , and it annihilated both . To prevent the future concentration of land , it was enacted /z/ that at the death of the owner it should be divided among his children , excepting , however , a very small share that he might , if he thought proper , bequeath beyond the limits of his family . The confiscation was bad . It was a violation of the rights of property , and such measures are always bad : always impolitic : because nature remedies all grievances , when permitted to act . It was , however , done , and nothing now was needed but to permit labour to be applied to compelling the land to yield up its rich treasures , and thus to cause wealth to grow : and that wealth would have been applied to the further improvement of the land , increasing the product and enabling a constantly increasing population to obtain larger supplies of food in return to the labour employed in producing , and in fashioning. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer , the various products of the soil . Such , however , was not the policy of the rulers , or of the gentlemen , of France . They preferred Italy , Germany , Spain , and even Russia , to their own soil , and they exhausted the population and the wealth of the Empire , in vain endeavours to obtain from abroad what at home nature courted them to accept . With the battle of Waterloo closed a period of exhaustion ; but , since that time , repeated revolutions and attempts thereat have prevented the growth of any feeling of security , while the maintenance of immense armies and fleets : expensive palaces : and kings and princes : and a body of officials , whose name is legion : have prevented and still prevent the growth of wealth and population , without which the better soils can not be cultivated . The consequence is , that there is no demand for labour , and the process of division goes on . More than two and a half millions of proprietors have incomes of $10 or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seven hundred and thirty-seven thousand have between $20 and $40 . Between $40 and $100 , there are seven hundred thousand : while the whole number of families whose revenue exceeds $2000 is under seven thousand . Properties are in many cases , so subdivided that men are /z/ willing to abandon them to the government , but even this they can not do , except on payment of a tax of about forty cents , and until that shall be paid they must remain responsible for the taxes on the land , averaging twenty cents per acre . If they attempt to sell them , the tax is equivalent to two years ' rent . Under such circumstances , it is not extraordinary that the land should be almost literally shingled over with mortgages , notwithstanding the enormous charges for fees of registration , &c.,; by which the interest is not unfrequently doubled , and sometimes raised even to a higher point . Interest and taxes swallow up , as we have , already said , seventy per cent , of the rent , and the balance is squabbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A century since , the families that lived by the law were thirty thousand in number , and the business was immensely lucrative . Since then the number has , we believe , greatly increased , and we can hardly doubt that the amount divided among them has also increased . The whole system of France tends to remove property out of the control of those who have laboured for its production , and to give it to those who have not laboured : and tending thereby to produce that grinding down " into the fine and shifting sand which is the basis of " not democracy but turbulence , anarchy and slavery . Throughout her whole history it has been seen forcing men to live in villages while cultivating land at a distance , thus diminishing greatly the productiveness of labour : and now , we see there two millions of poor proprietors , with their little bits of garden , pasture , and arable land , and vineyards , scarcely ever lying together ; but here a little and there a little , some in the valley and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . The foreclosure of mortgages , therefore , comes , and the real owners the mortgagees take possession . How far such is the tendency may be seen from the fact that in the ten years from 1826 to 1835 , thirty per cent , of the whole territorial property changed hands by sale , exchange , and /z/ forfeiture , being about as much as changed by means of inheritance and gift . Such is the necessary consequence of the present state of things . In the Netherlands , the power of division exists in its fill extent , yet there the son does not claim his part merely because entitled to it . Wealth increases because men cultivate fertile soils , and a demand for labour consequently exists in other employments . The consumer and producer are near neighbours to each other . If the piece which the son may claim be not sufficient to afford him support , he lets or sells it to his brother : and thus the tendency to division is counteracted by the power of the owner to judge for himself as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So in Norway , distinguished for the industry and economy of its people , both wealth and population grow , and the tendency towards grinding down the land has no existence . Properties there remain undiminished for centuries . In the United States , the right of primogeniture existed . It disappeared as wealth and population grew . In no part of the world does the democratic tendency exist so much as in Massachusetts and generally in New England , and in none are the forms used in the conveyance of land so simple , yet there the tendency to minute subdivision has no existence . M. de Tocqueville himself informs us that the " laws of the United States are extremely favourable to a division of landed property : but that a cause which is more powerful than the laws prevents property from being divided to excess . " He adds , that " the law has abolished the right of primogeniture , but that circumstances have concurred to reestablish it under a form of which none can complain , and by which no just rights are impaired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the demand for labour and skill grow more rapidly than population . No one will cultivate a piece of land that will not afford him full wages , and hence we iind , invariably , that when too small for advantageous division , one son takes the property , paying to the /z/ others their share , to enable them to apply , with advantage to themselves , their labour , or their skill , in Lowell , or in Providence . In no country is the tendency to perfect individuality and freedom of action so great ; in none is the tendency to union so universal : and in none is the power of man over land so complete . Perfect individuality , and the tendency to union , keep pace , invariably , with the growth of wealth and the division of land . The land of the great noble of the middle ages was bound to give him a certain amount of rent , and for this his serfs were jointly bound . Unlimited liability solidarite was the universal rule . If one failed to work or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serf was nameless . He was merely a serf : one of those who were to do the work . So we find it , even now , in India , where villages are assessed en masse ; and when some of the unfortunate ryots abandon their little properties in despair at their utter inability to comply with the unceasing demands for rent claimed by the Company 's government , the rest are held liable for the deficiency . So again , in France , where the people of provinces , and towns , and villages , were all held liable for the taxes ; and when the dragons of Louvois had expelled the laborious and economical Huguenots , the Catholics who remained were held bound to make up the full amount . With the growth of population and of wealth , land becomes divided , and individuals make contracts to pay fixed rents ; and thus every man acquires power to determine for himself what shall be the extent of his liability : and this tendency is always greatest where men cultivate the richest soils , as may be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rights . His landlord 's game consumes his crop , yet must he pay the full rent ; whereas in Lancashire or Lincoln , the rights of all are strictly defined . In the one , poor men , who live in mud hovels , still cultivate the poor lands first occupied . In the other , they live in houses , and cultivate the rich soils that two centuries since were swamps and forests . /z/ This tendency to freedom of individual action in the making of contracts for other purposes keeps pace with that in relation to land . Throughout Europe , the right of men to associate has been at all times limited , through a jealousy of every thing like tendency to union among the people , which induced sovereigns and those by whom they were surrounded , to insist upon continuing in relation to them the principle of unlimited liability . Exemptions from it have always been obtained as matters of favour : by aid of royal charters . These exemptions are more or less numerous as population and wealth increase rapidly or slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In France , they are granted invariably as favours , and applications therefor , unsupported by powerful interest , are useless. * In England , they were granted only to a few powerful companies , to enable them to monopolize certain branches of trade : and even so recently as the latter part of the last century , the formation of joint-stock associations with transferable stock , for any purpose , was absolutely prohibited . With the gradual increase of wealth and population , and with the cultivation of the better soils , we see a gradual relaxation of the system of solidarite , and charters are now granted to railroad companies , because without them roads could not be made . They are , however , still refused to associations for most other purposes . In the United States , we can see this tendency to perfect freedom in the making of contracts , whether for the rent of land or for other purposes , steadily increasing as we pass from those States in which they cultivate the poor lands to those in which they cultivate the rich soils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gangs , and each man is individually liable for the performance of the * The reader who desires to understand the restrictions on Commercial Association in France , will find them fully explained in the Revise des deux Mondes , for July , 1845 , in an article by M. Coquelin , translated and republished in the Merchant 's Magazine for May and June , 1845. /z/ whole work . No contract for rent is here made , ai.J here it is that we find the greatest hostility to exemption from the same principle in regard to all other of the pursuits of life . In the new States of the west , where population is small and scattered , and the rich soils are untouched , the same state of things is found . Union among themselves is difficult , and jealousy of unions exists . In Pennsylvania , much of whose richest lands is yet uncleared , the same jealousy has always existed ; but as the various soils : the lime , the coal , and the iron-bearing soils : are coming into activity , it tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union has there existed the same tendency to the concentration of land in the hands of a few persons , nor has there been elsewhere exhibited so forcibly its effect in preventing the union of man . The first has been always , to a great extent , held in masses , and corporations have been formed for the purpose of so continuing to hold it . This latter state of things is found chiefly in the coal region of the Lehigh river , which while possessed of every advantage for a great trade , has ever been unable to contend , because of the monopoly of land , with the Schuylkill region , in which the lands were divided among numerous owners , and were frequently passing from hand to hand . In the first , the union of man has no existence , and wealth grows slowly . In the second , it is seen everywhere , and wealth and population grow rapidly , producing a demand for the products of the earth tending to bring the more fertile soils into full activity . As we pass north from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense , and a greater tendency to perfect individuality , accompanied by an increasing tendency to union , and . an increasing power to unite on such terms as may be deemed best for the parties who contract . These things are found to a greater extent in New York than in Pennsylvania : but as we approach Massachusetts and Rhode Island , where men devote themselves most assiduously to bringing into activity all the powers of the earth , we find in- /z/ dividuality , the tendency to union , and the power to unite , in a greater degree than in any other portion of the world . There , all have property . There the rights of person and property are most strictly defined and best maintained : and there it is that large capitalists and little shopkeepers ; large farmers and little labourers ; large manufacturers and little spinners and weavers ; widows and orphans , clergymen and doctors , editors and authors , and lawyers ; are found uniting for the building of factories , the making of railroads , and every other of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the productiveness of labour . If we desire now to find the cause of the rapid advance of the poor and scattered colonists of the United States towards wealth and power , we must seek it in the division of the land . Every man lives , or , if he . will , may live , in his own house and lot , or on his own farm . He works , or , if he will , he may , in his own shop . He drives his own wagon , and commands the ship , of which he is owner in whole or in part . The ship carpenter builds the ship of which he is to be part owner , and the iron founder makes engines for the factory in whose stock he has purchased shares . The female operative works in the mill of which she is part owner , that she may gather means to furnish the house of which she is to be sole mistress : and the coal miner looks forward to the time when he can work his own vein of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his footsteps . All these phenomena , although some of them are apparently unconnected with land , are the natural results of its division . The landlord who collects large rents patronises his own farmer , his own agent , his own shopkeeper , his own lawyer , his own doctor , and his own carpenter , and these men have all what is termed a valuable connection . " All this is fully exhibited in the Lehigh coal region of Pennsylvania . Great companies prefer great tenants , and little men can not rent mines . Great tenants keep great shops , at which the little inec /z/ must make their exchanges , for competition is rendered impossible . Great companies and tenants patronize their own lawyers , and doctors , and carpenters , and bridge-builders , and road-makers ; the consequence of which is an universal dulness and stagnation . The miner lives in the company 's house , and works company land ; and his daughter is idle , for there is no demand for labour . With wealth unlimited beneath the surface , the houses upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lime needed to improve even the exterior appearance of their houses being deemed a luxury too great to be afforded to their occupants . If , now , we pass westward , a few miles , to the Schuylkill region , where land is divided , and where each man looks after his own property , we see a totally different state of affairs . There patronage can not exist . Every working miner seeks to have his own house and lot , and each looks to the time when he may work for himself , either as tenant or owner . Every man selects his own shop with W 7 hich to trade ; his own lawyer with whom to consult ; his own doctor ; and his own carpenter , when he would build . The consequence is universal activity and energy , and universal demand for labour . The daughter finds a demand for her services in making dresses for her thriving neighbours ; and she can marry , because she can aid in furnishing the house ; while her husband , the journeyman carpenter , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , and living in his own house , occupied by his own wife and children ; and that house is built on his own lot , within which he cultivates his own garden in his hours of leisure . If , now , we substitute England and America for the Lehigh and Schuylkill coal regions , the same picture will answer . The first is filled with great land-owners , great farmers , great merchants , great bankers , great lawyers , great architects , great manufacturers , great ship-owners , and great corporations , all living in palaces ; while the people cultivate the lands of others ; live in the houses of others ; work in the WEALTH ANfc LAND . 151 factories or the mines of others ; tend the shops of others ; command the ships of others ; and , as a necessary consequence , a vast portion are obliged to eat the food of others . Patronage is universal . The great do not need to work , and the small work without spirit . The first are idle , for want of disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of work to do . The first waste , because they may . The second do not economize , because they want confidence in the future . In America , from north to south , we find the state of things that has been described as existing in the Schuylkill valley : greatest in the north , and gradually diminishing as we pass south and west . Every man is working for himself , and anxious to have his own house and lot : or farm : or shop . Those who have houses and lots , and farms and shops , have in them their own little savings ' banks , in which they deposit all their spare hours and half hours : their spare dollars and half dollars : and thus there is made , almost insensibly , an addition to the wealth of the community , the amount of which , could it be ascertained , would be deemed incredible . Those who have not yet houses and lots , or farms , or shops , have at hand the little factory , or the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neighbourhood : in which they make their deposits , there to remain until they shall have enough to buy the house or the farm , or to setup the shop . Wealth thus accumulates rapidly , and produces a constant demand for labour . Everyone feels that he can " go ahead " if he will , and everybody , therefore , does ; the necessary consequence of which is , that those who are " ahead " must work to keep so . If they pause but for a moment they are left behind ; and this is equally true , intellectually and physically . Every man will educate his children , and will have his own newspaper , and will have portraits , whether in oil or daguerreotype , of his family ; and will invent his own machine ; and the rich must study books , and newspapers , and pictures , and machinery , if they would maintain their position in the world . To this state of things is due the vast productive power of /z/ the Union , far exceeding that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and not to the abundance of land , upon the poor soils of which they have been forced to scatter themselves ; expending upon them , and upon distant roads and canals , labour that would have been thrice more productive if employed upon the river bottoms of the older States : upon the marl and the limestone , the coal and the iron : all of which would long since have been done , could they have concentrated themselves as they would naturally have desired to do . To this it is due , that while they are the greatest producers and the greatest consumers , they are the greatest accumulators of the world . Every man has , in his own home , his own saving fund : in his own farm , or house , or shop : and each is desirous of making his deposits as large as possible . Therefore , each dislikes taxes . Taxes come with wars . Therefore , each dislikes wars . The question of peace or war rests always with himself , and others like himself , who cultivate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having their own houses , and lots , and shops , and mills , and factories , to look after , have no need to seek employment in the work of robbing and plundering their neighbours . Therefore , he and they prefer peace . With peace grow wealth , and strength , and the power of self-protection , whether by means of armies and fleets : if needed : or by means of laws for restraining their neighbours who desire to compel them to use their ships , or to wear their cloths . They are too rich to quarrel with ; and therefore it is that causes of quarrel , whether in regard to boundary lines ; or indemnity for spoliations on the ocean ; or restrictions on their commerce ; or interference with the personal rights of their citizens ; disappear . They prefer peace , and therefore it is that they have it . They need , therefore , neither fleets nor armies. * * War with Mexico could never have arisen had it been left to the people to declare it . Mexico commenced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives accepted the defiance ; but had it been left to the people to decide the question , the decision , even then , would have been for peace . /z/ If , now , to the great accumulations resulting from the existence of these millions of savings ' banks , small and great , we add those resulting from the absence of taxes for the support of ruinous wars : and for preparations for war in time of peace : which latter , on the scale of those of England , would consume a hundred millions a year : we may readily account for at least jive hundred millions now annually invested , in addition to what would be invested were land held by great landholders : by men who sought in the maintenance of colonies , requiring fleets and armies , the means of providing for themselves and their dependents . These five hundred millions add annually to the productive power at least one hundred millions . If the reader will calculate the result of such an investment , and such a return , he will be enabled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealthiest country of the world ; and the result at which he will arrive will be that it is due to the division , and not to the quantity , of land . This estimate of the excess of the power of accumulation is equal to twenty-four dollars , or five pounds sterling , per head . A very large portion of this sum may be accounted for by the greater diligence of men who apply their labour on their own property ; but much is the result of other causes . England persists in relying upon the poor soils of Poland , Canada , and other parts of the world , for a portion of her supply of food , which she might obtain from her own rich ones ; and that is now obtained by the aid of the most cumbrous machinery . It is a rule in mechanics , that the more directly power is applied , the less is the friction and the greater is the effect : . and that with every increase in the quantity of machinery , friction increases and power diminishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence it is that food is high , and that wages are low . In many parts of England , the agricultural labourer has but nine shillings per week , while the ordinary price of wheat is not less than fifty shillings per quarter , and it is frequently more . The labourer has for his /z/ week 's work , therefore , but about a bushel and a quarter , or a bushel and a third per week , for all purposes , and he can accumulate nothing . Throughout the United States , the labourer has about seventy-five cents per day , which will not vary materially from the average price of a bushel of wheat : which would give six bushels as the price of a week 's work . He can , therefore , consume more than the English labourer receives , and still lay up more than half his wages . That he does this is every day seen . In tens of thousands of cases , the unmarried labourer has from a hundred to a hundred and twenty dollars per annum , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole amount of his wages remains in the hands of his employer , or is temporarily invested : afterwards to be employed in the purchase of a little farm . The large capitalist profits in a similar manner from the cheapness of food , and the result of such accumulation by the two classes is prodigious . Again , no capital need remain idle , or even but partially productive , where the habit of combined exertion exists in so great a degree as in the United States , and where capital is active , labour is rendered productive . In England , on the contrary , the former often stagnates , and the latter is often unproductive . The waste in that country is almost incredible . The city of London , * has vast estates , chiefly Irish confiscations , that * The income of this corporation is as follows : Trust estates - - - 360,000 Local rates - - 230,000 Coal duties and street and market tolls 200,000 Freedom and livery fines - - 50,000 Port of London - - - 60,000 900,000 , or $4,320,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of officers is two hundred and sixty-three , with salaries varying from 100 to 8000 per annum , and these offices are filled invariably by friends and relations of aldermen and common council men . The private extortion of the body , individually and collectively , adds greatly to the above amount . The consequence of all this is , that the prudent tly to escape extortion , but the pauper remains " and the poor /z/ yield above , 300,000 per annum , most of which is squandered ; while poor taxes are heavy , and the provision for education is very bad . A single entertainment has cost $120,000 , and a single officer receives nearly $40,000 per annum . The salaries of the legal staff amount to nearly $200,000 , and the whole amount of salaries exceeds half a million of dollars . Large estates , here as elsewhere , begec habits of great expenditure and great waste , and thus the leaks are almost incredibly great . Massachusetts , with a population of 800,000 , expends about $2,000,000 , or less than half of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sum , she appropriates $300,000 to the support of infirm and aged poor , and about seven hundred thousand dollars for the maintenance of public schools . There men manage their own affairs : because land is divided , and man united . The admirable effect of the division of land , consequent upon the growth of population and wealth , is fully shown in Prussia , by the result of the abolition of leases in perpetuity , and their conversion into freeholds , with compensation to the owner of the land , at the rate of twenty-five years ' purchase of his interest . The great landholders were encumbered with debts , and their estates were loaded with mortgages which prevented improvement . In Pomerania alone , the encumbrances amounted to $24,000,000 . The peasant holdings were freed at once , on payment of the stipulated sum ; and the small landholders enjoyed a credit that to the great ones had been denied . All other impediments to the free disposal of land by sale , gift , or will , were also abolished ; and the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now advancing in Prussia at a rate unknown to the rest of continental Europe : and that she is now at the rates amount to 90,000 . Here we have , in miniature , a perfect representation of the whole system of England . The reader who desires to understand both , will obtain the knowledge he seeks by reference to the Westminster Review , vol. 45 , p. 193. /z/ head of the great commercial union of northern Germany , throughout the whole extent of which exists perfect freedom of internal trade . Here , as elsewhere , the division of land has been attended with the union of man , and the extension of cultivation over the fertile soils . The PAST says to the landlord of the PRESENT : If you desire that your lands become valuable : yielding large rents : labour to promote the maintenance of peace . " To the tenant it says : " If you desire to become the owner of the land you cultivate : labour to promote the maintenance of peace , and to prevent the waste of wealth on fleets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you desire to own your house , and lot , and garden , your own shop , or your own farm : to have your own wife and children : to read your own books and newspapers : to go to your own church : to send your children to your own school : and to see them prosper in an active world , where rapidly increasing wealth gives increased wages to a rapidly increasing population : labour to promote the maintenance of peace and economy . " To the nation : " If you desire to acquire , individually and collectively , the power of perfect self-protection : avoid war and preparation for war . " /z/ THE man who cultivates the poor soils , barters the commodity he produces for the one he wants . His production is small , and consists chiefly of food , most of which is needed for himself and his family . His exchanges are few and small . As population and w r ealth increase , and as the more fertile soils are brought into cultivation , food becomes more abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such other commodities as he is now enabled to consume , and we find him gradually adopting a standard of value to be used in his exchanges . In some places cowrie shells pass as money . In others prices are measured by tobacco , the legislator being paid for his services by the delivery of a certain number of pounds : while other quantities are fixed as the price of other services , and . of the commodities most commonly in use . Tobacco is , however , bulky and liable to injury by time , and forms a standard of a very inconvenient kind . Wealth and population still further increase , and men are found adopting as standards for the measurement of values , silver and gold : both constantly in demand for various purposes in the arts ; both representing in a very small compass a large amount of labour ; both free from all danger of injury from rust ; and therefore termed the precious metals . Those who desire to part with other commodities now sell them for money , and those who purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which becomes the universal currency , and the habit of bartering commodities passes gradually out of use . /z/ He now cultivates other and better soils , and as the productiveness of labour grows , exchanges grow in number and amount : and more and more of the precious metals , termed money , are required for the purpose of effecting those exchanges . Representing so large an amount of value , and being themselves of so little bulk , they are , more than others , liable to be lost or stolen ; and their possessors : those who hold portions of their capital uninvested , and waiting for the opportunity of re-investment : desire to place them in security . At first , we find them placed with traders called goldsmiths , and afterwards with bankers : or in banks . In some places , banks merely hold them for the owners , to be returned , or to be transferred on books kept for that purpose ; but as exchanges become more numerous , checks or drafts are devised , by means of which the property therein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another step , we find the machinery of exchange still further improved . Banks now furnish certificates for given sums , large and small , by aid of which transfers are made with a facility before unknown ; and thus the machinery for the exchange of property from hand to hand is perfected . As the better soils come further into action , and labour becomes more and more productive , the fashioner and the producer come more and more together . Communities now arise , in each of which are to be performed numerous exchanges , and in each are men whose capital is at one moment invested in merchandise , and at another uninvested : taking the form of money , and while remaining in that form yielding no return . In each of these communities , a shop is needed for facilitating transactions in the commodity now used as currency . One man desires to lodge his little stock for safe keeping . Another , to obtain an order for money to be paid at another place : and a third , to have bank notes that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus be relieved of the necessity for carrying silver or /z/ gold , which although far less bulky than tobacco , are far more bulky than the note . With each step in this course , we find a great saving of labour , and an increase in the quantity that may be applied to the work of production . The man who has a thousand dollars , or pounds , places it in the bank , and the bank pays it out in ten , twenty , or fifty small sums , of the precise amount desired : and thus the owner is saved the time of counting his money and of carrying it about with him , as well as the risk of loss . In the outset we find bankers charging a commission for the facility thus afforded , but by degrees , they are seen performing these important services , and affording the still greater facility of bank notes , free of all expense to those who use them . The machinery of exchange becomes therefore less costly as it becomes more perfect : and wealth accumulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up , are numerous little capitalists preparing for the purchase of houses and lots , or little farms , or for the opening of shops : while among them are some larger ones , that occasionally have their means disengaged . To all of them , interest is desirable , while it is in the highest degree advantageous to the community that the accumulations of the tailor and carpenter ; the little fortune of the widow or the orphan : and the savings of the doctor or the clergyman : should be kept in active operation , facilitating the application of labour to production . By the combined effort of these little capitalists , a shop is opened for the purpose of lending out their money , and that of affording to the people of the neighbourhood a secure place of deposit for such portions of their respective capitals as may from time to time become disengaged . The stock therein is held in shares , transferable with little trouble : and thus the shoemaker , when ready to buy his house , sells out to the tailor ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts with his interest to the clergyman . The joint capital is security to those who trade with it for the safe re* /z/ turn of their money , and now each man having a place of safe deposit , he no longer finds it necessary to hide or bury his little stock : nor even his larger amounts of disengaged capital . The little bank , thus organized , aids the farmer in his purchases of manure ; the shopkeeper in obtaining a larger supply of goods ; and the builder in obtaining bricks and timber ; and thus the little savings of the neighbourhood are always actively employed on the spot on which they have been made . The management of the little machine , though inexpensive , constitutes a deduction from the interest received : and to pay these expenses , the bankers must either make a charge for the accommodation they afford in receiving , guarding , and paying out again at the pleasure and in the sums that suit the convenience of their owners , the small amounts that they are accustomed to keep for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as one or another buys or sells a house , or a piece of land : or they must pay themselves with the interest derived from lending out the moneys thus placed with them for security . The facility of investment is perfect . Land in large and small lots ; and houses , and stocks in little institutions for insurance , or manufactures ; or shares in ships and railroads , and turnpikes ; may always be bought : and therefore but little capital accumulates in banks , to be used for their own benefit ; and their profits therefore just suffice to pay their expenses , and to enable their owners to receive the same rate of interest that they would have if their money were lent on mortgage . The advantage derived by them from the existence of the bank , is the facility with which small sums may be temporarily invested , and recalled : while the community profits by the fact that all wealth is actively employed . If the labourer did not lend his fellow labourer his horse , he could not borrow his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed where the work was perhaps insufficient for even one : and if the owners of little sums of money kept them in old stocking 's , they might themselves find /z/ it difficult to borrow when occasion required it . The moneyshop now constitutes a little savings ' bank for disengaged capital : as lands , lots , and houses constitute little savings ' banks for the otherwise spare labour of their owners . As the fertile soils come more and more into cultivation , and as with the growth of population and wealth the fashioner takes mom ; ind more his place by the side of the producer ; the tendency to concentration increases , and is accompanied with a constant diminution in the quantity required of the machinery of exchange used in passing commodities from hand to hand ; because the farmer exchanges directly with the tanner and the shoemaker , and the hatter with the dealer in sugar and coffee , the balances alone being paid in money : and is also accompanied with a constantly increasing facility of investment , tending to diminish the quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking employment . The diminution in the amount of capital invested in the machinery of exchange from hand to hand , equally with the diminution in that required for its transfer from place to place : the one called money and the other wagons : tends to enable men to apply more labour to production , and thus to bring into activity the more fertile soils , with increased return to both labour and capital : and towards the production of this result the establishment of the little money-shop greatly contributes . The owner of uninvested capital : money , or currency : keeps some of it in his pocket-book , and some of it in the bank . The former is called circulation , and the latter is known as deposits . The proportion which the former bears to the latter , depends upon the proximity or remoteness of the money-shop , or bank . If it be near , he will keep very few notes on hand , because he can have more at any moment , and his check will always answer in their stead ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must always have with him as many notes as will answer his purpose for a week , at least . Every increase in the facility of obtaining the de- /z/ scription of currency that is needed , tends therefore to diminish the quantity kept on hand , while it tends to facilitate exchanges and promote the growth of wealth . With the growth of wealth and population , there is a tendency to increase in the number of shops trading in money , or banks ; to increase in the facility of obtaining the machinery of exchange , called money ; and to diminution in the proportion which money , whether gold , silver , or bank notes , or in any form other than that of credits , transferable by checks or drafts , bears to the operation of trade . The proportion which the coin , or the bank notes , used in London or New York , bears to the trade of those cities , is vastly smaller than that of Paris or St. Petersburg ! ) , and less in all than in Mexico or Lima . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communities whose trade is not one-hundredth part as great : nor does that of New York exceed in amount what is required by counties of fifty thousand inhabitants . The more perfectly the number of banks is in accordance with the amount of business to be done , the less is the quantity of circulation that can be maintained ; and thus the power of banks to profit by aid of that circulation tends to diminish , as with the division of land and growth of trade the facility of investing capital is increased : and they are thus forced more and more to look to their own capital for the profits of business . With each such step , their action becomes more uniform and steady , and they themselves become more safe . Their insecurity results always from unsteadiness . Unsteadiness results always from over-trading . Over-trading can take place only by aid of deposits or circulation . Freedom of action tends to limit both , and by so doing to prevent over-trading , and thus to produce steadiness in their action and in the value of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exists . Rhode Island , with a population of about 100,000 , has sixty-five banks , with capitals varying from $20,000 to $500,000 : and the combined capital is above $10,000,000. /z/ Every village has its shoe-shop , its smith-shop , and its mofley-shop . Every man has at hand a little saving fund , or bank , owned generally by people like himself : men who work : and in this bank he deposits his little savings , buying first one share , and then another , until at length he is enabled to buy a little farm , or open a shop : or commence manufacturing on his own account : when he sells out to some one of his neighbours who is following in the same course. * The bank derives , from the use of its deposits and from its circulation , sufficient profit to pay its expenses , and no more ; because when the trade in money is free , the quantity of idle capital remaining in the form of money , whether real or imaginary , will always be small ; as will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . the world is the proportion which coin and notes bear to the amount of trade so small as there , and in the other States of New England : yet in none do there exist such perfect facilities for furnishing circulation . In no part does the individual banker so little appear . In none does the bank trade so much upon capital , * The following statement of one of their banks shows the mann in which the small institutions of New England are owned : Females ,  --   --   --  - 2,438 shares . /z/ Guardians , - - - - - /z/ Charitable institutions , ... Corporations and State , - - - - /z/ Mariners , ...... /z/ Traders , - - - - Lawyers ,  --   --   --  /z/ Total , - - - 11 , 045 share . It would be difficult to imagine any thing more democratic . /z/ and so little on credit . In none , consequently , are banks so steady and so safe . Perfect freedom in the employment of capital : te only true regulator : never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beautiful system under which that State has flourished , and has been enabled to maintain a currency less subject to fluctuations than any other that the world has yet seen . Of all the communities of the world , it is the one that can boast of the greatest number of banks , and greatest amount of capital therein invested , in proportion to its population ; and it can show that its banks , because of the perfect freedom there enjoyed , and because of the free exercise of the right of association for banking and other purposes , were enabled to pass through the calamitous period from 1835 to 1842 , with no alteration in their loans , to the extent of even three per cent , of their amount . They can not expand improperly , because the power of competition is complete , and rival institutions would follow such expansion : and they are thus shown to be governed by the same law which forbids the shoemaker and the tailor , by charging exorbitant prices , to afford inducements to other tailors and shoemakers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not having the power of undue expansion , they can not be compelled to contract , and thus both they and those who trade with them exercise in full perfection the power of self-government . Contractions not being required , their customers do not fail , nor do they fail themselves : as is shown by the fact that in the last thirty-eight years of war and commercial convulsions , the failures have been but two in number , and their joint capitals were less than $50,000 . There , the machinery of exchange from hand to hand is more perfect , and less costly than elsewhere in the world : and simply because , there , man and land , and wealth , are least fettered by regulation . The system of Massachusetts stands next in the order of freedom and security . It is less free , because banking capital /z/ tal is subject to a tax of one per cent. , which limits coi.etition to that point at which banks can make out of their circulation and deposits two and a half percent , in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Rhode Island , the average excess of loans over capital is but little over twenty-five per cent. , yielding seven and a half per cent , of gross profit , one and a half per cent , of which goes to the payment of losses and expenses , and to the gradual accumulation of surplus funds . Competition produces great economy , and the losses would be very small , had the other states #@# its neighbours , the same free system . The fluctuations of New York and Pennsylvania often ruin the traders of Rhode Island , whose banks have to bear losses of which they are not the cause , but they nevertheless divide six per cent , from a business exceeding their capitals less than thirty per cent . The banker receives the same rate of interest that the trader pays : neither more nor less . There is little friction to be paid for . The machine moves with a steadiness and regularity unknown in the world : yet every other state and kingdom might have one equally perfect , were they to adopt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and west from New England , we find the population becoming more and more scattered , and more and more employed in cultivating thin soils , while surrounded by forests and swamps covering rich soils : and with each step in our progress we find the trade in money becoming less and less free , the quantity of the machinery of exchange increasing , and its quality becoming depreciated . New York has had a variety of systems , all involving care and supervision on the part of those charged with the business of government , the natural consequence of which is , that her system is less advantageous to the community than those of Massachusetts and Rhode Island , where the people protect themselves . Under her present system , banks are made by individuals , and the saving fund character , by /z/ which they are distinguished in New England , has disappeared , and the local investment of capital is thus prevented . Pennsylvania is the favoured land of banking and landed monopolies . Large banks are permitted to exist while small communities throughout the state are denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forced from the country to the city , where it accumulates , somewhat as it does in England , and flows off to the south and west , there to be dissipated in wasteful enterprises : while the little farmer and trader of the interior are unable to obtain the temporary loans necessary to enable the one to purchase manure , and the other to increase his stock of axes and spades , shoes and coats . Her policy is suicidal . She abounds in the raw material of wealth , and she expels the wealth and the labour required to bring it into activity . Passing further south , as men become more scattered , and cultivate poorer soils , land is less divided , and the facility of investment is diminished : and therewith we find freedom of trade gradually decreasing , and States becoming bankers , with the usual results of great instability , enormous loss to the owner of the bank , and ruin to those who trade with it . Passing west , we find on the outer edge of civilization the least freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have but one bank , and that bank will not furnish more than a given quantity of circulation , be the increase of population and trade what it may . It would have been quite as judicious in the framers of the constitution had they determined that but one railroad should ever exist in the state , and that that road should never have more than a certain number of engines and cars . The bank note facilitates the transfer of property from hand to hand , and the railroad car its transfer from place to place . The one is as useful as the other , and quite as harmless : as much so as the shoeshop. /z/ In England , the investment of capital has been at all times impeded by land . In many cases , nine-tenths of the latter have been owned by persons having but a life-interest therein , and liable to be impeded in their actions or contract , by remainder-men . In many others , mortgagees and other parties have had interests at variance with those of the nominal owner . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit a drain to be dug , or a tile to be laid , unless he were permitted to take a tenth of the whole product of labour and capital ; while paying no wages to the man employed in the work of improvement or cultivation . In some , great landlords owning turnpikes wanted large tolls ; while in others steam-engines were held to be nuisances ; and railroad makers were regarded as enemies , to be kept at a distance unless they would consent to pay largely for the privilege of doubling the value of the land through which their roads were to be made to run . The necessary consequence of this has been , that the machinery of exchange has been very abundant , and of very inferior quality . All facility for local investment has been denied , and capital has been forced from the land into great towns and cities filled with starving operatives living in filthy cellars , whose labour w r as to be employed in converting cotton produced in India or America , into cloth to be sent to America or Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could have been produced at half the cost at home : while their employment therein would have tended towards perfecting the great machine given by the Creator for the production of food and wool . To ensure the continuance of the power thus to waste labour and capital , colonies have been founded and maintained ; and the flag of England has been enabled to disport itself over barren rocks in the Mediterranean , wild lands in Canada , and wilder lands occupied by wretched tribes in Australia and New Zealand , Southern Africa and Honduras : at the cost of thousands of millions that would have made of the United Kingdom a garden , /z/ occupied by a hundred millions of the best fed , best clothed , and best educated people in the world. * The machinery of exchange used for the accomplishment of these objects has been as costly as it has been bad , and it has absorbed eight hundred millions of the savings of the people , in addition to the thousands of millions raised by taxes . The owners of those eight hundred millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute a part of this vast system ef bad machinery , require pay : and to provide for all these charges , fifty millions a year are required . The collection of the taxes required for these purposes produces a demand for a vast quantity of inferior machinery , intermediate between the producer and consumer , in the form of tax-gatherers : and the payment of these contributions tends to render necessary another large quantity of machinery , in the form of managers of almshouses , poor law commissioners , &c.,; who take the produce and divide it among those who desire to consume , but can not find employment : and they can not do so because the spades and picks that should be employed in making roads and trenches at home , have been sent to Canada , the Cape of Good Hope , or Australia , to be there employed in the cultivation of the thin soils of the hills , while rich soils at home remain unimproved and valueless . The necessary consequence of all this is a tendency to cause the centralization of wealth in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of those who have not laboured for its production : and thus to cause waste . Added to this is the fact that the mass of the people do not own the land they cultivate . Capital accumulates in their hands from the commencement to the close of the year , to be distributed by the landlord , who gives back to the soil a small portion of its product , or not , at his pleasure ; and when he * The colonies of England are forty-four in number , and their annual cost , exclusive of fleets and armies kept on foot for their protection , exceeds three millions , while the whole exports to them are only ten millions . From this statement of costs and trade , India is excluded . /z/ chances so to do , he calls it an investment of capital on land ; thus charging all and crediting nothing to the great machine . A further consequence of all this is , that the quantity of the machinery of exchange required , in the form of money , is large : being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is required in New England , although under other circumstances it would be less . To add to the stagnation and centralization thus produced , the habit of local union among the little communities throughout the kingdom is , as far as possible , restrained by law , for the benefit of the larger unions in the metropolis ; and for that of the larger capitalists , bankers , manufacturers , and traders there and in the principal towns . Centralization is the rule . The law fixes the manner in which men may be permitted to unite for the purposes of trade , and what shall be the relation of the partners towards each other , and towards the world : and no effort at self-government can enable the parties to avoid that law . But recently , the formation of jointstock associations , with transferable shares , was prohibited on any terms . Twenty years since , not more than six persons could associate for opening a place for dealing in money , even if all were liable for the debts of the concern : and all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been granted exemption from the restrictions imposed by previous laws . About that time , however , men were permitted to associate in larger numbers for the formation of banks , but on the sole condition that each associate should be liable for all the debts of the concern : thus maintaining in full force the barbarous system of unlimited liability : solidariti : that had descended from olden time . The maintenance of this involved a thousand other regulations , and hence arose a necessity for various new laws to determine the relation of the parties to each other : yet they remain to this day in a condition so little satisfactory , that parties who desire to associate are forced to resort to various contrivances with a view to procure some approach to safety . The necessary /z/ consequence of all this is , that prudent men take no part in such institutions . They deposit their money for safe keeping , receiving no interest , while the bankers lend out both it and their own very little capital , and thus are enabled to divide double interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following comparison of the system of Rhode Island , and that of the joint-stock banks of London , the great centre of the trade of the world . The sixty-five banks of Rhode Island have a capital of about $10,300,000 The amount of their investments is usually about 13,000,000 Their dividends are about six per cent. , affording the same rate of interest as could be obtained from loans on mortgage security , as there is no liability to be paid for . The five joint-stock banks of London have a nominal capital of 55,000,000 Of which there is paid up 11,700,000 Each shareholder being individually liable for all the debts , it is attempted to free him from the responsibility by making him and his brother shareholders subscribe for 100 , of which but about .20 is called in : and thus , instead of a capital of a million , we find one amounting to 200,000 , while the remaining 800,000 consists of promises to pay ; but these promises involve liabilities , for w r hich the givers expect to be paid . They , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole million . Their deposits amount to about 10,000,000 , nearly the whole of which vast sum is lent out , liable to be reclaimed whenever any change takes place in the state of affairs ; and thus while the actual capital of the five great banks is little more than is found engaged in the money trade of the little State in which banking is most free , the amount of their loans is four times as great , being probably .11,000,000 , $53,000,000 . Their dividends are from six to eight per cent. , in addition to the sums that are appropriated to the increase /z/ of their capital : whereas mortgage loans yield but four per cent . Of the depositors , some receive a small interest , and some have none , they having thus to contribute towards the dividends of the men who take large risks in hopes of receiving large profits : of those who prefer the uncertain profits of the gaming-table to the certain ones of regular employment . Were those banks freed from barbarous liabilities , the whole amount of their capitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly convert their almost unproductive capital into bank shares paying four per cent . To yield such dividend would require a business not exceeding their own means by more than thirty per cent . : and their shares would then , because of the perfect safety of the institutions and perfect certainty of dividend , constitute a security of the highest order . Were chartered banks once to be formed under a general law , it would soon be seen that institutions with large capitals and small liabilities were safer for their owners , because steadier in their . action : and safer for those who trade with them : than such institutions as those which now exist , and which resemble an inverted pyramid , all top and no bottom ; and the latter would soon pass out of existence , for no one would trust them. * Under such a system , joint-stock banks are held in little favour , and private banks abound ; and here we see in full force the effect of regulation . We have shown that in Rhode Island , out of sixty-five banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of war and of the great revulsions of 1815 , 1825 , 1836 , and 1839 : whereas , in England , from 1839 to 1843 , both inclusive , a time of pro- * " The year 1836 marked the widest spread and extremity of the joint-stock bank system , and nothing has since been able to revive it , so as to make it a favourite object of public patronage , although , as we believe , joint-stock banks were , on the whole , never in so sound and satisfactory a condition as they are at this instant of time . This want of power to compete for public favour with the other new thing , the railway system , is no doubt owing to the unlimited liability of shareholders , in banks , and the absence of that obnoxious principle in railways . " Bankers ' drew lar , January 8 , 1847. /z/ found peace , eighty-two private bankers became bankrupt ; of whom forty-six paid no dividends , twelve paid under twenty-five per cent. , twelve under fifty per cent. , three under seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . : leaving seven yet unascertained . Under the one system capital is promptly invested where it is accumulated . It falls gently as the dew , and it diffuses life and animation everywhere around . Every village having its money-shop , owned in the neighbourhood , the little capitalist is not compelled to send his money to Boston , or New York , for investment . The consequence is , that every farmer and mechanic who wishes the aid of a little capital can have it , provided his character entitles him to claim it. * In England , on the contrary , there is a constant tendency to the centralization of capital in London , because of the difficulty attendant upon investing it at home . Of the 3,013 shareholders in the five joint-stock banks of that city , 1,106 reside at more than fifteen miles from it . The natural tendency of capital is to accumulate in towns , and to be from thence distributed over the country , equalizing the rate of interest to all portions of the nation ; and such would be the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present system is to force capital from the country to the city , and to increase the inequality that would naturally exist . It is offered in London at one and a half to two per cent. , when in parts of the country it is almost unattainable at any price . The same state of things exists in many parts of the United States . In Pennsylvania , because of the refusal to permit the establishment of local banks , large sums *The little bank of the little town in which we write , with its capital of $50,000 , has about a hundred and fifty stockholders , embracing all the little capitalists , farmers , and lawyers , and widows , and orphans , and tailors , and shoemakers , of the neighbourhood . It divides six per cent . precisely what the borrowers pay and its stock is at par . Each owner profits by the local application of his capicai , in the increased demand for labour and merchandise that is thereby produced : and each participates , through directors with whose characters he is acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce unmixed good : and such would be the character of all were banking once set free from the control of politicians . /z/ are remitted to Philadelphia , to be employed in building up great banks : while farmers , and mechanics , and traders , can scarcely borrow at any price , because they have no moneyshop within fifty miles of them . The capitalist receives less than he would otherwise do , and his property improves slowly , because his neighbours can not obtain the means to improve their own little farms ; to increase their machinery ; or to augment their stores of goods . Capital accumulates in the city , and the rate of interest falls . Large investments are then made in distant banks or railroads , and after a little time he finds that his means are gone : tha.t the great banks and himself are ruined together . Such is precisely the case in England . Capital is forced , by means of regulation , into the city , there to be managed by the great bank , and to be by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indiana , and Illinois ; whereas , had the currency been left to take care of itself , and had land and trade been relieved from restriction , employment for it would have been found at home . There would then never have arisen the necessity for threats of interference on the part of the ever-belligerent Secretary for Foreign Affairs , to compel the re-payment of money which would not have been lent but for the meddling of legislators and politicians with the affairs of individuals . Under such a system , steadiness in the value of the commodity used as the standard for the measurement of the values of commodities , was impossible ; but instead of perceiving that unsteadiness was produced by restriction and regulation , it was erroneously attributed to the excess of freedom , and a new system was established by the celebrated Bank Restriction Act of 1844 . To the movements of the one great bank have mainly been due all the violent revulsions in trade throughout the world , whose effects upon the United States we have already described . What have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose now to show : as well as to in- /z/ quire how far the new system tends to prevent their further recurrence . Under the old charter of the Bank , great inconvenience and loss were experienced by the mercantile world from the extraordinary fluctuations in the supply and value of money . At one moment it appeared to be so abundant as to be almost valueless . Vast sums remained in bank at the credit of individuals , yielding them no return ; and the bank itself was soliciting applications for loans , at low rates of interest . It vas then forced out in loans to all the poor sovereigns of Europe . A few months passed by , and the bank was charging almost double the usual interest on the best paper , and forcing out the securities which it had laboured to monopolize . By those who had securities of the first order , money was to be obtained with exceeding difficulty ; while , by those who held such as were of the second order , it was unattainable at any price . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then again cheap , and it was sent to the mines of Mexico ; and then again a little time , and it was dear . Again cheap , it was sent to make roads and canals in Illinois , and banks in Mississippi and Alabama . Again dear , the bank was seen labouring to save itself from ruin , and sauve qui pent was the order of the day . On the verge of suspension , in 1836 , and escaping only by the adoption of measures that involved in ruin a large portion of the trading world at home ; it was seen , as early as 1839 , enlarging its loans in the face of a steady drain of bullion , indicating an already existing excess in the currency , and thus involving itself in difficulty so serious as to compel resort to measures of severity far exceeding those of the former period . Hosts of shopkeepers and mechanics , merchants and manufacturers , were ruined ; operatives , in countless thousands , were deprived of employment and reduced to starvation ; and the best of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time trade seemed almost at an end . Severe as were these measures , the desired effect was /z/ not immediately produced ; and the great bank , the regulator of the monetary concerns of the greatest mercantile community of the world , was seen to be forced , on bended knees , to solicit the aid of its great neighbour and rival , the Bank of France , to save it from absolute bankruptcy . The frequency and extraordinary extent of these changes , induced a proper feeling of doubt as to the capacity of those to whom had been intrusted the management of the currency ; and a strong disposition was felt to ascertain by what laws , if any there were , the institution was governed . A Parliamentary committee was appointed , and niftnerous sittings were held . Witnesses were examined , for and against the bank ; and a huge volume of evidence was printed , much of which was strange enough certainly , as coming from men who might have been supposed to know some little of the laws of trade . With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was desired . The only conclusion at which it was possible for it to arrive was , that the institution was administered without reference to any principle whatsoever : that its movements were invariably those of momentary expediency : and that the dangers and difficulties which had occurred were likely to be repeated at the first favourable moment . Such having been clearly shown to be the case , even by the evidence of the governor of the bank himself , it was deemed necessary , on the renewal of the charter , to endeavour to subject its action to some certain law : thus fitting it to become the regulator of the action of others : and hence the Bank Restriction Acts . Those acts are not yet three years old , and the same scene is renew r ed . A period of frightful speculation is followed by universal panic . Consols , but recently at par , are now at 80 . The government is forced to pay five per cent , for money . Railroad stock has fallen , in many cases , twenty to thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at less than ten to fifteen per cent , per annum . Bank notes can not be obtained even for silver bullion . Dealers in corn , and cotton , /z/ and bullion , are again proscribed . Deputations from Liverpool and Manchester claim of the minister a suspension of the law , and he is assured that large orders remain unexecuted , because of the impossibility of obtaining the means necessary for their execution , while operatives are starving for want of employment . The bank itself , with bankruptcy staring it in the face , is compelled to enlarge its loans when it would contract them ; and thus is exhibited , for the third time within little more than , ten years , the spectacle of a great regulator utterly unable to control its own movements . It has hopes , however , in aid from the Russian autocrat . He has already saved the regulator of France , and he promises to do as much for that of England . The great community of Britain see , in the promised aid of two millions , a prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its discounts . " " The screw " is not so tight . They think they see that the regulator may save itself without utterly destroying them ; and bright hope gladdens the face of thousands , in reflecting upon the idea that the Czar is enabled , by means of the issue of bank notes , adapted for the purposes of small traders as well as large ones , to dispense with the use of gold to such an extent as to enable him to become a creditor of their own government ; and to entitle himself to an annual remittance of .60,000 , in payment of interest on the promised loan : whereas similar action on their own part would render available a much larger amount of their own capital , free of all demand for interest , thus lessening the cost of the machinery of exchange , and increasing the power of production . A brief interval of expansion is followed by another contraction . At one moment , interest is reduced to five per cent. , and at the next it is raised to nine . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , they are proscribed . From hour to hour the system changes , and universal ruin is the result . Such is the condition of the people of England under the control of its great bank . They are dependent upon the chance measures of a body of gentlemen , no one of whom /z/ has ever yet , so far as we have seen , been able to explain the principles by which they are governed in the administration of the vast machine subjected to their control . The Bank Restriction Act has failed to produce the effect desired . It has given no steadiness to the value of money . By one party , the fault is attributed to the law itself ; while by another , , it is asserted , that if the bank had acted " in the spirit of the law of 1844 , " the difficulty would not have occurred . Such are the words of the author of the law , who attributes the pressure to the extraordinary spirit of speculation that has recently existed ; to the scarcity of corn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been expected , is willing to see it in any cause but the real one , which is to be found in the radical defect of his own measure . It professed to regulate the action of the bank ; and , had it done so , the directors would have found themselves compelled to act in accordance with its letter and its spirit : and then there could have been no such speculation as that we have recently witnessed . Had it done so , the difficulties naturallyattendant upon short crops would not have been aggravated , . as they now are , by the total prostration of trade , the discharge of workmen , and the impossibility of obtaining wages to be used in the purchase , at any price , of the necessaries of life . The trade in money requires no more law than that , in shoes . It requires , on the contrary , perfect freedom , because it is so vastly greater in amount* that interference to the extent of one-half of one per cent , is there more felt than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tendency of gold and silver to steadiness in value is the great recommendation which they possess , entitling them to claim to be used for measuring the value of all other commodities ; and were the trade in money perfectly free , * Every contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity , or property r involves a contract for the delivery of a quantity of money equivalent to the price . The trade in money is therefore equal in amount to the sum of the prices of all commodities , and properties , and labor , sold . /z/ they would constitute standards almost as perfect as does the yard-stick as a measure of length , or the bushel as a measure of capacity . On an average , the whole quantity of corn , and cotton , and sugar , in market , in any year , is consumed in the year , and a failure of crop may make a change of fifty , or even of a hundred , per cent , iri the price ; whereas , the quantity of gold and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not subject to rust , or decay is more than a hundred times the quantity required for a year 's consumption : and a total failure of the year 's crop should not affect it to the extent of even one per cent . Nevertheless , such are the penalties , prohibitions , liabilities , and other restrictions , to which traders in money are subjected : so numerous and powerful are the monopolies established for their regulation : that of all trades that in money is the least steady : and of all commodities , money is the most subject to sudden* alteration in supply , and consequently in value , as compared with other commodities . It is a yardstick , of perpetually changing length : a gallon measure , that contains sometimes three quarts , and at other times six , or even twelve . The regulation of the currency is held to be one of the functions of government , because , in past times , all sovereigns have found it to be a convenient mode of taxation . Philip the Fair changed the coinage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred times during his reign . Louis X. , Charles IV. , Philip V. and VI. , John , and their successors , almost to the Revolution , followed the illustrious example . In England , similar changes have been made , but to a much smaller extent , France having been , at all times , distinguished among the countries of Europe for frauds of that and other kinds . All the governments of Europe , great and small , have , at various times , done the same thing ; and hence their claim , still maintained , to execute , either by themselves or their deputies , the same profitable office . That of England transfers the duty to the bank , which institution performs it in such a manner that at one /z/ time money is cheap , and the State is enabled to compel the owners of three and a half per cents , to receive three per cents , in exchange , and thus to effect a large saving of interest : while at another time money is dear , and the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their property . We do not desire to say that such is the object sought in the production of these extraordinary changes , but such is certainly their effect : and good reasons can always be given for them . At one time , it is the enormous import of stocks from the continent ; at another , the influx of South American shares and stocks ; at a third , the vast loans to the United States ; and at a fourth , the deficiency of the crops ; but stocks would not come if money were not made too cheap , and corn might be deficient without producing any material change in the value of money , except as regarded corn itself . If the supply of sugar were small , the price of sugar itself would rise , and there would be somewhat less money to be exchanged against cloth , the price of which would slightly fall ; and so , if the supply of grain ' were short , there would be less money to be exchanged against sugar ; but in no case would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities , were the currency let alone . The true reason is , that the task of regulation is committed to one great institution , whose movements are totally unregulated . It monopolizes securities at one time , and produces an apparent excess , and consequent cheapness , of money . It forces them back upon the market , when much of this apparent excess has found employment in new enterprises , to which resort would not otherwise have been had , and now the scarcity is equal to the previous abundance . It is a great fly-wheel in the midst of an infinite number of little wheels , all of which are compelled to go fast or slow as the master- wheel may direct . If its own movement could be rendered uniform , all would work harmoniously ; but if it must continue to be , as it has heretofore been , subjected to perpetual jerks , and to changes from /z/ backward to forward motion , and vice versa , from forward to backward , the inevitable consequence must also continue to be the destruction of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that of the great one . These little wheels are the bankers , and merchants , and manufacturers of England : of the United States : and of the world : who have been for a long time engaged in studying the law which governs the motion of the great fly-wheel , but with so little success , as yet , that we hazard little in asserting that there is no man in England , in or out of the bank , that would commit that law to writing , and stake his fortune on proving that it had been operative during any one period of twelve months in the last twenty years . In despair of arriving at any comprehension of the laws of its action , all resign themselves blindly to its influence , and the error of the great regulator is propagated throughout the whole system . Joint stock and private banks expand when it . expands , and contract as it contracts ; and an error of a single million in Threadneedle-street thus produces error to the extent of tens of millions in the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to fixed and positive rules . The currency needs no such regulator , but if such an one must continue to exist , its action should be rendered perfectly automatic : leaving it then to the proprietors of the little wheels to use such gearing as would enable them to attain as much or as little speed as they might respectively require . It should be acted upon by the community , instead of acting itself upon them , and then it might be consulted with the same confidence as the thermometer . The law that should produce this effect , would not be that of 1844 , which , with all its machinery of banking department , and department of issue , has totally failed to answer the end proposed . It has failed , because it was framed with a view to changes in the amount of currency in use , which are ever slow , and small in amount : while it contained no reference to changes in the currency seeking employment , which have always been rapid , and great in /z/ amount. * It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in constant use among the great body of the people , and can not be materially increased or decreased , without a great change in the state of trade , or in * It is curious to see in the evidence of eminent bankers the reasons adduced for thinking that deposits convertible on the instant into notes or gold are not as much currency as notes or gold themselves . One among the most learned of the bank directors , thought that they could not be sc considered , for the owner " could not pay his laborers with them , " nor could he do with them @#@ whatever he could do with sovereigns and shillings . " He thought , however , that they possessed the essential qualities of money in a very low degree . " The " essential quality of money " is that of facilitating the transfer of property , and that quality is possessed in a higher degree by the bank note than by gold and silver ; and in a still higher degree by the check than by the note : for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pounds , shillings , and pence required , and transfers them , without the trouble of handling or counting even a single penny . It is curious , too , to remark the strong tendency existing in the minds of many of the witnesses , distinguished in the monetary circles of London , to confound notes of hand , and bills , with currency . A note is a contract for the delivery , at some future day , of a given quantity of money , or currency . Its value , in money , depends on the proportion between the money and bills in market , and is just as much liable to variation as that of sugar or coffee . If money be plenty , and bills , or coffee , or sugar scarce , the price of the article in which the deficiency of supply exists , will be high ; but if sugar , or coffee , or bills , be abundant , and money be scarce , the price of the superabundant commodity will be low . Notes may be bartered for merchandise , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the supply of notes in the market , although it may materially affect the credit price of commodities : or the price in barter for promises to deliver money at some future day : will make no change in their money prices , unless there exist a facility for converting the notes into money . In time of severe pressure , there is great facility in bartering merchandise for notes ; but want of confidence induces the holders to fix the prices very high , with a view to cover the cost and risk attendant upon the conversion of notes into the commodity that is needed , which is money , or currency : the thing with which they must redeem their own obligations . The term currency means money on the spot , and in England , with the exception of the silver coinage for small payments , nothing is recognised as money but gold , which passes from hand to hand , either by actual delivery of the coin , or by the transfer of the property in a certain portion of that which exists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private drafts , or checks , or by that of obligations of the bank itself , called bank notes . A contract for the delivery of flour at a future day might , with the same propriety , be called flour , as a contract for the delivery , at a future day , of a certain quantity of the commodity which is current for the payment of debts , and which we caL 1 money , can be called money , or currency , itself . The difficulties of the bank result from the fact that , whenever speculation /z/ the feelings of the people ; instead of making it dependent upon the deposits of unemployed capital , the property of the few , which are liable to increase or decrease by every change of weather , and by every speck that appears in the political or commercial horizon . By the new charter , the quantity of bullion to be held is made dependent entirely on the state of the circulation ; a sovereign , or , to a certain extent , its equivalent in silver , being required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound of its notes that is in the hands of the public beyond the sum of .14,000,000 . An examination of the operations of the bank , shows the circulation an almost constant quantity , amounting , since the date of that charter , to .20,000,000 ; and so long as the public shall insist upon keeping it at that point , 6,000,000 of bullion must remain in the bank , not to be used under any circumstances whatsoever : and of little more value to the community , while they so remain , than would be an equal weight of pebble stones . How far the circulation can claim to be treated as a constant quantity , we propose now to inquire . In doing so , it is necessary to bear in mind that trade is more active at certain seasons of the year than at others ; and that , as more exchanges are to be performed , more notes , or machinery of exchange , are required in the active than in the dull season ; and that , therefore , if we would compare one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same months of the is rife , and men are anxious to make contracts for the future delivery of money , she facilitates their operations by taking their notes freely , and becoming responsible for the delivery of the money on demand : by which means her debts , called deposits , are largely increased . If she has the money , all is well ; but if she has not , she thus swells the imaginary amount of the currency , and prices rise . When the time arrives for payment , it commonly proves that both parties have been trading on their credit . The bank must be paid , or she can not pay , and must become bankrupt . She seduced the poor debtor to over-trade , by assuming to do that which she could not have done if called upon . and she now ruins him for having yielded to her solicitations . She escapes by lucky accident , and speedily re-exhibits what is called " an increased liberality " in her accommodations ; i. e. , she again runs largely in debt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , we now give the circulation of April and October , for the years from 1832 to 1840 : April . October . /z/ The year 1840 was a year of utter prostration . In that and the following year , trade was at an end , so far as the ruin of the customers of England : and particularly the people of the United States : by the extraordinary movements of the bank could accomplish that object . Nevertheless , under these untoward circumstances , the circulation remained above 16 , 000,000 ; and we shall now find it gradually attaining a point higher than it had been at for many years : April . October . /z/ April . October . /z/ From this we see that in the first period embracing the nine years from 1832 to 1840 , both inclusive : and including the crisis of 1836-7 : the variation in the month of April , above and . below the medium point of .18,500,000 , is under three per cent . ; while that of October , above and below the point of 18,900,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the close of 1839 , and commencement of 1840 ; when the bank had been compelled to trample in the dust an /z/ that were in any way dependent upon it , thereby almost annihilating the trade of the country , and that of all countries intimately connected with it . In the second period , it attains a higher point than in the first . Private and joint-stock banks have been ruined by the extraordinary revulsion of 1839 , and confidence in their notes has been impaired : and the bank now profits by the ruin which it has caused . From 1844 to the present time , the variations are under two per cent . There is , however , a material difference between the average amount of the first and third periods , and a permanent increase appears to have taken place . In the time that has elapsed , there has been a great increase of population , wealth , and trade , and an increase of the machinery of trade might have been calculated upon ; yet no real increase in the circulation has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only apparent , and offers a new proof of the tendency to constancy : despite all legislative interferences : to which we desire to call the attention of our readers . Previously to 1844 , there were no limits to the circulation of the private , joint stock , Irish and Scotch banks , which averaged , between 1833 and 1839 , about .20,000,000 . By the new law , they were limited to about .17,800,000 , which is almost the precise amount at the date of the latest returns . The vacuum thus made had to be filled by notes of the Bank of England , which have , therefore , risen from .18,000,000 to .20,000,000 . The average of the total circulation from 1833 to 1839 was , 37,838,000 ; in January last , it had reached .39,400,000 ; in April , it was .37,819,000 . Small even as are these variations , they are still to a considerable extent only apparent . It is well known that when money is very plenty and cheap , bankers and banks retain on hand a larger amount of each others ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note in their vaults is just as much out of circulation as if it remained in those of the issu- /z/ ing bank itself . In the above table it is shown that the highest April was that of 1835 , when the bullion in the bank was 10,673,000 , the securities below .26,000,000 , and the market value of money but three per cent . The highest October was that of 1833 , when the bullion was nearly 11,000,000 , the securities .24,000,000 , and the rate of interest also but three per cent . It was a period of recovery from recent excitement that had been followed by depression and loss . The next highest October was that of 1838 , when trade was paralyzed : unemployed capital abundant : the stock of bullion near 10,000,000 : and the rate of interest three per cent . In 1842-3-4 , the apparent circulation was greater than in any of the years of the first period , yet the bank w r as unable to extend its business , which was scarcely equal to the amount of its circulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances calculated to produce an accumulation of Bank of England notes in the vaults and chests of private and joint-stock bankers : while the lowest April and October , until we reach the total prostration of 1839-40 , were those of 1836 , when the loans of the bank had reached the highest point , and when , according to the theory of the bank restriction act , the circulation should have been highest . Under the new law , the highest April was that of 1845 , when the bullion had reached the enormous sum of 16,000,000 ; and the highest October , that of 1846 , when it had just re-attained that amount . In view of these facts , we doubt if the variation above or below the medium point , in the real circulation , from 1833 to 1839 , ever equalled one and a half per cent . ; a proportion so small , that for almost all purposes it may be regarded as being a constant quantity. * * We have shown , by unanswerable arguments , that under no circumstances will more circulation be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to perform the functions of a medium of exchange for the internal transactions of the country . No man retains more money in his possession /z/ That such has been the case , has not been due to any efforts of the bank for that purpose . On the contrary , none have been spared that could have tended to increase and decrease the amount . Between 1833 and 1839 , it increased its securities from .22,000,000 to 31 , 000,000 , and thus forced up the amount of unemployed capital at the credit of its customers , from 8,000,000 to 18,000,000 , for all of which they were entitled to demand notes , if they would ; and it had diminished its investments from .31,000,000 to 21,000,000 , thereby enabling the owners of unemployed capital to invest at low prices , the effect of which was shown in the reduction of deposits from 18,000,000 to 7,000,000 ; yet the circulation neither increased nor decreased materially . Under the new 7 law , we find it purchasing securities and contracting debts , until the former rise from .22,000,000 to .36,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again diminishing , the first to 25,000,000 , and the second to 16,000,000 : and all this with no change worth notice in the circulation . The transactions of the whole period have shown that scarcely any power can be exercised over it , for its increase or decrease ; and yet this almost invariable quantity is made the measure of the bullion to be retained in the vaults of the bank : the result of all which is , that it has a circulation of 20,000,000 that it can not compel the people to return upon it for redemption , and that it is , nevertheless , obliged to keep 6,000,000 out of these .20,000,000 , in bullion ; while the whole commercial community is thrown into an agony of despair by the total refusal of accommodation , because the amount of bullion is reduced to .9,000,000 . Had the law provided that .6,000,000 should be packed up and stowed away , never than he requires for immediate use , but either places it in a bank , or employs it in the purchase of commodities on which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield an interest As a rule , therefore , the circulation is at all times confined to the lowest sum which is sufficient to conduct the transactions of the country . " Economist . /z/ again to be opened or removed for any purpose whatsoever , it would have been quite as useful for the maintenance of any thing like equality in the value of money ; and far more useful in that it would not have lulled the people into a belief that safeguards had been provided , when safety there could be none . It may be said , however , that panics might arise when people would bring the notes for redemption . Panics follow violent changes of action , like those of 1825 , 1836 , and 1839 , by which great losses are produced , threatening the existence of the bank ; and nothing could be better calculated to produce them than the institution of a system that professed to afford security when it gave none . The directors thought they were safe if they obeyed the law , and the people relied on the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bank or individuals has not been attained , nor can it ever be by aid of that law . The power and the discretion of the people : their capacity for self-government : in regard to the regulation of the circulation , have been fully manifested . They want no aid from the law , which is just as useful as if its object had been to fix the number of shoes , hats , or coats , that should be kept by the manufacturers of those commodities ; with a view to provide against any man- claiming to purchase a hat , and not being able to find one . Should such an one ever be passed , many men will be found going without hats , shoes , or coats ; for the supply of those articles , whenever it shall come to be regulated , will be as unsteady , and their prices will become as variable , as we now see to be the case with money . The people do require , however , protection against the exercise , by the bank , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is enabled to purchase securities , passing the amount to the credit of their owners , arid calling them " deposits : " by which operation prices are forced up , the rate of interest is diminished , capital is made to appear superabundant , and a speculative disposition is produced . That institution has a monopoly of the power of trading as /z/ a banking corporation . Had it not , the persons , whose capital is there locked up , unproductive to themselves , while the bank is increasing the amount of its securities with a view to the making of large dividends ; might demand bullion for their deposits , and open banks themselves , lending out their own money for their own profit , and thus curbing the bank : but this they could not do , prior to 1844 , because every association for banking purposes was subjected to heavy penalties , in the form of liabilities , which forbade that any prudent man should take part in their formation ; and since the new law , the formation of them , even coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government : and as if utterly to prevent people of small means from taking part in them , the price of a share is fixed at a hundred pounds , of which one-half must be paid in . Thus is restriction loaded on restriction , to produce steadiness ! The effect is similar to that which would be obtained by adding a ton of iron to the top hamper of an already overloaded coach . For the benefit of those who have not traced the operation of an expansion , we propose to show the manner in which it acts . Let us suppose , first , a state of affairs , in which every thing is at par . Money is easily obtained for good notes , at a fair rate of discount , and for mortgages , at the usual rate of interest ; while all those who have disposable capital , can readily obtain good securities that will yield them the common rate of profit ; the daily supply of money and securities being about equal the one to the other . In this happy state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , fancy that it would be profitable to take , another million , and forthwith their broker is desired to purchase that amount of exchequer bills , or other securities . At once the equilibrium is disturbed . A demand for securities exists , exceeding the ordinary amount of supply . Prices rise , and some unhappy holder is tempted to sell , in the hope that there will be less demand to-morrow , and that then prices will fall , and he may buy in again with a fair profit . At /z/ the close of the day , his bills have become the property of the bank , and he : or all those who have united to furnish the the desired million : is creditor to the bank , either directly or through his banker , for the whole amount . His capital is now uninvested , and he appears in the market on the next day as a purchaser . Unfortunately for him , however , the bank , too , makes its appearance , for the second time , in the same capacity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its " deposits " have grown with the increase of its investments . Such success emboldens it to repeat the operation , and another million is purchased , with similar results . It obtains the bills , and the owners obtain credits on the books of the bank , which thus runs in debt , and the more debt it contracts , the more means it appears to suppose itself to have at command . With the second million , prices have risen ; and with the third , they rise still higher ; and so on with each successive million . Capital appears superabundant , because the former owner of these millions of securities is seeking for profitable investments ; when the real superabundance consists only in debts which the bank has incurred . Prices advance from day to day , and a speculative disposition is engendered by the growth of fortune among the holders of stocks , and next it becomes necessary to manufacture new stocks for the purpose of employing this vast surplus capital . New railroads are therefore projected and subscribed for : vast contracts are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raising corn , are breaking up the old roads to replace them with new , or building palaces for the lucky speculators . Immense orders for iron , and bricks , and timber , are given . Prices advance . England becomes a good place to sell in , and a bad one to buy in . Imports increase , and exports decrease . Bullion goes abroad . The bank has to sell securities . Prices fall . Business is paralyzed . The roads are half made , and can not be completed . The people are ruined , and the bank escapes with difficulty from the ruin she /z/ herself has made , congratulates herself on the dexterity she has shown , and prepares to repeat the operation at the first opportunity . Such is the history of 1825 , 1836 , and 1839 , at all of which periods , the bank manufactured " deposits " by monopolizing securities , and was then itself misled into the belief that the increase of its own debts indicated an actual surplus of capital . Whenever that institution purchases a security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment : the person from whom it is purchased will unquestionably use the means that are placed at his command for the creation of some new species of investment , as no man willingly permits his capital to lie idle . If it make this purchase with the money of others , the inevitable effect must be to raise prices , and stimulate the late owner to increased activity to provide the new investment ; and whenever it shall be provided , he will , either directly or indirectly , demand payment in gold , and then the security must be parted with to provide means for the payment ; at which time prices will as inevitably fall , because the creditor of the bank has been labouring to invest capital which had no real existence in any other form than that of a railroad , or canal , or some other public work , or debt , already created , and which could not be used for the formation of other roads or canals : and thus , while the one party has been trying to invest his funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already invested , and drawing interest for their use . A double action has thus been produced , causing inflation and speculation to be followed by panic and ruin . The course of the bank , in the late railroad speculation , appears to have been precisely the same as was , in the great land speculation of 1836 , that of the banks of the west , established among a scattered people who still cultivated poor lands : and who borrowed money to make the banks . A man purchased a section of land , and paid the amount to ihe treasurer . The treasurer deposited the money in the /z/ bank . The bank lent the man his money , on his note . He paid it again to the treasurer , jwho again deposited it in the bank , which again lent it to the original owner , who again bought land , and again paid the treasurer , repeating the operation until , with a single thousand dollars , he became the owner of tens of thousands of acres . At the end of the operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had , in exchange , a vast amount of bank credits : and the bank held the notes of the speculator . For a series of years , every species of difficulty had been thrown in the way of those who desired to make roads , the effect of which had been to cause an unnatural accumulation of uninvested capital : to lower the price of money : and to produce enormous speculation in railroads to be made . All England was engaged in it , from the highest peer to the smallest shopkeeper ; for the desire of gain by speculation is always in the direct ratio of the difficulty of obtaining a living by honest industry . It is universal in France : and far greater and more universal in England than in the United States. * The consequence was , that early in the last year a large amount of money was required to be paid for deposits on account of roads for which charters were to be obtained . The difficulty was supposed to consist not in the matter of capital , but in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accomplish it . The very fact of the vast sum required in that early stage of the business should have baen sufficient to induce great doubt of the propriety of the operation , and had the bank not interfered , very many doubtful speculations would have fallen to the ground . Ever ready , however , to foster a speculative tendency , she * In France , speculation in stocks by women in high life is a matter of daily occurrence . In England , it is less frequent , but it does occur : as the papers of the day furnish ample evidence . In both countries , ladies make Wets on th ? results of horse-races : small ones , it is true , but small as they are , they are evidence of the speculative tendency . In the United tai ? s , such things arj unknown . /z/ was not found wanting on this occasion . She took the money , and lent it out as fast.as paid in ; and thus enabled the same thousand pounds to pay the deposits on thousands of shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land speculator . In the latter case , there was one advantage , which the railroad speculation did not possess . No further payments were there to be required ; whereas , here , the loan was only to facilitate the first payment , which was to be followed by an almost endless series of instalments . In February , 1846 , the bank had become debtor to its depositors the principal of whom was the accountant who received those deposits , or , in other words , a state treasurer .18,000,000 , and it held .36,000,000 of securities , 23,000,000 of which were private ; and thus it had afforded to the railroad speculators of England precisely the same fad lity that the western banks granted to the land speculators of their respective vicinities . Had no such interference taken place , and had subscribers to roads been compelled , as they should have been , to find money instead of giving notes ; thus affording evidence of the existence of the capital required ; many ruinous schemes would have been crushed in the outset : fewer persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been engaged in cultivation : prices would not have been so high : more manufactures would have been exported : and the corn required to make amends for deficient crops would have been less in quantity , and paid for with manufactures , or with bullion , that might have been spared without causing the slightest disturbance in the monetary world of Britain : but the pro prietors of the bank would have received no bonus , in addi tion to their usual half-yearly dividend , the object sought for in fostering speculation. * /z/ . Among the assets of the bank are three quantities that may be regarded as constants . These are 1 . The rest , or surplus capital - - 4,000,000 2 . The circulation ..... 20,000,000 3 . The public deposits , to the extent of - 2,500,000 Total - - 26,500,000 With all the excitement of the last two years , the average amount of securities held by the bank , is but about .30,000,000 . That excitement has been produced by using the capital of others , placed in her hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had the law limited her to the use of the above items , which may be regarded as almost the same as her own capital , and by the use of which she interferes with nobody : and had the amount of her securities never exceeded the sum of those quantities : no excitement could ever have been produced ; no panic could ever have followed ; vast losses would have been avoided ; bank stock would not have fallen , in two months , from 205 to 189 ; and England would now be in the enjoyment of high prosperity , notwithstanding the failure of her crops . During the period from 1832 to 1839 , the amount of those items varied but little from .23,000,000 . We will now show the state of the securities of the bank , taking that sum as a par , and marking as plus + , or minus , the variations that occurred , with their effects .
