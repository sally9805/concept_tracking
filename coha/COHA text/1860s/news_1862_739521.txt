txt Not one man in a thousand can report correctly facts observed by him . Any one fa miliar with the giving of testimony in courts or with reports of scientific phenomena by in ' experienced persons , will readily agree to this statement . Very few men , indeed , when they observe facts , see the important ones , or remember them when they do see them . We presume the whole public , like ourselves , has felt this difficulty in the reports with regard to the condition and numbers of the rebel army . The accounts seemed so often purely " sensation descriptions , " and to be made by people of so little habit of observation , or under such excitement of feeling , that we have cone to put very little confidence in them . We have just had an opportunity of conversing with one of our surgeons who was captured at Harper 's Ferry  --  a gentleman of scientific habit of mind and close observation . lie had the opportunity which , till then , had scarcely been enjoyed by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , as they were crossing the Potomac . There were two corps d'orm  --  e ? that of LONGSTREET and STONEWALL . JACKSON : they marched in two solid columns over the bridges , and were about fifteen hours in passing . This gentlemen counted the numbers in a given time , and then made a rough estimate of the whole force : his reckoning would show those corps alone numbering close upon 60,000 . He had heard the usual accounts of the costume , appearance and condition of the rebel army , and like most of us , supposed them exaggerations . But he now says that no descriptions he has seen approach the truth . There never was beheld such a gang of ragged , rowdy looking men . It was like an army of rag-pickers . There was no uniform or attempt at uniform . Officers and men were equally dirty and dingy . The hats were commonly old " Wide-Awakes , " stained by a long campaign , often with the tops gone and the hair streaming out . The tro  --  sers were of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coats , if they , bad any , were dirty and ragged , and often well greased by the piece of bacon which each man carried on his bayonet . The shirts were black with long use . One officer told our informant that he had not been able to change his shirt for six weeks . Their blankets were of all colors and materials  --  often bits of carpeting and old bed-comforters . Nearly one-half of the men were barefooted . They carried their crackers and bullets and caps all together in their pockets . Both officers and men were excessively lousy , and the stench from the passing columns was almost unbearable . As they marched by , our men were surprised at first at the great number of field officers , riding in the lines , and then at the small numbers gathered around the flags . Their first theory was that these were sections of regiments , each with a separate flag . But they soon discovered that they were bona fide regiments , numbering from 150 to 300 men , with their own banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were informed , had numbered 1,000 and 1,100 men . Their method of treating their sick and wounded ig-ould account for much of this diminution . After each regiment . followed some half-dozen men with stretchers , and whenever a man fell out of the ranks from sickness , he was taken at once to the nearest house , and left there to the mercies of the country people . So with those wounded or operated on in battle . They were never carried with the army . The men were by no means in good spirits . They told our informant that they had been constantly walking since the battles before Richmond , and with very little to eat . They reproached ifecxsoe with working them too hard . There was no enthusiasm shown by any of them , and the North . Carolinians and the Irish were particularly lukewarm . The Virginians alone expressed sonic bitterness , on account of the ravages which their State had suffered . They evidently felt the deepest disappointment at their reception in Maryland . With " regard to the future prospects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two:new levies , by volunteering and drafting , could not possibly . be raised at the North . We had come , they believed , to the end of our power . The whole rebel army had , to the eyes of this medical gentleman and his associates , a worn-out , exhausted look . The physique , ' was inferior to that of our men , and they evidently suffered from want of food and overwork . Even the horses looked wretchedly . With such testimony as this , from persons accustomed especially to judge of the physical condition of men , what may not be believed of the present condition of the rebel army ? Men can Eight on empty stomachs and endure long and harassing marches , where victory and  --  plunder reward them . But now to retrace the weary steps over a desolated country , under the consciousness of defeat and disaster , and with an active enemy behind them , must have a most discouraging effect upon them . They want rest and food . This is precisely what we should not allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . An incessant , vigorous attack from our forces , might go far to break up and utterly demoralize the rebel army . Hesitation now , slow movements , any Corinth or Richmond operations with spade and pick-axe , will surely give the enemy time to recuperate , and destroy all the advantages of this successful campaign .
