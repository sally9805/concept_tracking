txt THE PACIFIC RAILROAD-OPEN . HOW TO GO : WHAT TO SEE . I. " f HIS is Faneuil Hall - open , " said I. Mr. Webster on a memorable occasion in his life . This is the Pacific Railroad - open ; and a more memorable event is it for our national life . I often think , with a private chuckle , of the many delightful surprises in store for those of us who go out over it now into our new and unknown West , before the tribe of guide-book makers , newspaper letter-writers , journal-keepers , and photographers have " done it to death " with pen and collodion . Europe long ago became only a familiar panorama , with the ohs and ahs and apt sentimentalism all written in at the proper places , like the " cheers " and " laughter " of a faithfully reported speech . But thanks to the toughness of day and night stage travel for a continuous three weeks ; thanks to the greed for gold and the high prices of food , leaving no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at its scenery , or to study its phenomena , or at least to write about them ; thanks , indeed , to the Indians , of whom all sentimental travellers have a holy horror ; thanks , finally , to the rapidity with which the railroad has been built , - we have here a world of nature , fresh and tempting for the explorer . The field is too broad , also , the variety of experiences to be had too great , the forms and freaks of nature too strange and too numerous , the whole revelation too unique and too astonishing , to be readily catalogued and put into flexible covers for one 's overcoat-pocket . So the pleasure of original discovery - delicious victual for our vanity - may // 494 not unfairly be enjoyed by those who travel within the next year or two by the Pacific Railroad , and are wise enough and have leisure enough to deploy liberally to the right and left at salient points along its track . Near two thirds of all the land of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of Alaska , which will doubtless prove a very good thing when we have found out what to do with it . The Pacific Railroad fairly bisects this vast area east and west , as the Rocky Mountains  --  the backbone and dividing line of the continent - do north and south ; the two cutting it up into huge quarters , each of which would overlay all Europe this side of Russia , and flap lustily in the wind all around the edges . It will take us long to learn what there is on and in it ; h@w long , indeed , to subjugate it to use and the ministries of civilization ! But with one railroad of two thousand miles built across it in four years , and two others to follow within the present generation , our strides in its conquest are at least on equal scale with its majesty and its mysteries . Skipping the Mississippi Valley as more or less familiar country to us all , and taking up the New West on the other side of the Missouri , where the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country hence to the Pacific . First the Plains , that grandest of all glacial deposits according to Agassiz , five hundred miles wide and one thousand miles long , stretching from river to mountains , from Britain to Mexico ; a magnificent earth-ocean , rolling up in beautiful green billows along the shores of the continental streams and continental mountains that border it , but calming down in the vast centre as if the divine voice had here again uttered its " Peace , be still . " The ocean does not give deeper sense of illimitable space ; never such feeling of endless repose , as inspires the traveller amid this unchanging boundlessness . We *u*ed to call it The Great American Desert ; it is really the great natural pasture-ground of the nation ; and the Platte will yet prove the northern Nile . The antelope , the buffalo , and the wolf are already disappearing before the horse , the ox , and the sheep , and these , for so far as the waters of the Platte may be spread , - and volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give way in time to fields of corn and wheat . Next the Mountains , - five hundred miles width of mountains , staying the continent at its centre , and feeding the great waters that fertilize two thirds its area , and keep the two oceans alive . The Cordilleras of South America , the Rocky Mountains of North America , are here broken up into a dozen subranges , with vast elevated plains lying among and between ; their crests broken down and wasted away for a pathway for the iron track across the continent . This section is full of natural wonder and beauty , of scientific variety and marvel ; in its centre , holding the divide of the continent , lies a great barren basin , without living streams , and almost without living springs , - a desert , indeed , which the trains should always manage to pass over in the night ; and beyond is the picturesque descent into Salt Lake valley , pastmajestic ruins of majestic mountains , under towering walls of granite , along banks of snow and beds of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose waters lead ' the locomotive a losing race , and turn the train from one novelty to another , from one wonder to a greater , - altogether , perhaps , the most interesting and exciting portion of the whole continental ride . Now a third stretch of five hundred miles through Utah and Nevada , whose united territory takes in little more than the vast interior basin , which , more properly than any other region in our extended territory , merits the name of the American Desert . The Colorado and its tributaries drain much of its eastern and all its southeastern portions ; and some of the shorter branches // of the Snake or Columbia cross its northern border ; but , with these exceptions , all the waters within its six hundred by three hundred miles ' area rise and flow and waste within itself . They contribute nothing to the common stock of the ocean . Salt Lake is its chief sheet of water , - fifty by one hundred miles in extent , - and is bountifully fed from the western slopes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Humboldt River , lying east and west along its upper line , and marking the track of the railroad for some three hundred miles , though fed from various ranges of mountains , that cut the basin every dozen or twenty miles north and south , yet finally weakens and wastes itself in a huge sink within a hundred miles of the California line . So with the fresh streams that pour down on the western border from the Sierra Nevadas ; and those of feebler floW from the winter snows of the interior mountain ranges , - all , so soon as they reach the valleys , begin to be rapidly absorbed by the dry air and the drier elements of the soil , and sooner or later absolutely die away . Yet , where and while they do exist , there are strips of fertile land that yield most abundantly in grass and grain and vegetables ; and where , as in the Salt Lake valley on the east , and in the Carson on the west , the mountain streams can be divided and spread about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , this is a barren and uninteresting country for the general traveller ; sodas and salts and sulphurs taint the waters and the soils ; the dust , wherever disturbed , is as searching and poisonous as it is delicate and impalpable ; the rare grass is not green , but a sickly yellow or a faint gray ; trees and shrubs huddle like starved and frightened sheep into little nooks among the hills , - stunted and peevish in growth and character , with no others near , and often none visible within the horizon 's stretch of ten or twenty miles ; no flower dreams of life in such imcongeniality ; wastes of volcanic rocks 495 lie along and around rivers that might otherwise be tempted to hless the country they pass through ; beds of furious torrents slash the hillsides and mar the valleys ; while fields of alkali look in the distance like refreshing banks of snow , and taunt approach with the suffocating reality . Some of the valleys seem indeed to realize the character of the fabled Death 's Valley of southern Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no human life ever goes ; and yet , within this grand area of distance and desert , two States have risen and are prosperous , - one planted by the fanaticism of a relig ! ion , and the other by the fanaticism for gold and silver . To these are we indebted for our path across the continent ; and in these the traveller finds refreshment for his finer senses in the purity of the air , and the beauty of the rounded hills that , with the winds for architect , present such forms , unbroken by rock or trees , as are a constant exhilaration to the eye . The final division of the journey begins with the eastern foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains , and c*irries us over these , through twice-welcome forests of unaccustomed height and variety ; by broad lakes of rare purity and beauty ; along rocky precipices unscaled until the engineer for the railroad planted his level on the walls , and the Chinaman followed with his subduing pick ; down by fathomless gorges ; through long delaying foot - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or green with the vineyards that promise to heal the wounds of nature ; out by the muddy Sacramento , and its broad alluvials , golden brown with the summer 's decay ; over long stretches of the tule marshes ; under the shadows of Mount Diablo ; finally across the wide inland bay to the sand hills which the Pacific has thrown up as a barrier to its own restless ambition , and over which San Francisco roughly but rapidly creeps into her position as the second great city of America . This is but a two hundred miles ' ride , and should be made from *un to The Pacific Railroad- open . // sun , for it takes the traveller through lands already famed in our history , and introduces him to that region of wonderful wealth , of contradictory and comprehensive nature , of strange scientific revelations , of fascinations unequalled , of repulsions undisputed , - California , the seat of a new empire , the promised creator of a new race . And here the traveller 's experiences have but just begun ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go hack and look around , and see where he should linger , on what it should feed itself . II . Humboldt , in one of his solemn sentences , prescribes three requisites for travel in new regioi*s i . Serenity of mind ; 2 . Passionate love for some class of scientific labor ; 3 . A pure feeling for the enjoyment which Nature , in her freedom , is ready to impart . These are all very desirable ; at least one is indispensable ; but my companions may swap off the other two for a well-filled purse and a bood set of flannels . We ' may be as serene and scientific and sentimental as the old German traveller himself ; hut without these other possessions , we can not go far or be very comfortable . Then we must be liberal as to time , too ; the average American can see Europe in thirty days , I know ; but this is a bigger job . True , with that limit , he can be carried from Boston to San Francisco in ten days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one or two failures to connect at that , - . and back in the same time , and have a third ten days to look about him in the mountains , in Utah and in Friscoe ; and this is better than nothing , of course ; but still , comparing what he thinks he knows with what he really does , before and after such a trip , he will be immensely more ignorant when he returns than he was at starting . I can not tolerate the idea of less than sixty days ; and we shall find three months devoted to the journey the busiest and best spent in our lives . That is as little time as any one proposing really to see our interior and Pacific States should allow himself to take for the purpose . So make a ninety-day note for your expenses , - well , say five hundred dollars a month , - the average Atlantic reader will hardly get off with less , - and leave a good indorser for any little contingency of delay , such as a pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a long call from those persuasive gentlemen of the interior basin , " the road agents . " We may as well count railroad travel at five cents a mile , and stage at twenty cents , and board and lodging , whether with Pullman or at the hotels , at five dollars a day . Extras and contingencies will absorb all these allowances have to spare ,  --  if they have any . Prejudices against sleeping-cars must be conquered at the start . They are a necessity of our long American travel . There are often no inviting or even folerable places for stopping over night , and , besides , we can not afford to lose the time , when so much of beauty and interest lies beyond . But the Pullman saloon , sleeping and restaurant cars of the West , - as yet unknown in the Atlantic States , - make railroad travelling a different thing from what it is in the close , cramped , ill-ventilated , dirty box-cars of common experience . They introduce a comfort , even a luxury , into life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained to . For the Pacific Railroad excursions these cars will be offered to private parties on special charter ; that is , one or two dozen people may club together , and hire one for their home by day and night as they ride through to the Pacific coast , and back , stopping over with them wherever they choose on the route . By day , they are op*n , roomy , broad-seated cars ; by night , they offer equally comfortable beds , with clean linen and thick blankets ; with as good toilet accommodations as space will allow , and a servant at command constantly . Those with a kitchen furnish a meal to order , equal to that of a firstclass restaurant and with neat and // fresh table appointments . But the eating-stations on the whole route already average respectably ; some of them are most excellent ; and all will soon be at least good . The modern American mind , especially that of the Western type , gives intelligent thought to the food question ; and one of the surprises before us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast . The Pullman cars go along with all through* trains , and the independent traveller can make such use of them , day or night , as he chooses to pay for . Those for sleeping only are attached to the trains as night approaches , and dropped in the morning , while the traveller resumes his place in the regular cars of the road . But travellers who can afford the extra expense will choose either to share in a special charter of one for the round trip , or engage a particular seat and berth in a regular one for so far as they may be going without stopping . To understand their advantages , and learn how best to make use of them , is a part of the education of the traveller in New America . Their introduction and development and popular use mark an era in the history of railroad travel ; and place America at the head of nations in its convenience and comfort . Though Pullman promises to back one of these cars to order up at our very doors in Boston or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey at Chicago . This is just one third the way across the continent , and the beginning of the New West , whose spirit is nowhere else so proudly rampant , in whose growth no other city is so intimately concerned . The pulse of the Pacific beats with electric sympathy on the southern shore of Lake Michigan ; and if Chicago does not hear every blow of the pick in the depths of the gold- mines of Colorado and Montana , she at least has made sure to furnish the pick , and to have a claim on the gold it brings to light . One now , two next month , three in the fall , and another year four roads invite us across Illinois and Iowa to 497 the junction of the Pacific road proper on the Missouri River . This five-hundred-mile ride is through the best of the rich prairie country of the Mississippi Valley . If it is stranger to us , it will arouse our enthusiasm by its widereaching openness , the evidences of its fertility , and the signs of its civilization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall even the more wonder at the rapidity of its growth and the wealth of its accumulating harvests . It is quite worth while to stop a day either on the Mississippi River at Clinton or Davenport or Burlington , or at some such town as Geneva or Dixon in Illinois , or Grinnell or Des Moines in Iowa , and see more closely than the cars permit the character and culture of this most interesting region and its population . Last year , before the Pacific Railroad was open , it was the New West ; now it is the Old ; but it will always be the garden and granary of the continent . It is our new New England ; here the Yankee has broadened and softened ; and what he can do , what he has done , with a richer soil , a broader area , a larger hope , and a surer realization , is worth the scrutiny of every American and every student of America . Those who would understand the sources of American wealth , and the courses of American politics and religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , dwarfed in the larger life of the mellower regions of the Republic , - it may be the taunt of her enemies that hers is a departed sceptre is substantially true ; but she has a resurrection here , and her sons and daughters havecometoa new glory in these prairies , heavenly by comparison with her sterile hillsides . Stop and see if you recognize them in their new robes . Council Bluffs , the depot of the gathering lines of the East , and Omaha , opposite , the starting-point of the grand continental line , challenge attention for the striking diversity and yet striking similarity of their locations on the bottoms and bluffs of the Missouri River , as well as for the wonderful rapidity of // 498 their growth and their large future promise . Four railroads come in already from the East at Council Bluffs ; very soon the number will be doubled ; and with these and the swift and strong Missouri rollii*g between , and carrying steamboats two thousand miles north to the very line of British America and the Rocky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico , the two towns are surely to be one of the largest centres of traffic and travel on the continent . We shall not need to stop for the next five hundred miles . The first hundred and fifty are a repetition of the Iowa we have left behind , - rich rolling prairies , already broken by plough , or smoothed with the track of the mower ,  - -  beyond , the grand Plains proper , cut by the Platte , with wood-houses and water-spouts every twelve or fifteen miles , and workshops and eating-houses every seventy-five or one hundred ; the road straight as an arrow across the whole region , and apparently as level as the floor , though actually rising steadily at the rate of ten feet to the mile for the entire five hundred miles ; - there is enough of the journey to satisfy curiosity and exhaust novelty ; there is none too much to absorb the grand impressions of vastness , and majesty of area , and take in the glory of sunset and sunrise along the unending horizon . The Plains introduce us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cloudless sky and far-reaching vision - which is the great and growing charm of the whole region from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean . Moving westward from New England , there is a constantly increasing dryness of atmosphere , with a broadening sweep and power for the eye ; but , after getting fairly outside Eastern influences upon the Plains , it takes on a positive character , and the traveller feels it as a beauty , as an exhilaration , an inspiration to every sense . It surrounds him with a new world ; it fills him with a new spirit ; and it gives delight and loveliness to experiences and forms , that x , yould never have pleased under different skies and in a denser atmosphere . The nights become cold also . Glaring as may have been the day 's sun , and searchfng its heat , the evening brings refreshing coolness , and the night need of blankets . This phenomenon , too , will attend him through all the new countries he is now entering upon . At Cheyenne the Plains end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and the figures of railroad subsidies . The hills at least come into sight ; and though the track goes forward through an open country , the shadows of the great Rocky Mountain belt fall faintly around us . Cheyenne wondered and waited long , but finally determined to be a town . Colorado makes its connection here with the continental road ; it is as high up - near six thousand feet above the sea level - as that road will care to have the winter quarters of its supplies and machinery ; it is far enough away to be out of the shadow of Omaha ; and Denver lies one hundred miles to the south , and is off the main route . So the town has several thousand settled population , and is steadily growing . Here I make a personal point of our switching off . We must see Denver , the real Rocky Mountains , which the railroad cheats us of , - their grand snow peaks and their wonderful wide parks , the scene and the source of the central life of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sigh of the Sierra Nevada pines , or listen to the roll of the*Pacific waters . III . Though Colorado lies below the line of our first Pacific Railroad , and above the second , - which I take it will be the Southern , - she can not be refused a first place among their revelations . Because of her mountains , which turn the tracks north and south , she allures the lovers of the grand and the picturesque in scenery ; because of her mines of gold and silver , she seduces the greedy for gain ; because of the agricultural resources of her plains and her // 499 valleys , she will have steady growth , permanent prosperity , and moral rectitude , - for these are the gifts of a recompensing soil ; because of her many and various mineral springs , soda , sulphur , and iron , and of her wonderfully clear , dry , and pure atmosphere , she will be the resort of the health-seeking . Within her borders , the great continental mountains display their most magnificent proportions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite the farmer and the husbandman , and the best population , between the Missouri River and California , has organized itself into a State . Fifty thousand people here have more than become self-supporting ; they are already wealth-producing ; and social order and its institutions of education and religion are established . The main Pacific Railroad wisely hastens to connect itself with them by a branch from Cheyenne to Denver ; and St. Louis " builded better than she knew " after all , when , in the apparent spirit of a blind rivalry , she pushed her Eastern Division Pacific Road sfraight towards their centre . Failing to go through the mountains , this road will yet find recompense in furnishing the most direct communication between Colorado and the East , and in throwing out branches from its terminus here , through the best agricultural sections of Colorado , to the main continental lines , above and below . If the branch track is not laid to Denver when we leave Cheyenne , so much the better . The stage ride of this one hundred miles is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best representation of that sort of travel which the rapid progress of our railway system has left us . Fine Concord coaches , six sleek and gay horses in every team , changed each ten miles , good meals on the way , the road itself generally smooth and hard over the open rolling prairie , the sky clear , the air an inspiration , the open ocean of the plains on one side , the long and high mountain battlements shadowing us on the other , - altogether this is as fine a bit of out-door life by day as will come within the range of all our summer 's journey . By night , for the ride occupies the night as well , there are other incidents which I forbear to mention in detail ; but if my companions served in the war , or have tended sick and cross babies through a winter 's night , when they had the toothache themselves , I am sure they will survive it . We shall like Denver , spread out upon the rising plain , with the Platte River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine blocks of stores , and a panoramic mountain view before it , such as rises before no other town in all the circle of modern travel . For one hundred miles , buttressed on the north by Long 's Peak and on the south by Pike 's Peak , each 14,000 feet high , its line of majestic rock and snow peaks stretches before the eye , ever a surprise by its variety , ever a beauty by its form and color , ever an inspiration in its grandeur . The Alps from Berne do not compare with the Rocky Mountains from Denver ; in nearness , in variety , in clearness of atmosphere , in grand sweep of distance , in majestic uplifting of height , these are vastly the superior . Any man with a susceptibility to God 's presence in nature must find it very easy to be good in Denver . Certainly , to watch these mountains , through the changes of light and cloud of a summer 's day and evening , is a joyful experience worth coming from a long distance to Denver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mountains , twenty-five , fifty , and seventy-five miles from Denver , which is but the political and business capital , and thus facilities exist for travel into the regions whither we would go for knowledge and enjoyment of nature . Ten hours of staging take us through Central City , the chief gold-mining centre , at a height of seven thousand feet above the sea , with a population of several thousands , on to Georgetown , two thousand feet higher , the centre of the silver production , with nearly three thousand inhabitants . The way // 500 is full of mountain and valley scenery of freshest interest and startling beauty . At Idaho and Fall River , little villages in the South Clear Creek valley , on the route , are accommodations for summer visitors , with cold and warm soda springs at the former place , furnishing most luxurious bathing . And at Georgetown , with larger and better hotels , we are in the very heart of the highest and finest mountain life of the State . Gray 's Peaks , the highest explored summits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinguished Cambridge botanist , lie just beyond and above the town , and the excursion to and from their tops may easily be made in a day with guide and horses from Georgetown . The working of mines up as high as twelve thousand feet has secured a wagon-road two thirds the way , and a trail for horses goes to either of the two summits of themountain . The view from either , of a clear morning , is the most commanding and impressive , I truly believe , within the range of all ordinary American or European travel . Nothing in the Alps takes you so high , reaches so wide . There we overlook a petty province ; here the broad American Continent spreads itself around us as a centre , and stretches out its illimitable lengths before the eye . The rain-drops falling on one coat-sleeve flow off to the Pacific ; on the other , to the Atlantic ; we are at the very apex , the absolute physical centre of the North American Continent ; the scene assures the thought , and is worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-ribbed mountains lie all around , - west , east , north , and south ; they riot in luxuriant multiplicity ; for . this is the fastness , the gathering and distributing point of the grand continental range ; while away to the east lies the gray-green sea of the Plains , and distributed among the snow folds of the mountains are miniature copies of the same , which look like patches of prairie amid the continent of mountains , yet are , in fact , great Central Parks , from ten to thirty miles wide and forty to seventy miles long . North , Middle , South , and San Luis Parks , - they lie along through the whole line of Central Colorado , - great elevated basins or plains , directly under the highest mountains , - soft and smooth ways upon the very backbone of the continent . Some lie on the Atlantic side , others on the Pacific side of the divide ; and their height above the sea level ranges from seven thousand to ten thousand feet . In Europe or in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not perpetual ice and snow ; but here in Western America , grains and vegetables are successfully cultivated and cattle graze the year round at seven thousand feet , while between that and ten thousand feet there is rich summer pasturage and often great crops of natural grass are cured for hay . These great fertile areas among the high mountains of Colorado - this wedding of majestic hill and majestic plain , of summer and winter , of fecund life and barren rock - present abundant attractions for a full summer 's travel . For the lover of the grand and the novel in nature , or the weary seeking rest from toil and excitement , our country offers nothing so richly recompensing as a summer among the Parks and Mountains of Colorado . The dryness of the climate inviting to out-door life , is favorable to lung difficulties , though the very thin air of the higher regions must be avoided by those whose lungs are quite weak . Asthma and bronchitis flee before the breath of this dry , pure atmosphere , and it operates as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about in the same latitude , and their thermometers have nearly the same range , though Denver is nearly six thousand feet higher . Its noons are probably warmer , and its nights are certainly cooler , the year round ; but the dryer and lighter air , ever in motion from plain and mountain , makes its summer heats always tolerable . Denver is exposed to snow from October to May , but it rarely stays long ; sleighing is as much of a novelty as at Washington // or Philadelphia , and its winters are more like a dry , clear New England November than any other season of the East . The valleys and parks of the mountains are similar in climatic character , allowing for the difference of three or four thousand feet in elevation . The principal snows are in early spring , and the rains in late spring and early summer . Midwinter and midsummer are uniformly dry and clear . When clouds and storms do come , they are always brief . The sun soon shines through them to warm and clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of extended travel or a summer 's life in Colorado . A party of four , well mounted on mules or Western ponies , with a guide and servant , and two pack-mules for tents and blankets and food , can gain such experience of rare nature , such gift of health , such endowment of pleasure , in leisurely travel over its mountains and among its parks , lingering by the side of their beautiful lakes and their abundant streams fat with trout , basking in its sunshine , hunting in its woods , and bathing in its mineral springs , as nowhere else that I know of in all America . This is surely destined to be " the correct thing to do , " for the pleasure and health seekers of the future America . Over in Middle Park , two days ' horseback ride from Georgetown , are the famous Hot Sulphur Springs ,  --  a douchebath and a sitz - bath united , such as only experience of their wondrous tonic can appreciate . The water is of the temperature of x ro ' Fahrenheit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and pours over a ledge of rock ten feet high into a pool below with a stream of four to six inches in diameter . When wagonroads are made to the spot , as they soon will be , invalids will flock to these springs in July and August from the whole country . Already they are a favorite local resort , despite the hard climb over the mountains into the valley where they lie . The South Park is the most attractive and most frequented of these elevated areas ; and a good wagon-road from Denver , branching out within the Park to all its various sections , and taverns and mining villages strung freely along one and through the other , invite the traveller to its easy enjoyment . Mount Lincoln , the great parent mountain of the parent range , stands at the northwestern angle of the Park , and may be ascended without too severe labor from the village of Montgomery . It is of the same height as the loftiest of Gray 's Peaks , and commands a like view . The connoisseurs in mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider and grander prospect . Either view is grand enough , and one or other should be enjoyed by every visitor to Colorado . Our ascent of Lincoln was made amid contending torrents of rain , snow , hail , and sunshine ; and though the views we obtained were not so complete and satisfactory as those from Gray , the experience was perhaps the grander , because of its variety , and the terrible impressiveness of a storm on the mountaintops , opening and closing long glimpses of ghastly worlds of rocks and snow below and all around us . The upper mountains of Colorado - at 11,000 and 12,000 feet - hold numerour pools and lakes , and not infrequent waterfalls ; a party , that made the ascent of Long 's Peak for the first time last season , report nearly forty lakes in view at once ; but the parks and lower ranges offer them but rarely . A day 's ride , in saddle or wagon , out of South Park over into the valley of the Upper Arkansas , where various new beauties of scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Twin Lakes , as beautifully lying sheets of water as mountains ever guarded or sun shone on . They are of kindred character with the Cumberland lakes of England , the Swiss and Italian lakes , and those of Tahoe and Donner in the California Sierra Nevada , which are among the sweet revelations of the Pacific Railroad . The Twin Lakes will be one of the specialties when the world goes to Colorado for its summer vacations . The tree life of the Rocky Mountains // 502 is meagre ; pines and firs and aspens ( or cottonwood ) make up its catalogue ; nor are these so abundant or so rich in size or beauty as to challenge special attention . They grow in greatest luxuriance at elevations of from eight to eleven thousand feet , and the timber line does not cease till nearly twelve thousand feet is reached . A silver-fir or spruce is the one charm among the trees . But the flora is more varied and more beautiful ; Dr. Parry reports one hundred and forty-one different species in these higher mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can report that nowhere else have I gathered such wealth , in glory of color , and perfection and numbers , of fringed gentians , harebells , painter 's brush , buttercups , larkspurs , child sunflowers , dandelions , and columbines , as on these eight and ten thousand feet high hillsides , or in little nooks of grass and grove still higher . Blue and yellow are the dominant colors ; but the reds flame out in the painter 's brush and the kernel of the sunflowers , like beacons of light amid darkness . With much lacking in details of beauty and interest , that are found in the country life of New England and the Middle States , as in California , Colorado more than redeems herself by the charm of her atmosphere and the magnificent majesty of her mountains and *er plains . These are her title to supremacy , - her claim to be to America what Switzerland is to Europe . But I can not hope my Pacific Railroad travellers will give more than seven or ten days to Colorado , - an appetizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on the patriotic and thrifty citizens of Denver and Georgetown to perfect some arrangements , by which , April , in that time , they may get a fair glimpse of its grand and rare specialties of mountain ranges and enfolded parks , and a share in the enjoyment they offer . A ride up through the mottntains by Boulder Creek or South Clear Creek valleys , on to the head of the latter above Empire or at Georgetown ; the ascent of Gray or Lincoln ; and a peep into and a cut across the South Park , with two or three nights in camp , and a half-day 's trout-fishing , - these I consider essential ; and under good guidance they may all be had within the time mentioned . Ascending Gray 's Peaks from George town , I should recommend going down on the other side , and a night 's camp on the Snake River ; thence to the junction of the Snake , the Blue , and Ten Mile Creek ; up the Blue to Breckinridge ; over the Breckinridge Pass into South Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not time for Lincoln or the Arkansas Lakes , across th' Park and out to Denver by Turkey Creek Canyon and the Plains . All this could be put into seven days from Denver , though ten would be better ; but through lack of a wagon-road from Georgetown over to Snake River , it would have to be done in part or altogether in the saddle . Hotels could be reached for all but one or two nights ; but these may be made , with fortunate camping-ground , choice companions , and plenty of blankets and firewood , the most memorable and happy of the whole week . With such experience as this , we go back to the railroad at Cheyenne , with a new sense of the greatness of Ameri*ca , with a curious doubting wonder as to what can lie beyond , and with appetites that we shall probably have to go to Ford 's to satisfy , while waiting for our train for Salt Lake City .                  @ @ @
