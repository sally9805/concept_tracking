IN June , 1861 , Dr. Russell , the correspondent of the London Times , was ascending the Mississippi in a steamboat , on board of which was a body of Confederate troops , several of whom were sick , and lay along the deck helpless . Being an old campaigner , he had his medicine-chest with him , and he was thins enabled to administer to these men the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge fellow , attenuated to a skeleton by dysentery , who appears to have been aware of his benefactor 's connection with the press , gasped out these words : " Stranger , remember , if I die , that 1 am Robert Tallon of // Tishimingo County , and that I died for States ' Rights . See , now , they put that in the papers , wo n't you ? Robert Tallon died for States ' Rights . " Having thus spoken , he turned over on his blanket , and was silent . Dr. Russell assures his readers that this man only expressed the nearly unanimous feeling of the Southern people at the outbreak of the war . He , had been ten weeks travelling in the Southern States , and he declared that the people had but one battle-cry ,  --  " States ' Rights , and death to those who make war upon them ! " About the same time , we remember , there was a paragraph going the rounds of the newspapers which related a conversation said to have taken place between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the word " country , " the Northerner asked him , " What is your country ? " To which the boy instantly and haughtily replied , " SOUTH CAROLINA ! " Such anecdotes as these were to most of us here at the North a revelation . The majority of the Northern people actually did not know of the existence of such a feeling as that expressed by the Carolina boy , nor of the doctrine enunciated by the dying soldier . If every boy in the Northern States old enough to understand the question had been asked , What is your country ? every one of them , without a moment 's hesitation , would have quietly answered in substance thus : " Why , the United States , of course " ; - and the only feeling excited by the question would have been one of surprise that it should have been asked . And with regard to that " battle-cry " of States ' Rights , seven tenths of the voters of the North hardly knew what a Southern man meant when he pronounced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of a people so ignorant of one another , so little homogeneous , that nearly all on one side of an imaginary line were willing to risk their lives for an idea which the inhabitants on the other side of the line not only did not entertain , but knew nothing about . We observe something similar in the British empire . The ordinary Englishm*x does not know what it is of which Ireland complains , and if an Irishman is asked the name of his country , he does not pronounce any of the names which imply the merging of his native isle in the realm of Britain . Few of us , even now , have a " realizing sense , " as it is called , // of the strength of the States ' Rights feeling among the Southern people . Of all the Southern States in which we ever sojourned , the one that seemed to us most like a Northern State was North Carolina . We stayed some time at Raleigh , ten years ago , during the session of the Legislature , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upright men who were members of that body . Of course , we expected to find Southern men all mad on one topic ; bift in the Legislature of North Carolina there were several individuals who could converse even on that in a rational and comfortable manner . We were a little surprised , therefore , the other day , to pick up at a book-stall in Nassau Street a work entitled : " The North Carolina Reader , Number III . Prepared with Special Reference to the Wants and Interests of North Carolina . Under the Auspices of the Superintendent of Common Schools . Containing Selections in Prose and Verse . By C. H. Wiley . New York : A. S. Barnes and Burr . " The acute reader will at once surmise that the object of this series of school readers was to instil into the minds of the youth of North Carolina a due regard for the sacredness and blessed effects of our peculiar institution . But for once the acute reader is mistaken . No such purpose appears , at least not in Number III. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusions to that dread subject . Onesimus is not mentioned there is no reference to Ham , nor is there any discourse upon long heels and small brains . The great , the only object of this Reader was to nourish in the children of the State the feeling which the boy expressed when he proudly said that his country was South Carolina . Nothing can exceed the innocent , childlike manner in which this design is carried out in Number III . First , the children are favored with a series of chapters descriptive of North Carolina , written in the style of a school geography , with an occasional piece of poetry on a North Carolina subject by a North Carolina poet . Once , however , the compiler ventures to depart from his plan by iimerting the lines by Sir William Jones , " What constitutes a State ? " To this poem he appends a note apologizing for " breaking the thread of his discourse , " upon the ground that the lines were so " applicable to the subject , " that it seemed as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When the compiler has done cataloguing the fisheries , the rivers , the mountains , and the towns of North Carolina , he proceeds to relate its history precisely in the style of our school history books . The latter half of the volume is chiefly occupied by passages from speeches , and poems from newspapers , written by natives of North Carolina . It is impossible for us to convey an idea of the innutritiousness and the silliness of most of these pieces . North Carolina is the great theme of orator and poet . " We live , " says one of the legislators quoted , " in the most beautiful land that the sun of heaven ever shone upon . Yes , sir , I have heard the anecdote from Mr. Clay , that a preacher in Kentucky , when speakg of the beauties of paradise , when he desired to make his audience believe it was a place of bliss , said it xvns a Kentucky of a place . Sir , this preacher had never visited the western counties of North Carolina . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unsurpassed grandeur , in hearing the roar of her magnificent waterfalls , second only to the great cataract of the North ; and while I gazed for hours , lost in admiration at the power of Him who by his word created such a country , and gratitude for the blessings He had scattered upon it , I thought that if Adam and Eve , when driven from paradise , had been near this laud , they would have thought themselves in the next best place to that they had left . " We do not aver that the contents of this collection are generally as ludicrous as this specimen ; but we do say that the passage quoted gives a very fair idea of the spirit and quality of the book . There is scarcely one of the North Carolina pieces which a Northern man would not for one reason or another find extremely comic . One of the reading lessons is a note written fifteen years ago by Solon Robinson , the agricultural editor of the Tribune , upon the use of the long leaves of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note written to accompany a bunch of North Carolina grapes sent to an editor ; and there are many other newspaper cuttings of a similar character . The editor seems to have thought nothing too trivial , nothing too ephemeral , for his purpose , provided the passage contained the name of his beloved State . // How strange all this appears to a Northern mind Everywhere else in Christendom , teachers strive to enlarge the mental range of their pupils , readily assenting to Voltaire 's wellknown definition of an educated man : " One who is not satisfied to survey the universe from his parish belfry . " Everywhere else , the intellectual class have some sense of the ill-consequences of " breeding in and in , " and take care to infuse into lower minds the vigor of new ideas and the nourishment of strange knowledge . How impossible for a Northern State to think of doing what Alabama did last winter , pass a law designed to limit the circulation in that State of Northern news papers and periodicals ! What Southern men mean by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . All mcii of every land are fond of their native place ; but the pride that Northern people may feel in the State wherein they happened to be born is as subordinate to their national feeling , as the attachment of a Frenchman to his native province is to his pride in France . Why this difference ? It did not always exist . It cost New York and Massachusetts as severe a struggle to accept the Constitution of 178T as it did Virginia . George Clinton , Governor of New York , had as much State pride as Patrick Henry , orator of Virginia , and parted as reluctantly with a portion of the sovereignty which he wielded . If it required Washington 's influence and Madison 's persuasive reasonin0 to bring Virginia into the new system , the repugnance of Massachusetts was only overcome by the combined force of Hancock 's social rank and Adams 's late , reluctant assent . Suppose , to-day , that the United States were invited to merge their sovereignty into a confederation of all the nations of America , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send delegates to a general congress on the Isthmus of Darien ! A sacrifice of pride like that was demanded of the leading States of the Union in 1787 . Severe was the struggle , but the sacrifice was made , and it cost the great States of the North as painful a throc as it did the great States of the South . Why , then , has State pride died away in the North , and grown stronger in the South ? Why is it only in the Southern States that the doctrine of States ' Rights is ever heard of ? Why does the Northern // man swell with national pride , and point with exultation to a fiat bearing thirty-seven stars , feeling the remotest State to be as much his country as his native village , while the Southern man contracts to an exclusive love for a single State , and is willing to die on its frontiers in repelling from its sacred soil the national troops , and can see the flag under which his fathers fought torn down without regret ? The study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mystery . He could not have correctly answered the question we have proposed , but he was an answer to it . Born when George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , George Mason , and James Madison were Virginia farmers , and surviving to the time when Andrew Jackson was President of the United States , he lived through the period of the decline of his race , and he was of that decline a conscious exemplification . He represented the decay of Virginia , himself a living ruin attesting by the strength and splendor of portions of it what a magnificent structure it was once . " Poor old Virginia ! Poor old Virginia ! " This was the burden of his cry for many a year . Sick , solitary , and half mad , at his lonely house in the wilderness of Roanoke , suffering from inherited disease , burdened with inherited debt , limited by inherited errors , and severed by a wall of inherited prejudice from the life of the modern world , he stands to us as the type of the palsied and dying State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most consistent and persistent champion ; while of that feeling which the North Carolina Reader No . III . styles " State pride , " we may call him the very incarnation . " When I speak of my country , " he would say , " I mean the Commonwealth of Virginia . " He was the first eminent man in the Southern States who was prepared in spirit for war against the government of the United States ; for during the Nullification imbroglio of 1833 , he not only was in the fullest accord with Calhoun , but he used to say , that , if a collision took place between the nullifiers and the forces of the United States , he , John Randolph of Roanoke , old and sick as he was , would have himself buckled on his horse , Radical , and fight for the South to his last breath . But then he was a man of genius , travel , and reading . We find him , therefore , as we have said , a conscious witness of his // Virgin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominion that was fanatical , there was in this maii 's heart a constant and most agonizing sense of her inferiority to lands less beloved . By no tongue or pen - not by Sumner 's tongue nor Olmsted 's pen - have more terrible pictures been drawn of Virginia 's lapse into barbarism , than are to be found in John Randolph 's letters . At a time ( 1831 ) when he would not buy a pocketknife made in New England , nor send a book to be bound north of the Potomac , we find him writing of his native State in these terms : - " I passed a night in Farrarville , in an apartment which , in England , would not have been thought fit for my servant ; nor on the Continent did he ever occupy so mean a one . Wherever I stop it is the same : walls black and filthy ; bed and furniture sordid ; furniture scanty and mean , generally broken ; no mirror ; no fire-irons ; in short , dirt and discomfort universally prevail ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows milked a half a mile oW or not got up , and no milk to be had at any distance , - no jordan ; - in fact , all the old gentry are gone , and the nouveaux rickes , when they have the inclination , do not know how to live . Biscuit , not half cuit ; everything animal and vegetable smeared with butter and lard . Poverty stalking through the land , while we are engaged in political metaphysics , and , amidst our filth and vermin , like the Spaniard and Portuguese , look down with contempt on other nations , - England and France especially . We hug our lousy cloak around us , take another ekaw of tubbacker , float the room with nastiness , or ruin the grate and fire-irons , where they happen not to be rusty , and try conclusions upon constitutional points . " f What truth and painting in this passage ! But if we had asked this suffering genius as to the cause of his " country 's decline , he would have given us a mad answer indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it was all Tom Jefferson 's doing , sir . Tom Jefferson* abolished primogeniture in Virginia , and thus , as John Randolph believed , destroyed the old families , the life and glory of the State . Tom Jefferson was unfaithful to the States ' Rights and strict-constructionist creed , of which he was the expounder and trustee , and thus let in the " American system " of Henry Clay , with its protective tariff , which completed the ruin of the agricultural States . This was his simple theory of the situation . These were the // reasons why he despaired of ever again seeing , to use his own language , " the Nelsons , the Pages , the Byrds , and Fairfaxes , living in their palaces , and driving their coaches and sixes , or the good old Virginia gentlemen on the Assembly drinking their twenty and forty bowls of rack punches , and madeira and claret , in lieu of a knot of deputy sheriffs and hack attorneys , each with his cruet of whiskey before him , and puddle of tobaccospittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing any relatioii of cause and effect between the coaches , palaces , and bowls of punch , and the " knot of deputy sheriffs , " as a Fenian is from discerning any connection between the Irish rackrenting of the last century , and the Irish beggary of this . Like conditions produce like characters . How interesting to discover in this republican , this native Virginian of English stock , a perfect and splendid specimen of a species of tory supposed to exist only in such countries as Poland , Spain , Ireland , and the Highlands of Scotland , but which in reality does abound in the Southern States of this Union , - the tory , conscious of his country 's ruin , but clinging with fanatical . and proud tenacity to the principles that ruined it . Tobacco , virgin land , and cheap negroes gave to several families in Virginia , for three generations , a showy , delusive prosperity , which produced a considerable number of dissolute , extravagant m&amp;n , and educated a few to a high dejee of knowledge and wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and among the oldest , richest , and most influential . The soldiers of the late army of the Potomac knew well the lands which produced the tobacco that maintained them in baronial state . It was on Turkey Island ( an island no more ) , twenty miles below Richmond , close to Malvern Hill of immortal memory , that the founder of the family settled in 1660 , - a Cavalier of ancient Yorkshire race , ruined in the civil wars . Few of our troops , perhaps , who rambled over Turkey Bend , were aware that the massive ruins still visible there , and which served as negro quarters seven years ago , are the remains of the great and famous mansion built by this Cavalier , turned tobacco-planter . This home of the IRandolphs was so elaborately splendid , that a man served out the whole term of his apprenticeship to the trade of carpenter in one of // its rooms . The lofty dome was for many years a beacon to the navigator . Such success had this Randolph in raising tobacco during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each of his six sons he gave or left a large estate , besides portioning liberally his two daughters . Five of these sons reared families , and the sons of those sons were also thriving and prolific mcii ; so that , in the course of three genera tions , Virginia was full of Randolphs . There was , we believe , not one of the noted controlling families that was not related to them by blood or marriage . In 17B , when John Randolph was born , the family was still powerful ; and the region last trodden by the Army of the Potomac was still adorned by the seats of its leading members . Cawsons , the mansion in which he was born , was situated at the junction of the James and Appomattox , in full view of City Point and Bermuda Hundred , and only an after-breakfast walk from Dutch Gap . The mansion long ago disappeared , and nothing now marks its site but negro huts . Many of those exquisite spots on the James and Appomattox , which we have seen men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were occupied sixty years ago by the sumptuous abodes of the iRandolphs and families related to them . Mattoax , the house in which John Randolph passed much of his childhood , was on a bluff of the Appomattox , two miles above Petersburg ; and Bizarre , the estate on which lie spent his boyhood , lay above ; on both sides of the same river . Over all that extensive arid enchanting region , trampled and torn and laid waste by hostile armies in 1864 and 1865 , John Randolph rode and hunted from the time lie could sit a pony and handle a gui ) . Not a vestige remains of the opulence and spleIldor of his early days . Not one of the mansions inhabited or visited by him in his youth furnished a target for our cannoneers or plunder for our camps . A country better adapted to all good purposes of man , nor one more pleasing to the eye , hardly exists on earth ; but before it was trodden by armies , it had become little less than desolate . The James River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a region far more fertile , longer settled , more inviting , and of more genial climate ; but there are upon the Hudson 's banks more cities than there are rotten // landings upon the James . The shores of this beautiful and classic stream are so unexpectedly void of even the signs of human habitation , that our soldiers were often ready to exclaim " Can this be the river of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas ? Was it here that Jamestown stood ? Is it possible that white men have lived in this delightful land for two hundred and fifty-seven years ? Or has not the captain of the steamboat made a mistake , and turned into the wrong river ? " One scene of John Randolph 's boyhood reveals to us the entire political economy of the Old Dominion . He used to relate it himself , when denouncin6 the manufacturing system of Henry Clay . One ship , he would say , sufficed , in those happy days , for all the commerce of that part of Virginia with the Old World , and that ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to sail , all the family were called together , and each member was invited to mention the articles which he or she wanted from London . First , the mother of the family gave in her list ; next , the children , in the order of their ages ; next , the overseer ; then the mammy , the chiP dren 's black nurse ; lastly , the house servants , according to their rank , down even to their children . When months had passed , and the time for the ship 's return was at hand , the weeks , the days , the hours were counted ; and when the signal was at last descried , the whole household burst into exclamations of delight , and there was festival in the family for many days . How picturesque and interesting ! How satisfactory to the tory mind ! But alas ! their system of exhausting the soil in the production of tobacco by the labor of slaves , and sending for all manufactured articles to England , was more ruinous even than it was picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to supply the waste of aristocratic blood and means ; and in three generations , rich and beautiful Virginia , created for empire , was only another Ireland . But it was a pictnresque system , and John Randolph , poet and tory , revelled in the recollection of it . " Our Egyptian taskmasters , " he would say , meaning the manufacturers of Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey , and New England , " only wish to leave us the recollection of past times , and insist upon our purchasing // their vile domestic stuffs ; but it wo n't do : no wooden nutmegs for old Virginia . " His own pecuniary history was an illustration of the working of the system . His father left forty thousand acres of the best land in the world , and several hundred slaves , to his three boys ; the greater part of which property , by the early death of the two elder brothers , fell to John . As the father died when John was but three years old , there was a minority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have greatly increased . So far from increasing , an old debt of his father 's - a London debt , incurred for goods brought to a joyous household in the London Trader - remained undiminished at his coming of age , and hung about his neck for many years afterward . Working two large estates , with a force of negroes equivalent to one hundred and eighty full field hands , he could not afford himself the luxury of a trip to Europe until he was fifty years old . The amount of this debt we do not know , but he says enough about it for us to infer that it was not of very large amount in comparison with his great resources . One hundred and eighty stalwart negroes working the best land in the world , under a man so keen and vigilant as this last of the noble IRandolphs , and yet making scarcely any headway for a quarter of a century ! The blood of this fine breed of men was also running low . Both the parents of John Randolph and both of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early developed into disease . One of his half-brothers died a madman . " My whole name and race , " he would say , " lie under a curse . I feel the curse clinging to me . " He was a fair , delicate child , more like a girl than a boy , and more inclined , as a child , to the sports of girls than of boys . His mother , a fond , tender , gentle lady , nourished his softer qualities , powerless to govern him , amid probably never attempting it . Nevertheless he was no girl ; he was a genuine son of the South . Such was the violence of his passions , that , before he was four years old , he sometimes in a fit of anger fell senseless upon the floom* , and was restored only after much effort . His step-father , who was an honorable man , seems never to have attempted either to control his passions or develop his intellect . He grew up , as // 1866 . John Bando*p1i. many boys of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turned loose in a miscellaneous library , nearly every book he read tended to intensify his feelings or inflame his imagination . His first book was Voltaire 's Charles XII. , and a better book for a boy has never been written . Then he fell upon the Spectator . Before he was twelve he had read the Arabian Nights , Orlando , ilobinson Crusoe , Smollett 's Works , Reynard the Fox , iDon Quixote , Gil Blas , Tom Jones , Gulliver , Shakespeare , Plutarch 's Lives , Pope 's Homer , Goldsmith 's IRome , Percy 's Reliques , Thomson 's Seasons , Young , Gray , and Chatterton , - a gallon of sack to a penny 's worth of bread . A good steady drill in arithmetic , geography , and language might have given him an understanding , a chance ; but this ill-starred boy never had a steady drill in anything . He never remained longer at any one school than a year , and he learned at school very little that he needed most to know . In the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Greek , a good deal of French , and an inconceivable medley of odds and ends of knowledge , which his wonderful memory enabled him to use sometimes with startling effect . Everywhere else , in the whole world , children are taught that virtue is self-control . In the Southern States , among these tobacco-beds , boys learned just the opposite lesson ,  --  that virtue is self-indulgence . This particular youth , thin-skinned , full of talent , fire , and passion , the heir to a large estate , fatherless , would have been in danger anywhere of growing up untrained , - a wild beast in broadcloth . In the Virginia of that day , in the circle iii which he lived , there was nothing for him in the way either of curb or spur . He did what he pleased , and nothing else . All that was noble in his life , - those bursts of really fine oratory , his flashes of good sense , his occasional generosities , his hatred of debt , and his eager haste to pay it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his race . In the very dregs of good wine there is flavor . We can not make even good vinegar out of a low quality of wine . His gentle mother taught him all the political economy he ever took to heart . " Johnny , " said she to him one day , when they had reached a point in their ride that commanded an ex // tensive view , " all this land belongs to you and your brother . It is your father 's inheritance . When you get to be a man , you must not sell your laud : it is the first step to ruin for a boy to part with his father 's home . Be sure to keep it as long as you live . Keep your land , and your land will keep you . " There never came a time when his mind was mature and masculine enough to consider this advice . He clung to his land as Charles Stuart clung to his prerogative . All the early life of this youth was wandering and desultory . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey , where , we are told , he fought a duel , exchanged shots twice with his adversary , and put a ball into his body which he carried all his life . By this time , too , the precocious and ungovernable boy had become , as he flattered himself , a complete atheist . One of his favorite amusements at Princeton was to burlesque the precise and perhaps ungraceful Presbyterians of the place . The library of his Virginian home , it appears , was furnished with a great supply of what the French mildly call the literature of incredulity , - Helvetius , Voltaire , Rousseau , Diderot , D'Alembert , and the rest . The boy , in his rage for knowledge , had read vast quantities of this literature , and , of course , embraced the theory of the writers that pushed denial farthest . For twenty-two years , he says in one of his letters , he never entered a church . Great pleasure it gave him to show how superior the Mahometan religion was to the Christian , and to recite specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Psalms of David were his special aversion . Almost all gifted and fearless lads that have lived in Christendom during the last hundred years have had a fit of this kind between fifteen and twenty-five . The strength of the tendency to question the grounds of belief must be great indeed to bear away with it a youth like this , formed by Nature to believe . John Randolph had no more intellectual right to be a sceptic , than he had a moral right to be a republican . A person whose imagination is quick and warm , whose feelings are acute , and whose intellect is wholly untrained , can find no comfort except in belief . His scepticism is a mere freak of vanity or self-will . Coming upon the stage of life // when unbelief was fashionable in high drawing-rooms , he be . came a sceptic . But Nature will have her way with us all , and so this atheist at fifteen was an Evangelical at fortyfive . His first political bias was equally at war with his nature . John Randolph was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one republican atom . But coming early under the direct personal influence of Thomas Jefferson , whose every fibre was republican , he , too , the sympathetic tory of genius , espoused the people 's cause . He was less than twenty-two years , however , in recovering from this false tendency . Summoned from Princeton , after only a few months ' residence , by the death of his mother , he went next to Columbia College , in the city of New York , where for a year or two he read Greek with a tutor , especially Demosthenes . At New York he saw the first Congress under the new Constitution assembled , and was one of the concourse that witnessed the scene of General Washington 's taking the oath on the balcony of the old City Hall . It seemed to this Virginia boy natural enough that a Virginian should be at the head of the government ; not so , that a Yankee should hold the second place and preside over the Senate . Forty years after , he recalled with bitterness a trifling incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the origin of his intense antipathy to all of the blood of John Adams . The coachman of the Vice-President , it seems , told the brother of this little republican tory to stand back ; or , as the orator stated it , forty years after , " I remember the manner in which my brother was spurned by the coachman of the Vice-President for coming too near the arms emblazoned on the vice-regal carriage . " Boy as he was , he had already taken sides with those who opposed the Constitution . The real ground of his opposition to it was , that it reduced the importance of Virginia , - great Virginia ! Under the new Constitution , there was a man on the Western Continent of more consequence than the Governor of Virginia , there were legislative bodies more powerful than the Legislature of Virginia . This was the secret of the disgust with which he heard it proposed to style the President " His Highness " and " His Majesty . " This was the reason // why it kindled his ire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most honorable Rufus King " had been elected Senator . It was only Jefferson and a very few other of the grand Virginians who objected for higher and larger reasons . In March , 1790 , Mr. Jefferson reached New York , after his return from France , and entered upon his new office of Secretary of State under General Washington . He was a distant relative of our precocious student , then seventeen years of age ; and the two families had just been brought nearer together by the marriage of one of Mr. Jefferson 's daughters to a Randolph . The reaction against republican principles was at full tide ; and no one will ever know to what lengths it would have gone , had not Thomas Jefferson so opportunely come upon the scene . At his modest abode , No. 57 ' Maiden Lane , the two Randolph lads - John , seventeen , Theodorick , nineteen - were frequent visitors . Theodorick was a roistering blade , much opposed to his younger brother 's reading habits , caring himself for nothing but pleasure . John was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction , first at New York , afterward at Philadelphia , finally in Virginia , John Randolph sat at the feet of the great Democrat of America , fascinated by his conversation , and generally convinced by his reasoning . It is a mistake , however , to suppose that he was a blind follower of Mr. Jefferson , even then . On the question of States ' Rights , he was in the most perfect accord with him . But when , in 1791 , the eyes of all intelligent America were fixed upon the two combatants , Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine , Burke condemning , Paine defending , the French Revolution , the inherited instincts of John Randolph asserted themselves , and he gave all his heart to Burke . Lord Chatham and Edmund Burke were the men who always held the first place in the esteem of this kindred spirit . Mr. Jefferson , of course , sympathized with the view of his friend Paine , and never wavered in his belief that the French Revolution was necessary and beneficial . A gen erous and gifted nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class proscribed . He dwelt more upon the long and bitter provocation , than upon the brief frenzy which was only one of its dire results . Louis XIV ' . and Louis XV. , picturesque as they were , excited within him a profounder horror // 1866 . John Bando*p1t. than ugly Marat and Robespierre . lie pitied haggard , distracted France more than graceful and high-bred Marie Antoinette . In other words , he was not a tory . There was a difference , too , between Mr. Jefferson and his young kinsman on the points upon which they agreed . Jefferson was a States ' Rights man , and a strict constructionist , because he was a repablican ; Randolph , because he was a Virginian . Jefferson thought the government should be small , that the people might be great ; John Randolph thought the government should be small , that Virginia might be great . Pride in Virginia was John Randolph 's ruling passion , not less in 1790 than in 1828 . The welfare and dignity of man were the darling objects of Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we have the explanation of the great puzzle of American politics , - the unnatural alliance , for sixty years , between the plantation lords of the South and the democracy of the North , both venerating the name of Jefferson , and both professing his principles . It was not , as many suppose , a compact of scurvy politicians for the sake of political victory . Every great party , whether religious or political , that has held power long in a country , has been founded upon conviction , - disinterested conviction . Some of the cotton and tobacco lords , men of intellect and culture , were democrats and abolitionists , like Jefferson himself . Others took up with republicanism because it was the reigning affectation in their circle , as it was in the chateaux and drawing-rooms of France . But their State pride it was that bound them as a class to the early Republican party . The Southern aristocrat saw in Jefferson the defender of the sovereignty of his State : the " smutched artificer " of the North gloried in Jefferson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican party was in opposition , battling with unmanageable John Adams , with British Hamilton , and with a foe more powerful than both of those men together , Robespierre ,  - -  while it had to contend with Washington 's all but irresistible influence , and with the nearly unanimous opposition of educated and orthodox New England , - this distinction was not felt . Many a tobacco aristocrat cut off his pig-tail and wore trousers down to his ankles , which were then the outward // signs of the inward democratic grace . But time tries all . It is now apparent to every one that the strength of the original Democratic party in the South was the States ' Rights portion of its platform , while in the North it was the sentiment of republicanism that kept the party together . Young politicians should study this period of their country 's history . If ever again a political party shall rule the United States for sixty years , or for twenty years , it will be , we think , a party resembling the original Republican party , as founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its platform will be , perhaps , something like this : simple , economical government machinery ; strict construction of the Constitution the rights of the States scrupulously observed ; the suffrage open to all , without regard to coloWor sex ,  --  open to all , but conferred only upon men and women capable of exercising it . John Randolph agreed upon another point with Mr. Jefferson : he was an abolitionist . But for the English debt which he inherited , it is extremely probable that he would have followed the example of many of the best Virginians of his day , and emancipated his slaves . He would , perhaps , have done so when that debt was discharged , instead of waiting to do it by his last will , but for the forlorn condition of freedmen in a Slave State . His eldest brother wrote , upon the division of the estate , in 1794 : " I want not a single negro for any other purpose than his immediate emancipation . I shudder when I think that such an insignificant animal as I am is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told his guardian that he would give up all his land rather than own a slave . There was no moment in the whole life of John Randolph when he did not sympathize with this view of slavery , and he died expressing it . But though he was , if possible , a more decided abolitionist than Jefferson , he never for a moment doubted the innate superiority of a Virginia gentleman to all the other inhabitants of America . He had not even the complaisance to take his hair out of queue , nor hide his thin legs in pantaloons . He was not endowed by nature with understanding enough to rise superior to the prejudices that had come down to him through generations of aristocrats . He was weak enough , indeed , to be extremely vain of the fact that // a grandfather of his had married one of the great-granddaughters of Pocahontas , who , it was believed , performed the act that renders her famous at Point of hocks on the Appomattox , within walking distance of one of the IRandolph mansions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always had in the superiority of his caste , of his State , and of his section . He once got so far as to speak favorably of the talents of Daniel Webster ; but he was obliged to conclude by saying that he was the best debater he had ever known north of the Potomac . This singular being was twenty-six years of age before any one suspected , least of all himself , that he possessed any of the talents which command the attention of men . His life had been desultory and purposeless . He had studied law a little , attended a course or two of medical lectures , travelled somewhat , dipped into hundreds of books , read a few with passionate admiration , had lived much with the ablest men of that day , - a familiar guest at Jefferson 's fireside , and no stranger at President Washington 's stately table . Father , mother , and both broUiers were dead . He was lonely , sad , and heavily burdened with property , with debt , and the care of many dependants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At twenty-three he had still the aspect of a boy . He actually grew half a head after he was twenty-three years of age . " A tall , gawky-looking , flaxen-haired stripling , apparently of the age of sixteen or eighteen , with complexion of a good parcln *ent color , beardless chin , and as much assumed selfconsequence as any two-footed animal I ever saw . " So he was described by a Charleston bookseller , who saw him in his store in 1796 , carelessly turning over books . " At length , " continues this narrator , " he hit upon so*nething that struck his fancy ; and never did I witness so sudden , so perfect a change of the human countenance . That which was before dull and heavy in a moment became animated , and flashed with the brightest beams of intellect . He stepped up to the old gray-headed gentleman ( his companion ) , and , giving him a thundering slap on the shoulder , said , Jack , look at this ! " Thus was he described at twenty-three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as slender as before . His light hair was tlieii // combed back into an elegant queue . His eye of hazel was bright and restless . His chin was still beardless . He wore a frock-coat of light blue cloth , yellow bi*eeches , silk stockings , and top-boots . Great was the love he bore his horses , which were numerous , and as good as Virginia could boast . It is amusing to notice that the horse upon which this pattern aristocrat used to scamper across the country , in French-Revolution times , was named facobiu ! It was in March , 1799 , the year before the final victory of the Republicans over the Federal party , that the neighbors of John Randolph and John Randolph himself discovered , to their great astonishment , that he was an orator . He had been nominated for Representative in Congress . Patrick Henry , aged and infirm , had been so adroitly manipulated by the Federalists , that he had at length agreed to speak to the people in support of the hateful administration of John Adams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience , nor , as he afterwards declared , had ever imagined that he could do so , suddenly determined , the very evening before the day named for the meeting , to reply to Patrick Henry . It was an open-air meeting . No structure in Virginia could have contained the multitude that thronged to hear the transcendent orator , silent for so many years , and now summoned from his retirement by General Washington himself to speak for a Union imperilled and a government assailed . He spoke with the power of other days , for he was really alarmed for his country ; and when he had finished his impassioned harangue , he sunk back into the arms of his friends , as one of them said , " like the sun setting in his glory . " For the moment he had all hearts with him . The sturdiest Republican in Virginia could scarcely resist the spell of that amazing oratory . John Randolph rose to reply . His first sentences showed not only that he could speak , but that he knew the artifices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression to the veneration felt by his hearers for the aged patriot who had just addressed them . He spoke for three hours , it is said ; and if we may judge from the imperfect outline of his speech that has come down to us , he spoke as well that day as ever he did . States ' Rights was the burden of his speech . That the Alien // and Sedition Law was an outrage upon human nature , he may have believed ; but what he felt was , that it was an outrage upon the Commonwealth of Virginia . He may have thought it desirable that all governments should confine themselves to the simple business of compelling the faithful performance of contracts ; but what he insisted upon was , that the exercise by the government of the United States of any power not expressly laid down in the letter of the Constitution was a wrong to Virginia . If John Adams is right , said lie , in substance , then Virginia has gained nothing by the Revolution but a change of masters , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a change for the better . It was unnecessary , in the Virginia of 1799 , for the head of the house of Randolph to he an orator , in order to secure an election to the House of Representatives . He was elected , of course . When lie came forward to be sworn iii , his appearance was so youthful , that the Clerk of the House asked him , with the utmost politeness , whether he had attained the legal age . this reply was eminently characteristic of the tobacco lord : Go , sir , arid ask my constituents : they sent me here . " As there was no one present authorized by the Constitution to box the ears of impudent boys on the floor of the House , he was sworn without further question . It has often occurred to us that this anecdote , which John Randolph used to relate with much satisfaction , was typical of much that has since occurred . The excessive courtesy of the officer , the insolence of the Virginia tobacconist , the submission of the Clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes in the Capitol at WashinoThn ? It was iii December , 1799 , that this fiery and erratic genius took his seat in the House of Representatives . John Adams bad still sixteen months to serve as target for the sarcasm of the young talent of the iiation . To calm readers of the present day , Mr. Adams does really seem a strange personage to preside over a goveram cut ; but the calm reader of the present day can not realize the state of things in the year 1800 . We can not conceive what a fright the world had had in the excesses of the French Revolution , and the receiit usurpation of General Bonaparte . France had made almost every timid man // in Christendom a tory . Serious and respectable people , above forty , and enjoying a comfortable income , felt that there was only one thing left for a decent person to do ,  --  to assist in preserving the authority of government . John Adams , by the constitution of his mind , was as much a tory as John Randolph ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding . To be a democrat it is necessary to have a little pure intellect ; since your democrat is merely a person who can , occasionally , see things and men as they are . New England will always be democratic enouoh as long as her boys learn mental arithmetic ; and Ireland will always be the haunt of tories as long as her children are brought up upon songs , legends , and ceremonies . To make a democratic people , it is only necessary to accustom them to use their minds . Nothing throws such light upon the state of things in the United States in 1800 , as the once famous collision between these two natural tories , John Adams and John Randolph , which gave instantaneous celebrity to the new member , and made him an idol of the Republican party . In his maiden speech , which was in opposition to a proposed increase of the army , he spoke disparagingly of the troops already serving , using the words ragamuffins and mercenaries . In this passage of his speech , the partisan spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nature toward soldiers , when , a few years later , on the same floor , he said " If I must have a master , let him be one with epaulets ; something which I can look up to ; but not a master with a quill behind his ear . " In 1800 , however , it pleased him to style the soldiers of the United States ragamuffins and mercenaries ; which induced two young officers to push , hustle , and otherwise discommode and insult him at the theatre . Strange to relate , this hot Virginian , usually so prompt with a challenge to mortal combat , reported the misconduct of these officers to the President of the United States . This eminently proper act he did in an eminently proper manncr , thanks to his transient connection with the Republican party . Having hriefly stated the case , he concluded his letter to the President thus : " The independence of the legislature has been attacked , and the majesty of the people , of which you are the principal representative , insulted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I demand that a provision commensurate with the evil be made , and which will be calculated to deter others from any future attempt to introduce the reign of terror into our country . In addressing you in this plain language of man , I give you , sir , the best proof I can afford of the estimation in which I hold your office and your understanding ; and J assure you with truth , that I am , with respect , your fellow-citizen , John Randolph . " This language so well accords with our present sense of the becoming , that a person unacquainted with that period would be unable to point to a single phrase calculated to give offence . In the year 1800 , however , the President of the United States saw in every expression of the letter contemptuous and calculated insult . " The majesty of the people , " forsooth ! The President merely their " representative " ! " plain language of man " and " with respect , your fellow-citizen " ! To the heated imaginations of the Federalists of 1800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was simply prophetic of the guillotine . So amazed and m 0nn was Mr. Adams , that he actually submitted the letter to his Cabinet , requesting their opinion as to what should be done with it . Still more incredible is it , * that four members of the Cabinet , in writing , declared their opinion to be , that " the contemptuous language therein adopted requires a public censure . " They further said , that , " if such addresses remain unnoticed , we are apprehensive that a precedent will be established which must necessarily destroy the ancient , respectable , and urbane usages of this country . " some lingering remains of good-sense in the other member of the Cabinet prevented the President from acting upon their advice ; and he merely sent the letter to the House , with the remark that he " submitted the whole letter and its tendencies " to their consideration , " without any other comments on its matter and style . " This affair , trivial as it was , sufficed in that mad time to lift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be regarded as a shining light of the Republican party . The splendor of his talents as an orator gave him at once the ear of the House and the admiration of the Republican side of it ; while the fury of his zeal against the President rcn* // dered him most efficient in the Presidential canvass . No young man , perhaps , did more than he toward the election of Jefferson and Burr in 1800 . He was indeed , at that time , before disease had wasted him , and while still enjoying the confidence of the IRepublican leaders and subject to the needed restraints of party , a most effective speaker , whether in the House or upon the stump . He had something of Burke 's torrent-like fluency , and something of Chatham 's spirit of command , with a piercing , audaciotis sarcasm all his own . He was often unjust and unreasonable , but never dull . He never spoke in his life without being at least attentively listened to . Mr. Jefferson came into power ; and John Randolph , triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ways and Means ,  --  a position not less important then than now . He was the leader of the Republican majority in the House . His social rank , his talents , his position in the House of Representatives , the admiration of the party , the confidence of the President , all united to render him the chief of the young men of the young nation . It was captivating to the popular imagination to behold this heir of an ancient house , this possessor of broad lands , this orator of genius , belonging to the party of the people . He aided to give the Republican party the only element of power which it lacked , - soci ' 4 consideration . The party had numbers and talent ; but it had not that which could make a weak , rich man vain of the title of Republican . At the North , clergy , professors , rich men , were generally Federalists , and it was therefore peculiarly pleasing to Democrats to point to this eminent and brilliant Virginian as a member of their party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing ability as a man of business , and living in harmony with his colleagues . As often as he reached Washington , at the beginning of a session , he found the President 's card ( so Colonel Benton tells us ) awaiting him for dinner the next day at the White House , when the great incasures of the session were discussed . It was he who moved the resolutions of respect for the memory of that consummate icpublicami , that entire and perfect democrat , Samuel Adams of Massachusetts . It was he who arranged the financial measures required for the purchase of Louisiana , and made no objectiomi // to the purchase . During the first six years of Mr. Jefferson 's Presidency , he shrank from no duty which his pai ty had a right to claim from him . Whatever there might be narrow or erroneous in his political creed was neutralized by the sentiment of nationality which the capital inspires , and by the practical views which must needs be taken of public affairs by the Cha*-man of the Committee of Ways and Means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most honorable ones . Never , since governments have existed , has a country been governed so wisely , so honestly , and so economically as the United States was governed during the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson . Randolph himself , after twenty years of opposition to the policy of this incomparable ruler , could still say of his administration , that it was the only one he had ever known which " seriously and in good faith was disposed to give up its patronage , " and which desired to go further in depriving itself of power than the people themselves had thought . " Jefferson , " said John Randolph in 1828 , " was the only man I ever knew or heard of who really , truly , and honestly , not only said , Nblo episcopari , but actually refused the mitre . " For six years , as we have said , Mr. Randolph led the Republican party in the house of Representatives , and supported the measures of the administration , - all of them . In the spring of 1807 , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that time opposed the policy of the adminIstration , - the whole of it . Why this change ? If there were such a thing as going *ppreutice to the art of discovering truth , a master in that art could not set an apprentice a better preliminary lesson than this . Why did John Randolph go into opposition in 1807 ? The gossips of that day had no difficulty in answering the question . Some said he had asked Mr. Jefferson for a foreign mission , and been refused . Others thought it was jealousy of Mr. Madison , who was known to be the President 's choice for the succession . Others surmised that an important state secret had been revealed to other members of the House , but not to him . These opinions our tyro would find very positively recorded , and he would also , in the course of his researches , come upon the statement that Mr. Randolph himself // John Randolph . July , attributed the breach to his having beaten the President at a game of chess , which the President could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolted for the same reason that a steel spring resumes its original bent the instant the restraining force is withdrawn . His position as leader of a party was irksome , because it obliged him to work in harness , and he had never been broken to harness . His party connection bound him to side with France in the great contest then raging between France and England , and yet his whole soul sympathized with England . This native Virginian was more consciously and positively English than any native of England ever was . English literature had nourished his mind ; English names captivated his imagination ; English traditions , feelings , instincts , habits , prejudices , were all congenial to his nature . How hard for such a man to side officially with Napoleon in those gigantic wars ! Abhorring Napoleon with all a Randolph 's force of antipathy , it was nevertheless expected of him , as a good Rep**blicai* , to interpret leniently the man who , besides being the armed soldier of democracy , had sold Louisiana to the United States . Randolph , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Representatives tl1at he , being a Virginian slaveholder , was not obliged to curry favor with his coachman or his shoeblack , lest when he drove to the polls the coachman should dismount from his box , or the shoeblack drop his brushes , and neutralize their master 's vote by voting on the other side . How he exulted in the fact that in Virginia none but freeholders could vote ! How happy he was to boast , that , in all that Commonwealth , there was no such thing as a ballot-box ! " May I never live to see the day , " he would exclaim , " when a Virginian shall be ashamed to declare aloud at the polls for whom he casts his vote ! " What pleasure he took in speaking of his Virginia wilderness as a " barony , " and in signing his name " John Randolph of IRoanoke , " and in wearing the garments that were worn in Virginia when the great tobacco lords were running through their estates in the fine old picturesque and Irish fashion ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as a leader in the Republican party . For a time the spell of Jefferson 's winning genius , and the presence of a powerful oppo // sition , kept him in some subjection ; but in 1807 that spell had spent its force , and the Federal party was not formidable . John Randolph was himself again . The immediate occasion of the rupture was , probably , Mr. Jefferson 's evident preference of James Madison as his successor . We have a right to infer this , from the extreme and lasting rancor which Randolph exhibited toward Mr. Madison , who he used to say was as mean a man for a Virginian as John Quincy Adams was for a Yankee . Nor ought we ever to speak of this gifted and unhappy man without considering his physical condition . It appears from the slight notices we have of this vital matter , that about the year 1807 the stock of vigor which his youth had acquired was gone , and he lived thenceforth a miserable invalid , afflicted with diseases that sharpen the temper and narrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limitations , and attained to the stature of a modern , a national , a republican man . John Randolph sick - radically and incurably sick - ceased to grow just when his best growth would naturally have begun . The sudden departure of a man so conspicuous and considerable at a time when the Republican party was not aware of its strength , struck dismay to many minds , who felt , with Jefferson , that to the Republican party in the United States were confided the best interests of human nature . Mr. Jefferson was not in the least alarmed , because he knew the strength of the party and the weakness of the man . The letter which he wrote on this subject to Mr. Monroe ought to be learned by heart by every politician in the country , - by the self-seekers , for the warning which it gives them , and by the patriotic , for the comfort which it affords them in times of trouble . Some readers , perhaps , will be reminded by it of events which occurred at Washington not longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off from us some time ago ; at first , professing to disdain joining the Federalists ; yet , from the habit of votino together becomint soon identified with them . Without carrying a , over with him one single person , he is now in a state of as perfect ohseurity as if his name had never been known . Mr. J. Randolph is iu the same track , and will end in the same way . His course has excited considerable alarm . Timid men consider it as a proof of the weakness // of our go*ernn*ent , and that it is to be rent in pieces by demagogues and to end in anarchy . I survey the scene with a different eye , and draw a different a*ury from it . In a House of Representatives of a great mass of good sense , Mr. Randolph 's popular eloquence gave him such advantages as to place him unrivalled as the leader of the House ; and , although not conciliatory to those whom he led , principles of duty and patriotism induced many of them to swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right , as long as he kept the path of right himself . The sudden departure of such a man could not but produce a momentary astonishment , and even dismay ; but for a moment only . The good sense of the House rallied around its principles , and , without any leader , pursued steadily the business of the session , did it well , and by a strength of vote which has never before been seen The augury I draw from this is , that there is a steady good sense in the legislature and in the body of the nation , joined with good intentions , which will lead them to discern and to pursue the public good under all circumstances which can arise , and that no ignis fatuus will be able to lead them long astray . " Mr. Jefferson predicted that the lost sheep of the Republican fold would wander off to the arid wastes of Federalism ; but he never did so . His defection was not an inconsistency , but a return to consistency . He presented himself in his true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights fanat ic . He opposed the election of Mr. Madison to the Presidency , as he said , because Mr. Madison was weak on the sovereignty of the States . He opposed the war of 1812 for two reasons : - 1 . Offensive war was in itself unconstitutional , being a national act . 2 . War was nationalizing . A hundred times before the war , he foretold that , if war occurred , the sovereignty of the States was gone forever , and we should lapse into nationality . A thousand times after the war , he declared that this dread lapse had occured . At a public dinner , after the return of peace , he gave the once oclebrated toast , " States ' Rights , - Dc mortuis nil nisi bonurn . " As before the war he sometimes affected himself to tears while dwelling upon the sad prospect of kindred people imbruing their hands in one another 's blood , so during the war he was one of the few American citizens who lamented the triumphs of their coitatry 's arms . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of Perry 's victory on the lake , because he thought it would prolong the // contest ; and he exulted in the banishment of Napoleon to Elba , although it let loose the armies and fleets of Britain upon the United States . " That insolent coward , " said he , " has met his deserts at last . " This Virginia Englishman would not allow that Napoleon possessed even military talent ; but stoutly maintained , to the last , that he was the merest sport of fortune . When the work of restoration was in progress , under the leadership of Clay and Calhoun , John IRandolph was in his element , for he could honestly oppose every movement and suggestion of those young orators , - national bank , protective tariff , internal improvements , everything . He was one of the small number who objected to the gift of land and money to Lafayette , and one of the stubborn minority who would have seen the Union broken up rather than assent to the Missouri Compromise , or to any Missouri compromise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained , was the same , and it was this : Are we a nation or a confederacy ? Talent , too , is apt to play the despot over the person that possesses it . This man had such a power of witty vituperation in him , with so decided a histrionic gift , that his rising to speak was always an interesting event ; and he would occasionally hold both the House and the galleries attentive for three or four hours . He became accustomed to this homage ; he craved it ; it became necessary to him . As far back as 1811 , Washington Irving wrote of him , in one of his letters from Washington " There is no speaker in either house that excites such universal attention as Jack Randolph . Bnt they listen to him more to be delighted by his eloquence and entertained by his ingenuity and eccentricity , than to be convinced by sound doctrine and close argument . " As he advanced in age , this habit of startling the House by unexpected dramatic exhibitions grew upon him . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary scene is that in which the late Mr. S. G. Goodrich records his recollection of one of these displays . It occurred in 1820 , during one of the Missouri debates . A tall man , with a little head and a small oval face , like that of an aged boy , rose and addressed the chairman . " He paused a moment , " wrote Mr. Goodrich , " and I had time to // study his appearance . 1-us hair was jet-hiack , and clubbed in a queue ; his eye was black , small , and painfully penetrating . His complexion was a yellowish-brown , bespeaking Indian blood . I knew at once that it must be John Randolph . As he uttered the words , Mr. Speaker ! ' every member turned in his seat , and , facing him , gazed as if some portent had suddenly appeared before them . iMr . Speaker , ' said he , in a shrill voice , which , however , pierced every nook and corner of the hall , I have but one word to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state a fact . The measure to which the gentleman has just alluded originated in a dirty trick ! ' These were his precise words . The subject to which he referred I did not gather , but the coolness and impudence of the speaker were admirable in their way . I never saw better acting , even in Kean . His look , his manner , his long arm , his elvish fore-finger , - like an exclamation-point , punctuating his hitter thought , - showed the skill of a master . The effect of the whole was to startle everybody , as if a pistol-shot had rung through the hall . " - Recollections , Vol . II . p. 395 . Such anecdotes as these , which are very numerous , both in and out of print , convey an inadequate idea of his understanding ; for there was really a great fund of good sense in him and in his political creed . Actor as he was , he was a very honest man , and had a hearty contempt for all the kinds of falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more restive under debt than he , or has better depicted its horrors . Speaking once of those Virginia families who gave banquets and kept up expensive establishments , while their estates were covered all over with mortgages , he said : " I always think I can see the anguish under the grin and grimace , like old Mother Cole 's dirty flannel peeping out beneath her Brussels lace . " He was strong in the opinion that a man who is loose in money matters is not trustworthy in anything , - an opinion which is shared by every one who knows either life or history . " The time was , " he wrote , " when I was fool enough to believe that a man might be negligent of pecuniary obligations , and yet be a very good fellow ; but long experience has convinced me that he who is lax in this respect is utterly unworthy of trust in any other . " lIe discriminated well between those showy , oceasional acts of so-called generosity which such men perform , and the true , habitual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . " Despise // the usurer and the miser as much as you will , " he would exclaim , " but the spendthrift is more selfish than they . " There are flashes of sense and touches of pathos in some of his most tory passages . As he was delivering in the House one of his emphatic predictions of the certain failure of our experiinent of freedom on this continent , he broke into an apology for so doing , that brought tears to many eyes . " It is an infirmity of my nature , " said he , " to have an obstinate constitutional preference of the true over the agreeable ; and I am satisfied , that , if I had had an only son , or what is dearer , an only daughter , - which God forbid - I say , God forbid , for she might bring her father 's gray hairs with sorrow to the grave ; she might break my heart , or worse than that - what ? Can anything be worse than that ? Yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the caterpillar and the horseman was conceived in arrogance , but it was pretty and effective . Every tory intellect on earth is pleased to discourse in that way of the labors of the only men who greatly help their species , - the patient elaborators of truth . A caterpillar , as we learn from this fable , had crawled slowly over a fence , which a gallant horseman took at a single leap . " Stop , " says the caterpillar , " you are too flighty ; you want connection and continuity ; it took me an hour to get over ; you ca n't be as sure as I am that you have really overcome the difficulty , and are indeed over the fence . " To which , of course , the gallant horseman makes the expected contemptuous reply . This is precisely in the spirit of Carlyle 's sneers at the political economists ,  - -  the men who are not content to sit down and howl in this wilderness of a modern world , but bestir themselves to discover methods by which it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in the doctrines of the original States ' Rights party , - the party of Jefferson , Madison , and Patrick Henry , - that a very commonplace man , who learned his politics in that school , is able to make a respectable figure iii the public counsels . The mere notion that government , being a necessary evil , is to be reduced to the minimum that will answer the purposes of government , saves from many false steps . The doctrine that the central government is to confine itself to the duties assigned it in the Constitution , is a guid // ing principle suited to the limited human mind . A vast number of claims , suggestions , and petitions are excluded by it even from consideration . If an eloquent Hamiltonian proposes to appropriate the public money for the purpose of enabling American manufacturers to exhibit their products at a Paris Exhibition , tbe plainest country member of the Jeffersonian school perceives at once the inconsistency of such a proposition with the fundamental principle of his political creed . He has a compass to steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being afloat on the waste of waters , the sport of every breeze that blows . It is touching to observe that this unhappy , sick , and sometimes mad John Randolph , amid all the vagaries of his later life , had always a vein of soundness in him , derived from his early connection with the enlightened men who acted in politics with Thomas Jefferson . The phrase " masterly inactivity " is Randolph 's ; and it is something only to have given convenient expression to a system of conduct so often wise . He used to say that Congress could scarcely do too little . His ideal of a session was one in which members should make speeches till every man had fully expressed and perfectly relieved his mind , then pass the appropriation bills , and go home . And we ought not to forget that , when President John Quiney Adams brought forward his schemes for covering the continent with magnificent works at the expense of the treasury of the United States , and of uniting the republics of both Americas into a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , more than anything else , made plain to new members the fallacy , the peril , of such a system . His opposition to this wild federalisni involved his support of Andrew Jackson ; but there was no other choice open to him . Seldom did he display in Congress so much audacity and ingenuity as in defending General Jackson while he was a candidate for the Presidency against Mr. Adams . The two objections oftenest nrged against Jackson were that he was a military chieftain , and that he could not spell . Mr. Randolph discoursed on these two points in a most amusing manner , displaying all the impudence and ignorance of the tory , inextricably mingled with the good sense and wit of the man . " General Jackson can not write , " said a friend . " Granted , " // replied he . " General Jackson *cannot write because he was never taught ; but his competitor can not write because he was not teachable . " He make a bold remark in one of his Jacksonian harangues . " The talent which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech has no more relation to the leading of an army or a senate , than it has to the dressing of a dinner . " He pronounced a fine enlogium on the Dnke of Marlborough , one of the worst spellers in Europe , and then asked if gentlemen would have had that illustrious man " superseded by a Scotch schoolmaster . " It was in the same ludicrous harangue that he uttered his famous joke upon those schools in which young ladies were said to be " finished . " " Yes , " he exclaImed , " finished indeed ; finished for all the diities of a wife , or mother , or mistress of a family . " Again he said : " There is much which it becomes a second-rate man to know , which a first-rate man ought to be ashamed to know . No head was ever clear and sound that was stuffed with booklearning . My friend , W. II . Johnson , has many a groom that can clean and dress a race-horse , and ride him too , better than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man had ever presided over a government with advantage to the country governed , who had not in him the making of a good general ; for , said he , " the talent for government lies in these two things , - sagacity to perceive , and decision to act . " Really , when we read this ingenious apology for , or rather eulogy of , ignorance , we cease to wonder that General Jackson should have sent him to Russia . The religious life of this gifted being is a most curious study . He experienced in his lifetiiim four religious changes , or conversions . His gentle mother , whose name he seldom uttercd without adding , with tender emph*sis , " God bless her ! " was such a member of the Church of England as gentle ladies used to be before an " Evangelical " party was known in it . She taught his infant lips to pray ; and , being naturally trustful and affectionate , he was not an unapt pupil . But in the library of the old mansion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a " wagon-load " of what he terms " French infidelity , " though it appears there were almost as many volumes of Hobbes , Shaftesbury , Collins , Hume , and // Gibbon as there were of Diderot , D'Alembert , Helvetius , and Voltaire . These works he read in boyhood ; and when he came to mingle among men , he found that the opinions of such authors prevailed in the circles which he most frequented . Just as he , a natural tory , caught some tincture of republicanism from Jefferson and his friends , so he , the natural believer , adopted the fashion of scepticism , which then ruled the leading minds of all lands ; and just as he lapsed hack into toryisrn when the spell which drew him away from it had spent its force , so he became , in tim decline of his powers , a prey to religious terrors . For twenty-five years , as we have said , he held aloof from religion , its ministers and its temples . The disease that preyed upon him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , one after another , he alienated all the friends and relations with whom he ought to have lived ; and he often found himself , between the sessions of Congress , the sole white tenant of his lonely house at IRoanoke , - the sick and solitary patriarch of a family of three hundred persons . He sought to alleviate this horrid solitude by adopting and rearing the orphaned sons of old friends ; to whom , when he was himself , he was the most affectionate and generous of guardians . But even they could not very long endure him ; for , in his adverse moods , he was incarnate Distrust , and , having conceived a foul suspicion , his genius enabled him to give it such withering expression that it was not in the nature of a young man to pass it by as the utterance of transient madness . So they too left him and he was utterly alone in the midst of a crowd of black dependants . We see from his letters , that , while he saw the impossibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pined for their society and love . Perhaps there never lived a more unhappy person . IRevering women , and formed to find his happiness in domestic life , he was incapable of being a husband ; and if this had not been the case , no woman could have lived with him . Yearning for companionship , but condemned to be alone , his solace was the reflection that , so long as there was no one near him , he was a torment only to himself . " Often , " he writes in one of his letters , " I mount my horse and sit upon him for ten or fifteen minutes , wishing to go somewhere , but not knowing where to ride ; for I. // would escape anywhere from the incubus that weighs me down , body and soul ; but the fiend follows me en croupe The strongest considerations of duty are barely sufficient to prevent me from absconding to some distant country , where I might live and die unknown . " A mind in such a state as this is the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , first recalled his mind to the consideration of religion . This was about the year 1810 , at the height of those hot debates that preceded the war of 1812 . For nine years , he tells us , the subject gradually gaiued upon him , so that , at last , it was his first thought in the morning and his last at iiight . From the atheism upon which he had formerly plumed himself , he went to the opposite extreme . For a long time he was plunged into the deepest gloom , regarding himself as a sinner too vile to be forgiven . He sought for comfort in the Bible , in the Prayer-book , in conversation and correspondence with religious friends , in the sermons of celebrated preachers . He formed a scheme of retiring from the world into some kind of religious retreat , and spending the rest of his life in prayers and meditation . Rejecting this as a cowardly desertion of the post of duty , he had thoughts of setting up a school for children , and becoming himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid aside , as savoring of enthusiasm . Meanwhile , this amiable and honest gentleman , whose every error was fairly attributable to the natural limitations of his mind or to the diseases that racked his body , was tormented by remorse , which would have been excessive if he had been a pirate . He says that , after three years of continual striving , he still dared not partake of the Communion , feeling himself " unworthy . " " I was present , " he writes , " when Mr. loge invited to the table , and I would have given all I was worth to have been able to approach it . " Some inkling of his condition , it appears , became known to the public , and excited great goodwill towards him on the part of many persons of similar belief . Some of his letters written during this period contain an almost ludicrous mixture of truth and extravagance , lie says in one of them , that his heart has been softened , and he " thinks be has succeeded in forgiving all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a human being that I wonld hurt if it were in my // power , - not even Donaparte . " In another place he remarks that the world is a vast mad-house , and , " if what is to come be anything like what is passed , it would be wise to abandon the hulk to the underwriters , - the worms . " In the whole of his intercourse with mankind , he says he never met with but three persons whom he did not , on getting close to their hearts , discover to be unhappy ; and they were the only three he had ever known who had a religion . He expresses this truth in language which limits it to one form or kind of religion , the kind which he heard expounded in the churches of Virginia in 1819 . Give it broader expression , and every observer of human life will assent to it . It is indeed most true , that no human creature gets much out of life who has no religion , no sacred object , to the furtherance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief at length , and became a regular communicant of the Episcopal Church . But although he ever after manifested an extreme regard for religious things and persons , and would never permit either to be spoken against iii his presence without rebuke , he was very far from edifying his brethren by a consistent walk . At Washington , in the debates , he was as incisive and uncharitable as before . His denunciations of the second President Adams 's personal character were as outrageous as his condemnation of parts of his policy was just . Mr. Clay , though removed from the arena of debate by his appointment to the Department of State , was still the object of his bitter sarcasm ; and at length he included the President and the Secretary in that merciless philippic in which he accused Mr. Clay of forgery , and styled the coalition of Adams and Clay as " the combination of the Puritan and the Blackleg . " He used language , too , in the course of this speech , which was understood to be a defiance to mortal combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reporters , however , misunderstood him , as it was not his intention nor his desire to fight . Nevertheless , to the astonishment and sorrow of his religious friends , he accepted Mr. Clay 's challenge with the utmost possible promptitude , arid bore himself throughout the affair like ( to use the poor , lying , tory cant of the last generation ) " a high-toned Virginia gentleman . " Colonel Benton tells us that Mr. Randolph invented an ingenious excuse for the enormous inconsistency of // his conduct on this occasion . A duel , he maintained , was private war , and was justifiable on the same ground as a war between two nations . Both were lamentable , but both were allowable , when there was no other way of getting redress for insults and injuries . This was plausible , but it did not deceive him . He knew very well that his offensive language respecting a man whom he really esteemed was wholly devoid of excuse . He bad the courage requisite to expiate the offence by standing before Mr. Clay 's pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess that his abominable antithesis was but the spurt of mingled ill-temper and the vanity to shine . Any good tory can fight a duel with a respectable degree of composure ; but to own one 's self , in the presence of a nation , to have outraged the feelings of a brother-man , from the desire to startle and amuse an audience , requires the kind of valor . which tories do not know . " Whig and tory , " says Mr. Jefferson , " belong to natural history . " But then there is such a thing , we are told , as the regeneration of the natural man ; and we believe it , and cling to it as a truth destined one day to be resuscitated and purified from the mean interpretations which have made the very word sickening to the intelligence of Christendom . Mr. Randolph had not achieved the regeneration of his nature . He was a tory still . In the testing hour , the " high-toned Virginia gentleman " carried the day , without a struggle , over the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his anguish was relieved by an occasional visit to the Old World . It is interesting to note how thoroughly at home he felt himself among the English gentry , and how promptly they recognized him as a man and a brother . He was , as we haSTe remarked , more English tliaii an Englishman ; for England does advance , though slowly , from the insular to the universal . Dining at a great house in London , one evening , lie dwelt with pathetic eloque*ice upon the decline of Virginia . Being asked what he thought was the reason of her decay , lie startled amid pleased the lords and ladies present by attributing it all to the repeal of the law of primogeniture . One of the guests tells us that this was deemed " a strange remark from a Republican , " and that , before the party broke up , the company had " almost // taken him for an aristocrat : " It happened sometimes , when he was conversing with English politicians , that it was the American who defended the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British prejudice was he , that , in Paris , he protested that a decent dinner could not be bought for money . Westminster Abbey woke all his veneration . H* went into it , one morning , just as service was about beginnings and took his place among the worshippers . Those of our readers who have attended the morning service at an English cathedral on a week-day can not have forgotten the ludicrous smallness of the congregation compared with the imposing array of official assistants . A person who has a little tincture of the Yankee in him may even find himself wondering how it can " pay " the British empire to employ half a dozen reverend clergymen and a dozen robust singers to aid seven or eight unimportant members of the community in saying their prayers . But John Randolph of Roanoke had not in him the least infusion of Yankee . Standing erect iu the almost vacant space , he uttered the responses in a tone that was in startling contrast to the low mumble of the clergyman 's voice , and that rose above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in most serious earnest . When the service was over , he said to his companion , after lamenting the hasty and careless manner in which the service had been performed , that he esteemed it an honor to have worshipped God in Westminster Abbey . As he strolled among the tombs , he came , at last , to the grave of two men who had often roused his enthusiasm . He stopped , and spoke " I will not say , Take off your shoes , for the nround on which you stand is holy ; but , look , sir , do you see those simple letters on the fiagstones beneath your feet , - W. P. and C. J. F. Here lie , side by side , the remains of the two great rivals , Pitt and Fox , whose memory so completely lives in history . No marble monuments are necessary to mark the spot where their bodies repose . There is more simple grandeur in those few letters than in all the surrounding monuments , sir . " How more than English was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Westminster Abbey , William Pitt , and Charles James Fox ; but this Virginia Englishman , living alone in his woods , with his slaves and his // overseers , severed from the progressive life of his race , was living still in the days when a pair of dissolute young orators could be deemed , and with some reason too , the most important persons in a great empire . We ought not to have been snrprised at the sympathy which the English Tories felt during the late war for their brethren in the Southern States of America . It was as natural as it was for the English Protestants to welcome the banished Huguenots . It was as natural as it was for Louis XIV . to give an asylum to the Stuarts . The traveller who should have gone , seven years ago , straight from an English agricultural county to a cotton district of South Carolina , or a tobacco county of Virginia , would have felt that the differences between the two places were merely external . Tl1e system in. both places and the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia , the Carolinas , Tennessee , and Kentucky , you had only to get ten miles from a railroad to find yourself among people who were English in their feelings , opinions , habits , and even in their accent . New England differs from Old England , because New England has grown : Virginia was English , because she had been stationary . Happening to be somewhat familiar with the tone of feeling in the South , - the real South , or , in other words , the South ten miles from a railroad , - we were fully prepared for Mr. iRussell 's statement with regard to the desire so frequently expressed in 1861 for one of the English princes to come and reign over a nascent Confederacy . Sympathies and antipathies are always mutual when they are natural ; and never was there a sympathy more in accordance with the nature of things , than that which so quickly manifested itself between the struggling Southern people and the nmjority of the ruling classes of Great Britain . Mr. Randolph took leave of public life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified manner . He furnished another illustration of the truth of a remark made by a certain queen of Denmark , - " The lady doth protest too much . " Like many other gentlemen in independent circumstances , he had been particularly severe upon those of his fellow-citizens who earned their subsistence by serving the public . It pleased him to speak of members of the Cabinet as " the drudges of // the departments , " and to hold gentlemen in the diplomatic service up to contempt as forming " the tail of the corps diplomatique in Europe . " He liked to declaim upon the cuormous impossibility of his ever exchanging a seat in Congress for " the shabby splendors " of an office in Washington , or in a foreign mission " to dance attendance abroad instead of at home . " When it was first buzzed about in Washington , in 1830 , that General Jackson had tendered the Russian mission to John Randolph , the rumor was not credited . An appointment so exquisitely absurd was supposed to he beyond even Andrew Jackson 's audacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph 's brilliant defence of General Jackson 's had spelling , together with Mr. Van Buren 's willingness to place an ocean between the new administration and a master of sarcasm , to whom opposition had become aix unchangeable habit , had dictated an offer of the mission , couched in such seductive language that Mr. Randolph yielded to it as readily as those ladies accept an offer of marriage who have often announced their intention never to marry . Having reached the scene of his diplomatic labors at the beginning of August , he began to perform them with remarkable energy . In a suit of black , the best , he declared , that London could furnish , he was presented to the Emperor and to the Empress , having first submitted his costume to competent inspection . Resolute to do his whole duty , he was not content to send his card to the diplomatic corps , but , having engaged a handsome coach and four , he called upon each member of the diplomatic body , from the ambassadors to the secretaries of legation . Having performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he was charged could not then be accomplished , he had leisure to observe that St. Petersburg , in the month of August , is not a pleasant residence to an invalid of sixty . He describes the climate in these terms : - " Heat , dust impalpable , pervading every part and pore Insects of all nauseous descriptions , bugs , fleas , mosquitoes , flies innumerable , gigantic as the empire they inhabit , who will take no denial . This is the land of Pharaoh and his plagues , - Egypt and its ophthalmia and vermin , without its fertility , - Holland , without its wealth , improvements , or cleanliness . " // He endured St. Petersburg for the space of ten days , then sailed for England , and never saw Russia again . When the appropriation bill was before Congress at the n&amp;xt session , opposition members did not fail to call iii question the justice of requiring the people of the United States to pay twenty thousand dollars for Mr. Randolph 's ten days ' work , or , to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's bad spelling ; but the item passed , nevertheless . During the reign of Andrew Jackson , Congress was little more than a board of registry for the formal recording of his edicts . There are those who think , at the present moment , that what a President hadi done , a President may do again . It was fortunate that John Randolph was in retirement when Calhoun brought on his Nullification scheme . The presence ii Congress of a man so eloquent and so reckless , whose whole heart and mind were with the Nullifiers , might have prevented the bloodless postponement of the struggle . He was in constant correspondence with the South Carolina leaders , and was fully convinced that it was the President of the United States , not " the Hamiltons and Haynes " of South Carolina , who ought to seize the first pretext to concede the point in dispute . No citizen of South Carolina was more indignant than he at General Jackson 's Proclamation . He said that , if the people did not rouse themselves to a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " the country.was irretrievably ruined and he spoke of the troops despatched to Charleston as " mercenaries , " to whom he hoped " no quarter would be given . " The " wretched old man " whom the people were to " put down " was Andrew Jackson , not John C. Calhoun . We do not forget that , when John Randolph uttered these words , lie was scarcely an accountable being . Disease had reduced him to a skeleton , and robbed him of almost every attribute of man except his capacity to suffer . But even in his madness he was a representative man , and spoke the latent feeling of his class . The diseases which sharpened his temper unloosed his tongue ; he revealed the tendency of the Southern mind , as a petulant child reveals family secrets . In his good and in his evil he was an exaggerated Southerner of the higher class . He was like tl*em , too , in this they are not criminals // to be punished , but patients to be cured . Sometimes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in being incurable . As long as Americans take an interest in the history of their country , they will read with interest the strange story of this sick and suffering representative of sick and suffering Virginia . To the last , old Virginia wore her ragged robes with a kind of grandeur which was not altogether unbecoming , and which to the very last imposed upon tory minds . Scarcely any one could live among the better Southern people without liking them ; and few will ever read Hugh Garland 's Life of John Randolph , without more than forgiving all his vagaries , impetuosities , and foibles . How often , upon riding away from a Southern home , have we been ready to exclaim , " What a pity such good people should be so accursed ! " Lord Russell well characterized the evil to which we allude as " that fatal gift of the poisoned garment which was flung around them from the first hour of their establishment . " The last act of John Randolph 's life , done when he lay dying at a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express once more his sense of this blighting system . Some years before , he had made a will by which all his slaves were to be freed at his death . He would probably have given them their freedom before his death , but for the fact , too evident , that freedom to a black man in a Slave State was not a boon . T1*e slaves freed by his , brother , forty years before , had not done well , because ( as he supposed ) no land had been bequeathed for their support . Accordingly , he left directions in his will that a tract of land , which might be of four thousand acres , should be set a.part for the maintenance of his slaves , and that they should be transported to it and established upon it at the expense of his estate . " I give my slaves their freedom , " said he in his will , " to which my conscience tells me they are justly entitled . " On the last day of his life , surrounded by strangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief concern was to make distinctly known to as many persons as possible that it was really his will that his slaves should be free . Knowing , as he did , the aversion which his fellowcitizens had to the emancipation of slaves , and even to the presence in the State of free blacks , he seemed desirous of tak // ing away every pretext for breaking his will . A few hours before his death , he said to the physician in attendance " I confirm every disposition in my will , especially that concerning my slaves whom I have manumitted , and for whom I have made provision . " The doctor , soon after , took leave of him , and was about to depart . " You must not go , " said he , " you can not , you shall not leave me . " He told his servant not to let the doctor go , and the man immediately locked the door and put the key in his pocket . The doctor remonstrating , Mr. Randolph explained , that , by the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was requisite that the master should declare his will in that particular in the presence of a white witness , who , after hearing the declaration , must never lose sight of the party until he is dead . The doctor consented , at lei*gtl* , to remain , but urged that more witnesses should be sent for . This was done . At ten in the morning , four gentlemen were ranged in a semicircle round his bed . He was propped up almost in a sitting posture , and a blanket was wrapped round his head and shoulders . His face was yellow , and extremely emaciated ; he was very weak , and it required all the remainino energy of his mind to endure the exertion he was about to make . It was evident to all present that his whole soul was in the act , and his eye gathered fire as lie performed it . Pointing toward the witnesses with that gesture which for so many years had been familiar to the House of Representatives , he said , slowly and distinctly " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and direct them to be enforced , particularly in regard to a provision for their support . " Then , raising his hand and placing it upon the shoulder of his servant , he added , " Especially for this man . " Having performed this act , his mind appeared relieved , but hi* strength immediately left him , and in two hours he breathed his last . The last of the IRandolphs , and one of the best representatives of the original masters of Virginia , the high-toned Virginia gentleman , was no more . Those men had their opportunity , but they had not strength of character equal to it . They were tried and found wanting . The universe , which loves not the high-toned , even in violins , disowned them , and they perished . Cut off frorii the life-giving current // of thought and feeling which kept the rest of Christendom advancing , they came to love stagnation , and looked out from their dismal , isolated pool with lofty contempt at the gay and active life on the flowing stream . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have taught them . But we are hound always to consider that they were subjected to a trial under which human virtue has always given way , and will always . Sudden wealth is itself sufficient to spoil any but the very best men , - those who can instantly set it at work for the general good , and continue to earn an honest livelihood by faithful labor . But those tobacco lords of Virginia , besides making large fortunes in a few years , were the absolute , irresponsible masters of a submissive race . And when these two potent causes of effeminacy and pride had worked out their proper result in the character of the masters , then , behold ! their resources fail . Vicious agriculture exhausts the soil , false political economy prevents the existence of a middle class , and the presence of slaves repels emigration . Proud , ignorant , indolent , dissolute , and in debt , the dominant families , one after another , passed away , attesting to the last , by an occasional vigorous shoot , the original virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was . Virginia remains . Better men will live in it than have ever yet lived there ; but it will not be in this century , and possibly not in the next . It can not be that so fair a province will not be one day inhabited by a race of men who will work according to the laws of nature , and whom , therefore , the laws of nature will co-operate with and preserve . How superior will such Virginians be to what Dr. Francis Lieber styles the provincial egotism of state sovereignty
