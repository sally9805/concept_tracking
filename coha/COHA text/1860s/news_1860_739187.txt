txt Since the loss of the Connaught we have intelligence of the loss of the Granada at San Francisco , and of the Arctic , the Edinburgh , the Aloscow , the Thor , and the Viscount Lambton , with all on board , ip the North Sea or in the Baltic . The Golden Fleece , which took the place of the Connaught on one voyage , is also reported missing . As far as we know anything about it , all this loss of life and property might have been prevented . When the Granada ran upon a reef , she at once filled and broke her back . The five British ships next mentioned were piled with enormous Summer deck loads for a Fall passage ; but to the Connaught we wish particularly to refer .. It will be remembered that the Connaught began to go to pieces in an ordinary sea-way , in addition to which she was burned out by fire while going to pieces ! Now we have it by good authority from the engineer of this ship , that she showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open in a dreadful way " on the whole of the last passage , that fire was " continually breaking out even on the previous voyage , " from a defective superheater , and that when the vessel began to break up a little faster than usual , allhands were called away from the fire to stop the leak , and so the fire got the upper hand . Here is a commentary on the safety of traveling in cheap ships . Either working to pieces or a continual fire nobody would object to , of course , but both at a time is a little too risky as a general rule . We have heard of ships that do not begin to work open in a heavy swell ; it will be remembered that the North American has twice gone at nearly or quite full speed upon the rocks near Cape Race , and then crossed the ocean , without repairs , with the forward compartment full of water , while the Cuba and the Indian simply broke up in a sea-way , and the Royal Charter and the Hungarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the causes of disaster , plainly enough ; it is all a question of a little more or a little less first cost . The Connaught was built by the Messrs . PALMER , of Jarrow ? so was the Leinster , her advertised successor . These ships are represented by the correspondents of the English papers to be the same as to quality . That is all . vole-THE JAPANESE ITEMS COMING. ? We observe that Alderman BRADY has at length commenced to question the expediency of paying the Japanese bills without scrutiny . The approach of election day and his desire to retain his seat in the honorable body of which he is an ornament , would seem to have had upon his political vision the same miraculous effect which is attributed in the Arabian Nights to the ointment rubbed by the wandering dervise on the eyelids of the blind beggar of Bagdad . Ile now not only sees , but sees more clearly than other men , and has suddenly become convinced of the iniquity of that course which a majority of his official brethren have heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to " put through . " There is one little drawback , we confess , to the apparent sincerity of the regenerate Alderman from the Fifth District . His motion , which was adopted without debate or division ? in itself a very suspicious circumstance ? contains on its face the germs of delay  --  a delay which may very likely last until after the December election . The members of the Japanese Committee are ordered to present " forthwith " a bill of items , " if prepared ; " and " if not prepared , " then to have said bill of items prepared without delay and submitted to the Board at its meeting on next Monday evening . It is just possible that , at the period named , the Special Committee may have the report required of them in readiness ; but it is also possible , and not against the probabilities of Aldermanic nature , that on next Monday evening the Committee may confine themselves to " reporting progress " and asking for further delay . We do not , by any means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have heard of like dilatory action in other cases of a similar kind . There is no necessity , however , for anticipating evil with regard to the Board of Aldermen . Our receipts from them of this commodity are so abundant every day , that we have never the least need of drawing against future invoices . We , therefore , hope for the best , while bracing our nerves not to be astonished by the worst .
