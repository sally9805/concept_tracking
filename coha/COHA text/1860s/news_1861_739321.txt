txt While the policy of Gen. MCCLELLAN was very properly a defensive one till he had repaired the Bull Run disaster , and put his Army in condition for operations in the open field , we can not help believing that the time is not far distant in which he will resume the offensive . While he has been daily accumulating strength , the enemy has been constantly weakened , at least relatively , by his inability to carry on war upon anything like the scale assumed by the United States . The defeat of the rebels will be in their commissariat , by which they can neither be properly paid , nor fed , nor clothed ; their great Army must , if Gen. MCCLELLAN remains in his intrenchments , gradually fall to pieces and disappear . But we can not afford to rest our cause entirely upon negative action . We have the disgrace of . a defeat to efface , while . we must make an adequate display of our power . The success of our Army must not only be up to the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the magnitude of the crisis . . Such , we are confident , is the feeling of the Army at Washington , and and of the Administration , and we consequently anticipate an early advance from the Potomac . Gen. MCCLELLAN has been successful in his efforts to create any army complete in any department , infantry , artillery , and cavalry . He has brought it to such a state of , perfection , that he probably will not long hesitate to encounter the rebels on their own ground . - We believe that not many days will elapse before we shall see a grand advance of all our forces , and if the rebels oppose , a great battle . It has undoubtedly been in anticipation of such an advance that an expedition has already sailed from Fortress Monroe , to deal another blow upon the Southern sea-coast . A much more important point than Hatteras . will be assailed , and if with success , which we have a right to anticipate , we think we shall witness a staincede from the rebel Army in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MCCLELLAN moves or not . Should we succeed ' ' . in capturing a leading Southern seaport , n4. a soldier from its State would remain forty. : eight hours thereafter upon the soil of Vir=. , ginia . We presume that there is to be a concert between the naval expedition-. and Gen. MCCLELLAN 'S advance . The former , is not only to turn the flank of the rebels , but , to recall them for the defence of their own , : homes , instead of attempting to stay the tide ; . of battle in a far distant region . Such is .. ' ; clearly our strategy for the future . It is one : we can carry out in open day , and without ' any effectual resistance . We have the sea at : ? cemmand , which is worth more to us in the contest than 100,000 - trained yeterans- ' - wotild4:be to the rebels : ' ' Z ' = They have ln ' their : - frensy hardly con isidered the effect of an attack . by sea as as  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be enabled to fight the rebel States singly , instead of collectively , and shall : in this way be always , enabled to present an overwhelming force at any point . We think we can assurne , without , any risk of being mistaken , an early advance from all our lines , and a success which will speedily make up for our apparent tardiness , which was only the result of preparations necessary to assail and overwhelm the enemy at a half a dozen different points , at the same moment .
