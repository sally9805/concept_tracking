NEEDLE AND GARDEN . THE STORY OF A SEAMSTRESS WHO LAID DOWN HER NEEDLE AND BECAME A STRAWBERRY-GIRL . WRITTEN BY HERSELF . CHAPTER VII . I HAVE already mentioned that the little holding of forty acres , Which my progenitor took up when he came to Philadelphia , had in process of time been subdivided into many smaller ones . These had been successively improved as the new owners entered upon them , some very indifferently , some quite respectably , - many of them being devoted to gardening for the city markets . The occupants were not much of neighbors to us , though friendly enough in their way ; among them , however , was a family by the name of Tetchy who claimed to have some acquaintance with us . This name , Tetchy , always struck me as a singular one ; and I have often thought it must have been a corruption of Touchy , as a constitutional tendency to the infirmity thereby signified was continually apparent in their conduct toward all who came in contact with them . The whole family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , were a jealous , envious set , rarely saying a kind word to any one , and never , as my mother often remarked , doing a kind thing even to us , who were more sociable with them than any other of the neighbors . Of course they had abundance of ridiculous pride , though having nothing to be proud of ; and one of the daughters , Miss Belinda , was remarkable for holding up her head as if she had been the finest lady fn the land , besides having a curt , snappish way of speaking , that made me habitually afraid of her . These people had a piece of ground of the same size as ours , which the father worked as a garden . He was very skilful at gardening , and kept everything in such complete order that I would many times have gone in to admire his fruits and flowers , had it not been for the crisp reception that one was sure to get from Miss Belinda Tetchy and her mother . They never invited us inside the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were doing . The father had some grains of good-nature in his disposition , and would have been glad to have me come in occasionally : I am sure of this , as he often came into our garden and gave me very useful advice and instruction about what I was cultivating . But his wife 's temper was abar to all hospitality , and our intercourse with the family was accordingly as limited as possible , except with the son , Arthur , who made himself quite intimate at our house , and was disposed to set up for a beau to my sister , though I never could discover that she had any particuk*r liking for him . Even he , however , was habitually taciturn about what was done in their garden , as if he had been well drilled in the art of concealment . We never could tell with certainty how this family contrived to live as well as they did . The father had no other employment than that afforded by his garden , at least that we ever knew . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valuable fruit . We saw him taking it away in a wheelbarrow , but it was always carefully covered , and none but his family knew whether he took it to market , or disposed of it to the fruit stores in the city . The family never boasted of how much they raised ; and though we were often curious to know more than we did , myself especially , yet the fear of being snubbed by Miss Be4inda prevented us from making any inquiries . The daughters did nothing , unless it were to dress well , a great deal // better than any of us , and to be often in the street . It is true that Arthur was an apprentice , arid was no expense to the family ; but beyond what he received from his employer we could not learn that they had any income hut what was produced from the garden . Still , all the neighborhood knew that old Tetchy had an immense bed of strawberries ; they could see that through the cracks in the fence . Then he had fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden , and there , during the season , was a constant throng of visitors , who came to eat strawberries and cream . He had carried on this business for a great many years . I had never noticed these things very particularly , until my mother and I began debating how it was that the Tetchy family contrived to live and dress so well without apparently doing anything except looking after a garden no larger than our own . But when my curiosity had been awakened , I started out on a course of inquiry that resulted in throwing more light on the subject than the Tetchys supposed . I watched the crowd of visitors who entered the garden-gate every evening in June to eat strawberries , and found it so large that toward the last of the season I began to count them . The number was so great that it amazed us , and my mother was sure I must have been mistaken . I regretted not having begun the enumeration when the season first opened , as that would have given us some idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - the number of pints of strawberries they raised in a season . My sister had entered heartily into the spirit of inquiry which now moved me , and became extremely accessible to Arthur Tetchy , even consenting to walk out with him several evenings , in the hope of being invited into the garden , or of getting some information out of him , in aid of the common cause . But the fellow had been so well tutored on the subject that he proved a regular knownothing , - he had no idea what quantity they raised , - in short , he refused to tell . But in addition to what was consumed in the garden , we saw , during the day , numerous callers with baskets , and we knew that their errand was to buy strawberries . Then old Tetchy was seen carrying away other baskets into the city , so that during the season the demand was evidently unintermitted . We had often heard these strawberries spoken of as being of superior size and quality . Indeed , we one day read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being nearly as large as eggs , and descrihing the garden . It also spoke in very extraordinary terms of the richness of the cream . But I never could understand how this could be , as we knew that old Tetchy kept only one cow , and it was impossible for one cow to make cream enough - real cream - for even a quarter of the people who came to eat his strawberries . I thought so strange of this piece that I ventured to show it to Miss Belinda , and inquired very innocently how they could get so much cream , and if it were not wrong in the newspapers to publish such mistakes . But , what was very unusual with her , she was wonderfully pleased with the matter , and said they had two cows , - one that they kept in the stable , and another in the kitchen . " How ? " I inquired , in amazement , - " keep a cow in the kitchen ? Why , is it not very inconvenient ? " " Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the kitchen cow has an iron tail ! " " But did the newspaper man know this ? " I asked , not being familiar with the tricks of trade , and utterly ignorant how such things were managed . " No , indeed ! " she replied , - adding , with what I considered great superciliousness , " we sent him a basket of strawberries , and invited him down last *veek to take some with cream , and when he came it was cream that he got , - our best . That was well done ; and ever since he published that piece we have been so crowded that the new cow in the kitchen supplies more milk than the old one in the stable . " I had never known either her or any of the family to be so communicative // before . It was an entirely new idea to me , and rather shook my confidence in the newspapers , not supposing they were ever deceived . But Tetchy 's berries were unquestionably very superior ones . We had frequently seen them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the evening throng and called for saucers of them , merely to learn for ourselves how the business was carried on and what prices were obtained . I am sure that not near so much civility was shown to us as to the other customers . No doubt , as we were neighbors , and had been very inquisitive , they suspected our object in coming . We both remarked on the deplorable weakness of the cream , and had a good laugh over the method of its manufacture . Jane thought of calling for a second saucer , and of asking the fair Tetchy who served us if she would not do us the favor to let the watery portion be put into a separate vessel . I was really frightened for fear she would do as she proposed , as I knew her fondness for pleasantries of this sort , and also , that so far from being taken as a joke , it would bring down upon us a storm of wrath . We were surprised at the smallness of the saucers containing the fruit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been put into a pint . Then the sugar was supplied in meagre quantity , though at that time cheaper than ever before known . There were common tin spoons , so valueless as to make it no object for a thief to steal them , and of no consequence if they were bent up or thrown away by roystering visitors . The supply of cheap sugar was not sufficient to overcome the sharp acid of the fruit , showing that the demand was so urgent as to compel the picking of the berries before the sun had imparted to them the luscious sweetness of complete ripeness . As at all popular summer resorts , the price charged was provokingly disproportioned to the fare ; but then we remembered that we had come in pursuit of knowledge , that knowledge always has in some way to be paid for , 49 ' and that the strawberry-season is very short . Though thus ascertaining the prices at which Tetchy disposed of the fruit in his popular strawberry-garden , we were unable to learn what he obtained for that which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we supposed it must go to families who paid the highest figures , as the fruit was carefully selected , the smaller berries being served up to the evening customers , who , viewing them by an indifferent light , were unable to form a judgment as to their size and appearance , and with whom the mere strawberry-flavor was sufficient . My mother calfed our attention to one circumstance , - that all the fruit was sold at retail prices , and that , if there was any profit in the business , these people got the whole of it . At the rates they were selling , they must be receiving at least a dollar a quart , and that clear of the cost of the cream from their two cows . I suppose it might have been considered impertinent in us to be thus prying into our neighbors ' concerns , wondering how they contrived to live and how much money they made by their business . But we had no idea of doing them any injury ; I was only desirous of doing something better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And besides , I have no doubt there were folks around us who were quite as inquisitive as to how we managed to get along , and that , too , from mere idle curiosity , without any view to bettering themselves by imitating us . In addition to these little diplomatic efforts to obtain information as to how much money our neighbors were making , many others were tried . I had already suggested to my mother and sister the idea of my undertaking the business of raising strawberries ; and hence , as they both fell in with the project , our common effort to learn whether our neighbors really did support themselves by an employment so apparently insignificant . There was one point about which we were greatly perplexed . The strawberry-season lasted only fifteen to // , 50 twenty days , and we could not understand how the Tetchys could make enough in that short period to keep them a whole year . It is true we knew that they could sell at enormous retail prices all that they were able to produce , and hence we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they could produce enou , , h. , even within the short period of twenty days , they could do all that they appeared to be doing during the remainder of the year , - that is , comparatively nothing . Now not one of us had any knowledge of the strawberry - culture . My father , strangely enough , had never introduced it into our garden , though he knew what our neighbors had for many years been doing . We had no agricultural publications to instruct us , and we could not form the remotest idea of how much fruit an acre could be made to yield . We did not even know the size of our neighbor 's strawberrybed . But one day , when the fruit season was over , my sister was bold enough to invite herself into Tetchy 's garden . She and Arthur had been taking a walk , and he was about parting with her at the garden-gate , when she pushed in with him , and obliged him to go all round the strawberry - ground . It lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she managed to count the number of steps as they strolled round it . Arthur had not the faintest idea of what she was after , but flattered himself that she was desirous of having a little more of his society . When Fred came home that evening , Jane reported to him the number of steps she had taken in her strawberry-circuit , and Fred ciphered it out for us that the plot contained exactly an acre . This was an important item of information for us . We knew that old Tetchy 's lot was of precisely the same size as ours , - an acre and a half , and we felt that we could spare an acre for a strawberry-bed as well as he . We were firmly impressed with the belief that their acre of strawberries kept the whole family ; and I felt sure , that , if I could only learn the mode of culture , we could in some way find a market for all we could produce , - although I did not contemplate inviting customers to our house to eat sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I often saw the Tetchy girls hoeing and weeding , and have no doubt they performed a very large part of that important labor . It was light work , as well as home-work , such as I was extremely anxious to obtain . The wholesome out-door exercise , I was confident , would give robustness to my health , - and , if the summer sun did change me from a blonde into a brunette , the winter intermission would bring that all right again . We saw there were difficulties in the way of making a beginning , because of our total ignorance of the business . But among us there was a good deal of resolution . There was also a strong desire to learn ; and a willingness to do so , coupled with persevering energy of purpose , rarely fails of its object . We were also prompt to act , whenever we found action desirable . While others would be deliberating , we would be pushing on ; and I have always found that going forward with spirit and confidence is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubts , and so does nothing , that unfits himself for doing anything . Success in one thing stimulates to exertion in another . We had already borne up under calamity , and been quite as fortunate as others , even when the horizon was overcast by heavy clouds . But now we were comparatively comfortable ; the sky above us was serene , and our hopes were buoyant ; the venture I was proposing to make would cost but a trifling sum , and , if failure came , the loss could not be great . It was not farming that I was to undertake . There was no land to be bought ; it was merely the better cultivation of what we already had . There was not even a tool to be purchased . Now no one would be surprised at the conversion of our whole garden into a cabbage-field ; yet many would wonder at our turning it into a strawberry-patch . It would be a // novelty for women to undertake ; and , alas while even vicious novelties are tolerated in men , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we cared not for what others might say or think . My assurance of success was so strong that it overbore every other consideration . Besides , I was strengthened by the encouragement of every member of our little family . I am not about to write an apology for women 's undertaking even a large horticultural establishment . Of ordinary rough farming I will not speak , as that is confessedly beyond the domain of female strength . But there are individuals of the sex who have large flower - gardens , even fruit - gardens , in which everything is made to bloom and bear luxuriantly . They neither dig nor hoe , but they frequently plant and train and trim , overseeing and directing where and when the spade , the hoe , and the watering-pot shall be applied . Their cultivated taste gives symmetry and grace to borders , trellises , and walks , - decking the first with floral gorgeousness , hanging the second with festoons whose perfumes load the atmosphere , and lining the third with edgings that wear an ever - flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not by their own hands that these marvels are wrought . It is of their passionate fondness for tree and fruit and flower that such humanizing results are born . They spring from the mind , the heart , the understanding , not from the manual labor of their fair authors . Too few of my sex have sufficiently informed themselves of these simple affairs of the garden : their inheritance has been the needle only . But it was nothing of this ornate description that I was about to undertake . I was to have neither arbor nor trellis , - no sweet-scented honeysuckle clustering over an elaborate framework , - no parterre of beautiful flowers , glorious to behold , but producing no profit , - not even marigold or lady's-slipper . There was to be no fancy-work , but everything was to be practicaL I was now in search of profit , trusting that the future would enable me to indulge in the ornamental . The first thing was to procure the strawberry-plants . I knew of none who had them but the Tetchy family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I half despaired of obtaining any from them . Why they did so we could not exactly tell , but our conclusion was that they must be unwilling to have competitors in their business . But though never admiring the manners of any of the family , I resolved to make a trial with them . There were reasons for hoping I might succeed . Miss Belinda Tetchy , notwithstanding her odd name , was quite a belle . She had been immensely popular with the young gentlemen who came to the strawberrygarden . My sister Jane bad once very ill-naturedly insinuated that they came there as much to flirt with her as to indulge in strawberries , and that one could readily eat his way into the affections of the whole family . I did not like the remark , although probably there mibht be some truth in it . But one of these admirers continued to visit at old Tetchy 's even when the excuse of coming for strawberries could no longer be given , and very soon our little neighborhood learned the interesting news that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister said she pitied the young man . Indeed , she went so far as to say that it was astonishing what risks were run by all such when looking round for a wife . As to Belinda , she was sure , that , though there might be a change of name , there would be no change of temper , as the latter was something she got by Nature , while the former came by accident . But Jane had a little dash of tartness in her own disposition , which was very apt to break out when topics of this kind came up for discussion . Though I could not help agreeing with her in the main , yet I considered it no more than fair to remind her that the choosing of a husband was quite as risky a business for the girls . 5 ' // These things occurred towards the close of summer . Miss I3elinda 's wedding-day had been fixed for early in September . Of course there was considerable fluttering among the young people of the neighborhood , - the girls , candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the young men . It was understood that Mrs. Tetchy intended to have a grand wedding for her daughter , by way , as my sister said , of showing her new son that her daughter was somebody , a fact of which Jane thought he would have a realizing experience much sooner than he expected . Now it was desirable for us to conciliate the Tetchys , and we thought the occasion of a wedding a good opportunity to do so . Accordingly , when the eventful day arrived , I carried to the house a really magnificent vase of flowers which we had gathered from our garden , and presented it to the bride . Both she and her mother received it with a profusion of thanks that was remarkable for them to indulge in , adding that they would be sure and have it placed in the centre of the great table at the wedding . I had also contemplated accompanying it with a few complimentary verses , - not that I was at all poetically inclined , but my idea was that they would feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion . Indeed , I did write something , but it was so much of an effort that I have never made a second attempt . When I read the lines to Jane , she went off into a strain of merriment over what she called my folly , and said , in her usual sharp way , that that was not what the Tetchys cared for , - they had no faith in any kind of jingle but that of money . Everybody in the neighborhood , as a matter of course , knew all that transpired at the wedding , - how many people were there , how the bride was dressed , what presents she received , how she looked and behaved , and what she said , as well as what sort of a dinner they had . We learned , also , that there was a profusion of bride-cake , in nic*e little white boxes tied with sky-blue July , ribbon , sent to friends and acquaintances in token of friendly remembrance . As we were living close by , and felt that we had stron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day at least . But the day passed , and the next and the next , and still no bride-cake came . A week longer proved that we had been either overlooked by accident or positively cut by design . Jane became indignant at the apparent slight ; I was only alarmed lest my diplomacy had failed . I cared nothing for the bridecake , but only for the strawberry-plants . So , when we thought the family had recovered from the confusion and really hard work which are always incident to a grand wedding , I summoned up courage to go and see Mrs. Tetchy and ask her to sell me some plants . I had great misgivings as to my success ; and in addition , the fear of her sharp temper and language made me nervous . I could stand up and face and argue with a man without flinching ; but somehow the rasping savagery of a termagant woman always overcame me . It happened , when I went into the garden , that both she and her husband were engaged in taking up what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that summer , and were setting them out in new rows , by a line that extended across the entire bed . I observed also that they were throwing away many plants , probably because the ground was too crowded . But there was scarcely a moment allowed me for observation ; for I had no sooner walked up to where they were at work than Mrs. Tetchy rose up quickly , and saluted me with , - " I-low did you get in ? Was n't the gate bolted ? " I replied , that , as no one had answered my call at the front door , I supposed they must be in the garden , and so had taken the liberty of coming in . I could have feigned some apology inconsistent with sincerity , but that was not my way . Besides , her manner was so unexpectedly abrupt as to confuse me . There she stood , with a garden-trowel in her hand , in working dishabille , and Needle and Garden . // presenting altogether a needlessly unattractive picture of a female horticulturist ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt , yet it does not follow that one must of necessity be dirty herself . " Do you want anything ? " she again asked , in the same snappish tone . " Yes , Ma'am , " I replied , - " I came to see if I could buy a few strawberryplants . " " I thought that 's what you were going at , " she answered , even more sharply . " That s what your pimping about us comes to . Want to ruin our business , do you , and have strawberries of your own to sell to our customers ? You ca n't get any here : we do n't sell plants . " The woman 's manner forbade all persuasion or ar6ument . Her husband kept on with his work , saying nothing ; she was evidently the master-spirit of garden as well as household , and I turned away so vexed and indignant as not even to bid the churl a good-morning . I could hear the mutterings of her anger to her husband as I walked quickly away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed through the gate , I slammed it to with all the energy of a real spitefulness . Not one of us has ever stepped foot upon the inhospitable premises of these people since . And Jane so persistently snubbed the son , that he very soon discovered , that , instead of being desirous of assuming the name of Tetchy , she would prefer never to hear it even mentioned . I have somewhere read of two charming women being once engaged in discussing the question of what it is that constitutes the beauty of the human hand . There was difference of opinion , of course , and no really definite idea of the true elements of beauty . Unable to decide themselves , they referred it to a 6entleman present . His mind went back to , and wandered over , the classics , exhausting the heathen mythology for examples and parallels , but he could come to no conclusion until the shining illustrations of the Christian faith rose up before him . Taking the white hand 53 of each fair disputant in his own , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to answer ; but ask the poor , those who in any way solicit from us a favor , and they will tell you that the most beautiful hand in the world is the hand that gives . " I could have discovered beauty even in that of our neighbor , coarse and soiled as it was , had it been open and generous . But the nerves by whose agency the human hand is opened freely or as tightly closed must have their source in the human heart . If there be sympathy for others there , a politeness of the heart , the kindly impulses thus living and moving within it will vibrate through every cord of one 's being , and , struggling or outward expression , will manifest their presence by the warm grasp of the hand , the cordial smile , the gently modulated voice , the unflagging effort to promote the happiness of all around . I had not asked a gift ; it was the jealous indisposition to oblige that so grieved and confounded me . I had always supposed that horticulture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affections and refined the manners of all who pursued it , eve*i when they did so as a matter of pecuniary gain . Here was evidence that in one instance I was mistaken . But it was the single exception to what may be regarded as the general rule ; for in other cases I have found humble cultivators of both fruit and flowers , to whose genial hearts all selfish unwillingness to communicate a knowledge of the art , or to supply me with plants , was a total stranger . There are thousands of pioneers such as I was . It is well for them that the light they need is not hidden under the bushel of any one churlish individuaL But there were ample expedients remaining , and it required more than one discouragement to divert me from the object we were seeking to accomplish . There stands in the centre of Second Street , in Philadelphia , a market-house extending two squares below Pine // Street , long famous for its overflowing supplies of fruits and vegetables . In passing through it on my daily walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strawberries on the various stands ; but , having at that time no special interest in the subject , I had only noticed the beauty of their crimson pyramids , the abundant supply , and the throngs of buyers that gathered round them . I took no thought of price , nor of where or how they were produced , as that branch of horticulture had never engaged my attention . But now the case was diferent . I remembered that most of these stands had been attended by women , and that one in particular bad been famous for the quantity of its daily supply of fruit , as well as for the crowd of customers that collected about it . I lost no time in calling on the occupant . Though the strawberries had long since disappeared , yet she sat surrounded with a profusion of vegetables , - one kind succeeding another as the seasons changed . In all the public markets of Philadelphia , this business of retailing what is popularly known as " truck " has become an inheritance of the poor women ever abounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacting business . Whether well or ill , the earliest daybreak finds them at their posts . There they stand or sit until the evening shadows begin to lengthen . Through all weathers they observe the same compulsory routine . No morning rain is too drenching , no snow too blinding , no cold too bitter , to keep from their stands these heroic toilers for a bare subsistence . Multitudes of them are mothers of families , whom they are thus obliged to leave half-uncared-for at home . Many are poor widows , burdened also with the care of children . Every other avenue to employment being closed , they are forced into this public exposure of the open air , in many cases with a mere shed to shelter them from the inclement weather . But while thus dispensing food to others , they earn it honestly for themselves . They live , and some-July , times accumulate money . The shrewd managing ones have been known to become independent . Some of them begin upon a capital of a few dollars wherewith to furnish their stands , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . Talent is necessary even for the sale of truck : not possessing it , they are driven to some employment of a humbler description . These women are not producers of the fruits and vegetables they have to sell . Most of these are grown by truckers in the suburbs , who supply the market-stands with a daily assortment during the season . But the business of thus trafficking in the open thoroughfare is a hard one for females . Custom has reconciled the public eye to it , but necessity alone has made it tolerable for women . When I called at the strawberrystand referred to , and entered into conversation with the occupant , I at once discovered that I was conversing with one infinitely above the situation she was filling . Indeed , if courteousness , gentleness , and the manifestation of a sincere desire to gratify the wishes of another are to be considered as characteristic of a lady , this woman was one . I did not notice how she dressed , but only how pleasantly she spoke . I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate the possibility of a lady being found among the occupants of a public market . I know that before one can be considered lady-like , in the common acceptation of the term , she must be shown to be perfectly useless . By this rule she must be devoid of everything that may entitle her to the love and protection which she claims of right , before she can receive either . It is fashionable with some ladies to be invalids and helpless , and some are nursed and coddled up because they take on accomplishments of this description . Of course no one will expect me to know how the domestic arrangements of Adam and Eve were conducted . But I may presume that Adam 's dinners were prepared with as much gastronomic skill as had up to Ne*ed/e and Garden . // 55 that time been attained , and that if Eve had set up to be a fashionable invalid , wholly dependent on Adam , and not a help-meet , there would have been a domestic mutiny even in the Garden of Eden . Our primal mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a capital cook . Thus the truly gentle heart will lose nothing of its native gentleness , though forced by misfortune into a humbler station . Such must have been the character of the woman I was addressing . There was something in her voice , moreover , that struck me as a familiar sound , and , long before our conversation had ended , I recognized her as the widow whom , years ago , I had seen made the victim of a heartless imposition at the counter of a slop-shop . She had gone through trial after trial , and now , lady though she certainly was , there she stood at a fruit-stand in the public market . There was no difficulty in obtaining plants through her . Like some others in the market , she sold many things on commission , among which were strawberry-plants for the trucker who supplied her with fruit . I engaged all I should need for an acre of ground , not then knowing how many would be wanted . Then I went into a long course of inquiry touching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the latter . When I suggested the possibility of not finding a market , she broke out into loud merriment . " Brincr them to me , Miss , " she cried . " I can sell all that you will be able to produce . I have never yet had a full supply for my customers . This market has never within my experience had too many strawberries , and I have been here three years . " She gave me abundant information concerning the whole business of selling , which at that time I regarded as the most important , having , notwithstanding my new-born enthusiasm , felt considerable doubt as to whether we could dispose of our cr6p . But here , according to her account , the sale was sure . Then she went into quite a long explanation of how the fruit was to be made ready for market , just as if I had already produced it , telling me that the berries must be selected when they were picked , the large and fine ones being kept separate from the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it gave a good return , as there were those among her customers who would pay any price for fine berries . I observed , that it was probably the wealthy ones who thus insisted on having the best . But she replied , it was not always so ; there were quite poor people who would buy nothing but the very best in the market ; though even the smallest had the genuine strawberry-flavor , yet persons who really could not afford it did not hesitate to take the largest , at the highest price : the appearance , not the flavor of the fruit , seemed to regulate this . She remarked , that the extravagance of some families in thus indulging themselves was to her very surprising . But among the several classes of consumers all kinds were readily disposed of , the result being that she never had an overstock ,  --  and there need be no apprehension on my part , therefore , of not finding a market , and at good prices , for all I could raise , no matter what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the more people there were who got a taste of good fruit , the more freely they would consume it . Her great regret was that the strawberry-season did not extend over the whole year . On my suggesting , that , if such a thing could be brought about , there would be danger of the public becoming tired of them ,  --  " XVhat ! " she exclaimed , with animation , " tired of strawberries. ? Do n't distress yourself too soon . Strawberries are a thing of which the public have never yet had a surfeit . " All this was exceedingly encouraging to me , and I made a full report at home of wh*it I had thus learned . I was rejoiced at being able to carry out my plan in spite of our ill-natured neighbors . Besides this , the conversation referred to showed us that their pretence of my wanting to ruin their business by raising strawberries was only a piece of 1865.1 // mean and unreasonable jealousy , - that there was no real likelihood of such an event occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very probable , however , that it was from pure ill-temper that they refused to sell me any plants , an unwillingness to see us do well , not from any apprehension of an overstocking of the market ; as long experience must have taught them , equally with the market - woman , that that was a comparative impossibility . There were various impediments to be overcome , even after ascertaining that we were sure of selling all we could produce . Those who are experienced in horticulture will smile at my simplicity and ibnorance , and wonder how so many difficulties beset me . But even they must have had some sort of probat*on , which they overlook when reading this history of mine . We are all , at some period , mere beginners in everything . There were hundreds of visitors to our neighbor 's garden who had never seen a strawberry-plant until then . When mine were fairly started , I witnessed the same display of ibnorance in others who came to visit us . Some ladies , occasionally gentlemen even , supposed the vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like cherries . It is possible that this may be read by some gentle spirit , some anxious inquirer after a brighter pathway through a checkered life , some one of my own sex whose aspirations may be in harmony with mine , and whose fortunes may have b'een infinitely more unpropitious , in the hope of gathering from my humble experience sufficient light to guide her in a similar undertaking . I doubt not there are thousands in our country whose tastes would lead them in the same direction , did opportunity offer , and were the requisite knowledge at hand . I therefore record all the trials that impeded my progress . XVhen difficulties are known beforehand , they may often be avoided . I was unwilling to lose a day from the factory by walking several miles into the country to visit the man who supplied my friendly market-woman with strawberries , and from whom the plants were to come . But while waiting for him to bring them in , together with the information I desired as to how and when to plant them , an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of strawberry-culture . I had gone with my mother , one Saturday evening , to a neighboring grocery for certain articles we needed ; and while standing at the counter , awaiting our turn to be served , a boy came in with a large bundle of old newspapers fer sale as wrappers , placing it on the counter directly beside me . Casting my eye upon it , I noticed that the outside paper bore the title of " The New England Farmer . " I then examined the bunble , untied it , and found that there were many numbers of the same journal , and underneath these a collection of " The Country Gentleman . " I had never seen an agricultural paper before , though our little penny daily did occasionally contain extracts from some of them . I became immediately interested . The thought struck me that this bundle of old papers , now about to be used for such ignoble purposes as wrappers for groceries , must contain stores of the very information I was so laboriously seeking after . Hastily turning them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how to plant and how to cultivate them . " I was fairly dipping into it , when my mother , giving me a nudge , told me she was ready to go . But it was far otherwise with roe , and 1 began bargaining with the boy for his bundle . That matter was soon concluded , as the grocer declined buying ; so I took them at a few cents a pound . They came to nearly a dollar , but I had my week 's wages in my pocket , and am certain that I never made an investment so cheerfully , nor any , considering the amount , that was half so useful to me as this . Buying knowledge by the pound was quite a new idea with me . I lugged the bundle home myself and went into an examination of its contents with the utmost enthusiasm . Indeed , the whole family shared it with me , so that we were up till nearly midnight engaged // in looking after articles treating of the subject then uppermost in our minds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivators of the strawberry , with a mass of information on all matters pertaining to fruits and flowers . It took us a whole week to obtain any tolerable idea of the contents , as our evenings only could be spared for reading . The variety of experiences related was rather confusing , - one writer telling how he had failed altogether , though pursuing the very system under which another had had great success . There were all kinds of theories , and probably all kinds of practice . One grower declared that the ground must be made extremely rich , while another asserted positively that strawberries grew better and bore more abundantly on the poorest soil . One gentleman averred that the only profitable plan was to raise the plants in distinct hills , keeping them clear of runners ; some one in the next paper denied this , and vowed that he made more money by crowding his ground with all the plants that could find room upon it to take root . I remember one correspondent who said that letting the weeds grow would kill the strawberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor , that , in his opinion , the strawberries rather liked the weeds , because they shaded the ground . How was it possible for me to discriminate between these contradictory statements , - all made , moreover , by gentlemen who wrote as if each were in himself a complete horticultural encyclopa*dia ? Though utterly confused by them , and , quite at a loss to know which plan of cultivation to adopt , yet one fact seemed very prominent , and that was that any person who was at all careful in keeping his ground mellow and reasonably clear of weeds would be sure to have good crops . What str*uck me as a little remarkable in this voluminous record of experience and opinion was the circumstance of there being very few female writers on the subject . There were 57 many who wrote quite eloquently on the culture of flowers , but only two or three who appeared to have cultivated strawberries . Yet there were several accounts of wonderful coverlets which some of them had made , containing many thousands of pieces ; with probably one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluding that this latter feat was only labor thrown away , and that elderly ladies who undertake to produce counterpanes and bedspreads with so much superfluous work upon them should be provided with a sewing-machine . It was not very encouraging to observe that so small a share of female attention had been directed to the strawberry - culture . The only recorded efforts of this kind had been made in gardens , where the beds , after being planted , were attended to by the women of the family . It appeared that they could r*adily keep everything in order , pull out the weeds , gather the fruit ; and though the fact was not mentioned , yet I presume they were able to put in a full oar when it came upon the table . One or two cases were related of young girls having made quite a handsome sum from a small gardenbed . But the general testimony went to prove that strawberry - growing was so simple an art that any woman who had sufficient good sense to keep herself tidy could successfully practise it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I concluded , therefore , that the true reason why women had not engaged more extensively in this employment was because no one had taken pains to call their attention to it . There was one branch of the subject which it was difficult to understand exactly . Almost every person who wrote about strawberries seemed to have the best variety that had ever been known or heard of . This was especially noticeable in the statements of those who bad plants to sell . After reading one advertisement , I felt satisfied that the particular fruit therein described was what I ought to have . But on examining the next announcement , I was con- // founded at learning that there was a still better kind . So it ran through probably half a dozen : every one was best . Indeed , there appeared to be no inferior strawberry - plants for sale . I had no friend to consult with who could explain this iemarkable state of things ; and being thus left in doubt as to whether there was really any merit in plants thus extravagantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way would be to let them all go , and adopt some well-established kind , that was known to be a sure bearer , and which could be had at a moderate price , leaving the costly novelties to be patronized by those who had more money to spare . In two or three of these florid descriptions of new varieties I observed that great stress was laid on the enormous size of the fruit , as well as their unequalled productiveness ; but there was no mention of quality : what that was appeared to be studiously suppressed . An orange may be as large as a pumpkin ; but if it be proportionably coarse and flavorless , one would conclude , that , the greater the size , the less desirable the fruit . It was important for me to begin right ; so , abandoning these new and costly varieties , I determined to have something nearer home , about whose value there could be no doubt . I was to produce fruit for the public , not for our own private use , and therefore must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undervalue the great horticultural novelties of the day , merely because I was unable to purchase , or because others were evidently realizing great sums by first originating them , and then spreading their merits before the world , though sometimes in extravagant terms . The world must have been waiting for them , or they could not have become so suddenly popular . And the painstaking horticulturist would not have devoted years of patient care and watchfulness , exercising a consummate skill in stimulating Nature to the production of a better plant , a more gorgeous flower , or a more luscious fruit , had he not known that there was a waiting public , ever ready to reward his skill and perseverance by extensive purchases at liberal prices . It is to this certainty of generous remuneration that we are indebted for nearly all the great and truly valuable novelties with which the horticultural world has been supplied . A rose , with tints unknown a century ago , has proved a stepping-stone to the discoverer 's fortune . The skilful propagator of new or rare verbenas has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tulip is an historical monument of floral enthusiasm . When Mexico was opened to Northern enterprise , it yielded of its boundless exuberance the cactus and the dahlia , sources of untold wealth to those florists who ministered to the popular taste for Nature 's richest productions . The originator of a new and valuable grape has found in it a fortune . Accident has sometimes been productive of equally remunerative results . A solitary berry , growing in the tangled hedge - row of an abandoned field , has been the foundation of an independence . The history of horticulture abounds in instances akin to these . The enthusiasts who produced or discovered such novelties have conferred inestimable benefits on the world . The originator of the Albany seedling strawberry unquestionably added ' threefold to the quantity of that surpassingly delicious fruit . He devoted years of patient care and watchfulness to a nursery containing thousands of seedlings , of which one only was found to be worthy of cultivation . And if he had his reward , he was well entitled to it . He has given us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously produced , - superior in the elements of commercial value , particularly in a productiveness so far surpassing that of any of its predecessors as to establish it as the standard by which every subsequent competitor must be estimated . It has spread over every section of our vast country , taking kindly to every variety of soil find climate , covering with its robust foliage many thousands of acres , producing tens of thousands of bushels of fruit , crowding our markets with abundant supplies , and // producing profits to its cultivators such as no other strawberry has evef yielded . As a market berry it was quickly recognized as being unsurpassed , nor have its numerous modern rivals been yet able to shake its strong hold upon the public favor . I know - at least my reading has taught me - that there are multitudes of recent candidates for popularity , claiming to be far superior to this , all struggling to displace the old-time favorite . I am unable - there at leastto discuss their several merits , and therefore dismiss the novelties I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved . We knew it was by means of this prolific berry that our neighbors , so disagreeable to us , were making themselves so popular . It was the variety sold by my widow in the i*Thrket . Its character as a fruit for the million being thus established , we adopted it without hesitation . My agricultural journals told me how many plants were to be put upon an acre , what were to be the distances apart , when to set them , with other particulars as to the mode of cultivation . But one of the most important facts taught me by my little library was that I could set the plants in the fall as advantageously as in the spring . This would give me a great start . I learned that in the two last autumn months , the temperature of the earth being higher than that of the air , the former would act as a sort of forcing-house , stimulating the growth and expansion of the roots , so that before winter set in they would become so firmly established as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to give me quite a handsome crop the succeeding summer . There was nothing to do , then , but to procure the plants and get them in . Fred undertook to have the ground broken up and put in complete order for me ,  --  that is , half an acre . We were not able to spare money enough to buy more plants , but intended to fill up the other half-acre from the runners that would be thrown out the following summer . I knew that our ill-natured 59 neighbors had thrown away more plants than I needed , which they could have given to me without being themselves any the poorer . But perhaps I ought not to indulge in reproachful reminiscences of this kind . Still , it is difficult for one who never feels a selfish wish to understand how others can be so differently constituted . If such people would only for once indulge in the luxury of doin a really kind action , I am inclined to think they would be tempted into many repetitions of it . But it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground by depending on myself letting others pursue their own way . The rows were struck out only three feet apart , and the plants were set a foot asunder in the rows . This was not too close for our little garden culture , though it may be much too crowded for large fields . I was anxious to have as much fruit as possible on a small surface , intending to keep the runners from overspreading the ground . This desire for a great crop is the common anxiety of most fruit-growers , especially of beginners , and I think is frequently the cause of those failures that so often happen to them . My sister and I took a holiday from the factory and went to planting . My mother also did her full share of the labor . With such novfces , it was of course very slow work , and employed us two or three days . Very soon the neighbors stopped , as they were passing the half-latticed garden-gate , and looked in to see what we were about . This neighborly curiosity is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what is going on either next door or in the opposite house . I confess to a weakness of that sort myself . Hence we took no offence , even when there was quite a crowd looking in . When it was ascertained that we were planting strawberries , great surprise was manifested , and all kinds of remarks were made . Had we been planting potatoes , it would have been all right , as every family that had a little patch of ground in that neighborhood raised // potatoes , though they paid no profit , while only one - the Tetchys - cultivated strawberries , which afforded a very handsome profit . I think it must have been the novelty of seeing women thus occupied that occasioned much of the surprise . Before noon of the first day the whole Tetchy family crowded up to the gate and stood there a long time observing our movements . Their quick ears had been among the first to catch the news . They tried the latch , but Jane had locked the gate , determined that not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could do was to indulge in a variety of ill-natured remarks . " I knew that was what they were after ! " said Mrs. Tetchy to her husband , in a voice that was intended for us to hear . But we kept our backs to them , taking no notice of what they said . " Another strawberry-garden , I suppose ! " exclaimed the daughter , Miss Annabella Tetchy , who had not yet had the good luck to change her ugly name . " Cream , too , no doubt ! " added Tetchy himself , in a tone so insulting that I thought it unworthy of one calling himself a man . These provoking taunts continued until the spiteful family appeared to have either relieved themselves or grown tired of having the cold shoulder of a profound contempt all the time turned toward them . It was a very hard thing for me to bear this malicious insolence . I could have retorted keenly on them by some plain insinuation touching their iron-tailed cow , of which they probably thought that no one but themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining silence . These little private vexations were about all that we encountered during the whole progress of our strawberryplanting . The neighbors , with the ex July , ception of the Tetchys , having no particular interest as to how we got along or whether we got along at all , very soon ceased to take any notice of what we were doing . The novelty of the new enterprise died away as speedily , for the season at least , as if we had been sowing turnips . Under the fine October weather , the plants quickly took root , and went on growing so vigorously that some of them even put out an occasional i-unner . But these were immediately clipped off , as sure to impair the vigor of the plant , which could now support no extraneous offshoots . There were some plants , however , that apparently stood still , refusing to grow , while Qthers died out entirely . But casualties of this sort are always to he expected . They occur with old hands at strawberry-planting , and beginners must not think to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I watched this work of my own hands so closely , being up and in the garden long before breakfast , that I think the very shape and position of every plant came to be imprinted on my memory . I know that I could detect the changes that took place in the look of each particular pet . I thought of them when operating the treadle of my sewing-machine at the factory , and I hurried home more expeditiously than aforetime , to enjoy even the brief autumn twilight among my strawberries . I sometimes even dreamed of them on my pillow . Now my agricultural library became far more intere*ting and useful than before . I had had a touch of real , actual practice , and could already understand and appreciate many suggestions which had heretofore been of doubtful significancy . Thus the long winter came gradually in , closing up the great volume of vegetable life , but affording me abundant time for studying that other volume which had so singularly fallen in my way . Needle and Garden .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
