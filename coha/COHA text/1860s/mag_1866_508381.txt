When I had arranged all according to my plans and wishes I came . To-night I have been telling Mrs. Livingstone onr story , and she is waiting to welcome you as my betrothed . " Mrs. Livingstone was an unspoiled woman of fashion-her heart as warm to lovers ' hopes as in her earliest youth . Her own marriage had been so entirely happy that at fifty she was capable of enthusiasm , of friendship , of generosity . She received her former seamstress , whom she had always liked and trusted , at once to the position of a family friend - superintended the hurried preparations for her marriage , and wished her joy on her bridal morning . And joy came . Does it not come , I wonder , to all who bear discipline patiently , and learn of sorrow the lessons she is sent to teach ? If we are obstinate , and will not heed our teacher , we may have still to con the bard task all our lives-who knows how many lives more ? They bad been married four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . She found out one day , when they took a long car ride , and stopped at last at Pentonville Station , and she rode across country with her husband in the evening twilight , as she had ridden in the morning twilight with her father nine years before . They drove through ways growing constantly more familiar and stopped at last before an old brown house with a hill rising behind it , its summit touched with the lingering glow of sunset . Meadows sloped greenly to the eastward-farm lands stretched into the south , and at the gate stood Job Lee and his wife , ready to bid the master and mistress welcome . " There , Olive , " said the husband , tenderly , " this is my bridal present , which I have waited until now to offer you . When my father died this place was still unsold  --  the property of the Company . I bought it , and paid enough for it to cover all the loss they had sustained . I have succeeded well enough in my ch*sen calling not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in Perry can say now that he lost any thing by our father . " " Our father ! " She understood by those words how be was taking up all her burdens and bearing them for her , assuming even the shadow of her disgrace and turning darkness into day . Her heart was too full for any words ; but he did not miss the thanks which her fastfalling tears would not let her utter . THOMAS CARLYLE has a theory that the word club , as applied to a social assembly , is the relic , " in a singularly dwindled condition , " of the vow or oath of the famous chivalric associations of six and seven centuries since . But we learn from a pleasant paper in the New York Evening Post that Mr. John Timhs of London has written a sprightly book about clubs , in which he disputes Carlyle 's assertion . The sly satire of Carlyle is very characteristic . The lounger in the reading-room or the great window of a London club is so sharp a contrast to the fiery Templar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in pointing bun out . " So , " we can imagine him saying , " the heroic soldier of religion has come to this , a dandy bored to death and yawning in a highly-upholstered parlor over the poetry of Sir Pelham Bulwer ! " His derivation of " club " must have been a huge delight to the philosopher of Chelsea . And yet his own parlor in which he sits enthroned and discourses to admiring pilgrims drawn from all parts of the world to his doors , is exactly a club like Will 's in which Addison reigned supreme . The fine house is an accident . The Divinity is as present in the shabbiest shed as in the towering cathedral . Besides , Carlyle should remember that if the gilded youth smoking idly in a London drawingroom are poor representatives of Ivanhoe or Richard of the Lion Heart , and if Godfrey of Boulogne would have regarded an elegant habitud of the Reform , or the Oxford and Cambridge , or the Atheneum or the Carlton , with very much the same feeling that Guiliver looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those sm*me drawing-rooms and airy listlessness came the young soldiers who rode at Bala-klava " Into the jaws of death , Into the month of hell . " The stoutest heart does not always beat under the coarsest cloth . Noblesse oblige is one of the sayings which have a spiritual meaning ; for essential nobleness obliges to heroism and generosity , and it is a rule of counterfeits to imitate nature as closely as possible . Thus the paste gentleman imitates conitesy and ludicrously imitates honor . In the conduct and bearing of the people who are vulgarly called gentlemen , but who have no gentleness of soul , we constantly see the travesty of the nobleman or noble man . Then also some characters are mixed , like ore in which veins of pure gold and sheer earth alternate . But the grim Chelsea moralist allows less and less for human nature , and when he looks in at the windows of a club and sees the fashions of to-day , he does not also see the ancient virtue behind them , which is yet there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blind . " This is a club , is it ? " says that rich , melancholy voice , with the Scotch burr upon the tongue ; " this is the outcome of the Knights Templars and Hospitallers ? Ah , yes ; in a singularly dwindled condition . " New York maintains her increasing fame and character as a metropolis by her increasing clubs . The loiterer on Broadway of twcnty-five and thirty years ago , who remembers the modest mansion just below Franklin Street in which the Union Club had its rendezvous , would be amazed and lost could he be introduced to the many and splendid clubs which are now scattered through the finest parts of the city . Like all the great clubs of Europe they have each a special character , and since the war there are for the first time true political clubs ; like the " Beefsteak " and the " October " of Swift 's time in Lou . don . Ilitherto in this country we had slmown the // crudity of our civilization by banning politics in society , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to bear upon the purification of politics . If the man who is in habitual league and collusion with corrupt and ignorant men , with bullies and blacklegs , for the purpose of securing political results , is to be received with the same cordiality by honorable men and women as those who are of their own kind , the severest penalty of his infamous conduct is evaded . And this was formerly the result , it was evaded . But when the political differences festered into civil war , it became quite impossible for a man to enjoy the society of another who was openly favoring by sympathy , if not secretly aiding with material , the slaughter of his sons and brothers . It was absolutely necessary for the morality of the nation that those who differed upon the merits of a struggle which involved every thing sacred and precious should not affect a feeling which it was monstrous to entertain . Consequently political lines were drawn with a precision never before thought of . The old Union Club , in the city of New York , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary of the rebellion , was directing the guns which destroyed the sons of other members of the club , and the Loyal League Club was at once established , the cardinal condition of membership being unswerving fidelity to the national cause . The Century , which had unanimously elected as President a venerable scholar and lover of art and friend of artists , but whose sympathies were adverse to the great cause , perceived the enormity of suffering itself to be represented to strangers by such a chief ; thereby inevitably giving the world the impression that the war was a superficial quarrel of politicians instead of the life-struggle of a nation , and removed him from his position . In all such cases it was idle to plead the comity of clubs , and the most tragical folly to urge that politics should not poison society . It is easy to imagine Mr. Webster and Mr. Hayne , after their great debate in the Capitol , pleasantly descending the steps and dining together . But it is impossible to fancy Joseph Warren or Samuel Adams dining with General Gage while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s are purely speculative and are maintained in good temper social intercourse is possible . But when the debate storms into shot and shell it is impracticable to take wine together . The French officers in a famous battle are reported to have said to their antagonists , " Gentlemen , if you please , fire first ! " But it was not their quarrel . Their position was merely perfunctory . It is only those who are fighting ex officio who risk any thing upon a point of politeness . It is amusing to observe how long and how carefully we strove to avoid giving any political school in this country the intrenebment of a social club . It is amusing , because we were doing the very thing that we played we were not doing . The whole club force of society in New York was really tacitly directed against liberal opinions and reforms , and it was probably so in other cities . The under current in the club which refused to expel Judah Benjamin in 1861 was indicated twenty years before when it blackballed John Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal , anti-American theories which culminated in civil war , because they are essentially hostile to the inevitable development of this country . The Easy Chair recalls a dinner at Newport , fifteen years ago , at which a Senator from the South was the guest of honor . The conversation at table gradually lurched toward the inevitable topic , and we were edified with the most anxious and earnest praises of the Southern " institution . " Yet such was the ascendency of that view that it was considered impolite at a gentleman 's table for a man to vindicate the rights of humanity ; and those who did not agree with what was saidand so far as manner was concerned , not uncourteously-by the chief guest , sat in a smiling imbecilitv of silence . Was it surprising that those who found it easy to padlock our mouths supposed that it would not be hard to have their way in all things ? This social cowardice was one of the symptoms of national demoralization . If every gentleman and every lady at Saratoga and Newport , and at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed their real sentiments , some vast miscalculations would have been saved . The eyes are very blind which do not see that the future welfare of this country depends upon the fullest freedom of tongue and pen . Mr. Pollard , of Richmond , should he chance to read this , would naturally inquire , " Why , then , does General Grant silence my paper ? " Because of martial law . When you appealed to the sword you consented to abide by the law of the sword , and that does not allow perfect liberty of speech and pen . Had you trusted to the tongue and pen the sword could not have imposed its law . The value of a political club in our " society " is this , that it invests with a visible social dignity and importance views which many young men naturally hold and approve at a time when every decoration of " respectable " consideration is most powerful . If they find opinions superbly lodged and fited , drinking the choicest wines , and girt with the blandishments of beauty , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the temptation is very strong to adopt them . An opinion which carries a cotton umbrella and dines cheaply in a cellar is not seductive to youth . The establishment of political clubs is a sign of the greater manhood of the country which the war has developed . They give every opinion the aid of every influence , and destroy the social glamour with which old feudal injustice and Toryism have hitherto so skillfully surrounded themselves . They promote that independence which in this country has been sadly lacking . Ix Dickens 's All the Year Round young Chesterfield writes letters to his papa . It is a sign of the times . Punch represents a paterfamilias coming into his bedroom at four in the morning after a part ) ' . His young son of eight is sitting upon his bed , dressed , and kicking his heels . The astonished parent exclaims : " Why , how 's this , Reginald ? Not in bed yet ? It 's nearly four o'clock ! You should have been asleep hours ago ! " " Haw ! And pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another sign of the times . Such a cut would have bad no significance or humor a century ago . The little people were put to bed . They had not yet invaded the social domain of the elders . Look in any print of that period , read any novel of the time , and you find it is the parents and not the children who constitute society . We have changed all that somewhat . At thirty men retire from " society ; " at forty women are called " old . " " Society " is the perpetual target of satire . But it sweeps on , unconscious . It has certain distinctlye // attributes recognized in all countries and times . When it comes to marrying , you know , why ' that 's But it is in old countries , where the machinery plays another matter . Girls of my set , and educated as with perfect ease , that it is pleasantest . The bloom we are , are not meant for poor men 's wives . But of that fruit is ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we should not waltz with and cultivation . It is , meanwhile , a fact that we poor men if they . dance well . " try to make money do the whole work of society , and our success is not brilliant . Here , for instance , is a note from a pleasant good fellow , whose name we will hide under the alias of Pearl Gray . " DEAR EASY CsAsa ,  --  What is to be done ? Whither are we drifting ? I echo Governor Foote 's remarks in his late interesting book upon the war , published in Franklin Square , 0 my country ! O tempora , 0 mores ! ' The case is this : If you have ever been to a ball in the selecter circles you know that there is a culmination of felicity called The German . ' If you do n't dance the German , what on earth do you go to a ball for ? I do dance the German , and bad luck to me next morning at half past seven when I tumble out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office by nine o'clock . I am a clerk , you know , and clerks are not millionaires . Yet once in a way I like to send a bouquet to the reigning Queen of my soul , when I know that I am to dance with her in the German , although I ca n't often do it . Naturally we who go almost everynight to a ball and meet the same girls , engage our partners from evening to evening . But as Shoddy and Petroleum will haveit , the fellows belonging to those families always send superb bouquets to the girls they engage in a dance for partners ; and the rest of us know it , and what is the consequence ? Simply that if I want to dance with Fairy Snowflake , for instance ( and who would n't ? ) , I know that if she promises me I can not send her a bouquet , and yet I cut her off from accepting Sam Shoddy who can . So I refrain ; I do not ask her . For why should I be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much girls enjoy carrying them ; and what perfumed weapons of offense they are ! No , Sir . It has become a habit to do this thing , and Pearl Gray , for one , dances fewer Germans , and contemplates retiring from society . I confide the fact to you , begging your advice . " The Easy Chair has no advice to give . Master Pearl Gray shall hear the counsel of a pleasanter Mentor . Will he please read these lines from Fairy Snowflake herself ? " What foolish fellows young men are , my good friend , the Easy Chair ! Do they really suppose that we prefer pretty flowers to good partners ? I am speaking of dancing , you rdinember , you wick-. ed man ! and not of life-partners . That is annther point , and upon that I imitate Pa and reserve my decision ! But there is Pearl Gray , a capital partner and an agreeable man . He knows that he dances well , lie knows that I like to dance with him , and yet because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not promised . and send me a bouquet , which Gray could not do , he holds aloof . Now , in what position does he leave me ? I must either not dance , or take the best fellow who comes along , or I must wait for the chance of Sam Shoddy ; and even if he asks me , I do n't care to dance with him , bouquet or no bouquet . I wish men like Pearl Gray would understand that dancing is dancing , and that I and all other girls at a ball want good dancers and agreeable partners . We are not so enamored of bouquets as he seems to imagine ; and if you conveniently can , I wish , in a general way , you would make him understand it . If Mr. Pearl Gray accepts this philosophy , let him be comforted . It is rather hard ; but there is much truth in it . It is , for so delicate and dainty a little lady , fearfully coarse and mercenary , and Miss Fairy Snowflake must not be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we be surprised that fire melts ? Why should it shock us that a pupil of the school of money should think and live money ? If Miss Fairy is a good partner in the waltz and pleasant withal , our advice to Mr. Pearl Gray is to engage her for the next German . But we do not advise him to engage her for life . Can he not enjoy a dance with her even if he is not to marry her ? Does he really wish to marry her , if he knows the reason why she thinks it impossible ? THE Boston Transcript says truly that when the two parties in our late civil war begin to " poke fun " at each other the clouds are really beginning to clear . We may indeed now believe that the feeling of contempt at least is eliminated , and upon this point we may let by-gones be by-gones . The somewhat popular theory in one part of the country , that the people of the other were windy Gascons breathing fire and fury merely , and the equally popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell their souls for sixpence , and **ere only tuppenny tinkers - whatever tuppenny tinkers may be - are both finally exploded . The soldiers upon either . side during the war do not accuse the other of cowardice . The shock was fierce and prolonged because it was a collision ' of the same general stock and quality . If we are to live together  --  and it is tolerably clear that we are-it will be henceforth a very unnecessary and uncomfortable business to look at each other for the sole purpose of sneering and bickering . Nothing could be more utterly contemptible than to persist in systematic depreciation . Alienation , bitterness of feeling , sore remembrance , we must all count upon for some time yet . No nation can be torn up by the roots and not show sad signs of the convulsion for many and many a day . But the necessity of good feeling for healing our ghastly wounds need not encourage a mean reticence or cowardice . The purer the air the sounder the human system that breathes it , and the freer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation that trusts it . If we had all guarded freedom of discussion and of the press as the very heart of our whole political system , as in every free Government it is , we should have escaped how many and many a national sorrow ! Henceforth let our battles be new battles , or new forms of the old one , for the contest of every nation is essentially the same . It is the struggle of Whig and Tory ; of Liberal and Conservative . It was the fate of this country that certain sections corresponded to the conflict of ideas . That is always a misfortune in a free Government , for it is desirable that the contest shall be kept as exclusively as possible in the intellectual arena . There it will be henceforward in this country . We shall be divided by sentiments not by systems , and our differences will be such as the tongue and the pen can most wisely settle . // It is the Petersburg ( Virginia ) Index thAt gives the following thrust at the Yankees .

" NEAR the pleasant little city of Poughkeepsie there is one of the noble monuments which true patriotism , generosity , and wealth are building all over the country . It is the Vassar Female College , munificently founded and amply endowed by Matthew Vassar , a citizen of Poughkeepsie ; and a visit to it , although the way lies along the muddiest of Dutchess County roads , and the day is one of the brown and leafless February days , is yet one of the incidents which will not be forgotten , especially if your cicerone be not only a trustee of the college , but a noted and faithful brother of the pen . The long street that brings the railway traveler to the heart of the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , past the closely-built houses gradually raveling out into loose suburbs , and then pushes by the straggling outskirts into the fields , and so goes across the county to the Connecticut line . Floundering out upon this miry highway for about two miles , it was agreeable to turn sharp to the right and proceed by a pretty lane between the fields . The immediate country is very level , but fine ranges of hills break the horizon , and the Catskill Mountains are piled nobly against the northwest . In a little while you see a huge pile standing back from the road on the left , and know at once that it is the college . The building was designed by Mr. Renwick , and 661 is generally modeled upon the Tuileries . It is solid and spacious , but a little unrelieved and heavy-almost gloomy , indeed , as you come nearer . . The observatory lies to the northeast , and riding-schools and gymnasiums are now building a little in the rear of the college at the southeast . The area of ground is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear by a picturesque ravine ; and in front , across the road , is a pleasant grove with a pond which , self-supplied by springs , supplies the building with water . The grounds immediately around the college are newly planted with rows of evergreens along the road . The view is purely rural ; a broad and gentle landscape with the Hudson highlands in the south , and the hills beyond the river and the Catskill to the west and northwest . The building broadly based stands tranquilly hi the spacious area ; and a ludicrous sense of contrast with monkish Oxford sweeps across your mind as you drive under the lofty gateway into the grounds and make straight for the door . The entrance is not imposing , and a wooden sign over the door , " M. Vassar , Founder , " is so shocking to good taste and propriety , so utterly incongruous and improper , as if it were a shop-sign , that you are hardly prepared for the plain elegance that greets you with the opening door . A long , broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet from north to south . There are three main floors with a basement and cellar . The corridor in the two upper stories is brilliantly lighted by western windows , and out of it open little parlors , each of which connects with three chambers . In the parlor the occupants of the chambers study and sew and read . The rooms are neatly and prettily furnished . The chapel stretches eastward from the main building , and is entered upon the floor from the second main floor , and the gallery opens upon the third floor . Behind the chapel , and separated by its entire length from the rooms of the students , are twenty or thirty small rooms , each large enough to contain one square Steinway piano , and there , shut up to her own instrument , each pupil can practice nudisturbing and undisturbed . It is a curious jangle of sound as you emerge from the rear door of the chapel . Under the chapel is the dining-room , full of sun and air , with ranges of tables for eight or ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feast were being rapidly removed when we entered the hall . But drawn by what sweet attraction-it was not wine-sauce nor gooseberry-foolwe eagerly pushed through , following the vanishing fumes of the banquet , passing the shining silver pantry , the neat dish pantry , the aromatic spicecloset , the shelves of bread as spongy yet firm as the ambrosia of the celestial kitchens , advancing and advancing , until we came upon , the upper kitchen , where in huge hot ovens the dinner is dished , and upon huge hot iron tables the meats are carved . But still pursuing the ultimate crucible in which the pleasant feast was wrought , we descended beneath the dishing and carving kitchen , and there beheld the arcane of the cook , and saw the rosy genius of " grub " - if the base slang of mere men-colleges and commons may be here tolerated-presiding with a stirring-stick over a vast steaming caldron of golden mush . In this retreat , usually so remote and inaccessible to strange and visiting eyes  --  and upon which we had come without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savory , and the sitter at the snug tables need not have feared to probe his dinner to the last . The cooking process is by steam , as in the great metropolitan hotels . Beyond the kitchen we opened into the laundry , a realm of many rooms , with smoothing machines , and drying closets , and ironing boards , and heaps and hills and mountains of snowy wear , with convenient pigeonholes , and a bland , systematic matron who looked upon a book and reported five thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine " pieces " in the present wash . Some seventy " domestics " fulfill the household cares of this fair family of three hundred and fifty pupils . Beneath the laundry is the cellar ; the crypts in which the coils and lengths of steam-pipes are hidden , and where in a warm corner the portly baker with his plump hand swiftly scoops bright dough in equal portions from the wooden dish , and pats them kindly on the head in the iron tray which slides into the enormous oven and emerges full of puffy pound-cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie by the thousand near , and we taste the happy cates destined to such choice consumption . There are sixteen miles of steam-pipe in the college building , supplied from a house many rods in the rear in which the gas is made ; and in which are the only fires of the vast building . Twelve hundred tons of coal fed those fires during the winter , and there was no need of any fire whatever in the main building . As we wound our way upward through the halls toward the picture-gallery and library there were groups of the students passing up and down the spacious staircases , lingering and loitering in laughing talk , with learned books clasped under their arms . They leaned twittering over the railings . They glided with demure smoothness as they caught the grave eye of a venerable Regent of the University who attended us upon our rounds . But so blithe and fair a picture no American college ever before left in memory . Indeed he was so charmed with every aspect that the venerable Regent , in a gush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten to ask one most important question-whether Professor Blot has classes in the College ? In the quiet observatory , in a parlor cheerful and elegant , the fortunate visitor may find the Professor , whose name is already famed and honored , Miss Mitchell . There she lives with her father , teaching and observing , and a perpetual illustration of the accomplishment which is supposed to be peculiar to the other sex . It seemed to be May as we sat talking or stood by the telescope . The sun shone bright . The air was balmy . " Why , this is the Princess , ' " said the venerable Regent , as we descended the steps- " we have been to the Poet 's College . " THE tales of the old mythology have an imperishable charm . Their chastening music still breathes through the newest song . While Byron was pouring out his passionate , intensely modern , and half insincere strain , Keats touched the stop of pure Greek melody , which will sound longer than Byron 's . Among the latest books are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meleager , told with a mechanical Greek propriety - and the poems of Robert Buchanan , a friend of David Gray , and an expert in the felicities of diction . A large part of his volume is filled with mythological themes , which are treated with great skill and facility ; but they still seem only the very finished studies of an accomplished artist . One of them , " Ades , King of Hell , " is Pluto 's own story of his wooing in the vale of Enna , and the poem has a rich gloom that fits the tale . But a friend sends us a little poem upon the same general theme , touched in another and a novel key . It seems to us very melodious and beautiful , and to move with fine passionate feeling . PROSERPINA ON EARTH TO PLUTO IN HADES . " Nec repitita eequi caret Proserpina matrem . " Georgica , lib . I.

On the 19th of February the four following resolutions , introduced by Mr. Longyear , were passed by the majorities appended to each : " Resslred , That in the language of the proclamation of the President of May 29 , 1865 , the rebellion which was waged by a portion of the people of the United States against the properly constituted authorities of the Government thereof in the moot violent and revolting form , but whose armed and organized forces have now been almost entirely overcome , ' has in the revolutionary progress deprived the people of the States in which it was organized of all civil government2 ' - ( Passed , 102 to 36 . ) " Resolved , Whenever the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it becomes the duty of Congress by appropriate legislation to enable them to organize a State Government , and in the language of the Constitution to guarantee to each State a republican form of government . " - ( Passed , 104 to 33 . ) " Resolved , That it is the deliberate sense of this House that the condition of the rebel States fully justifies the President in maintaining the suspension of the writ of habees corpus in these States . " - ( Passed , 117 to 29 . ) " Resolved , That it is the deliberate sense of this I-louse that the condition of the rebel States fully justifies the President in maintaining military possession and control therein , and that the President is entitled to the thanks of the nation for employing the war power for time protection of the Union citizens and the freedmen in those States . " - ( Passed , 114 to 8 . ) I languish for the late autumnal showers , The cool , cool plashing of the autumn rain , The shimmering hoar-frost and fast-fading flowers That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no native land from thee apart , And my high heaven of heavens is in thy heart . On the 20th Mr. Stevens , from the Committee on Reconstruction , introduced the following resolution , which was passed by a vote of 109 to 40 : " Resolved , That In order to close agitation upon a question which seems likely to disturb the action of the Government , as well as to quiet the uncertainty which is agitating the nainds of the people of the eleven States whaich laave been declared in insunection , no Senator or Representative shall be admitted into either branch of Congress from any of the said States , until Congress shall have declared such States entitled to such representation2 THE FINANCIAL CONDITION . On the 21st the Loan Bill came up for discussion . This authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to convert obligations not bearing interest , and also to dispose of Government bonds either in America or Europe , for the purpose only of retiring other obligations , but not for any increase of the public debt . Mr. Stevens proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the bill , as it stood , placed sixteen hundred and forty-four millions of dollars at the absolute control of the Secretary of the Treasury . Mr. Ilooper , speaking in favor of the bill , presented an elaborate exposition of the financial condition of the Government , the leading points of which we reproduce : " According to the estimates of the Treasury Department , and this results of the first half of this fiscal year , the revenue of the Government from the existing system of taxation , and from other sources , will not be less thoan $500,000,000 ; while the annual expenditures for the fiscal year ending the 30th June , 1867 , including time interest on the public debt , is $284,311,181 88 . It is apparent , tImersfore , that the present rates of taxation will , under any circumstances , yield an amount of revenue much In excess of what is necessary to secure the amount required for the ordinary expenses of the Government , the interest on the public debt , and a reasonable appropriation for its extinguishment within the lifetinme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this taxation . " - Mr . Hooper thus summed up the terms of our debt on 1st January , 1866 : Bonds , the principal and Interest pay able in gold $1,120,786,700 00 Legal tender Government notes , including the fractional currency , not bear ing interest 452,231,810 37 Seven and three-tenths Treasury notes payable in three years , . and convertible at maturity into six percent . bonds .. 830,000,000 00 Legal tender compound interest Treasury notes , bearing interest payable with the principal three years from date .. 188549,041 00 Certificates of indebtedness , payable one year from date , with interest 60,667,000 00 Certificates of deposit of temporary loans , payable withi interest on demand , or in ten days from demand , after thirty days 97,257,194 50 Amount of this war debt $2,140,491,745 87 Adding other Government debts 51,530,472 12 Total amount of debt Jan. 1 , 1866. - $2,800,022,217 99 At the same time there was in the Treas ury , in coin $45,735,550 69 Less gold certificates of deposit 1,288,140 00 $38,447,410 69 Add in currency 44,903,271 11 Totol amount to the credit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was essential , Mr. Hooper said , that our currency should not be subject to fluctuation . This could only be done by a gradual reduction of its amount until the remainder shall circulate as the equivalent of coin . The first step in that direction should be to exchange the interest-hearing legal tender notes for long bonds ; and at the same time to reduce the rate of interest on temporary loans to at least four or five per centum . This reduction of the rate of interest on temporary loans would enhance the value of certificates of indebtedness , which bear six per cent , interest ; and being payable at a period fixed by the Treasury Depart : ment , they are a more convenient form of loan , while at the same time they provide a mode of anticipating the revenue at times when it may be needed . When the only unfunded obligations of the Government are the legal tender notes and fractional currency , costing nothing for interest , we can more easily determine to what extent , and when , they shall be withdrawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over $450,000,000 without any cost to the Government for interest . They constitute a loan from the people ; and before I consent to their conversion into bonds that will require the addition of $27,000,000 to the annual payment for interest , I wish to know how much benefit is to be derived by assuming so large an increase to the amount of interest we now have to pay ; and also , for whose benefit it will be ... . My chief objections to withdrawing the United States notes from circulation by converting them into bonds are , besides the expense that would be incurred for interest on the bonds , my belief that a larger amount of money than formerly is now required for the business of the country , and my fear that some other paper-money not so good may be allowed to take their place , by which the country would be further than ever from a currency convertible into coin . " VETO OF THE FREEDMEN S BUREAU BILL . On the 19th of February the President returned to the Senate , where it originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau , without his approval , and with his objections . He objects to - the bill as unnecessary at the present time , since the law now in existence has proved itself sufficient , even in war-time , to accomplish the object aimed at . In a conversation with Governor Cox , of Ohio , the President said that he " had contemplated that either by proclamation of his own , or by some action of Congress , a condition of peace , the technical end of the rebellion would be declared at some period not very remote ; and as he understood the present law , the Bureau might continue a year from that time . Meanwhile he could say to the South , It depends upon yourselves to say whether the Bureau shall be discontinued at an earlier day ; for I will put an end to it just as soon as you , by proper action for the protection of the freed . men , make it unnecessary . " ' And in his Veto Message the Prealdent says that , " before this law ceases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wise conclusion as to the policy to be adopted in time of peace . " He then goes on to state his objections to the bill , which , " in his opinion , contains provisions not warranted by the Constitution , and not well calculated to accomplish the end in view . " He first objects to the general scope of the bill , which " proposes to establish military jurisdiction over all parts of the United States containing refugees and freedmen ; and the source from which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is none other than the President of the United States , acting through the War Department and the Commissioner of the Freedmen 's Bm'eau .... the subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to extend in every pert of the United States , include protection to all employ*s , agents , and officers of this Bureau in the exercise of the duties imposed upon them by this bill . In eleven States ills further to extend over all cases affecting freedmen and refugees discriminated against by locel law , custom , or prejudice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may he charged with deprivhsg a freedman of any civil lights , privileges , or immunities belong . lug to white persons , to imprisonment or fine , or both , without , however , defining the civil rights and immunities which are thus to be secured by military law . This military jurisdiction also extends to all questions that may arise respecting contracts ... . The trials having their origin under this bill are to take place without the intervention of a jury , and without any fixed rules of law or evidence . . . The punishment will not be what the law declares , but such as a court-martial may think proper . And from these arbitrary tribunals there lies no appeal , no writ of error te any of the courts in which the Constitution of the United States vests exclusively the judicial power of the country . " This great power , says the President , is to be exercised through an immense number of agents , many of whom maybe " ignorant of the laws of the place , and exposed to the errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides those arising from " caprice , injustice , and passion . " The President believes that such a permanent military jurisdiction is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution , which guarantee to all persons in civil life the right of trial by jury . And , moreover , it " places in the hands of the President powers such as in time of peace should never be intrusted to any one man . " Passing from general considerations , the President objects to several details of the bill . Different sections make provision for unlimited granis for the support of refugees and freedmen , for providing them with land , and erecting for them asylums and schools at the public expense . Congress , he says , has never considered it to be its duty to provide schools for any class of the people , not even for the orphans of those who have fallen in defense of their country , nor to purchase homes for any " of the white race who are honestly toiling for a subsistence ; " and he can see " no good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a permanqnt establishment , should be founded for one class or color of our people more than for another . " It was presusned that the liberated slaves would become a self-sustaining population , and any legislation of an opposite tendency would have an injurious effect upon thorn . Moreover , the expense of such an establishment would be too great to be imposed upon the country . The bill also " proposes to take away land from its former owners without any legal proceedings being previously had . Some of this land may belong to persons who are minors , or of unsound mind , or who have been loyal , in which cases " it is not competent for any authority to deprive them of it ; " and even if the property is liable to confiscation " it can not be appropriated to public purposes until , by process of law , it shall have been declared forfeited to the Government . " The President argues at length that such provision made for freedmen would have an injurious effect upon them , by keeping them in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live it would be a source of constant and vague apprehension . They should indeed be protected , but it should be by the civil authorities , and especially by the courts of the United States and of the several States . He believes that " As they have received their freedom wills moderation and forbearance , so they will distinguish themselves by their industry and thrift , and soon show tire world that in a condition of freedons they are self-sustaining , and capable of selecting their own employment and their own places of abode ; of insisting for themselves upon a proper remuneration , and of establishing and m own asylums and schools . " aintaining tireir The Constitution , says the President , in providing for taxation , also provides for the representation of each State in the Ns*tional Congress . The act now in force was of necessity passed when the people of the States chiefly to be affected by it were not represented , on account of their being in rebellion . But now some of these States have sent loyal representatives , and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that reports have been made adverse to the good disposition of the people of these States was an additional reason why they should be heard upon a question of such importance to them . He would not interfere " With the unquestionable right of Congress to judge , each House for itself , of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members . But that authority can not be construed as including the right to shut out , in time of peace , any State from the representation to which it is entitled by the Constitution . At present all the people of eleven States are excluded . ' Referring particularly to the State of Tennessee , the people of which had , before the war was concluded , placed themselves in relation to the Federal Government , had established a State Government of their own , and had by their own act abolished slavery in the State , he declares that he " knows no reason why the State of Tennessee , for example , should not fully enjoy all her constitutional relations with the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ten States the President says , explicitly : " It is hardly necessary for me to inform Congress that in my own judgment most of those States , so far at least as depends upon their own action , have already been fully restored , and are to bedeemed to be entitled to enjoy their constitutional rights as members of the Union . " He be . lieves also that in these States " the rights and interests of all classes of the people , with the aid of the military in case of resistance to the law , will be essentially protected against unconstitutional infringement and violation . But should ibis expectation unhappily fail , which I do not anticipate , then the Executive is already armed with the powers conferred by the Act of March , 1865 , establishing the Freedmen 's Bureau ; and hereafter , as heretofore , he can employ the land and naval forces of the country to asippress insurrection and to overcome obstructions to the laws . " The President closes this elaborate Message by expressing his " earnest hope that a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not become a law , unless upon deliberate consideration by the people it shall receive the sanction of an enlightened public judgment . " The consideration of the question whether the bill should be passed , notwithstanding the veto of the President , was postponed until the following day . Before it was taken up on that day , Senator Wade introduced a joint resolution for an . Amendment to the Constitution providing that the President of the United States should be ineligible for re-election ; this provision to apply not merely to any person who had been elected as such , but to any one who should become such by reason of the death , removal , or disability of the President . He supported the resolution by a speech in which he declared that this was no new idea with him . He believed that we had rarely been able to elect a President who had not been tempted to use the vast powers intrusted to him for the purpose of advancing his own re-election . The present Chief Magistrate , when he came into office , had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ought to be punished ; and he had pledged himself to see that this was done . He had not only failed to keep this pledge , but had placed notorious traitors in high positions at the South . His policy , said Mr. Wade , as it now developed itself , was one that " Suits every rebel , every Copperhead , and every enemy of the Government of the United States , at home and abroad . It was no less than this : That those States should suffer nothing and forfeit nothing by rebellion ; but should be admitted , unwashed , and red with the blood of their countrymen , into full communion with honest , loyal men , and into the councils of the nation . What has brought about this change ? It all points to this fact , that it will not dots tempt men this way . This policy of bringing these States into the Union , with all their rebellion and treason in their hearts , Is no better than treason itself . If there is any man , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing traitors into the councils of the nation , that man is a traitor in his heart . He is an enemy to the Government and the nation . " Mr. Wilson offered a resolution , which was adopted , instructing the Committee on Reconstruction " to inquire into and report how far the States lately in rebellion , or any of them , have complied with the terms proposed by thePresident for their resumption of practical relations with the United States . " Mr. Sumner said that the President had some time ago been requested to communicate this information . For some reason this call had not been complied with ; but it might be bettor to repeat it . Mr. Wilson said that this had been done . Mr. Sumner hoped that the President would yet listen to the call of the Senate , and communicate the needed information , which was essential in determining the duties of Congress at this important moment . The question of the Veto being called up , Mr. Davis spoke in favor of the President 's action . Mr. Trumbull , the originator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . The bill , he said , was amendatory of an Act already in existonce ; it did not materially enlarge the powers of the Freedmen 's Bureau , as it now exists ; nor was it intended to be a permanent establishment . Its object was not to provide for four millions of refugees or freedmen , but only for such of them as could not take care of themselves , and only until they should become able to do so . He reviewed the circucnstances under which the Bureau was organized , and affirmed that it had saved millions of dollars to the Government by supplying employment to those who must otherwise have been supported by the Government . By virtue of the Amendment to the Constitution hundreds of thousands of slaves had been made free , in the midst of a hostile population , who were without means of any kind to save them from immediate starvation . Something must be done to take casino of these people , and this the Freedmen 's Bureau had endeavored to do . But so far from its supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number was now only 17,000 , while aid had been given to 47 000 whites . The President , he said , was in error as to the time when the functions of the Bureau , under the existing law , would cease . It was to last for one year after the rebellion should cease . The rebellion ceased in May last , with the surrender of the last rebel army , so that the Bureau would cease by its own limitation in May next . Mr. Trumbull reviewed at length the several objections of the President , and argued that those which related to the extension of military jurisdiction were invalid . In reply to the suggestion of the President that the freedmen should be protected by the civil courts , he referred to enactments of the Legislature of Mississippi which prohibited the holding or leasing of land by the freedmen ; and said that in some localities they were not permitted to hire themselves out without the consent of their former masters , were restricted in their right to travel , whipped if found away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrained of their natural rights . " There was , " he said , " no protection for the freedmen in the courts or the laws of the rebellious States . As to the last objection of the President , ' the absence of representatives from // he said qwq On the same day ( February 22 ) a large meeting was held at New York to indorse " the general principles announced by the President in his Annual Message to Congress , and also his recent Veto Message . " Resolutions were passed expressing an earnest desire to see the restoration of constitutional relations between all the States and the Federal Government ; favoring the admission of loyal representatives from the States lately in rebellion ; approving the course of the President , and pledging him " support in all proper measures for the restoration of constitutional government in all parts of the country . " Apart from the influential character of those who took prominent parts in this meeting , it is of special importance from the fact that Mr. Seward , the Secretary of State , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak at this meeting , indicating that a majority , if not all , of the Cabinet are iu favor of the policy adopted by the President . The general purport of Mr. Seward 's speech was that " the difference of opinion that but too clearly reveals itself between the executive administration of the President and the legislative counselors of the nation " was not one of ends to be attained , but of means to accomplish those ends . " Boils , " said Mr. Seward , " have got the Union restored as they originally planned it should he . They have got it restored , not with Slavery , hut without it ; not with secession , flagrant or latent , but without it ; not with compensation for emancipation , hut without it ; not with coinpromise , but without it ; not with disloyal States , or representatives , but with loyal States and representatives ; not with rebel debts , but without them ; not with exemption from our own debts for suppressing the rebellion , but with equal liabilities upon the rebels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffering and persecution , but with the freedmen employed in productive , self-sustaining industry , with refugees under the protection of law and order . " Mr. Seward apprehended no serious difficulty or calamity in this case ; and this confidence arose from his conviction " that there never wis and never can be any successful process for the restoration of union and harmony among the States except the one with which the President has avowed himself satisfied . " The rebellion being dead , it follows that sooner or later all the States must be reorganized by loyal men , in accordance with the change in our fundamental law , and being so organized , must resume their places in the Union . " All the rebel States but Texas have done just that thing , and Texas is doing the same thing jtsst now as fast as possible . " Loyal representatives from nearly all of these States have been for three months asking to be admitted to seats in Congress . " So far as I can judge of human probabilities , " said Mr. Seward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal States will , sooner or later , at this session or some other , by this Congress or some other , be received into the Legislature of the nation . When this shall have been done the process of restoration will be complete . " " Other plans , " continued Mr. Seward , " have indeed been mentioned . They were projected during Mr. Lincoln 's administration ; they have been projected since . Briefly described , these plans have been such as this : that Congress , with the Presideuc concurring , should create what are called Territorial Governments in the eleven States which once were in rebellion , and that the President should administer the Government there for an indefinite period by military force , and that after long purgation they should be admitted into the Union by Congressional enactment . This proceeding was rejected hy Mr. Lincoln , as it is rejected by the President . If it ever may have been practicable it is now altogether too late . If the President could be induced to concur in so mad a measure at this date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you will or what you may the States are already organized , in perfect harmony with our amended national Constitution , and are in earnest co-operation with the Federal Government . It would require an imperial will , an imperial person , and imperial powers greater than the Emperor of France possesses to reduce any one of these States with the consent of all the other States , into what you term a Territorial condition . " " Congress , " said Mr. Seward , " has had a Reconstruction Committee , as it is called , composed of fifteen members , who have stopped the wheels of legislation three months to enable them to submit a process or plan different from that which is now on the eve of a happy consummation . And what have they given us ? One proposed amendment to use Constitution , to compel the excluded States to equalize suffrage upon the penalty of an abridgment of representation . I do not discuss Its merits . Either the amendment will or will not be adopted . The expectation is , that it will fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full restoration of the Southern States . it is therefore no plan or process of reconstruction at alL The Committee prove this to be the true character of the proceeding , because they fall back upon a process not of restoration , but of obstruction . The resolution which they submitted Tuesday last , and which has passed the House of Representatives , directly declares that loyal representatives shall not be admitted from loyal States until Congress shall pass a law for that purpose-whirls law it would seem that every member who votes for it must know can not he enacted without the President 's approval , whirls can not be consistently given in view of the opinions that he is known to entertain . This last concurrent resolution , then , is not a plan for reconstruction , but for indefinite postponement and delay by the concurrent action of the two Houses of Congress . " There was no chance , Mr. Seward thought , of the success of this system of obstruction . The history of the country had settled three things : First " No State can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Territorial condition under the Union . " Second- " The States whirls are in the Union can not be taken or kept out of its limits ; and this lathe great lesson of the rebellion . " Third " The States which are in the Union can not keep any States that are outside from coming in . " The conflict between the President and Congress in reference to the Freedmen 's Bureau Bill Mr. Seward thought of importance , mainly because it had revealed the differences between the President and Congress . These differences were thus stated : " Both the President and Congress agree that , during the brief transition which the country is making from civil war to internal peace , the freedmen and refugees ought not to be abandoned by the nation to persecution or euffering . It was for this transition period that the Buceau of Freedmen was created by Congress , and was kept and Is still kept In effective operation . Both the President and Congress , on the other hand , agree that when that transition period shall have been folly passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union fully restored , that Bureau would be not only unnecessary but unconstitutional , demoralizing , and dangerous , and therefore tisat it should cease to exist . The President thinks that the transition stage has nearly passed , and that the original provision for the Bureau is all that is necessary to secure the end in view , while the bill submitted by Congress seems to him to give It indefinite extension in thins of peace and restoration . He vetoed it for ths.t reason ... .1 agree with the President in the hope that the extraordinary provision which the hill makes will not be necessary , but that the whole queotion may be simplified by a simple reference to the ezisting law . The law of March 8 , 1865 , which created the Freedmen 's Bureau , provides that it shall continue in force during the war of rebellion and one full year thereafter . When does that year expire ? In the President 's judgment , as I understand the matter , the war of the rebellion has been coming and is still coming to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this ground that he maintains an army , continues the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , and exercises martial law , when these things are found to be necessary in rebel States . The existence of the rebellion was legally announced by Executive proclamation in 1861 . The end of the rebellion ought to be , and may he expected to be , announced by competent declaration of the President and of Congress , or of both . For all practical purposes the rebellion will , in law , come to // an end if the President or Congress , one or both , officially announces its termination . Now suppose this announcement to be made by the President and by Congress , or by either of them , to-morrow . In that case the Freedmen 's Bureau is continued by virtue of the limitation prescribed in the act of March 3 , 1865 , one year after such proclamation shall have been made . Thus the Freedmen 's Bureau would continue , by the original limitation , until the 2Qd day of February , 1867  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . If Congress should then find it necessary to prolong its existence it can at once take the necessary steps , for it will at that date have been in session nearly three months . " Ought the President of the United States , " said Mr. Seward* in conclusion , " to be denounced in the house of Isis enemies-much more , ought he to be denounced in the house of his friends-for refusing , in the absence of any necessity , to occupy or retain , and to exercise powers greater than those which are exercised by any impertal magistrate in the world ? I trust that this fault of declining imperial powers , too hastily tendered by a too-cenfiding Congress , may be forgiven by a generous people . It will be a sad hour for the republic when the refusal of unnecessary poweys , treasure , and patronage by the President shall be held to be a crime . When it shall be so considered the time will have arrived for setting up at the White House an imperial throne , and surrounding the Exeontive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander H. Stephens , Vice-President of the late Confederacy , delivered at Milledgeville , Georgia , on the 22d of Fehruary , a Speech on the present condition of affairs , especially as they relate to the State of Georgia . This speech has special importance from the fact that Mr. Stephens was chosen , against his wish , Senator in Congress ; that the Speech was delivered at the express desire of the Legislature of Georgia , and has been officially sanctioned hy that body . It may therefore be considered as an exposition of the sentiment of the people of that State , and in a measure , at least , of that of the thinking portion of the entire Southern people . We quote , abridging when possible , a few of the leading portions : The Situation*-We have reached that point in our affairs in which the great question before us is to be or not to be ; if to he , how ? Adversity is a severe school , a terrible crucible , both for individuals and communities .

Can the evils upon us , the absence of law , the want of protection and security of person and property he removed ; and can those greater ones which threaten our very poiltical existence bs averted ? Dscties. - The first great duty I would enjoin at this time is the exercise of patience . Patience requires of those affected to bear , to suffer with fortitude , whatever ills may befall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it with us now essential for their ultimate removal by any insirumentalities whatever . We are in tht condition of a man with a dislocatedlimh or a broken leg , and avery bad compound fracture too , at that .

The knitting of the bones and the granulation of the flesh requires time . Perfect quiet and repose , even under the severest pain , is necessary ; it will not do to make too great haste to get well ; an attempt to walk too soon will only make the matter worse . We must , or ought now , therefore , in a similar manner , to discipline ourselves to the same or like degree of.patience . I know how trying it is to be denied representation in Congress while we are paying our proportion of the taxes ; how annoying it is to be even partially under military rule , and how injurious it is to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail communications , to say nothing of divers other matters on the long list of our present inconveniences and privations . All these , however , we must patiently bear and endure for a season with quiet and repose ; we may get well , may get once more on our feet again . One thing is certain , that bad humor , ill temper , exhibited either in restlessness or grumbling , will not hasten it . Next to this , another great duty we owe to ourselves , is the exercise of a liberal spirit of forbearance among ourselves . The first step toward local or general harmony is the banishment from our breasts of every feeling and sentiment calculated to stir the discords of the past . On no occasion , and especially in the hestowment of office , ought such differences of opinion in the past ever to be mentioned either for or against any one otherwise entitled to confidence .

Good government is what we want . This should be the leading desire and the controlling object with alL Objects of Necession. - Whatever differences of opinion existed before the late fury of the war , they sprung mainly from differences as to the best man to be used and the best line of policy to be pursued to secure the great controlling object of all , which was good government .

It was with this view and this purpose that secession was tried . That has failed . Instead of bettering our condition , instead of establishing our liberty upon a surer foundation , we have , in the war that ensued , come well-nigh losing the whole of the rich inheritance with which we set out . Wars , end civil wars especially , always menace liberty-they seldom advance it , while they usually end in its entire overthrow and destruction . Ours stopped just short of such a catastrophe . Our only alternative now is either to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to look for its vindication and maintenance in the forums of reason and justice , instead of on the arena of arms ; in the courts and halls of legislation , instead of on the fields of battle . Means to be cmdepted. - Our surest hopes , in my judg. mont , of these ends are in the restoration policy of the President of the United States . I have little hope for liberty , little hope for this success of the great American experiment of self-government , but in the success of the present efforts for the restoration of the States to their former practical relations in a common Government under the Constitution of the United States . Tests of Lopalty. - Another one of our present duties is this : we should accept the issues of the war , and abide by them in good faith . This , I am fully persuaded , it is your purpose to do , as well an that of your constituents . The people of Georgia have in Convention revoked her ordinance of 1861 , which was intended to sever her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States has been reordained as the organic law of our land . Whatever differences of opinion heretofore existed as to where our allegiance was due disring the late state of things , none for any practical purpose can exist now . Whether Georgia , by the action of her Convention of 1861 , was ever rightfully out of the Union or not , there can be no question that she is now in , so far as depouds upon her will ; and I deem the whole United States theref.re is now without question our country , to be cherished and defended as such by all our hearts and by all our arms . The Constitution of the United States , and the treaties and laws made in pursuance thereof , are now acknowledged to be the paramount law in this whole country . Whoever , therefore , is true to these principles is now recognized as loyal , as far as that term has any legitimate use or force under our institutions . This is the only kind of loyalty , and the only test of loyalty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of the war in good faith , and come up to time test required // by the Constitution , are now loyal , however they may have heretofore been . The Freedmen  --  but with this change comes a new order of things . One of the results of the war is a total change in our whole internal policy . Our former social fabric hao been entirely subverted . The relation heretofore , under our old system , between the African and European races , no longer exists . Slavery , or the status of the black race-their subordination to the whites , upon which all our institutions rested-is abolished forever , not only in Georgia , but throughout the limits of the United States . This change should be received and accepted as an irrevocable fact . It is a bootless question now to discuss whether tise new system is better for both races than the old one was or not . Our present duty in regard to this subject is not with the past or the future . It is with the present . This duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require of you , as legislators of the land , great changes in our former laws in regard to this large class of population . Wise and humane provisions should be made for them ; ample and full protection should be secured to them so that they may start equal before the law in the possession and enjoyment of all rights of personal liberty and property . Many considerations claim this at your hands . Among these may be stated their fidelity in times past . They cultivated your fields , ministered to your perasnal wants and comfort , nursed and reared your children , and even in the hour of danger and peril they were in the main true to you and yours . To them we owe a debt of gratitude as well as acts of kindness . This sleould also be done because they are poor , untutored , uninformed , many of them helpless , liable to be imposed upen , and need it . All obstacles , if tisere bs any , should be removed which can possibly hinder or retard the blacks to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own efforts . Channels of education should be opened up to them ; schools and the usual means of moral and intellectual training should be encouraged among them . The Ussien-My only hope is in the peaceful re-establishment of good government ; and its peaceful maintenance is the restoration of tise old Union , and with it the speedy return of fraternal feeling throughout is lengtla and breadth . Let it not be said of us in this day , not yet passed , of our country 's trial and agony , that there was a party for Casar , and a party for Pompey , and a party for Brutus , but no party for Rome ; but all patriots , by whatever distinction heretofore styled , rally in all elections . Every where to the support of him , be he whom he may , who bears the standard with Constitution emblazoned on its folds . President Johnson is now , in my judgment , the chief great standard-bearer of these principles , and in his efforts at restoration should receive the cordial support of every well-wisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes . Should he be sustained , and the Government be restored to its former functions , all the States brought beck to their practical relations under the Coesstitutiou , our situation will be greatly changed from what it was before . A radical and fundamental change , as has been stated , has been in that organic law . We shall have lost what was known as our peculiar institution , which so enteriwined with the whole frame-work of our State body politic . We shall have lost nearly half the accumulated capital of a century , but shall have still left the essential of free government contained and embodied in the old Constitution , untouched and unimpaired , as they came from ties hands of our fathers . I know of no land the sun shines on that offers better prospects under these contingencies . The old Union was based on the assumption that it was for the best interests of the people of the United States to be united as they were , each State faithfully performing to the people of other States all their obligations under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on broad , correct , and statesmanlike principles . I think so yet . It was only when it seemed to be impossible further to maintain it without hazarding greater evils than would perhaps attend a separation that I yielded my assent , in obedience to the voice of Georgia , to try the experiment just resulting so disastrously to us . Indeed , during the whole lamentable conflict , it was my opinion that , however the pending strife might terminate , so far as the appeal to the sword was concerned , after a while when the passions and excitement or the day should pass away , an adjustment or arrangement would be made upon constitutional principles , upon a general basis of reciprocal advantage and mutual convenience , on which the Union was first established . SOUTHERN AMERICA . From Mexico we have only accounts of isolated guerrilla contests , and these are so colored by the medium through which they pass that they must be received with great allowance . Thus we are told that on the 23d of January Mendez , a Juarist commander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars , besides a thousand mules ; and that subsequently he was attacked by the garrison of Tampico , and defeated , with the loss of 850 men , the Imperialists losing only 100 . Another General Mendez , an Imperialist , is said to have gained a victory in the State of Michoacan , over the Republican commander Regales killing many and capturing 600 prisoners , and *ll of the enemy 's artillery and ammunition . The Imperialists claim several other successes in various parts of the country . On the other hand , it is said that the whole State of Sinaloa , with the exception of Mazatlan , is in possession of the Republicans . Simultaneously with the intelligence of the probable withdrawal of the French troops from Mexico come reports that the Emperor of Austria has offered to furnish his brother Maximilian with any number of Austrian troops , provided that he will pay them  --  a condition with which the present condition of the Mexican finances will render it bard to comply . Chili and Pee-u have entered into an alliance , offensive and defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peruvian fleet has gone to unite with that of Chili . Meanwhile the Spanish fleet had concentrated near Yalparaiso , and made an attack , in which they were repulsed , upon the garrison at Caldervilla . FRANCE . The session of the Legislative Bodies was opened on the 2*d of January by the speech of the Emperor . It was much longer and more elaborate than is usual with royal speeches . Passing over the portions which relate to the internal affairs of the Empire , we notice briefly those which pertain to foreign affairs . Peace , says the Emperor , seems every where assured , for means are sought to overcome difficulties by friendly methods , instead of resorting to arms . The meeting of the French and English fleets in the same ports has cemented the accord between the two nations . With respect to Germany , the Emperor does not intend to meddle with questions in which France is not directly concerned . With respect to Italy , which has " affirmed her unity by inaugurating her capital in the centre of the Peninsula , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power of the Holy Father . " The most important paragraphs for us are the following , which relate to this continent : " In Mexico , the Government founded by the will of the people is becoming consolidated ; the non-contents , vanquished and dispersed , leave no longer any leader . The national troops have shown thetir worth , and thee country hiss found guarantees of order and security which have developed its reosurces and raised its commerce with France alone from twenty-one to seventy-seven millions . According to the lisps which I expressed last year , our expedition is approaching its termination . I am coming to an understanding with thee Emperor Maximilian for fixing the period for recalling our troops ; so that thee return may be effected without compromising thee French interests which we have to defend in that distant country . " North America , after having victoriously issued from a formidable contest , has re-established thee old Union and solenenly proclaimed the abolition of slavery . France , which forges no noble page in leer history , forms sincere wishes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance of amicable relations , now of nearly a century 's duration . Thee emotion produced in the United States by the presence of the Fronds army on thee Mexican territory will subside before the frankness of my declarations . The Ameejean people will understand that our expedition , in which we had invited them to take part , was not opposed to their interests . Two nations , // both equally jealous of their independence , should avoid any step in which their dignity and their honor would be engaged . " The Senate , in reply to this portion of the Emperor 's speech , said : " Your Majesty Informs us that the memorable expedition to Mexico approaches its termination . This is announced to satisfy France that the protection of her commercial interest is assured in a vast and wealthy market now restored to security . As regards the United States , if , from misconception , the presence of the French flag in America appeared to them less opportune than at a previous and most illustrious period of their history , the firm tone of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haughty and menacing language will not decide us to withdraw . France is accustomed to move only at her own time , hut she nevertheless wishes to remember the ancient friendship between herself and the United States . What your Majesty asked of the United States is neutrality and observance of international law . " GREAT BRITAIN . The British Parliament was opened on the 6th of February , the Queen being present . The Royal Speech was , however , read by the Lord Chancellor . We quote some of the leading paragraphs : " My relations with foreign Powers are friendly and satisfactory , and I see no cause to fear any disturbance of the general peace " Tue meeting of the fleets of France and England in the ports of the respective countries has tended to cement the amity of the two nations , and to prove to the world their friendly concert in the promotion of peace . " I isave observed with satisfaction that the United States , after terminating successfully the severe struggle in which they were so long engaged , are wisely repairing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event calling forth the cordial sympathies and congratulations of this country , which has always been foremost in showing its abisorrence of an institution repugnant to every feeling of justice and humanity . " I have at the same time the satisfaction to inform you that the exertions and perseverance of my naval squadron have reduced the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa within very narrow limits . " A correspondence has taken place between my Government and that of the United States with respect to injuries inflicted on American commerce by cruisers under the Confederate flag . " A conspiracy , adverse alike to authority , property , and religion , and disapproved and condemned alike by all who are interested in their maintenance , witlsout distinction of creed or class ; has unhappily appeared in Ireland . The constitutional power of the ordinary tribunals has been exerted for its repression , and the authority of the law has been firmly and impartially vindicated . " The alarm excited by the Fenian movement has greatly increased . On the 16th of February Sir George Grey in the Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the following day they would ask leave to bring in a bill to suspend for a limited time the Habeas Cospsss Act in Ireland . The importance attached to this measure is evinced by the fact that the Commons had specially agreed to hold a special session on that day ( Saturday ) for this purpose , and Earl Russell asked the Peers to do the same , in order that no time might be lost in pressing the measure . On the 17th , in asking leave to bring in the bill , Sir George Grey said that the Fenian conspiracy had only recently assumed its present proportions . It was necessary to strike an effective blow at these schemes , which were discountenanced by the American Government . The loyalty of the British army , be said , was without a doubt ; but the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland had earnestly requested the suspension of the Act , saying that he could not hold himself responsible for the safety of the country if the power was withheld from him . In the Commons the bill suspending the habeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no opposition being made except by Mr. Bright , who protested against it , but said that he would not oppose the Government . The bill also passed the Peers without opposition , Earl Derby , the leader of the Opposition , merely remarking that it would be for the Government to justify the course it was about to take . If the House of Commons agreed to the proposal , he would not interpose a moment 's delay ; but he hoped that the Government would , at the earliest possible moment , state the grounds upon which they relied for the justification of their proceedings . The bill , having passed both Houses , received the Royal assent on the same day . On the 17th of February more than a hundred arrests were made in Dublin of persons , mostly strangers , supposed to be implicated in the Fenian movement ; and this was presunsed to be but a beginning of the arrests . Meanwhile the troops in Ireland wore being distributed among the small towns . It is stated , though not officially , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea , and that this was one of the reasons for the suspension of theJlafees C'orpus . A French paper gives snore definite shape to this rumor by chronicling a report , which , however , needed confirmation , that a steamer called the Fort Morgan , which had been used as a Federal gun-boat , had been purchased by the Fenians , and under the name of the CThu. bad put to sea from New York on the 20th of January . The French paper adds that this vessel , if there be such an one , will be considered a pirate by all naval powers , and if captured all her crew should be hanged . SPAIN . The attempted insurrection nuder General Prim has proved to be a failure , whatever may have been its object . Prim made Isis way to Portugal , where his small force was disarmed . From thence it is said that he was to proceed to England. - Some difficulty has arisen between Italy and Spain in reference to the relations of the Government of Italy and the Pope . Tlse Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the September Convention , while acknowledging the principle of non-intervention , neverthelesaplaced certain conditions upon the application of that principle . Those conditions concern France exclusive ly . You will therefore declare that , as regards other Powers , their non-intervention in the political affairs of Rome will always remain an unqualified principle , upon which the conduct of Italy will he invariably based . " - No little alarm has been occasioned in Spain by the reported presence of Chilian privateers upon the Spanish coast . A Peruvian frigate , the Iluasca , lying at Brest , in France , had enlisted French sailors . But Peru having declared war against Spain , these sailors were disensharked at the request of the French authorities . Spain , in endeavoring to bully the South American Republics , appears to have rendered herself liable to far greater injuries than any which the can inflict .
