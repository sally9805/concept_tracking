ART . IX . - Considerations on Representative Government . B* JOHN STUART MILL , Author of " A System of Logic , Ratiocinative and Inductive . " New York : Harper and Brothers . 1862. l2mo. pp. 365 . POLITICAL institutions are not created out of nothing ; they grow from the antecedents and surroundings of the nation that is subject to them . They are effectively modified only by the progress or the essential change of the people in the elements of material , mental , or moral well-being . Modifications put in force by exterior power , as in the case of conquest or of the overmastering influence of a greater nation , endure only while the outward pressure lasts , or remain in form and letter while their substance and intent become obsolete . Revolutions from within are always slow , though they may seem sudden . Disruption barely marks the advanced stage of a process that may have been going on for centuries , and when it occurs it is a token , not of the entireness of the revolution , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be so organized that fundamental changes can be effected without the slightest shock ; or it may be so constituted as to admit of no new principle or idea without convulsion . If this view be correct , it might seem at first thought that forms of government are determined by fate , and in no wise by choice or volition on the part of the governed . But so far is this from being the case , that such choice or volition is the most potent of all political causes , - not indeed infallibly efficacious , ( for in all human affairs an inexorable past may tie the hands of the present , ) but strong enough to overcome almost every force short of immemorial prescription or ingrained national tendencies . Here , then , is the scope of political philosophy , especially when , as in numerous cases from Plato 's Republic down to the treatise now under review , it assumes a concrete form , not only establishing principles , but defining organisms as yet untried and unfamiliar . The process is slow and stepwise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential mind is already in a fair way to find ultimate realization in a consti // tution or government . This book propounds principles and modes of organism and administration which no nation upon earth is prepared to embody , yet the ability with which they are stated and defended renders their adoption in the distant future highly probable . The author 's ideas will gradually diffuse themselves among philosophers who occupy his own intellectual plane ; by their agency they will work their way into the common mind as reasonable , but impracticable ; then they will be esteemed as desideranda in governmental institutions ; and , when they are once objects of desire , they will in due time become objects of the popular will and choice . We do not propose to follow Mr. Mill over the entire ground occupied by his treatise . Ours will be the easier task of selecting some few of its salient points , and discussing them in our own way , borrowing much of our material from him , but freely adding to , or digressing from , his course of illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best form , it does not follow that it is always practicable , or always expedient when practicable . It is not practicable unless the people desire it , - unless they are able and willing to do what is necessary for its preservation , - unless they are able and willing to perform intelligently and honestly the functions which it imposes on them . It is not to be desired for a people that has not learned the lesson of obedience . This lesson is best learned under an absolute government , and especially under military rule . On the other hand , extreme passiveness disqualifies a nation for profiting by a representative government , which in that case would be virtually nominated by the supreme executive , and would be a mere court of registration for the dicta of irresponsible power . Imperfect union and centralization would equally render a representative government inexpedient ; for in this case local interests would predominate to the prejudice of the general good , and the unifying power of the central administration would be weakened and thwarted by the pestilent activity of sectional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we prefer to quote in Mr. Mill 's own words . " Among the tendencies which , without absolutely rendering a peo // pie unfit for representative government , seriously incapacitate them from reaping the full benefit of it , one deserves particular notice . There are two states of the inclinations , intrinsically very different , but which have something in common , by virtue of which they often coincide in the direction they give to the efforts of individuals and of nations ; one is the desire to exercise power over others ; the other is disinclination to have power exercised over themselves . The difference between different portions of mankind in the relative strength of these two dispositions is one of the most important elements in their history . There are nations in whom the passion for governing others is so much stronger than the desire of personal independence , that for the mere shadow of the one they are found ready to sacrifice the whole of the other . Each one of their number is willing , like the private soldier in an army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his general , provided the army is triumphant and victorious , and he is able to flatter himself that he is one of a conquering host , though the notion that he has himself any share in the domination exercised over the conquered is an illusion . A government strictly limited in its powers and attributions , required to hold its hands from overmeddling , and to let most things go on without its assuming the part of guardian or director , is not to the taste of such a people ; in their eyes , the possessors of authority can hardly take too much upon themselves , provided the authority itself is open to general competition . An average individual among them prefers the chance , however distant or improbable , of wielding some share of power over his fellow-citizens , above the certainty , to himself and others , of having no unnecessary power exercised over them . These are the elements of a people of place-hunters , in whom the course of politics is mainly determined by place.hunting ; where equality alone is cared for , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but struggles to decide whether the power of meddling in everything shall belong to one class or another , perhaps merely to one knot of public men or another ; where the idea entertained of democracy is merely that of opening offices to the competition of all , instead of a few ; where , the more popular the institutions , the more innumerable are the places created , and the more monstrous the over-government exercised by all over each , and by the executive over all . It would be as unjust as it would be ungenerous to offer this , or anything approaching to it , as an unexaggerated pictui'e of the French people ; yet the degree in which they do participate in this type of character has caused representative government by a limited class to break down by excess of corruption , and the attempt at representative government by the whole male population to end in giv // ing one man the power of consigning any number of the rest , without trial , to Lambessa or Cayenne , provided he allows all of them to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The point of character which , beyond any other , fits the people of this country for representative government , is that they have almost universally the contrary characteristic . They are very jealous of any attempt to exercise power over them not sanctioned by long usage and by their own opinion of right , but they in general care very little for the exercise of power over others . iNot having the smallest sympathy with the passion for governing , while they are but too well acquainted with the motives of private interest from which that office is sought , they prefer that it should be performed by those to whom it comes without seeking , as a consequence of social position . if foreigners understood this , it would account to them for some of the apparent contradictions in the political feelings of Englishmen ; their unhesitating readiness to let themselves be governed by the higher classes , coupled with so little personal subservience to them , that no people are so fond of resisting authority when it oversteps certain prescribed limits , or so determined to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way they themselves like best . Place-hunting , accordingly , is a form of ambition to which the English , considered nationally , are almost strangers . If we except the few fi*imilies or connections of whom official employment lies directly in the way , Englishmen 's views of advancement in life take an altogether different direction , - that of success in business or in a profession . They have the strongest distaste for any mere struggle for office by political parties or individuals ; and there are few things to which they have a greater aversion than to the multiplication of public employments ; a thing , on the contrary , always popular with the bureaucracy-ridden nations of the Continent , who would rather pay higher taxes than diminish , by the smallest fraction , their individual chances of a place for themselves or their relatives , and among whom a cry for retrenchment never means abolition of offices , but the reduction of the salaries of those which are too considerable for the ordinary citizen to have any chance of being appointed to them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill that a representative government would be under many conceivable conditions impossible or worthless , we can not lose sight of the efficacy of free and popular institutions as educators of public sentiment and of individual intelligence , capacity , and energy . If a nation can barely " keep out of fire and water , " can secure // domestic peace , prevent any grave infractions of justice , and maintain honorable relations with other powers , under a government whose functionaries are dependent on , and at frequent intervals replaced by , the general suffrage , it will develop its capacity of self-help and its interior resources more rapidly and more symmetrically with its own often unwise , defective , or vacillating legislation , than beneath the tutelage of the wisest and most beneficent autocracy or oligarchy conceivable . It is a vast benefit to a people to have the horizon of thought enlarged . The man who has a share by his suffrage in making or administering the laws of the land , even if he votes injudiciously , - even if his views of public affairs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private concerns , whether of interest or duty , a steadiness of vision and purpose , a conscious dignity , a felt responsibleness , which can hardly be found among the most intelligent subjects of absolute rule . He in whom resides an aliquot portion of the sovereignty will bear his kingly estate in mind on the numerous occasions in daily life on which he might else forget even his manhood . The gravity of the Anglo-Saxon character , as contrasted with the frivolity of some races that belong to other branches of the great Teutonic family , may be traced with more probability to the difference of political institutions than to hereditary laws of temperament . Certain it is that scions of the various stocks ingrafted on American Anglo-Saxondom take on , in a single generation , the reflective habits of their adopted soil , and bear a closer resemblance to the people of which they form a part , than to the nations whence they sprang . The principle for which we contend may be traced in the democratic governments - not representative - of the Grecian republics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrates were chosen by lot , when the assembled demos held the reins of state , and when popular eloquence was mightier than virtue , law , or justice . But the power which every citizen held by his suffrage , and the power which might devolve upon him from the mysterious urn , educated the people to a clearness of apprehension , a subtilty of intellect , an activity and energy , such as had no precedent and have had no parallel . *While Rome was a veritable republic , // her popular assembly also was a nation of kings , and from her plebeian ranks there constantly rose men fitted for the highest trusts in peace and war , - men whose fame immeasurably exceeds that of the greatest generals and administrators under the Emperors . As regards the proper functions of a representative government , Mr. Mill presents views in some respects novel , but , as seems to us , eminently sound and just . That a numerous representative body can not conduct the executive administration with wisdom and vigor , is universally conceded . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free people , and that no less in a monarchy than in a republic . In Great Britain the sovereign is powerless against the Commons . The royal veto may indeed postpone , and by postponing may defeat , the transient purpose of the people in a season of excitement ; but it can not withstand the settled , deliberate will of the nation , or prevent the progressive wisdom of the community from righting ancient wrongs , and embodying the best and ripest views it has attained in the various departments of the public service . The checks interposed by the royal prerogative are simply such checks as a self-governing people must of necessity provide against its own temporary caprices and delusions , and experience has shown that they are less arbitrarily employed by an hereditary sovereign than they have repeatedly been by the elective sovereign of the United States . Among the functions that by common consent reside in the representatives of a free people , that of taxation has been regarded as one of the foremost . Yet this is virtually exercised by the few , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the estimates furnished by the executive departments , which may indeed be modified , but can not be essentially changed , by the vote of the representative body . The mode of apportionment can be determined only by select committees of that body , subject to the revision of the whole . And it is very certain that the less the estimates of a competent executive and the recommendations of an impartial committee of finance are tampered with by the partisan influences that are prone to affect legislative bodies , the more surely are the 20* // interests of the public service and of individual tax-payers brought into harmony . But Mr. Mill goes farther than this . He maintains that legislation is not among the proper functions of a representative body . He suggests the expediency of a legislative commission , whose business it shall be to prepare all bills for the action of the assembly . If the bills proposed by such a commission meet the wishes of the majority , they should pass in the precise form in which they are proposed ; if they are repugnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peremptorily rejected . If amendments are desired , the bills should be referred hack to the commission , to be reported in a new draft . The reasons for such a provision are obvious . For the framing of laws a knowledge of the whole body of pre-existing laws is essentially requisite . From a lack of this knowledge springs the frequent conflict of laws , and thence the uncertainty , the utter dice-work , that is often manifest in the administration of justice . The chaotic state of the British statutes is well known and universally admitted . In many of the States of our Union this same condition of the statutes has rendered codification necessary ; and hardly is the long labor completed , and the body of the revised statutes in the hands of the people , than the confusion commences anew , and the volume becomes obsolete before its leaves are worn . Then , too , laws which are to be subjected to strict and technical rules of interpretation need to be carefully guarded in their phraseology , lest the intent of their makers be frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to Mr. Mill , " the proper function of a representative assembly is to watch and control the government ; to throw the light of publicity on its acts ; to compel a full exposition and justification of all of them which any one considers questionable ; to censure them if found condemnable , and , if the men who compose the government abuse their trust , or fulfil it in a manner which conflicts with the deliberate sense of the nation , to expel them from office , and either expressly or virtually appoint their successors . " Our author attaches also a very high importance to a representative body as literally a parliament , a talking assembly . On this subject he writes - // 235 1862 . " I know not how a representative assembly can more usefully employ itself than in talk , when the subject of talk is the great public interests of the country , and every sentence of it represents the opinion either of some important body of persons in the nation , or of an individual in whom some such body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shade of opinion in the country can have its cause even passionately pleaded , in the face of the government and of all other interests and opinions , - can compel them to listen , and either comply , or state clearly why they do not , - is in itself ; if it answered no other purpose , one of the most important political institutions that can exist anywhere , and one of the foremost benefits of free government . Such talking ' would never be looked upon with disparagement if it were not allowed to stop doing ' ; which it never would , if assemblies knew and acknowledged that talking and discussion are their proper business , while doing , as the result of discussion , is the task , not of a miscellaneous body , but of individuals specially trained to it ; that the fit office of an assembly is to see that those individuals are honestly and intelligently chosen , and to interfere no further with them , except by unlimited latitude of suggestion and criticism , and by applying or withholding the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this judicious reserve that popular assemblies attempt to do what they can not do well , - to govern and legislate , - and provide no machinery hut their own for much of it , when of course every hour spent in talk is an hour withdrawn from actual business . " - pp. 117 , 118 . This view may reconcile us in part to the alleged waste of time in most of our representative assemblies , especially to the very small proportion of time employed by Congress in " doing , " and to the numerous speeches made for the sole behoof and benefit of constituents ,  --  the " talking " with the whole nation for an audience . There can be little doubt that the else inefficient harangues delivered in the Capitol tend to arouse and energize the thought of the people on subjects of vital interest , and that , so far as the public mind is progressive in political science , its progress is largely due to the free ventilation of opinion , prejudice , and passion on the floor of Congress . The instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important measure , though not known to change a single vote , have given to the general opinion and conscience of the country a direction opposed to that of the final vote of the legislative chambers . In the // great issues which are joined in our present civil war , it is true , on the one hand , that Congress had , prior to the secession of South Carolina , taken no action whatever at which the most sensitive advocate of slavery had need to feel alarm ; but it is equally true that Congressional discussion had brought the public sentiment of the Free States to a point at which action adverse to slavery would soon have been imperatively demanded , and could not have been much longer delayed . The chief danger incident to a representative government , as Mr. Mill justly maintains , is that of class-legislation , that is , the neglect by the governing class of other interests than its own . This need not spring from corrupt or selfish motives . On the other hand , such motives are so liable to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made operative they have emphatic recognition and live in long memory , they probably affect the course of legislation but seldom and feebly . What is to be feared is the unconscious class-egotism which identifies its own immediate interests with the public good , and the honest non-appreciation or misapprehension of the needs and rights of other classes . Thus , to draw our illustration from the two great classes into which civilized society divides itself , the employers and the employed , or those who do and those who do not subsist by hand-labor , - neither of these classes can enter into the self-consciousness of the other . The laborer has but a vague comprehension of the elements which constitute the rightfulness of property and the legitimacy of large incomes ; still less , of the offset to the superior advantages of wealth in its peculiar responsibilities , cares , and perils ; least of all , of the inestimable public benefit of great estates as safety-funds and movement-funds for the subsistence and enterprise of the whole community . On the other hand , the non-laboring classes are prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be comfortably lodged , clothed , and fed , while they are in full employment , and are to a great degree unaware of the depressing and precarious conditions under which they often toil , of the social arrangements which often defraud labor of its rights , and of the sensibilities and cravings which poverty suppresses only when it is allied with gross ignorance or vice . Each class is liable to legislate to // the disadvantage of the other . Thus , during the brief periods when the proletaries of France have had the power of the empire in their hands , wealth has been treated as a crime , the rights of property have been ruthlessly invaded , and the wildest dreams of socialism have threatened the people with their realization . In Great Britain , on the contrary , where the elective franchise has been carefully guarded and restricted , the worst portion of the national legislation has been that which relates to the laboring and pauper classes . The English poor-laws are adapted to create the very evil they are designed to mitigate ; the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there remain legal obstacles to free competition in the labor market ; the abuses of the factories and the mines were patent to the whole world long before Parliament attempted to remedy them ; Ireland has owed more of her suffering and depopulation to stepmotherly legislation than to all other causes combined ; and the rapid consolidation of landed estates , with diminished products from the soil and employment for its cultivators , is due to the operation of laws which embody , in a sense never intended by its Author , the sacred maxim , " Unto every one which hath , shall be given , and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away . " Except during a revolutionary epoch and a violent upheaving of the lower strata of society , the danger of legislation less favorable to the laboring class than to capitalists and proprietors is always imminent . It is not averted by universal suffrage . The great mass of the voters are not represented by their own candidates . The intelligence , influence , and position which make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose affinities are with the employers rather than with the employed . It is , indeed , for the interest of those who would retain office by popular suffrage , to consult for the welfare of the whole body of their constituents ; but an outside view of their rights , claims , and wants must always be inadequate as compared with the knowledge which experience and fellow-feeling would give . Only a sincere and self-devoting philanthropy can discern the exact relations between those who occupy the higher and the lower places in the social scale ; and the true remedy for exclusive class-legisla // tion is to be found in the operation of such philanthropy in and through legislative bodies . It is mainly to this element that the legislative reforms iii Great Britain are due , and to the same cause we are indebted in our country for the generally equitable character of our laws as between class and class , and for the degree to which the rights of labor and the needs of the poor are recognized and cared for . In what we have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality any exclusive class-interests . Nor yet are there any exclusive national interests . No international treaty or commercial arrangement can be permanently beneficial to one of two nations that is not so to both ; for so far as one of the two is weakened or impoverished for the benefit of the other , the benefit-yielding capacity of the former is impaired by every draft upon it , and must in process of time be exhausted . Equally must class-legislation become gradually less beneficial , then nugatory , then positively injurious to the class in whose behalf it is instituted . But as the immediate and apparent interest of a nation may be opposed to that of another nation , so may the immediate and apparent interest of a class be opposed to that of another class , and it can no more be expected of the legislative than of the treatymaking functionaries , that they shall always take those comprehensive and far-reaching views in which the good of each is seen to be identical with the good of all . Mr. Mill has a very able and instructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the systems now in use in all representative governments , not only that a bare majority should wield all the power of a nation , but that a large minority should be wholly or nearly destitute of representation in its councils . This is evidently undesirable . It is not only unjust in itself considered , but it tends to make the majority less secure of permanent power , and to render the change of administrative policy harmfully frequent . A minority that could make itself heard in the national assembly would depend for its success in overcoming the odds against itself solely on the soundness of its expositions , the weight of its arguments , and the cogency of its eloquence ; while the same minority , unrepresented and voiceless in the public // counsels , attracts to itself sympathy , makes capital of its enforced silence and inaction , appeals not in vain to a certain blind , rude justice , which weighs not the merits of the cause , but the wrongs of its adherents , and very probably turns the scale in its own favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds . Now if the legislative assembly be in its prime intent and use a parliament , a talking body , every numerous and respectable party among the people has an undoubted right to its share in the talk ; every significant phasis of opinion has a right to be presented and advocated , or , to state the case still more strongly , the nation has a right to such practical wisdom as can be elicited only by the free comparison and discussion of opposing or divergent theories and measures ; and the legislators who represent a bare majority have no right to close their ears and minds to the most ample and forceful presentation of the views and arguments of the miiirority . But , if all this be admitted , how is it possible to insure the representation of minorities ? It can be effected by no system now in practice . An approximation is made to it , however , by rendering each constituency so small , that it shall elect but a single representative ; for it is at least probable that a large minority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable number of these small constituencies . On the other hand , constituencies large enough to choose several representatives on a general ticket will be likely to have a majority coincident with that of the whole state , or of the section of the country to which they respectively belong . Thus most of the counties of Massachusetts would generally furnish majorities of the same complexion with that of the State ; while the individual towns would , many of them , choose minority Representatives . The time has often been when most , if not all , of the Northern and Middle States of our Union , choosing Representatives to Congress by a general ticket , would have been represented by men of the same political school , while the single representative districts would have furnished an adequate minority representation . Thus , too , it almost always happens that , of two legislative chambers , the smaller and higher is much more nearly homogeneous in opinion than the larger and lower ; and we // have known at least one instance in which a senate of twelve consisted wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of the members of the lower house were in opposition . We deem this subject of so great importance in theory , and so sure to become at no great distance of time a matter of practical discussion , that we offer no apology for quoting at length the solutions of the problem suggested by Mr. Mill . " Those who have seen and felt , in some degree , the force of these considerations , have proposed various expedients by which the evil may be , in a greater or less degree , mitigated . Lord John Russell , in one of his Reform Bills , introduced a provision , that certain constituencies should return three members , and that in these each elector should be allowed to vote only for two ; and Mr. *israeli , in the recent debates , revived the memory of the fact by reproaching him for it , being of opinion , apparently , that it befits a conservative statesman to regard only means , and to disown scornfully all fellow-feeling with any one who is betrayed , even once , into thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to vote only for one . By either of these plans , a minority equalling or exceeding a third of the local constituency would be able , if it attempted no more , to return one out of three members . The same result might be attained in a still better way , if , as proposed in an able pamphlet by Mr. James Garth Marshall , the elector retained his three votes , but was at liberty to bestow them all upon the same candidate . These schemes , though infinitely better than none at all , are yet but makeshifts , and attain the end in a very imperfect manner , since all local minorities of less than a third , and all minorities , however numerous , which are made up from several constituencies , would remain unrepresented . It is much to be lamented , however , that none of these plans have been carried into effect , as any of them would have recognized the right principle , and prepared the way for its more complete application . But real equality of representation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average number of a constituency , wherever in the country they happen to reside , have the power of combining with one another to return a representative . This degree of perfection in representation appeared impracticable until a man of great capacity , fitted alike for large general views and for the contrivance of practical details , - Mr. Thomas Hare , - had proved its possibility by drawing up a scheme for its accomplishment , embodied in a draft of an Act of Parliament ; a scheme which has the almost unparalleled merit of carrying out a great principle of government in a manner approaching to ideal perfection // as regards the special object in view , while it attains incidentally several other ends of scarcely inferior importance . " According to this plan , the unit of representation , the quota of electors who would be entitled to have a member to themselves , would be ascertained by the ordinary process of taking averages , the number of voters being divided by the number of seats in the House ; and every candidate who obtained that quota would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituencies it might be gathered . The votes would , as at present , be given locally , but any elector would be at liberty to vote for any candidate , in whatever part of the country he might offer himself . Those electors , therefore , who did not wish to be represented by any of the local candidates , might aid by their vote in the return of the person they liked best among all those throughout the country who had expressed a willingness to be chosen . This would so far give reality to the electoral rights of the otherwise virtually disfranchised minority . But it is important that not those alone who refuse to vote for any of the local candidates , but those also who vote for one of them and are defeated , should be enabled to find elsewhere the representation which they have not succeeded in obtaining in their own district . It is therefore provided that an elector may deliver a voting paper containing other names in addition to the one which stands foremost in his preference . His vote would only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first choice failed to be returned , from not having obtained the quota , his second perhaps might be more fortunate . He may extend his list to a greater number in the order of his preference , so that if the names which stand near the top of the list either can not make up the quota , or are able to make it up without his vote , the vote may still be used for some one whom it may assist in returning . To obtain the full number of members required to complete the House , as well as to prevent very popular candidates from engrossing nearly all the suifrages , it is necessary , however many votes a candidate may obtain , that no more of them than the quota should ba counted for his return ; the remainder of those who voted for him would have their votes counted for the next person on their respective lists who needed them , and could by their aid complete the quota . To determine which of a candidate 's votes should be used for his return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed , into which . we shall not here enter . He would , of course , retain the votes of all those who would not otherwise be represented ; and for the remainder , drawing lots , in default of better , would be an unobjectionable expedient . The voting papers would be conveyed to a central office , where the votes would be counted , the number of first , second , third , and // other votes given for each candidate ascertained , and the quota would be allotted to every one who could make it up , until the number of the House was complete ; first votes being preferred to second , second to third , and so forth . The voting papers , and all the elements of the calculation , would be placed in public repositories , accessible to all whom they concerned ; and if any one who had obtained the quota was not duly returned , it would be in his power easily to prove it . " - pp. 151-155 . As regards the right of suffrage , Mr. Mill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small capitation tax . He deprecates , however , the extension of the suffrage to those who are too ignorant to vote intelligently , and proposes as a test that the applicant for registration as a voter be required to copy a sentence from an English book , and to perform a sum in the rule of three , ' ' - the last a provision which , we apprehend , would disfranchise some of the younger graduates of our universities , that useful rule having been dropped from the greater part of our treatises on arithmetic . Mr. Mill is in favor of granting two or more votes to persons who have attained certain prescribed standards of education , as to the alumni of universities and high schools , and the members of the liberal professions . This principle , though intrinsically reasonable , would be attended with too many practical difficulties , and with too many unjust discriminations , to find or to merit adoption . Thus there are many among those commonly termed " self-educated , " whose attainments in knowledge are larger and more valuable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned professions ; and there are not a few of the comparatively uneducated , whose conversance with affairs , shrewd judgment of men and measures , and sound discretion , would render their just claim to a plural vote superior to that of many persons of high reputation for such learning as is derived from books alone . Mr. Mill contends earnestly , and on grounds that are not easily set aside , for the admission of women to the right of suffrage . If they have independent property of their own , it is hard to deny them the privilege of representation in the body which protects their property and levies exactions upon it . They , in all civilized countries , possess at least as high an // average degree of intelligence as their husbands , fathers , and brothers , and are more likely to cast their votes under the restraint and guidance of a discriminating conscience . They have already decided political opinions , and exert a strong influence upon the voters . This influence is now employed without the governing check of personal responsibility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were this check felt in its full force . The other civil rights of women were long merged in the heathenish idea of their inferiority and subserviency to the stronger sex ; but now unmarried women , in every civilized state , can hold property and form business relations on an even footing with men , and the tendency of recent legislation is toward the emancipation of married women from the legal disabilities of coverture . Why should not the same principle be extended to the suffrage , which would in the hands of women be far less liable to corruption than it is with the major part of those in whom this right is now Vested ? We acknowledge the force of these considerations , yet find ourselves unconvinced by them . But we can meet them only by what seems to us a reductio ad absurdurn . There is no argument for female suffrage which does not bear with equal weight in behalf of the opening of all official stations to female competition . The voter may surely be voted for . A wise woman is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many anile members who now encumber their places might , without disadvantage to the public service , make room for such representatives as could be furnished from the sisterhood of genius and talent . But if women be eligible to office , they can not be kept out of the scramble for office , and , as there are fewer lucrative employments open to them than to men , the number of placehunters among them will be increased in the same proportion . If there are any of our readers who would gladly see women holding every grade of official station , from the premier to the constable , haranguing at mass-meetings , soliciting votes and influence in bar-rooms , on wharves , and at street-corners , plying all the low arts of political hucksters , they must be men who have no homes of their own to shield from desecration . While we doubt not that our elections would be all the purer , // if such women as are the pride and joy of our lives , in casting their votes , threw their whole noble natures into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and stain and sin , the degradation and infamy , that would be drawn upon our households , and upon all the fountains of domestic virtue and happiness , by the inevitable concomitants and consequences of female suffrage . True , we must confess , with our author , women have an undoubted right to vote , and , we would add , to be candidates for votes ; but we are told , on very high authority , that all things which are lawful are hot expedient . Women have a right , beyond all question , to labor at the plough and the anvil , to reef topsails , to replace the stokers and brakemen on railroad cars , to run with fire-engines , and to do the hard and dirty work of society in general ; and when they claim these functions as privileges , or show themselves over-anxious to share them as burdens with their brethren , it will be time enough to vindicate for them their rights in the caucus , at the hustin gs , and as candidates for public office . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leave him perfectly untrammelled , we have in the book under review an able and well-considered chapter . The question is not as simple as at first sight it might seem . On the one side , it is justly urged that the representative is , or ought to be , chosen because he has culture and discernment which may fit him to see farther than his constituents , and that , even were it not so , his position at the centre of affairs and his free conference with men of various shades of opinion may enable him to exercise a more trustworthy judgment than he could attain in the perhaps remote and isolated district from which he is chosen . Then , too , by virtue of his election , he loses in part his local character , and becomes a legislator not for his own electoral district , but for the whole nation , and he is therefore bound to sacrifice not only sectional prejudices , but even sectional interests , to the public good . Moreover , if he has a conscience , he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not approve . If a mere mouthpiece is wanted for a district , the choice ought to fall , not on the wisest and best man , but on the man who has the minimum of independent opinion , conscience , // and will . Yet , on the other hand , it may be contended that each constituency , having its own shade of opinion , has a right to the fair and full representation of its favorite policy ; that each , having its own interests , has a right to the strong advocacy of these interests in the councils of the state , or nation ; and that , by the comparison of all opinions and the competition of all interests on the floor of the legislative assembly , there is created the highest probability that the truth will be elicited , and the general good promoted . On this ground , if it be not the representative 's duty to suppress his own judgment and to violate his own conscience , it may become his duty to resign in favor of one whose opinions coincide with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion . " As the general result of what precedes , we may affirm that actual pledges should not be required unless , from unfavorable social circumstances or family institutions , the electors are so narrowed in their choice as to be compelled to fix it on a person presumptively under the influence of partialities hostile to their interest : that they are entitled to a full knowledge of the political opinions and sentiments of the candidate , and not only entitled , but often bound , to reject one who differs from themselves on the few articles which are the foundation of their political belief : that , in proportion to the opinion they entertain of the mental superiority of a candidate , they ought to put up with his expressing and acting on opinions different from theirs on any number of things not included in their fundamental articles of belief : that they ought to be unremitting in their search for a representative of such calibre as to be intrusted with full power of obeying the dictates of his own judgment : that they should consider it a duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward placing men of this quality in the Legislature , and that it is of much greater importance to themselves to be represented by such a man than by one who professes agreement in a greater number of their opinions ; for the benefits of his ability are certain , while the hypothesis of his being wrong and their being right on the points of difference is a very doubtful one . " - pp. 246 , 247 . As to the abstract expediency of a second representative chamber , the question must be determined by the mode in which that chamber shall be constructed . If it is of similar composition with the larger and more popular assembly , it can 21* // do little except to render proceedings slower and more complicated . The cases of radical difference of opinion will seldom occur ; and when they do occur , it may be because the smaller body is more easily susceptible of corruption and sinister influence . If , however , an upper house can be so constructed as to bring into its composition a different and higher class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revision . Especially , could such a body be composed of experienced statesmen , of men who had borne important civil trusts , or of ex officio members drawn from the judicial or executive departments , it would serve as a permanent check on precipitate and unwise legislation , while in a popular government it could never long withstand the deliberate and continuous voice of the popular branch . A body thus constituted could not , indeed , emanate from the immediate suffrage of the people , yet would be indirectly created by their choice . It would be thus created , were it dependent on appointment by the executive from officials or ex-officials of certain grades , or were certain high functionaries to become members of it after having borne office for a term of years . It is thus created in our national government , the Senate being chosen by the State legislatures , which are elected by the people at large . If it be the tendency of the lower house to legislate in favor of a class , the upper house should , above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but think that the true principle on which an upper chamber should be constructed , is indicated in the word Senate , - a council of the elders . Progress toward an ideal standard , irrespective of vested rights , reasonable expectations , and a stable equilibrium of society , is the aim of young statesmen and legislators , while the old are characterized by a too fond conservatism , clinging to the idols of the past , no less than to what is worthy of being preserved and cherished . It is no doubt the will of Providence that social progress should be effected by successive generations , and through the ministry of the great reformer Death . But Providence also wills that the strong minds and noble hearts of each generation should for the most part remain loyal to the best views , the highest principles , the nearest approximate truths of their // early maturity ; that they should be leading and progressive forces in their youth and prime ; and that in after-life they should exercise the no less important fnnction of repressing precipitancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the old waymarks erect and visible till the new are firmly established and fully recognized . Thus the engineers and firemen of one generation become brakemen for the next , and were it not for their agency , the onward rush would be destructive , not progressive , and old institutions and principles would collapse and perish , with nothing worthy of confidence to supersede them . The most perfect government would be that in which these two elements should be combined , so as mutually to interact , to check , and by checking to aid , each other . If the whole body of electors were to choose the lower house , while only those beyond a certain age could vote for the upper , and if at the same time all persons of full age were eligible to the former , and only those who had reached the late meridian of life could be chosen to the latter , we should have a Senate worthy of the name and fit for the functions which the name implies . We know very well that such a suggestion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political theories , if sound and valid , may in process of time pass from Utopia into existing institutions , and any speculative view that has in it the elements of truth and right may be a candidate for future realization . As regards the method of voting , Mr. Mill maintains the intrinsic fitness of the open vote , as opposed to the secret ballot . This question is virtually settled as he would have it , where the forms originally designed to insure secrecy are retained . Nay , even the sealed envelope is translucent , and its contents can be hidden only by falsehood . At one of our city or town elections it is or may be as well known for whom each elector votes , as if he gave his suffrage by uttering aloud the candidate 's name ; and when an important contest is going on , reporters register every vote as it is laid in the ballot-bbx . This is , we believe , as it should be . Voting is not a private privilege , but a public duty , and the citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by personal mo // tives , but by such considerations as he need not hesitate to avow to the whole community . For an exclusive club or society the secret ballot is an appropriate mode of election ; for there one has an undisputed right to indulge personal preferences and dislikes , of which he would not wish to make a public exposition . A mere incompatibility of taste and temper between a candidate for a select society and ourselves , may be a justifying cause for our adverse vote , while it would not justify our open expressioxis of disesteem or antipathy ; and , on the other hand , we might honestly vote for the membership of one whom we should especially enjoy as a companion , even if there were good reasons for not making public proclamation of our preference . But private considerations have no rightful place in a political election . The citizen is bound to Vote , not for the man he likes best , but for him who in his opinion will do the best service to the state . The elector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a public servant , and , as such , he should divest himself of all those individual partialities and prejudices which are most appropriately locked up in his own bosom , and should vote even for the man he hates , if he be the man whom his state or country needs . All this will be readily admitted . But the question is , Which mode of election will be most likely to impress the elector with a just sense of the kind and measure of his responsibility ? Will not the secret ballot sustain in his mind continually the idea of voting as a private , personal transaction , and of his suffrage as his own perquisite , for the use of which he is accountable to no man ? And on the other hand , will not the external publicity of the act educate him to the consciousness of accountableness for it to the entire community , as an act which can be justified only so far as it is true to his convictions of general utility ? There is indeed one contingent evil attending public voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country . It is within the power of an employer to constrain by interested motives the votes of those who depend on him for subsistence ; and it is riot without precedent for hundreds of operatives , under the dictation of a single proprietor or agent , to cast their suifrages for the same candidate , it being distinctly understood that dismission from the service was the // only alternative . Nay , worst of all , in our navy-yards and public workshops , the most stringent system of coercion has been exercised , and we have been personally cognizant of the summary discharge from these establishments of skilful and industrious mechanics , on the alleged ground , and no other , of having voted in opposition to the party then in power . These things are flagrantly wrong ; but it must be remembered that two wrongs do not make a right , and because an honest voter may be persecuted for his honesty , it by no means follows that he should be encouraged to vote by stealth , as if he were performihg a guilty act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sought to coerce or intimidate voters under pain of exclusion from the means of subsistence , would be consigned to irrevocable infamy , even by his own party ; and the state or national administration that would degrade itself by such a procedure would seal its ruin by its crime . We care not how high a standard of intellectual or moral fitness is established for the voter . We should be glad to have struck off from the register the name of every man who can not read and write , of every convicted felon , of every common drunkard , of every bad man whose immorality could be recognized and defined in a statute of exclusion . But the entire freedom of the men who are suffered to vote should be so vigilantly guarded by law and by public opinion , that he who should invade that freedom would have life-long cause to rue his act . As to executive functionaries , Mr. Mill regards their election by the people as always unadvisable . His remarks do not , indeed , apply to the single executive head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place , immediately or indirectly , to the popular suffrage , - or we might say without alternative immediately ; for where , as in the United States , an electoral college intervenes , its members will be chosen with foreknowledge of their votes . Most departments of the executive service require peculiar adaptation , of which it would be impossible for the public at large to judge wisely . The supreme executive , who is responsible to the nation for the discharge of the public business , is fitly intrusted with the appointment of the heads of departments , and they , under // his control and approval , with that of their subordinates . But a far better system is that of competitive examinations , which has been recently introduced in England , and is understood to be already fully organized and in successful operation as to the civil service in India , - in fine , a system not unlike that which , in the graduates from West Point , has furnished our regular army with thoroughly educated officers . According to this plan , the inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as they became vacant , to the young men of good character who appeared on examination to be the best-trained scholars in such departments of learning as would qualify them at once to perform and to adorn official functions of a high grade . From this initial stage the way might lie open through one or two more successive examinations to charges of a more important character , while those who have passed the last examination should be eligible to the most elevated posts in the gift of the executive . While this plan would more effectually than any other insure the faithful performance of public business , the collateral benefits that would result from it would far exceed even the great national advantage . It would abate the intolerable nuisance of office-seeking , and would restore to and leave in the walks of productive industry the multitudes who are lured from them by the hope of living from the public chest . It would relieve citizens at large from the still greater nuisance of the interference of public functionaries in elections , the activity and success of that interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that their own official incompetency , neglect , or malversation will be overlooked . At the same time , a healthful stimulus would be given to popular education ; for the people would demand the means of educating their sons for public trusts , and the higher institutions under the charge of the state would be thus kept up to the standard required for furnishing successful competitors ; while private schools and academies of the same nominal grade could justify and prolong their existence only by reaching and maintaining the same standard . It can hardly be needful to speak of the untold evil accruing to the public service , no less than to the best interests // of society , from the brief and uncertain tenure of office in the subordinate departments of the executive administration . The worth of such a functionary grows with his years , and his ambition to excel can be sustained only by the assurance that his honorable endeavors will have their adequate and permanent recognition and reward . Of an elective judiciary , Mr. Mill expresses opinions similar to those which we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable sanction of Mr. Binney . We take pleasure in quoting on this subject the following paragraph . " Of all officers of government , those in whose appointment nny participation of popular suffrage is the most objectionable are judicial officers . While there are no functionaries whose special and professional qualifications the popular judgment is less fitted to estimate , there are none in whose case absolute impartiality , and freedom from connection with politicians or sections of politicians , are of anything like equal importance . Some thinkers , among others Mr. Bentham , have been of opinion that , although it is better that judges should not be appointed by popular election , the people of their district ought to have the power , after sufficient experience , of removing them from their trust . It can not be d ! nied that the irremovability of any public officer to whom great interests are intrusted is in itself an evil . It is far from desirable that there should be no means of getting rid of a bad or incompetent judge , unless for such misconduct as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a functionary onSwhom so much depends should have the feeling of being free from responsibility except to opinion and his own conscience . The question , however , is , whether , in the peculiar position of a judge , and supposing that all practicable securities had been taken for an honest appointment , irresponsibility , except to his own and the public conscience , has not , on the whole , less tendency to pervert his conduct , than responsibility to the government or to a popular vote . Experience has long decided this point in the affirmative as regards responsibility to the executive , and the case is quite equally strong when the responsibility sought to be enforced is to the suifrages of electors . Among the good qualities of a popular constituency , those peculiarly incumbent upon a judge , calmness and impartiality , are not numbered . happily , in that intervention of popular suffrage which is essential to freedom they are not the qualities required . Even the quality of justice , though necessary to all human beings , and therefore to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . Justice and impar // tiality are as little wanted for electing a member of Parliament as they can be in any transaction of men . The electors have not to award something which either candidate has a right to , nor to pass judgment on the general merits of the competitors , but to declare which of them has most of their personal confidence , or best represents their political convictions . A judge is bound to treat his political friend , or the person best known to him , exactly as he treats other people ; but it would be a breach of duty , as well as an absurdity , if an elector did so . No argument can be grounded on the beneficial effect produced on judges , as on all other functionaries , by the moral jurisdiction of opinion ; for even in this respect , that which really exercises a useful control over the proceedings of a judge , when fit for the judicial office , is not ( except sometimes in political cases ) the opinion of the community generally , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be duly estimated , the bar of his own court . I must not be understood to say that the participation of the general public in the administration of justice is of no importance ; it is of the greatest ; but in what manner ? By the actual discharge of a part of the judicial office in the capacity of jurymen . This is one of the few cases in politics in which it is better that the people should act directly and personally than through their representatives , being almost the only case in which the errors that a person exert*ising authority may commit can be better borne than the consequences of making him responsible for them . If a judge could be removed from office by a popular vote , whoever was desirous of supplanting him would make capital for that purpose out of all his judicial decisions ; would carry all of them , as far as he found practicable , by irregular appeal , before a public opinion wholly incompetent , for want of having heard the case , or from having heard it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing ; would play upon popular passion and prejudice where they existed , and take pains to arouse them where they did not . And in this , if the case were interesting , and he took sufficient trouble , he would infallibly be successful , unless the judge or his friends descended into the arena , and made equally powerful appeals on the other side . Judges would end by feeling that they risked their office upon every decision they gave in a case susceptible of general interest , and that it was less essential for them to consider what decision was just , than what would be most applauded by the public , or would least admit of insidious misrepresentation . The practice introduced by some of the new or revised State Constitutions in America , of submitting judicial o icers to periodical popular re-election , will be found , I apprehend , to be one of the most dangerous errors ever yet committed // by democracy ; and , were it not that the practical good sense which never totally deserts the people of the United States is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time to lead to the retraction of the error , it might with reason be regarded as the first great downward step in the degeneration of modern democratic government . " - pp. 273-277 . In a chapter on " Federal Representative Governments , " Mr. Mill reveals a singularly*clear comprehension of the nature and working of our Federal Constitution . In his view , the Supreme Court of the United States is an anomalous feature of our system , and , writing before the present rebellion , he evidently thinks that here lies the weakest point of our body politic . He , in common with M. de Tocqueville , ascribes the deference which has thus far been paid to the decisions of that court to the fact that it has been wont , not to promulgate general dicta on constitutional or international law , but simply to deal with an actual case in hand , and to decide only such points in a general issue as apply to that particular case . He speaks of the Dred Scott decision as the first instance of marked and broad departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening peril to the Union ; and he adds , with too just prescience , " The main pillar of the American Constitution is hardly strong enough to bear many more such shocks . " The concluding chapter of this volume treats " Of the Government of Dependencies by a Free State . " We have not time to give a full sketch of this chapter . Suffice it to say , that the author approves of granting the largest possible measure of self-government to dependencies occupying the same plane of intelligence and capacity with the mother country , and that he admits the almost inevitable danger of misgovernment when a less civilized race , like the Ilindoos , depends for its laws on the legislation , and for its local rulers on the selection , of a government which has its seat on another continent . We close our too brief and cursory notice of the volume by an extract with reference to the administration of affairs in India . " It is not by attempting to rule directly a country like India , but by giving it good rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . // country ; and they can scarcely give it a worse one than an English cabinet minister , who is thinking of English , not Indian , politics ; who does not remain long enough in office to acquire an intelligent interest in so complicated a subject ; upon whom the factitious public opinion got up in Parliament , consisting of two or three fluent speakers , acts with as much force as if it were genuine ; while he is under none of the influences of training and position which would lead or qualify him to form an honest opinion of his own . A free country which attempts to govern a distant dependency , inhabited by a dissimilar people , by means of a branch of its own executive , will almost inevitably fail . The only mode which has any chance of tolerable success is to govern through a delegated body of a comparatively permanent character , allowing only a right of inspection and a negative voice to the changeable administration of the state . Such a body did exist in the case of India ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe penalty for the short-sighted policy by which this intermediate instrument of government was done away with . " It is of no avail to say that such a delegated body can not have all the requisites of good government ; above all , can not have that complete and over-operative identity of interest with the governed which it is so difficult to obtain even where the people to be ruled are in some degree qualified to look after their own affairs . Real good government is not compatible with the conditions of the case . There is but a choice of imperfections . The problem is , so to construct the governing body that , under the difficulties of the position , it shall have as much interest as possible in good government , and as little in bad . Now these conditions are best found in an intermediate body . A delegated administration has always this advantage over a direct one , that it has , at all events , no duties to perform except to the governed . It has no interests to consider except theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced - in the latest Constitution of the East India Company it was reduced - to a singularly small amount ; and it can be kept entirely clear of bias from the individual or class interests of any one else . When the home government and Parliament are swayed by such partial influences in the exercise of the power reserved to them in the last resort , the intermediate body is the certain advocate and champion of the dependency before the imperial tribunal . The intermediate body , moreover , is , in the natural course of things , chiefly composed of persons who have acquired professional knowledge of this part of their country 's concerns ; who have been trained to it in the place itself , and have made its administration the main occupation of their lives . Furnished with these qualifications , and not being liable // to lose their office from the accidents of home politics , they identify their character and consideration with their special trust , and have a much more permanent interest in the success of their administration , and in the prosperity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabinet under a representative constitution can possibly have in the good government of any country except the one which he serves . So far as the choice of those who carry on the management on the spot devolves upon this body , their appointment is kept out of the vortex of party and Parliamentary jobbing , and freed from the influence of those motives to the abuse of patronage for the reward of adherents , or to buy off those who would otherwise be opponents , which are always stronger with statesmen of average honesty than a conscientious sense of the duty of appointing the fittest man . To put this one class of appointments as far as possible out of harm 's way , is of more consequence than the worst which can happen to all other offices in the state ; for , in every other department , if the officer is unqualified , the general opinion of the community directs him in a certain degree what to do ; but in the position of the administrators of a dependency where the people are not fit to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government entirely depends on the qualifications , moral and intellectual , of the individual functionaries.
