txt OUT ON PICKET . ( *NE can hardly imagine a body of men more disconsolate than a regiment suddenly transferred from an adventurous life in the enemy 's country to the quiet of a sheltered camp , on safe and familiar ground . The men under my command were deeply dejected when , on a most appropriate day , - the First of April , 1863 ,  --  they found themselves unaccountably recalled from Florida , that region of delights which had seemed theirs by the right of conquest . My dusky soldiers , who based their whole walk and conversation strictly on the ancient Israelites , felt that the prophecies were all set at naught , and that they were on the wrong side of the Red Sea ; indeed , I fear they regarded even me as a sort of reversed Moses , whose Pisgah fronted in the wrong direction . Had they foreseen that the next occupation of the Promised Land was destined to require twenty regiments instead of two , and to culminate , after all , in the tragic battle of Olustee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their wonted cheerfulness . As it was , we were very glad to receive , after a few days of discontented repose on the very ground where we had been so happy , an order to go out on picket at Port Royal Ferry , with the understanding that we might remain there for some time This picket station was regarded as a sort of military picnic by the rebiments stationed at Beaufort , South Carolina ; it meant blackberries and oysters , wild roses and magnolias , flowery lanes instead of sandy barrens , and a sort of guerilla existence in place of the camp routine . To the colored soldiers especially , with their love of country life , and their extensive personal acquaintance on the plantations , it seemed quite like a Christmas festival . Besides , they would be in sight of the enemy , and who knew but there might , by the blessing of Providence , be a raid or a skirmish ? If they could not remain on the St. John 's River , it was something to dwell on the Coosaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , and though we " went out " several times subsequently , until it became an old story , the enjoyment never waned . And as even the march from the camp to the picket lines was something that could not possibly have been the same for any white regiment in the service , it is worth while to begin at the beginning and describe it . A regiment ordered on picket was expected to have reveille at daybreak , and to be in line for departure by sunrise . This delighted our men , who always took a childlike pleas*ire in being out of bed at any unreasonable hour ; and by the time I had emerged , the tents were nearly all struck ; and the great wagons were lumbering into cam ; ) to receive them , with whatever else was to be tran*ported . The first rays of the sun must faIl upon the line of these wagons , moving away across the x*ide parade-ground , followed by the column of men , who would soon outstrip them . But on the occasion which I especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once upon the sandy plain , neither camp nor town nor river could be seen in the dimness ; and when I rode forward and looked back , there was only visible the long , moving , shadowy column , seeming rather awful in its snake - like advance . There was a swaying of flags and multitudinous weapons that might have been camels ' necks for all one could see , and the whole thing might have been a caravan upon the desert . Soon we debouched upon the " Shell Road , " the wagon train drew on one side into the fog , and by the time the sun appeared the music ceased , the men took the " route step , " and the fun began . The " route step " is an abandonment of all military strictness , and nothing is required of the men but to keep fur abreast , and not lag behind . They are not required to keep step , though , with the rhythmical ear of our soldiers , they almost always instinctively did so ; talking and singing are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they eagerly availed themselves . On this day they were at the top of exhilaration . There was one broad grin from one end of the column to the other ; it might soon have been a caravan of elephants instead of caimels , for the ivory and the blackness the chatter and the laughter almost drowned the tramp of feet and the clatter of equipments . At cross-roads and plantation gates the colored people thronged to see us pass ; every one found a friend and a greeting . " how you do , aunt ) ' ? " " Huddy ( how d ' ye ) , Budder Benjamin ? " " How you find yourself dis mornin ' , Tittawisa ( sister Louisa ) ? " Such salutations rang out to everybody , known or unknown . In return , venerable kerchiefed matrons courtesied laboriously to every one , with an unfailing " Bre ss de Lord , budder . " Grave little boys , blacker than ink , shook hands with our laugh mb and utterly unmanageable drummers , who greeted them with this sure word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' war ! " Pretty mulatto girls ogled and coquetted , and made eyes , as // 273 Thackeray would say , at half the young fellows in the battalion . Meantime the singin * was brisk along the whole column , and when I sometimes reined up to see them pass , the chant of each company , entering my ear , drove out from the other ear the strain of the preceding . Such an odd mixture of things , military and missionary , as the successive waves of song drifted by ! First , " John Brown , " of course ; then , " What make old Satan for follow me so ? " then , " Marchinw Alono- " ; then " Hold your light on Canaan 's shore " ; then , " When this cruel war is over** ( a new favorite , sung by a few ) yielding presently to a grand burst of the favorite marching song among them all , and one at which every step instinctively quickened , so light and jubilant its rhythm , - " All true children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gwine in de svilderness , True believers gwine in de wilderness , To take away de sins ob de world , " - ending in a " Hoigh ! " after each verse , - a sort of Irish yell . For all the songs , but especially for their own wild hymns , they constantly improvised simple verses , with the same odd mingling ,  --  the little facts of to-day 's march being interwoven with the depths of theological gloom , and the same jubilant chorus annexed to all ; thus , - " XVe re gsvine to de Ferry , De bell done ringing ; Gwine to de landing , Dc bell done ringing ; Trust , believer , 0 , de bell done ringing ; Satan s behind me . De bell done ringing ; T is a misty morning , IDe bell done ringing ; 0 , de road am sandy , IDe bell done ringing ; Hell been open , Dc bell done ringing ; - and so on indefinitely . The little drum corps kept in advance , a jolly crew , their drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their heads . With them went the officers ' servant-boys , more uproarious still , always ready to lend their shrill treble to any song . At the head of the whole force there walked , by some self-imposed pre-eminence , a respectable elderly female , one of the company laundresses , whose vigorous stride we never could quite overtake , and who had an enormous bundle balanced on her head , while she waved in her hand , like a sword , a long-handled tin dipper . Such a picturesque medley of ftln , war , and music I believe no white regiment in the service could have shown ; and yet there was no straggling , and a single tap of the drum would at any moment bring order out of this seeming chaos . So we marched our seven miles out upon the smooth and shaded road , - beneath jasmine clusters , and great pine-cones dropping , and great bunches of mistletoe still in bloom among the branches . Arrived at the station , the scene soon became busy and more confused ; wagons were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fires made , while the " field and staff " could take possession of the abandoned quarters of their predecessors , and we could look round in the lovely summer morning to " survey our empire and behold our home . " The only thoroughfare by land between Beaufort and Charleston is the " Shell Road , " a beautiful avenue , which , about nine miles from Beaufort , strikes a ferry across the Coosaw River . War abolished the ferry , and made the river the permanent barrier between the opposing picket lines . For ten miles , right and left , these lines extended , marked by well-worn footpaths , following the endless windings of the stream ; and they never varied until nearly the end of the war . Upon their maintenance depended our whole foothold on the Sea Islands ; and upon that again finally depended the whole campaign of Sherman . But for the services of the colored troops , which finally formed the main garrison of the Department of the South , the Great March would never have been performed . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had exclusive military command . It was level , // 274 Ozd en Picket . but otherwise broken and bewildering to the last degree . No road traversed it , properly speaking , hut the Shell Road . All the rest was a wild medley of cypress swamp , pine barren , muddy creek , and cultivated plantation , intersected by interminable lanes and bridle-paths , through which we must ride day and night , and which our horses soon knew better than ourselves . The regiment was distributed at different stations , the main force being under my immediate command , at a plantation close by the Shell Road , two miles from the ferry , and seven miles from Beaufort . Our first picket duty was just at the time of the first attack on Charleston , under Dupont and Hunter ; and it was generally supposed that the Confederates would make an effort to recapture the Sea Islands . My orders were to watch the enemy closely , keep informed as to his position and movements , attempt no advance , and , in case any were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as possible , sending instant notice to head-quarters . As to the delay , that could be easily guaranteed . There were causeways on the Shell Road which a single battery could hold against a large force ; and the plantations were everywhere so intersected by hedges and dikes that they seemed expressly planned for defence . Although creeks wound in and out everywhere , yet these were only navigable at high tide , and at all other times were impassable marshes . There were but few posts where the enemy were within rifle range , and their occasional attacks at those points were soon stopped by our enforcement of a pithy order from General Hunter , " Give them as good as they send . " So that , with every opportunity for being kept on the alert , there was small prospect of serious danger ; and all promised an easy life , with only enough of care to make it pleasant . The picket station was therefore always a coveted post among the regiments , combining some undeniable importance with a kind of relaxation ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , and returned there several times afterwards , we got well acquainted with it . The whole region always reminded me of the descriptions of La Vend6e , and I always expected to meet Henri Larochejaquelein riding in the woods . How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life ? Our house possessed four spacious rooms and a piazza ; around it were grouped sheds and tents ; the camp was a little way off on one side , the negro quarters of the plantation on the other ; and all was immersed in a dense mass of waving and murmuring locust - blossoms . The spring days were always lovely , while the evenings were always conveniently damp ; so that we never shut the windows by day , nor omitted our cheerful fire by night . Indoors , the main head-quarters seemed like the camp of some party of young engineers in time of peace , only with a little female society added , and a good many martial associations thrown in . A large , low , dilapidated room , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scrawls of many predecessors , and with window-panes chiefly broken , so that the sashes were still open even when closed , - such was our home . The room had the picturesqueness which comes everywhere from the natural grouping of articles of daily use , - swords , belts , pistols , rifles , fieldglasses , spurs , canteens , gauntlets , - while wreaths of gray moss above the windows , and a pelican 's wing three feet long over the high mantel-piece , indicated more deliberate decoration . This and the whole atmosphere of the place spoke of the refining presence of agreeable women ; and it was pleasant when they held their little court in the evening , and pleasant all day , with the different visitors who were always streaming in and out ; - officers and soldiers on various business ; turbaned women from the plantations , coming with complaints or questionings ; fugitives from the mainland to be interrogated ; visitors riding up on horseback , // their hands full of jasmine and wildroses ; baby in her scarlet cloak , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumed with magnolias and the Southern pine . From the neighboring camp there was a perpetual low hum . Louder voices and laughter re-echoed , amid the sharp sounds of the axe , from the pine woods ; and sometimes , when the relieved pickets were discharging their pieces , there came the hollow sound of dropping rifleshots , as in skirmishing , - perhaps the most unmistakable and fascinating association that war bequeaths to the memory of the ear . Our domestic arrangements were of the oddest description . From the time when we began housekeeping by taking down the front door to complete therewith a little office for the surgeon on the piazza , everything seemed upside down . I slept on a shelf in the corner of the parlor , and undressed according to the weather ; if it was bright n*ooalight , so that nothing could happen , it was well to take my comfort ; if it was very dark and a trifle rainy , it seemed best to undress on Suwarrow 's method , by taking off one spur . Then the arrangements for ablution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook , which somehow got appropriated at once by the company laundresses ; but I had my revenge , for I took to bathing in the family - wash- tub . After all , however , the kitchen department had the advantage , for they used my solitary napkin to wipe the mess-table . As for food , we found it impossible to get chickens , save in the immature shape of eggs ; fresh pork was prohibited by the surgeon , and other fresh meat came rare ly . We could indeed hunt for wild turkeys , and even deer , but such hunting was found only to increase the appetite , without correspondin , supply . Still we had our luxuries , - large , delicious drumfish , and alligator steaks , - like a more substantial fried halibut , - which might have afforded the theme for Charles Lamb 's dissertation on Roast Pig , and by whose aid " for the first time in our lives we tasted crackling . " The post bakery yielded admirable bread ; and for vegetables and fruit we had very poor sweet potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest blackberries . For beverage , we had the vapid milk of that region , in which , if you let it stand , the water sinks instead of the cream 's risincr ; and the delicious sugar-cane syrup , which we had brought from Florida , and which we drank at all hours . Old Floridians say that no one is justified in drinking whiskey , while he can get cane-juice ; it is sweet and spirited , without cloying , foams like ale , and there were little spots on the ceiling of the dining-room where our lively beverage had popped out its cork . We kept it in a whiskey-bottle ; and as whiskey itself was absolutely prohibited among us , it was amusing to see the surprise of our military visitors when this innocent substitute was brought in . They usually liked it in the end , but , like the old Frencbwoman over her glass of water , wished that it were a sin to give it a relish . As the foaming beakers of molasses and water were handed round , the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbibing , and would then quaff the beverage , some with gusto , others with a slight after-look of dismay . But it was a delicious and cooling drink , while it lasted ; and at all events was the best and the worst we had . We used to have reveille at six , and breakfast about seven ; then the mounted couriers began to arrive from half a dozen different directions , with written reports of what had happened during the night ,  --  a boat seen , a picket fired on , a battery erecting . These must be consolidated and forwarded to headquarters , with the daily report of the command , - so many sick , so many on detached service , and all thc rest . This was our morning newspaper , our Herald and Tribune ; I never got tired of it . Then the couriers must be furnished with countersign and instructions , and sent off again . Then Baby* the Baby of the Regiment , made her appearance , to be kissed and tossed for // a few moments , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various rides , all disguised as duty ; one to inspect pickets , one to visit a sick soldier , one to build a bridge or clear a road , and still another to headquarters for ammunition or commissary stores . Galloping through green lanes , miles of triumphal arches of wild roses , - roses pale and large and fragrant , mingled with great boughs of the white cornel , fantastic masses , snowy surprises , - such were our rides , ranging from eight to fifteen and even twenty miles . Back to a late dinner with our various experiences , and perhaps specimens to match ; - a thunder-snake , eight feet long ; a live opossum , with the young clinging to the natural pouch ; an armful of great white , scentless pondlilies . After dinner , to the tangled garden for rose-huds or early magnolias , - whose cloying fragrance will always bring hack to me the full zest of those summer days ; then dress-parade and a little drill as the day grew cool . In the evening , tea ; and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - chess , cards , - perhaps a little music hy aid of the assistant surgeon 's melodeon , a few pages of Jean Paul 's " Titan , " almost my only hook , and carefully husbanded , - perhaps a mail , with its infinite felicities . Such was our day . Night brought its own fascinations , more solitary and profound . The darker they were , the more clearly it was our duty to visit the pickets . The paths that had grown so familiar by day seemed a wholly new labyrinth by night ; and every added shade of darkness seemed to shift and complicate them all anew , till at last man 's skill grew utterly baffled , and the clew must he left to the instinct of the horse . Riding beneath the solemn starlight , or soft , gray mist , or densest blackness , the fi-ogs croaking , the strange " chuckwill 's - widow " 6 his ominous note above my head , the mocking-bird dreaming in music , the great Southern fire-flies rising to the tree-tops , or hovering close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hoofs to avoid them ; through pine woods an ( l cypress swamps , or past sullen brooks , or white tents , or the dimly seen huts of sleeping ne * roes ; down to the glimmering shore , where black statues leaned against trees or stood alert in the pathways ; - never , though I live a thousand years , shall I forget the magic of those haunted nights . We had nocturnal boat service , too , for it was a part of our instructions to obtain all possible information about the enemy 's position ; and we accordingly , as usual in such cases , incurred a great many risks that harmed nobody , and picked up much information which did nobody any good . The centre of these nightly reconnoissances , for a long time , was the wreck of the George Washington , the story of whose disaster is perhaps worth telling . Till about the time when we went on picket , it had been the occasional habit of the smaller gunboats to make the circuit of Port Royal Island , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our position , but which the Rebels effectually stopped , a few days after our arrival , by destroying the army gunboat Geor6e Washington with a single shot from a light battery . I was roused soon after daybreak by the firing , and a courier soon came dashing in with the particulars . Forwarding these hastily to Beaufort , ( for we had then no telegraph , ) I was soon at the scene of action , five miles away . Approaching , I met on the picket paths man after man who had escaped from the wreck across a half-mile of almost impassable marsh . Never did I see such objects , - some stripped to their shirts , some fully clothed , but all having every garment literally pasted to their bodies with mud . Across the river , the Rebels were retiring , having done their work , but were still shelling , from greater and greater distances , the wood through which I rode . Arrived at the spot nearest the wreck , ( a point opposite to what we called the Brickyard Station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long stretch of marsh , out of which the forlorn creatures were still floundering . Here and there in the mud and reeds we could see the laboring heads , slowly advancing , and could hear excruciating cries from wounded men in the more distant depths . It was the strangest mixture of war and Dante and Robinson Crusoe . Our energetic chaplain coming up , I sent him with four men , under a flag of truce , to the place whence the worst cries proceeded , while I went to another part of the marsh . During that morning we got them all out , our last achievement being the rescue of the pilot , an immense negro with a wooden leg , - an article so particularly unavailable for mud travelling , that it would have almost seemed better , as one of the men suggested , to cut the traces , and leave it behind . A naval gun boat , too , which had originally accompanied this vessel , and should never have left it , now came back and took off the survivors , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It proved that the wreck was not aground after all , but at anchor , having foolishly lingered till after daybreak , and having thus given time for the enemy to bring down their guns . The first shot had struck the boiler , and set the vessel on fire ; after which the officer in command had raised a white flag , and then escaped with his men to our shore and it was for this flight in the wrong direction that they were shelled in the marshes by the Rebels . The case furnished in this respect some parallel to that of the Kearsarge and Alabama , and it was afterwards cited , I believe , officially or unofficially , to show that the Rebels had claimed the right to punish , in this case , the course of action which they approved in Semmes . I know that they always asserted thenceforward , that the detachment on board the George Washington had become rightful prisoners of war , and were justly fired upon when they tried to escape . This was at the time of the first attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly thither , and brought four regiments to reinforce Beaufort in a hurry , under the impression that the town was already taken , and that they must save what remnants they could . General Saxton , too , had made such capital plans for defending the post that he could not bear not to have it attacked so , while the Rebels brought down a force to keep us from taking the guns off the wreck , I was also supplied with a section or two of regular artillery , and some additional infantry with which to keep them from it ; and we tried to " make believe very hard , ' and rival the Charleston expedition on our own island . Indeed , our affair came to about as much , - nearly nothing , - and lasted decidedly longer ; for both sides nibbled away at the guns , by night , for weeks afterward , though I believe the mud finally got them ,  --  at least , we did not . We tried in vain to get the use of a steamboat or floating derrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we possessed to transfer anything so heavy to our small boats by night , while by day we did not bo near the wreck in anything larger than a " dug-out . " One of these nocturnal visits to the wreck I recall with peculiar gusto , because it brought back that contest with catarrh and coughing among my own warriors which had so ludicrously beset me in Florida . It was always fascinating to be on those forbidden waters by night , stealing out with muffled oars through the creeks and reeds , our eyes always strained for other voyagers , our ears listening breathlessly to all the marsh* sounds , - blackfish splashing , and little wakened reed-birds that fled wailing away over the dim river , equally safe on either side . But it always appeared to the watchful senses that we were making noise enough to be heard at Fort Sumter ; and somehow the victims of catarrh seemed always the most eager for any enterprise requiring peculiar caution . In this case , I thought I had sifted them beforehand ; // but as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to wheeze , and I turned upon him in exasperation . He saw his danger , and meekly said , " I wo n't cough , Cunnel ! " and he kept his word . For two mortal hours he sat grasping his gun , with never a chirrup . But two unfortunates in the bow of the boat developed symptoms which I could not suppress ; so , putting in at a picket station , with some risk I dumped them in mud knee-deep , and embarked a substitute , who after the first five minutes absolutely coughed louder than both the others united . Handkerchiefs , blankets , over-coats , suffocation in its direst forms , were all tried in vain , but apparently the Rebel pickets slept through it all , and we explored the wreck in safety . I think they were asleep , for certainly across the level marshes there came a nasal sound , as of the " Conthieveracy " in its slumbers . It may have been a bullfrog , but it sounded like a human snore . Picket life was of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sea Islands . We had a world of profuse and tangled vegetation around us , such as would have been a dream of delight to me , hut for the constant sense of responsibility and care which came between . Amid this preoccupation , Nature seemed but a mirage , and not the close and intimate associate I had before known . I pressed no flowers , collected no insects or birds ' eggs , made no notes on natural objects , reversing in these respects all previous habits . Yet now , in the retrospect , there seems to have been infused into me through every pore the voluptuous charm of the season and the place ; and the slightest corresponding sound or odor now calls back the memory of those delicious days . Being afterwards on picket at almost every season , I tasted the sensations of all ; and though I hardly then thought of such a result , the associations of beauty will remain forever . In February , for instance , - though this was during a later period of picket service ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shining haze " which marks our Northern May ; and the house was embowered in wild-plumblossoms , small , white , profuse , and tenanted by murmuring bees . There were peach - blossoms too , and the yellow jasmine was opening its multitudinous buds , climbing over tall trees , and waving from bough to bough . There were fresh young ferns and white bloodroot in the edges of woods , matched by snowdrops in the garden , beneath budded myrtle and Petis*orunz . In this wilderness the birds were busy ; the two main songsters being the mockingbird and the cardinal-grosbeak , which monopolized all the parts of our more varied Northern orchestra save the tender and liquid notes , which in South Carolina seemed unattempted except by some stray blue-bird . Jays were as loud and busy as at the North in autumn ; there were sparrows and wrens ; and sometimes I noticed the shy and whimsical chewink . From this early spring-time onward , there seemed no great difference in atmospheric sensations , and only a succession of bloom . After two months one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early rising bewilders the day . In the army one is perhaps roused after a bivouac , marches before daybreak , halts , fights , somebody is killed , a long day 's life has been lived , and after all it is not seven o'clock , and breakfast is not ready . So when we had lived in summer so long as hardly to remember winter , it suddenly occurred to us that it was not yet June . One escapes at the South that mixture of hunger and avarice which is felt in the Northern summer , counting each hour 's joy with the sad consciousness that an hour is gone . The compensating loss is in missing those soft , sweet , liquid sensations of the Northern spring , that burst of life and joy , those days of heaven that even April brings and this absence of childhood in the year creates a feeling of hardness in the season , like that I have suggested in the melody of the Southern birds . It seemed to me also that the woods had Out on Picket . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abound in the New England forest in early spring ; but there was something luscious , voluptuous , almost oppressively fragrant about the magnolias , as if they belonged not to Hebe , but to Magdalen . Such immense and lustrous butterflies I had never seen but in dreams ; and not even dreams had prepared me for *nci-flies . Almost too small to be seen , they inflicted a bite which appeared larger than themselves , - a positive wound , more torturing tha.n that of a mosquito , and leaving more annoyance behind . These tormentors elevated dress-parade into the dignity of a military engagement . I had to stand motionless , with my head a mere nebula of winged atoms , while tears rolled profusely down my face , from mere muscular irritation . Had I stirred a finger , the whole battalion would have been slapping its cheeks . Such enemies were , however , a valuable aid to discipline , on the whole , as they abounded in the guard-house , and made that institution an object of unusual abhorrence among the men . The presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the picket station a very popular resort while we were there . It was the one agreeable ride from Beaufort , and we often had a dozen people unexpectedly to dinner . On such occasions there was sometimes mounting in hot haste , and an eager search among the outlying plantations for additional chickens and eggs , or through the company kitchens for some of those villanous tin cans which everywhere marked the progress of our army . In those cans , so far as my observation went , all fruits relapsed into a common acidulation , and all meats into a similarity of tastelessness ; while the " condensed milk " was best described by the men , who often unconsciously stumbled on a better joke than they knew , and always spoke of it as condemned milk . We had our own excursions too , - to the Barnwell plantations , with their beautiful avenues and great live-oaks , the perfection of Southern beauty , - to Hall 's Island , debatable ground , close under the enemy 's fire , where half-wild cattle were to be shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the ferry , where it was fascinating to the female mind to scan the Rebel pickets through a field - glass . Our horses liked the by-ways far better than the level hardness of the Shell Road , especially those we had brought from Florida , which enjoyed the wilderness as if they had belonged to Marion 's men . They delighted to feel the long sedge hrush their flanks , or to gallop down the narrow wood-paths , leaping the fallen trees , and scaring the bright little lizards which shot across our track like live rays broken from the sunbeams . We had an abundance of horses , mostly captured and left in our bands by some convenient delay of the post quartermaster . We had also two side-saddles , which , not being munitions of war , could not properly ( as we explained ) be transferred like other captured articles to the general stock ; otherwise the P. Q. M. ( a married man ) would have showed no unnecessary delay in their case . For miscellaneous accommodation was there not an ambulance , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the merry to a feast or the wounded from a fray . " Ambulance " was one of those words , rather numerous , which Ethiopian lips were not framed by Nature to articulate . Only the highest stages of colored culture could compass it ; on the tongue of the many it was transformed mystically as " amulet , " or ambitiously as " epaulet , " or in culinary fashion as " omelet . " But it was our experience that an ambulance under any other name jolted equally hard . Beside these divertisements , we had more laborious vocations , - a good deal of fatigue , *nd genuine , though small , alarms . The men went on duty every third day at furthest , and the officers nearly as often , - most of the tours of duty lasting twenty-four hours , though the stream was considered to watch itself tolerably well by daylight . This 1867.1 279 // kind of responsibility suited the men ; and we had already found , as the whole army afterwards acknowledged , that the constitutional watchfulness and distrustfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after we went on picket , the commanding general sent an aid , with a cavalry escort , to visit all the stations , without my knowledge . They spent the whole night , and the officer reported that he could not get within thirty yards of any post without a challenge . This was a pleasant assurance for me ; since our position seemed so secure , compared with Jacksonville , that I had feared some relaxation of vigilance , while yet the safety of all depended on our thorough discharge of duty . Jacksonville had also seasoned the men so well that they were no longer nervous , and did not waste much powder on false alarms . The Rebels made no formal attacks , and rarely attempted to capture pickets . Sometimes they came stealing through the creeks in " dug-outs , " as we did on their side of the water , and occasionally an officer of ours was fired upon while making his rounds by night . Often some boat or scow would go adrift , and sometimes a mere dark mass of river-weed would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliciting a challenge and perhaps a shot from each . I remember the vivid way in which one of the men stated to his officer the manner in which a faithful picket should do his duty , after challenging , in case a boat came in sight . " Fus ' thing I shoot , and den I shoot , and den I shoot again . Den I creep-creep up near de hoat , and see who dey in em ; and s'pose anybody pop up he head , den I shoot again . S'pose I fire my forty rounds . I tink he hear at de camp and send more mans , " - which seemed a reasonable presumption . This soldier 's name was Paul Jones , a daring fellow , quite worthy of his namesake . In time , however , they learned quieter methods , and would wade far out in the water , there standing motionless at last , hoping to surround and capture these floating boats , though , to their great disappointment , the prize usually proved empty . On one occasion they tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickets after midnight , and hearing in the stillness a portentous snore from the end of the causeway ( our most important station ) , straightway hurried to the point of danger , with wrath in his soul . But the sergeant of the squad came out to meet him , imploring silence , and explaining that they had seen or suspected a boat hovering near , and were feigning sleep in order to lure and capture those who would entrap them . The one military performance at the picket station of which my men were utterly intolerant was an occasional flag of truce , for which this was the appointed locality . These farces , for which it was our duty to furnish the stock actors , always struck them as being utterly despicable , and unworthy the serious business of war . They felt , I suppose , what Mr. Pickwick felt , when he heard his counsel remark to the counsel for the plaintiff , that it was a very fine morning .
