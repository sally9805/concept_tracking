qwq // beauty was the mother : the aged grand-dame was the child : that was really all . But there are certain thoughts upon which you can vaguely brood for a long time . You remember reading how upon a day , not many years since , certain miners , working far under ground , came upon the body of a poor fellow who bad perished in the suffocating pit forty years before . Some chemical agent , to which the body had been subjected-an agent prepared in the laboratory of nature-had effectually arrested the progress of decay . They brought it up to the surface : and for a while , till it crumbled away , through exposure to the atmosphere , it lay there , the image of a fine sturdy young man . No convulsion had passed over the face in death : the features were tranquil ; the hair was black as jet . No one recognized the face : a generation had grown up since the day on which the miner went down his shaft for the last time . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage at hearing the news , came up : and she knew again the face which through all these years she had never quite forgot . The poor miner was to have been her husband the day after that on which he died . They were rough people , of course , who were looking on : a liberal education and refined feelings are not deemed essential to the man whose work it is to get up coals , or even tin : but there were no dry eyes there when the grayheaded old pilgrim cast herself upon the youthful c.orpse , and poured out to its deaf a ear many words of endearment , unused for forty years . It was a touching contrast : the one so old , the other so young . They had both been young , these long years ago : but time had gone on with the living , and stood still with the dead . It is difficult to account for the precise kind and degree of feeling with which we should have witnessed the little picture . I state the fact : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of my principle , that a certain vague pensiveness is the result of musing upon the lapse of time ; and a certain undefinable pathos of any incident which brings strongly home to us that lapse and its effects . " In silence Matthcw lay , and eyed The spring beneath the tree : And thus the dear old man replied , The gray-haired man of glee : CONCERNING GROWING OLD . Twill murmur on a thousand years , And flow as now it flows . " And here , on this delightful day , I can not choose but think how oft , a vigorous man , I lay Beside this fountain 's brink . " My eyes are dim with childish tears , My heart is idly stirred , For the same sound is in my ears Which in those days I heard . ' " That is really the sum of what is to be said on the subject . And it has always appeared to me that Mr. Dickens has shown an amount of philosophical insight which does not always characterize him , when he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Mr. Roker , who was a turnkey in the Fleet Prison . I do not know why it should be so ; but these words are to me more strikingly truthful than almost any others which the eminent author ever produced " You remember Tom Martin , Neddy * Bless my dear eyes , ' said Mr. Roker , shaking his head slowly from side to side , and gazing abstractedly out of the grated window before him , as if he were fondly recalling some peacefal scene of his early youth , it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal-heaver down at the Fox-under-the-Hill , by the wharf there . I think I can see him now , a coming up the Stran&amp; between two street-keepers , a little sobered by the bruising , with a patch o ' winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid , and that crc lovely hull-dog , as pinned the little boy arterwards , a following at his heels . What a rum thing Time is , ai nt it , Neddy ' ? ' " Here we find , truthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a more pleasing picture , perhaps , that comes back upon us in startling freshness , making us wonder if it is really so long ago since then , and our sentiment with regard to time is more elegantly expressed ; but it really comes to this . You can say no more of time than that it is a strange , undefinable , inexplicable thing ; and when , by some caprice of memory , some long-departed scene comes vividly back , what more definite thing can you do than just shake your head , and gaze abstractedly , like Mr. iRoker ? Like distant bells upon the breeze , some breath from childhood shows us pleinly for a moment the little thing that was ourself . What more can you do but look at the picture , and feel that it is strange P More important things have been forgotten ; but you remember how , when you were four years old , you ran a race along a path with a green slope beside it , and watched the small shadow keeping pace with you along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stay , that streamlet fearsIlow merrily it goes ' ? // recall the precise feeling with which you sat down in the railway carriage on the day when yqu first came home from school for the holidays , and felt the train glide away . And when these things return , what can you do but lean your head upon your hand , and vaguely muse and feel ? I have always much admired the truthful account of the small boy 's fancies , as he sits and gazes into the glowing fire " with his wee round face . " Mr. Ballantine is a true philosopher as well as a true poet . " For a ' sne sage he looks , what can the laddie ken* He 's TIIINiiIN ' UrON NAETUING , like mony mighty men ! " We can all " think of naething , " and think of it for a long time , while yet the mind is by no means a blank . It is very e*sy , in one sense , to grow old . You have but lo sit still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you old . But to grow old wisely and genially , is one of the most difficult tasks to which a human being can ever set himself . It is very hard to make up your mind to it . Some men grow old , struggling and recalcitrating , dragged along against their will , clinging to each birthday as the drowning man catches at an overhanging bough . Some folk grow old , gracefully and fittingly . I think that , as a general rule , the people who least reluctantly grow old , are worthy men and women , who see their children growing up into all that is good and admirable , with equal steps to those by which they feel themselves to be growing downward . A better , nobler , and happier self , they think , will take their place ; and in all the success , honor , and happiness of that new self , they can feel a purer and worthier pride than they ever felt in their own . But the human being who has no one to represent him wl*cn he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of his going as long as may be . It seems to be a difficult thing to hit the medium between clinging foolishly to youth and making an affected parade of nge . Entire naturalness upon this subject appears to be very hard of attainment . You know how many people , men as well as women , pretend to be younger than they really are . I have found various motives lead . to this pretence . I have known men , distinguished at a tolerably early age in some walk of intellectual exertion , who in announcing their age ( which they frequently did without any necessity ) , were wont to deduct three or five years from the actual tale , plainly with the intention of making their talent and skill more remarkable , by adding the element of these being developed at a wonderfully early stage of life . They wished to be recognized as infant phenomena . To 133 be an eloquent preacher is always an excellent thing ; but how much more wonderful if the preacner be no more than twentytwo or twenty-three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the foolish parent pats hi* child 's head with special exultation , as he tells you that his child , who has just repeated that popular poem , is no more than two years old . It is not improbable that the child 's real nge is two years and eleven months . It is very likely that the preacher 's real age is twentyeight . I remember hearing of a certain clerical person who , presuming on a very youthful aspect , gave himself out as twenty-four , when in fact he was thirty . I happened accidentally to see the register of that individual 's baptism , which took place five years before the period at which he said he was born . The fact of this document 's existence was made known to the man , by way of correcting his singular mistake . He saw it ; but he clung to the fond delusion ; and a year or two afterwards I read with much amusement in a newspaper some account of a speech made by him , into which account was incorporated an assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youthful orator was no more than twentyfour ! Very , very contemptible , you say ; and I entirely agree with you . And apart from the dishonesty , I do not think that judicious people will value very highly the crude fruit which has been forced to a certain ripeness before its time . Let us have the mature thing . Give us intellectual beef rather than intellectual veal . In the domain of poetry , great things have occasionally been done at a very early age ; for you do not insist upon sound and judicious views of life in poetry . For plain sense and practical guidance , you go elsewhere . But in every other department of literature , the value of a production is in direct proportion to the amount of the experience which it embodies . A man can speak with authority only of that which he has himself felt and known . A man can not paint portraits till he has seen faces . And all feeling , and most moods of mind , will be very poorly described by one who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young yourself , you may read with sympathy the writings of very young men ; but when you have reached maturity , and learned by experience the details and realities of life , you will be conscious of a certain indefinable want in such writings . And I do not know that this defect can be described more definitely than by saying that the entire thing is veal , not beef . You have the immature animal . You have the " berries harsh and crude . " But long after the period at which it 18 // possible to assume the position of the infant phenomenon , you still find many men anxious to represent themselves as a good deal younger than they are . To the population of Britain generally , ten years elapse before one census is followed by the next ; but some persons , in these ten years , grow no more than two or three years older . Let me confess to an extreme abhorrence of such men . Their conduct affects me with an indescribable disgust . I dislike it more than many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such men are , in the essential meaning of the word , humbugs . They are shams ; impostures ; false pretences . They are an embodied falsehood ; their very personality is a lie ; and you do n't know what about them may next prove to be a deception . Looking at a man who says he is forty-three when in fact he is above sixty , I suspect him all over . I am in doubt whether his hair , his teeth , his eyes , are real . I do not know whether that breadth of chest be the development of manly bone and muscle , or the skilful padding of the tailor . I am not sure how much is the man , and how much the work of his valet . I suspect that his whiskers and moustache are dyed . I look at his tight boots , and think how they must be tormenting his poor old corny feet . I admire his affected buoyancy of manner , and think how the miserable creature must collapse when he finds himself alone , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on the stretch , and carry on that wretched acting . When I see the old reptile whispering in a corner to a girl of eighteen , or furtively squeezing her in a waltz , I should like extremely to take him by the neck , and shake him till he came into the pieces of which he is made up . And when I have heard ( long ago ) such a one , with a hideous gloating relish telling a profane or indecent story ; or instilling cynical and impious notions of life and things into the minds of young lads ; or ( more disgusting still ) using phrases of double meaning in the presence of innocent young women , and enjoying their innocent ignorance of his sense ; I have thought that I was beholding as degraded a phase of human nature as you will find on the face of this sinful world . 0 venerable age ; gray , wise , kindly , sympathetic ; before which I shall never cease reverently to bend , respecting even what I may ( wrongly perhaps ) esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that foul , old leering satyr ! And if there be a thing on earth that disgusts one more than even the thought of the animal himself , it is to think of ministers of religion ( prudently pious ) who will wait meekly in his ante-cbamber and sit humbly at his table , because he is an earl or a duke ! But though all this be so , there is a sense in which I interpret the clinging to youth , in which there is nothing contemptible about it , but much that is touching and pleasing . I abominate the padded , rouged , dyed old sham ; but I heartly respect the man or woman , pensive and sad , as some little circumstance has impressed upon them the fact that they are growing old . A man or woman is a fool , who is indignant at being called the old lady or the old gentleman when these phrases state the truth ; but there is nothing foolish or unworthy when some such occurrence brings it home to us , with something of * shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , and that the innocent and impressionable days of childhood ( so well remembered ) are beginning to be far away . We are drawing nearer , we know , to certain solemn realities of which we speak much and feel little ; the undiscovered country ( humbly sought through the pilgrimage of life ) is looming in the distance before . We feel that life is not long , and is not commonplace , when it is regarded as the portal to eternity . And probably nothing will bring back the season of infancy and early youth upon any thoughtful man 's mind so vividly as the sense that he is growing old . How short a time since then ! You look at your great brown hand . It seems but yesterday since a boy-companion ( gray now ) tried to print your name upon the little paw , and there was not room . You remember it ( is it five-and-twenty years since ? ) as it looked when laid on the head of a friendly dog , two or three days before you found him poisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bury him in the garden under an apple-tree . You see , as plainly as if you saw it now , his brown eye , as it looked at you in life for the last time . And as you feel these things , you quite unaffectedly and sincerely put off , time after time , the period at which you will accept it as a fact , that you are old . Twentyeight , thirty , thirty-five , forty-eight , mark years on reaching which you will still feel yourself young ; many men honestly think that sixty-five or sixty-eight is the prime of life . A less amiable accompaniment of this pleasing belief is often found in a disposition to call younger men ( and not very young ) boys . I have heard that word uttered in a very spiteful tone , as though it were a name of great reproach . There are few epi* thets which I have ever heard applied in a manner betokening greater bitterness , than that of a clever lad . You remember how Sir Robert Walpole hurled the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Johnson for him ) defended himself with // great force of argument against the imputation . Possibly in some cases envy is at the root of the matter . Not every man has the magnanimity of Sir Buiwer Lytton , who tells us so frankly and so often how much he would like to be young again if he could . To grow old is so serious a matter , that it always appears to me as if there were something like profanation in putting the fact or its attendant circumstances in a ludicrous manner . It is not a fit thing to joke about . A funny man might write a comic description of the way in which starving sailors on a raft used up their last poor allotments of bread and water , and watched with sinking hearts their poor stock decrease . Or he might record in a fashion that some people would laugh at , the gradual sinking of a family which had lost its means through degree after degree in the social scale , till the workhouse was reached at last . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of a human being giving up hold after hold to which he had clung , and sinking always lower and lower ; and there is no doubt that , in a physical sense , we soon come to do all that in the process of growing old . And though you may put each little mortification , each petty coming down , in a way amusing to bystanders , it should always be remembered that each may imply a severe pang on the part of the man himself . We smile when Mr. Dickens tells us concerning his hero , Mr. Tupman , that " Time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form ; the black silk *vaistcoat had become more and more developed ; inch by inch had the gold watch-chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman 's vision ; and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat ; hut the soul of Tupman had known no change . " Now , although Mr. Tupman was an exceedingly fat man physically , and morally ( to say the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that as each little circumstance had occurred which his biographer has recorded , it would be a very serious circumstance in the feeling of poor Tupman himself . And this not nearly so much for the little personal mortification implied in each step of expanding bulk and lessening agility , but because each would be felt as a milestone , marking the progress of Tupman from his cradle to his grave . Each would be something to signify that the innocence and freshness of childhood were left so much further behind , and that the reality of life was growing more hard and prosaic . It is some feeling like this which makes it a sad thing to lay aside an old coat which one has worn for along time . Itis a decided step . Of course we all know that time goes on as fast when its progress is unmarked as when it is noted .. And each day that the coat went on was an onward stage as truly as the day when the coat went off ; but in this world we must take things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very strongly appeals to our feeling in a decided beginning or a decided ending . Do not laugh , thoughtless folk , at the poor old maid , who persists in going bareheaded long after she ought to have taken to caps . You can not know how much further away that change would make her days of childhood seem : how much more remote and dim and faint it would make the little life , the face , the voice of the young brother or sister that died when they both were children together . Do not fancy that it is mere personal vanity which prompts that clinging to apparent youth : feelings which are gentle , pure , and estimable may protest against any change fiom the old familiar way . Do not smile at the phrases of the house when there are gray-headed boys , and girls on the lower side of forty-five : it would be a terrible sacrifice , it would make a terrible change , to give up the old names . You thoughtless young people are ready to deride Mr. Smith when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , when poor Smith went to Truefitt 's to get it , he thought many thoughts of the long-departed mother , whom he remembers dimly on her sick-bed smoothing down her little boy 's hair , thick enough then . And when you see Mr. Robinson puffing up the hill with purpled face and laboring breath , do you think that poor Robinson does not remember the days when he was the best runner at school ? Perhaps he tells you at considerable length about these days . Well , listen patiently : some day you may be telling long stories too . There , is a peculiar sadness in thinking of exertions of body or mind to which we were once equal , but to which we are not equal now . You remember the not very earnest Swift , conscious that the " decay at the top " had begun , bursting into tears as he read one of his early works , and exclaiming , " Heavens , what a genius I had when I wrote that U ' What is there more touching than the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair through the rooms at Abbotsford , and suddenly exclaiming , " Come , this is sad idleness , " and insisting on beginning to dictate a new tale , in which the failing powers of the great magician appeared so sadly , that large as its marketable value would have been , it never was suffered to appear in print . Probably the sense of enfeebled faculties is a sadder thing than the sense of diminished physical power . Probably Sir Isaac Newton , in his later days , 135 // when he sat down to his own mathematical demonstrations , and could not understand them or follow them , felt more bitterly the wear of advancing time than the gray-headed Highlander sitting on a stone at his cottage door in the sunshine , and telling you how , long ago , he could breast the mountain with the speed of a deer ; or than the crippled soldier , who leans upon his crutch , and tells how , many years ago , that shaky old hand had cut down the French cuirassier . But in either ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put forth , and work once done , which could not be done or put forth now . Change for the worse is always a sorrowful thing . And the aged man , in the respect of physical power , and the capacity for intellectual exertion , has " seen better days . " You do not like to think that in any respect you are falling off . You are not pleased at being told that ten years ago you wrote a plainer hand or spoke in a rounder voice . It is mortifying to find that whereas you could once walk at five miles an hour , you can now accomplish no more than three and a half . Now , in a hundred ways , at every turn , and by a host of little wounding facts we are compelled to feel as we grow old that we are falling off . As the complexion roughens , as the hair thins off , as we come to stoop , as we blow tremendously if we attempt to run , the man of no more than middle age is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wise man sadly conscious of a mental decadence too . Let us be thankful that if physical and intellectual decline must come at a certain stage of growing old , there are respects in which , so long as we live , we may have the comfort of thinking that we are growing better . The higher nature may daily be reaching a nobler development ; when " heart and flesh faint and fail , " when the clay tenement is turaing frail and shattered , the better part within may show in all moral grace as but a little lower than the angels . Age need not necessarily be " dark and unlovely , " as Ossian says it is ; and the conviction that in some respect , that in the most important of all respects , we are growing better , tends mightily to strip age of that sense of falling off which is the bitterest thing about it . And as the essential nature of growing old ; - its essence as a sad thing ; - lies in the sense of decadence , the conviction that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable us cheerfully to grow old . A man will contentedly grow fatter , balder , and puffier , if he feels assured that he is pushing on to eminence at the bar or in politics ; and if he takes his seat upon the woolsack even at the age of seventy-five , though he might now seek in vain to climb the trees he climbed in youth , or to play at leapfrog as then , still he is conscious that his life on the whole has been a progress ; that he is on the whole better now than he was in those days which were his best days physically ; that to be lord chancellor , albeit a venerable one , is , as the world goes , a more eminent thing than to be the gayest and most active of midshipmen . And so on the whole he is content to grow old , because he feels that in growing he has not on the whole been comng down hill . The supremely mortifying thing is , to feel that the physical decadence which comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever . We shall not mind much about growing less agile and less beautiful , if we think that we are growing wiser and better . The gouty but wealthy merchant , who hobbles with difficulty to his carriage , feels that after all he has made an advance upon those days in which , if free from gout , he was devoid of pence ; and if he did not hobble , he had no carriage into which he might get in that awkward manner . The gray-haired old lady who was a beauty once , is consoled for her growing old , if in her age she is admitted to the society of the county , while in her youth she was confined to the society of the town . Make us feel that we are better in something , and we shall be content to be worse in many things ; but it is miserable to think that in all things we are falling off , or even in all things standing still . A man would be very much mortified to think that at fifty he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he did at five-and-twenty . In many things he knows the autumn of life is a falling-off from its spring-time . He has ceased to dance ; his voice quavers abominably when he tries to sing ; he has no fancy now for climbing hills , and he shirks walks of forty miles a day . Perhaps deeper wrinkles have been traced by time on the heart than on the forehead , and the early freshness of feeling is gone . But surely , in mellowed experience , in sobered and sound views of things , in tempered expectations , in patience , in. sympathy , in kindly charity , in insight into God 's ways and dealings , he is better now a thousand times than he was then . He has worked his way through the hectic stage in which even able and thoughtful men fancy that Byron was a great poet . A sounder judgment and a severer taste direct him now ; in all things , in short , that make the essence of the manly nature , he is a better and further advanced man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , by many little signs , wE ARE GOING DOWN HILL ; the spiritual nature testifies by many 136 // noble gains and acquirements , WE ARE GOING ONWARD AND TJPWARD ! It seems to me that the clergyman 's state of feeling must be a curious one , who , on a fine Sunday morning , when he is sixty , can take out of his drawer a sermon which he wrote at five-andtwenty , and go and preach it with perfect approval and without the alteration of a word . It is somewhat mortifying , no doubt , to look at a sermon which you wrote seven or eight years since , and which you then thought brilliant eloquence , and to find that in your present judgment it is no better than tawdry fustian . But still , my friend , even though you grudge to find that you must throw the sermon aside and preach it no more , are you not secretly pleased at this proof how much your mind has grown in these years P It is pleasant to think that you have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your imagination are somewhat clipped indeed , and your style has lost something of that pith which goes with want of consideration . Some youthful judges may think that you have sadly fallen off ; but you are content in the firm conviction that you have vastly improved . It was veal then : it is beef now . I remember hearing with great interest how a venerable professor of fourscore wrote in the last few weeks of his life a little course of lectures on a certain debated point of theology . He had outgrown his former notions upon the subject . The old man said his former lectures upon it did not do him justice . Was it not a pleasant sight  --  the aged tree bearing fruit to the last P How it must have pleased and soothed the good man amid many advancing infirmities to persuade himself ( justly or unjustly ) that in the most important respect he was going onward still ! It is indeed a pleasant sight to kindly onlookers , and it is a sustaining and consoling thing to the old manhimself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this is not a common thing . As a general rule it can not be doubted that , intellectually , we top the summit sometime before fourscore , and begin to go down hill . I do not wish to turn my essays into sermons ; or to push upon my readers in Fraser things more fitly addressed to my congregation on Sundays : still , let me say that down is a very sad thing to feel or to see ,  --  I find great comfort in remembering that as regards the best and noblest of all characteristics , the old man may be progressmo ' to the last . In all those beautiful qualities which most attract the love and reverence of those around , and which fit for purer and happier company than can be found in this world , the aged man or woman may be growing still . In the last days , indeed , it may be ripening rather than growing : mellowing , not expanding . But to do that is to " grow in grace . " And doubtless the yellow harvest-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June . You may like better to look upon the wheat that is progressing towards ripeness ; but the wheat which has reached ripeness is not a falling offi The stalks will not bend now , without breaking : you rub the heads , and the yellow chaff that wraps the grain , crumbles off in dust . But it is beyond a question that there you see wheat at its best . Still , not forgetting this , we must all feel it sad to see human beings as they grow old , retrograding in material comforts and advantages . It is a mournful thing to see : a man grower poorer as he is growing older , or losing position in any way . If it were in my power , I would make all barristers , above sixty , judges . They ought to be put in a situation of dignity and independence . You do n't like to go into a court of justice , and there behold a thin , gray-headed counsel , somewhat shaken in nerve , looking rather frail , battling away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-andtwenty years his junior . The youthful , bigwhiskered , roaring , and bullying advocate is sure to be held in much the greater estimation by attorney 's clerks . The old gentleman 's day is over ; but with lessening practice and disappointed hopes he must drive on at the bar still . I wish I were a chief justice , that by special deference and kindliness of manner , I might daily soothe somewhat the feelings of that aging man . But it is especially in the case of the clergy that one sees the painful sight of men growing poorer as they are growing older . I think of the case of a clergyman who at his first start was rather fortunate : who gets a nice parish at six-and-twenty : I mean a parish which is a nice one for a man of six-andtwenty : and who never gets any other preferment , but in that parish grows old . Do n't we all know how pretty and elegant every thing was about him at first : how trim and weedless were his garden and shrubbery : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how neat though slight all his furniture : how graceful , merry , and nicely dressed the young girl who was his wife : how ( besides hosts of parochial improvements ) he devised numberless little changes about his dwelling : rustic bowers , mosshouses , green mounts , labyrinthine walks , fantastically trimmed yews , root-bridges over the little stream . But as his familyincreased , his income stood still . It was hard enough work to make the ends meet even at first , // though young hearts are hopeful : but with six or seven children , with boys who must be sent to college , with girls who must be educated as ladies , with the prices of all things ever increasing , with multiplying bills from the shoemaker , tailor , dressmaker ; the poor parson grows yearly poorer . The rosy face of the young wife has now deep lines of care : the weekly sermon is dull and spiritless : the parcel of books comes no more : the carpets grow threadbare but are not replaced : the furniture becomes creaky and rickety : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rustic verandah : the mosshouse falls much over to one side : the friends , far away , grow out of all acquaintance . The parson himself , once so precise in dress , is shabby and untidy now ; and his wife 's neat figure is gone : the servants are of inferior class , coarse and insolent : perhaps the burden of hopeless debt presses always with its dull , dead weight upon the poor clergyman 's heart . There is little spring in him to push off the invasion of fatigue and infection , and he is much exposed to both ; and should he be taken away , who shall care for the widow and the fatherless , losingat once their head , their home , their means of living ? Even you , non-clerical reader , know precisely what I describe : hundreds have seen it : and such will agree with me when I say that there is no sadder sight than that of a clergyman , with a wife and children , growing poor as he is growing old . Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might found , once for all , a fund that should raise forever above penury and degradation the widows and the orphans of rectory , vicarage , parsonage , and manse ! And even when the old man has none depending upon him for bread , to be provided from his lessening store , there is something inexpressibly touching and mournful in the spectacle of an old man who must pinch and screw . You do not mind a bit about a hopeful young lad having to live in humble lodgings up three pair of stairs ; or about such a one having a limited number of shirts , stockings , and boots , and needing to be very careful and saving as to his clothes ; or about his having very homely shaving-things , or hair-brushes which are a good deal worn out . The young fellow can stand all that : it is all quite right : let him bear the yoke in his youth : he may look forward to better days . Nor does there seem in the nature of things any very sad inconsistency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boots or great coat will last , or with what minimum of shirts he can manage to get on . But I can not bear the thought of a grayheaded old man , with shaky hand and weary limb , sitting down in his lonely lodging , and CONCERNING GROWING OLD . meditating on such things as these : counting his pocket-handkerchiefs , and suspecting that one is stolen ; or looking ruefully at a boot which has been cut where the upper leather joins the sole . Let not the aged man be worried with such petty details ! Of course , my reader , I know as well as you do , that very many aged people must think of these things to the last . All I say is , that if I had the ordering of things , no manor woman above fifty should ever know the want of money . And whenever I find a fourleaved shamrock , that is the very first arrangement I shall make . Possibly I may extend the arrangement further , and provide that no honest married man or woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little end is sometimes the grand object of a human being 's strivings through many weeks and months ! I sat down the other day in a poor chamber , damp with much linen drying upon crossinglines . There dwells a solitary woman , an aged and infirm woman , who supports herself by washing . For months past her earnings have averaged thrce shillings a week . Out of that sum she must provide food and raiment ; she must keep in her poor fire , and she must pay a rent of nearly three pounds a year . " It is hard work , sir , " she said : " it costs me many a thought getting together the money to pay my rent . " And I could see well , that from the year 's beginning to its end , the thing always uppermost in that poor old widow 's waking thoughts , was the raising of that great incubus of a sum of money . A small end , you would say , for the chief thoughts of an immortal being ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom a week has been a success , if at its close she can put by a few halfpence towards meeting the term day ? Would you not like to enrich her , to give her a light heart , by sending her a half-sovereign ? If you would , you may send it to me . It is well , I have said , for a man who is growing old , if he is able to persuade himself that though physically going downhill , he is yet in some respect progressing . For if he can persuade himself that he is progressing in any one thing , he will certainly believe that he is advancing on the whole . Still , it must be said , that the self-complacency of old gentlemen is sometimes amusing ( where not irritating ) to their juniors . The self-conceit of many old men is something quite amazing . They talk incessantly about themselves and their doings ; and , to hear them talk , you would imagin* that every great social or political change of late years had been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly man of fair average ability , declare in sober earnest , // that had he gone to the bar , he " had no circumstances : to go back , perhaps , to some hesitation in saying " that he would have place where he had lived many years before , been chancellor or chicf justice of England . and there , as Dr. Johnson expresses it , to qwq youthful r*.ader , and you will understand that truth and soberness ( how fitly linked together ) are noble things . If you are a good man-let me say it at once , a Christian man - your latter days are better a thousand times than those early ones after which superficial and worldly folk whimper . The capacity of excitement is much lessened ; the freshness of feeling and heart are much gone ; though not , of necessity , so very much . You begin , like the old grandmother in that exquisite poem of Mr. Tennyson , " to be a little weary ; " the morning air is hardly so exhilarating , nor the frosty winter afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disappointed that so little of the vernal joy comes with them ; you go and stand by the grave of your young sister on the anniversary of the day when she died , and you wonder that you have come to feel so little where once you felt so much . You preach the sermons you once preached with emotion so deep that it was contagious ; but now the corresponding feeling does not come ; you give them coldly ; you are mortified at the contrast between the warmth there is in the old words , and the chilliness with which you speak them . You hear of the death of a dear friend , and you are vexed that you can take it so coolly . But 0 my brother , aging like myself , do you not know , in sober earnest , that for such losses as these , other things have brought abundant recompense ? What a meaning there is now to you in the words of St. Austin- . " Thou madst us for Thyself , and our hearts are restless till they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that St. Paul was right , when ( even in the face of the fact that inexperienced youth is proverbially the most hopeful ) he declared that in the truest sense " experience waketh hope . " What a calm there is here ! Passion is no longer the disturbing force is once was . Your eyes are no longer blinded to the truth of things by the glittering mists of fancy . You do your duty quietly and hopefully . You can bear patiently with the follies and the expectations of youth . I say it with the firmest assurance of the truth of what I say , that as he grows old , the wise man has great reason to thank God that he is no longer young . Truth and soberness are well worth all they cost . You wont make a terrific fool of yourself any more . Campbell was not a philosopher , and possibly he was only half in earnest when he wrote the following verse ; but many men , no longer young , will know how true it is " hail , *velcomc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How wondrous to myself appears this halcyon calm of soul I 141 The wearied bird blown o'er the deep would sooner quit its shore , Than I would cross the gulf again that Time has brought me o'er ! " The dead are the only people that never grow old . There was something typical in the arrestment of time in the case of the youthful miner , of whom we have already spoken . Your little brother or sister that died long ago remains in death and in remembrance the same young thing forever . It is fourteen years this evening since the writer 's sister 's left this world . She was fifteen years old then-she is fifteen years old vet . I have grown older since then by fourteen years , but she has never changed as they advanced ; and if God spares me to fourscore , I never shall think of her as other than the youthful creat are she faded . The other day I listcncxl as a poor woman told of the death of her first-born child . He was two years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rope that came in the middle close to the ground . The boy was leaning on the rope , swinging backwards and forwards , and shouting with delight . The mother went into her cottage and lost sight of him for a minute ; and when she returned the little man was lying across the rope , dead . It had got under his chin : he had not sense to push it away ; and he was suffocated . The mother told me , and I believe truly , that she had never been the same person since ; but the thing which mainly struck me was , that though it is eighteen years since then , she thought of her child as an infant of two years yet : it is a little child she looks for to meet her at the gate of the Golden City . Had her child lived he would have been twenty years old now : he died , and he is only two : he is two yet : he will never be more than two . The little rosy face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been faintly remembered by the mother had they gradually died into boyhood and manhood ; but that day stereotyped them : they remain unchanged . Have you seen , my reader , the face that had grown old in life grow young after death ? The expression of many years since , lost for long , come out startlingly in the features , fixed and cold ? Every one has seen it : and it is sometimes strange how rapidly the change takes place . The marks of pain fade out , and with them the marks of age . I once saw an aged lady dle . She had borne sharp pain for many days with the endurance of a martyr ; she had to bear sharp pain to the very last . The features were tense and rigid with suffering ; they remained so while life remained . It was a beautiful sight to CONCERNING GROWING OLD . // see the change that took place in the very instant of dissolution . The features , sharp for many days with pain , in that instant recovered the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tense , tight look was gone . You saw the signs of pain go out . You felt that all suffering was over . It was no more of course than the working of physical law : but in that case it seemed as if there were a further meaning conveyed . CONCERNING GROWING OLD . And so it seems to me when the young look comes back on the departed Christian 's face . Gone , it seems to say , where the progress of time shall no longer bring age or decay . Gone where there are beings whose life may be reckoned by centuries , but in whom life is fresh and young , and always will be so . Close the aged eyes ! Fold the aged hands in rest . Their owner is no longer old !
