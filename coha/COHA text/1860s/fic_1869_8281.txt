English , Thomas Dunn , 1819-1902 : The Lost Cause . from Poems , in The Southern Amaranth ( 1869 ) Lost ! wherefore lost ? That is not lost forever , Which yields to numbers on the field of blood : For truth has many fields for her endeavor  --  Seas in their ebb can wait the hour of flood . Worn out by contest with a myriad foemen , If champions grow exhausted and despair , What then  --  if on some cloudy day the gnomon Points not the hour  --  the dial still is there . The clouds will pass  --  the skies , not always shrouded , Will gleam with glory , though to-day they lower , And then the dial , never more enshrouded , Will mark , and plainly mark , the triumph hour . Lost ! wherefore lost ? ' T is not because in battle Its friends were routed by o'erthronging foes , Not ' mid the cannon 's roar and musket 's rattle , Truth only deals its most effective blows . No cause is lost , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brute-force succumb  --  The sons , with pride , the fathers ' wrongs inherit , And they will speak  --  ' t is only brutes are dumb . The surest weapon is not gun or sabre , Cannon , nor rifle , when for truth we fight : A few fit words surpass the idiot 's jabber , Tongue , pen , and press , are potent for the right . Not always Sisyphus may fail , and glorious The hour that witnesses his labors o'er ; Let him roll on , he yet will be victorious , And on the summit rest to toil no more . Lost ! what is lost ? The lives , the gold , the labor Of thousands , given for four long , weary years ! The story goes from neighbor unto neighbor , From sire to son , but is not told with tears . It is not told with shame , nor heard with terror , How , for a principle , a people fought ; Not in the cause , there lay the evident error , But in the mode by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than bullets surer , As will be proven ere the strife is done : Truth , by discussion , finds her throne securer  --  The council closes what the sword began . Lost ! never lost ! a cause when those who love it , Laugh at misfortune , and reverse defy , Loses no hope when falsehood sits above it ,  --  It may be wounded , but it can not die . But yesterday the Austrian ruled in Venice : To-day , he sullen fires his parting gun ; Appeal to reason , and abandon menace , Time , firmness , patience , and the cause is won . English , Thomas Dunn , 1819-1902 : The Letter to the Dead . from Poems , in The Southern Amaranth ( 1869 ) " We remember at the Wilderness a gallant Mississippian had fallen , and at night , just before burying him , there came a letter from her he loved best . One of the group around his body  --  a minister  --  whose tenderness was womanly , broke the silent tearfulness with which he saw the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast of him whose heroic heart was still : ' Bury it with him . He will see it when he wakes . ' It was the sublimest sentence of his funeral service . "  --  N. O. Picayune . Comes the letter from a mother ? Are a sister 's longings there ? Or the fondness of another , Loved and loving , young and fair ? Seek not now to know the writer , Seek not whence or why it came ; As he died , his dimmed eyes saw her ; As he died he breathed her name . It has come o'er hills and valleys , Crossed o'er rivers , passed o'er lakes : " Bury it upon his bosom , He will see it when he wakes . " Bury the dead with the letter unread , There to remain , Till the soldier awakes from his slumber , To join in the battle again . Ah ! but never more to battle He will march by beat of drum ; Nevermore when fight is over Sigh for gentle peace to come ; Nevermore to roll-call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er sleeping comrades Strewn upon the chilly ground ; Nevermore the light words utter While his heart with sadness aches ; " Bury it upon his bosom , He will see it when he wakes . " Bury it deep with the soldier to sleep : There let it lie , While the green grass grows o'er the sleeper , And the world goes hurrying by . She who lingered as she wrote it O'er each tender word she penned , She perchance will find her sorrow With some later lover end . But for him those words of loving May survive when time is o'er , And , though she forget her fondness ? Greet him on the further shore , Cross his arms and close his eyelids , ' T is his slumber that he takes ; " Bury it upon his bosom , He will see it when he wakes . " Lay him to rest with the scroll on his breast , There , in the tomb , Till the startled dead shall awaken At the terrible day of doom .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
