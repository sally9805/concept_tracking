PITTS BURG . HERE are three cities readily acI cessible to the tourist , which are peculiar , - Quebec , New Orleans , and Pittsburg , - and of these Pittsburg is*the most interesting by far . In other towns the traveller can make up his list of lions , do them in a few hours , and go away satisfied ; but here all is curious or wonderful , - site , environs , history , geology , business , aspect , atmosphere , customs , everything . Pittsburg is a place to read up for , to unpack your trunk and settle down at , to ' make excursions from , and to study as you would study a group of sciences . To know Pittsburg thoroughly is a liberal education in " the kind of culture demanded by modern - times " On that low point of land , fringed now with steamboats and covered with grimy houses , scarcely visible in the November fog and smoke , modern history began . It began on an April day , one hundred and thirteen years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which secured North America to our race , and gave final pre-eminence in Europe to the Protestant powers . Bismarck 's recent exploits do but continue the work begun in is , when a French captain seized that point of land , and built Fort Duquesne upon it . From the windows of the Monongahela House , which stands near the site of the old fort , and within easy reach of the three rivers , the whole geography of the country can be spelled out on the sides of the steamboats . Here begins the Great West . We have reached the United States . Or , if it is political economy that you would know , behold it in operation ! Here it is , complete , illustrated , with errata in the form of closed factories and workmen on the strike . Whatever protection can do to force the growth of premature enterprises has here been done , undone , and done again ; and here , too , may be seen the legitimate triumphs of skill , fortitude , and pa VOL . XXI. - NO. 123. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy , nor the alteration of a decimal fraction at a custom-house impair . Brave and steadfast men have battled nobly here with the substances that offer the greatest resistance to our control , and which serve us best when subjugated ; and in the hills and valleys round about , nature has stored those substances away with unequalled profusion . Besides placing a thick layer of excellent bitvminous coal halfway up those winding heights , besides accumulating within them exhaustless supplies of iron , besides sinking under them unfathomable wells of oil and salt water , nature has coiled about their bases a system of navigable streams , all of which form themselves into two rivers , - the Alleghany and Monongahela ,  --  and at Pittshurg unite to form the Ohio , and give the *i1* access to every port on earth . It is chiefly at Pittsbuxg that the products of the Pennsylvania hills and mountains are converted into wealth and distributed over the world . The wonder is , not that Pittsburg is an assesiblage of flourishing towns of z*o*ooo inhabitants , but that , placed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourishing and the most populous city in America . This it might have been , perhnps , if the site had been ten level square miles , instead of two , and those two surrounded by steep hills four hundred feet high , and by rivers a third of a mile wide . It is curiously hemmed in , - that small triangle of low land upon which the city was originally built . A stranger walking about the streets on a summer afternoon is haunted by the idea that a terrific thunder-storm is hanging over the place . Every street appears to end in a huge black cloud , and there is everywhere the ominous darkness that creeps over the scene when ' a storm is approaching . When the traveller has satisfied himself that the black clowls 7 // Pittstherg. are only the smoke-covered hills that rise from each of the three rivers , still he catches himself occasionally quickening his steps , so as to get , back to his umbrella before the storm bursts . During our first stroll about the town , some years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only recovered from it after observing that the old ladies who sat knitting about the markets never stirred to get their small stock of small wares under cover . Pittsburg announces its peculiar character from afar off . Those who approach it in the night see before them , first of all , a black hill , in the side of which are six round flaming fires , in a row , like six fiery eyes . Then other black hills loom dimly up , with other rows of fires half-way up their sides ; and there are similar fiery dots in the gloom as far as the eye can reach . This is wonderfully picturesque , and excites the curiosity of the traveller to the highest point . He thinks that Pittsburg must be at work behind those fires , naked to the waist , with hairy chest and brawny arms , doing tremendous things with molten iron , or forging huge masses white-hot , amid showers of sparks . No such thing . These rows of fires , of which scofes can be counted from a favorable point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duty during the night , unattended . That duty is to convert the waste coal-dust at the mouths of the mines , where it has been accumulating for a century , into serviceable coke . These are almost the only fires about Pittsburg that are always burning , night and day , Sundays and holidays . The approach to the city by day is even more remarkable . The railroad from Cincinnati , after crossing the Ohio several miles below Pittsburg , has an arduous work to perform . Its general design is to follow the course of the river ; but as the river is always bending into the form of the letter S , and carrying the hills with it , the railroad is continually diving under the hills to make short cuts . This is unfavorable to the Uanuary , improvement of the traveller 's mind ; for the alternations from daylight to darkness are so frequent and sudden , that he is apt , at length , to lay aside his book altogether , and give himself up to the contemplation of the November drizzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point for which nine nations have contended , - France , England , the United States , and the I ' Six Nations . " Was there ever such a dismal lookout anywhere else in this world ? Those hills , once so beautifully rounded and in such harmony with the scene , have been cut down , sliced off , pierced , slanted , zigzagged , built upon , built under , until almost every trace of their former outline has been obliterated , without receiving from man 's hand any atoning beauty . The town lies low , as at the bottom of an excavation , just visible through the mingled smoke and mist , and every object in it is black . Smoke , smoke , smoke , everywhere smoke I Smoke , with the noise of the steamhammer , and the spouting flame of tall chimneys , - that is all we perceive of Pittsburg from the side of the hill opposite the site of Fort Duquesne . How different the scene which the youthful Washington saw here , a hundred and twenty years ago , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white man lived beyond the Alleghanies ! With his soldier 's eye he marked the rushing Alieghany , the tranquil Monongahela , the winding Ohio , and the hills through which they flowed , only to report that the point of land at the intersection was the very place , of all others , for a fort . We have found better uses for it since . But these better uses have played havoc with the striking beauties of the landscape . The two tributary rivers are spanned by many bridges , light but strong , some of which ' are of great elegance . Over one of them the train crosses the Monongahela , alive with black barges and puffing tug-boats , and enters soon that famous depot , the common centre of all the great railroads meeting here . // 19 The West is paying back* with large interest , the instruction and propulsion it once received from the East . New York has no such depot as this , though it has far more need of one than any Western city . We shall have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarge our minds and methods , - especially our methods of dealing with that long-suffering creature , the Public . Many thousand passengers are daily received , transferred , and distributed at this extensive depot , replete with every convenience , without loss of time , money , or temper . The traveller arriving from the West is immediately reminded that , at this point , the West terminates . Neither the Western nor the Southern mind fully recognizes the existence of any sum of money between five and ten cents , and the Southern man considers it a proud distinction that in his " section " there are no copper coins . In this depot , on the contrary , boys can be found who charge seven cents for a New York paper . In this . depot there are l*ackmen who demand the exact fare as by law established , and who manifest some concern for the traveller 's convenience and comfort . Many other trifling circumstances denote that we have reached a State where exactness and economy are instinctive ; a State that is neither Eastern nor Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , - PENNSYLVANIA , -* square , solid , plodding , careful , saving Pennsylvania . There is no affectation here of stuffing change into the pocket without counting it . There is no one here who does not know there are such sums of money as seven , eight , and nine cents . Iron ore is not converted into steel bars so easily that the people . who do it are disposed to throw away ever so small a fraction of the results of their labor . On the other hand , these men of iron know how to be liberal when there is occasion . During the war , no regiment , no soldier , passed through Pittsburg without being bountifully entertained ; and the Sanitary Fair held here yielded a larger sum , for the size of the city , than any other . The sw*i was very nearly four hundred thousand dollars . It is people who feel the utility of copper coin that can do such things9 From some of the expensive foibles of human nature the people of Pittsburg are necessarily exei*ipt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very bold man indeEd who should venture into the streets of Pittsburg with a pair of yellow kids upon his hands , nor would they be yellow more than ten minutes . All dainty and showy apparel is forbidden by the state of the atmosphere , and equally so is delicate upholstery within doors . SQme very young girls , in flush times , when wages are high , venture forth with pink or blue ribbons in their bonnets , which may , in highly favorable circumstances , look clean and fresh for half a mile ; but ladies of standing and experience never think of such extravagance , and wear only the colors that harmonize with the dingy livery of the place . These ladies pass their lives in an unending , ineffectual struggle with the omnipresent black . Everything is bought and arranged with reference to the ease with which its surface can be purified from the ever-falling soot . Lace curtains , carved furniture , lightcolored carpets , white paint , marble , elaborate chandeliers , and every substance that either catches or shows this universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible housekeepers . As to the men of Pittsburg , there is not an individual of them who appears to take the slightest interest in his clothes . If you wish to be in the height of the fashion there , you must be worth half a million , and wear a shabby suit of fustian . You must be proprietor in some extensive " works , " and go about not quite as well dressed as the workmen . We will endeavor to describe without exaggeration the state of the atmosphere in Pittsburg , as we observed it on the 6th of December , i866 . We select that day because it was the first perfect specimen of a Pittsburg day at which we ever had the pleasure // to assist , and it consequently made ati impression on our mind . During the autumn , they have about thirty such days as the one we are about to describe . Pittsburg is proud of them . No other city can exhibit such a day . Pittsburg amuses itself ( when it can find a moment to spare ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excites in the mind of the stranger . No matter how dark it may be , the people still say that " this is nothing " to what they can do in the way of darkness . It was with irrepressible exultation , that one of the young gentlemen of the press assured us that he had been three weeks waiting to have his photograph taken . We know not why it is that no one has given an account of this curious production of nature and art , - a Pittsburg day . On waking in the morning , while It was still as dark as midnight , we became gradually conscious that the town was all astir . The newsboys were piping their morning song at the door of the hotel ; the street cars were jingling by ; the steamboat whistles were shrieking ; those huge Pennsylvania wagons , with their long lines of horses , were rumbling past ; and in the passages of the hotel frequent steps were heard , of heavy-booted travellers and of light-footed chambermaids . " Ah , " we thought , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury of industry ! All Pittsburg at work before the dawn of day ! This surpasses Chicago . What would luxurious St. Louis snyof such reckless devotion to business as this ? " Revolving such thoughts , it occurred to us , at length , that it would be only proper for an inquisitive traveller to follow this example , and do in Pittsburg as the Pittsburghers had already done . This bold conception was executed . A match was felt for and found , the gas was lighted , and the first duties of the day were performed with that feeling of moral superiority to mankind in general which is apt to steal over the soul of a person who dresses by gas-light for the first time in many years . " Would Bro*vn do this ? would Jones ? would Robinson ? What vigor there must be in that traveller who gets up to study his town before the first streak of dawn ! " Descending to the lower rooms of the hotel , elate with this new vanity , we were encouraged to find the gas all alight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the evening before . The dining-room , too , was brilliantly lighted , and full of people taking sustenance . Hardly prepared to go so far as to take breakfast by gas-light , - there is a medium in all things , even in the practice of heroic virtue , - we nevertheless deemed it a wise precaution to buy a newspaper or two , thinking it probable that in such a place the newspapers would be all bought and done with by daylight . Then we strolled to the frQnt door , and out into the street . It was still dark , though there were some very faint indications of daylight . Everything , however , was in full movement , - stores open and lighted up , drivers alert , newsboys vociferous , vehicles and passers-by as numerous as if it were broad day . It is not pleasant to stumble about out of doors before daylight , on a damp and chilly December morning , especially in a strange place . The valuable idea now occurred to us , that it would be good economy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom of the twilight in breakfasting . This fine idea was realized , and as it was never possible for us to read a newspaper with the light ten feet above it , we soon lost ourselves in wonder why people order for breakfast , at a hotel , five times as much as they can eat . We also pleased ourselves in. anticipating the moderation which these wasters of food will exhibit when the civilized custom prevails of paying for what is ordered , and no more . These reflections were prolonged and varied as much as possible , and we endeavored to check the propensity to eat rapidly which besets him who eats alone in a crowd . Still the daylight made little progress ; which we excused // en the ground that it had much to contend with in Pittsburg , and could not be expected to do as well as in more favored climes . We left the diningroom , and looked about for a seat close to a window , where perhaps the largetype headings of the news might be made out by the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we sat awhile waiting for more . It came with such strange and tan*lizing slowness , that it occurred to us , at last , to see what time it was . One glance at the watch dispelled our dream of moral superiority . It was a quarter to nine ! It was a still , foggy morning . There being no wind to drive away the smoke issuing from five hundred huge chimneys , the deep chasm in which Pittsburg lies was filled full of it , and this smoke was made heavy and thick by being mixed with vapor . At eleven o'clock that morning all the gas in the stores was lighted , and the light was as necessary as it ever can be at night . At ten minutes past noon , we chanced to be in a bookstore , where the bookkeeper 's desk was situated directly under a skylight , which in any otjer-city would have flooded the desk with a dazzling excess of light Even there , the ga* was burning with all its force from two burners , and all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke lifted a little ; the sun appeared , in the semblance of a large , clean , yellow turnip ; and , for the first time that day , it was possible to read without artificial light . This interval lasted half an hour . By three o clock , it was darker than ever , and so remained till night came to make the darkness natural ; when , the streets being lighted , Pittsburg was more cheerful than it had been all day . There is one evening scene in Pittsburg which no visitor should miss . Owing to the abruptness of the hill behind the town , there is a street along the edge of a bluff , from which you can look directly down upon all that part of the city which lies low , near the level of the rivers . On the evening of this dark day , we were conducted to the edge of the abyss , and looked over the iron railing upon the most striking spectacle we ever beheld . The entire space lying between the hills was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent forth tongues of flame , while from the depths of the abyss came up the noise of hundreds of steam-hammers . There would be moments when no flames were visible ; but soon the wind would force the smoky curtains aside , and the whole black expanse would be dimly lighted with dull wreaths of fire . It is an unprofitable business , view-hunting ; but if any one would enjoy a spectacle as striking as Niagara , he may do so by simply walking up a long hill to Cliff Street in Pittsburg , and looking over into - hell with the lid taken off . Such is the kind of day of which Pittsburg boasts . The first feeling of the stranger is one of compassion for the people who are compelled to live in such an atmosphere . When hard pressed , a son of Pittsburg will not deny that the smoke has its inconveniences . He admits that it does prevent some inconsiderate people from living there , who , but for the prejudice against smoke in which they have been educated , would become residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke of bituminous coal kills malaria , and saves the eyesight . The smoke , he informs you , is a perpetual public sun-shade and color-subduer . There is no glare in Pittsburg , except from fire and red-hot iron ; no object meets the eye that demands much of that organ , and consequently diseases of the eyes are remarkably rare . It is interesting to hear a Pittsburgher discourse on ' this subject ; and it much relieves the mind of a visitor to be told , and to have the assertion proved , that the smoke , so far from being an evil , is a blessing . The really pernicious atmospheres , say the Pittsburg philosophers , convey to man no intimation of the poison with which they are laden , and we inhale death while enjoying every breath we draw ; but this smoke is an evil only to the imagina // tion , and it destroys every property of the atmosphere which is hostile to life . In proof of which the traveller is referred to the tables of mortality , which show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longevity . All this is comforting to the benevolent mind . Still more so is the fact , that the fashion of living a few miles'out of the smoke is beginning to prevail among the people of Pittsburg . Villages are springing up as far as twenty miles away , to which the business men repair , when , in consequence of having inhaled the smoke all day , they feel able to bear the common country atmosphere through the night . It is probable that , in coming years , the smoky abyss of Pittsburg will be occupied only by factories and " works , " and that nearly the whole population will deny themselves the privilege of living in the smoke . With three rivers and half a dozen railroads , the people have ready means of access to places of almost unequalled beauty and pleasantness . The " great fact " of Pittsburg is coal . Iron and copper can better afford to come to coal to be melted , than send for coal to come and melt them . All those hills that frown down upon Pittsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburg , have a stratum of coal in them from four to twelve feet thick . This stratum is about three hundred feet above the water 's edge , and about one hundred feet from the average summit of the hills . It is simply a great cake of coal , lying fiat in the hills , uniform , compact , as though this region had once been a lake of liquid coal , upon which mountains had been tossed , pressing it solid . The higher the hill rises above the coal cake , the better is the coal . It has had more pressure , is more compact and less impure . What this black stuff really is that we have named coal , how it got laid away so evenly in these hills , why the stratum of coal is always found just so high up the hill , why coal is found here and not everywhere , and why it is better here than elsewhere , are questions to which answers have often been attempted . We have read some of these answers , and remain up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mere quantity of coal in this region is sufficiently staggering . All the foundries and iron-works on earth could find ample room in this region , at the edge of a navigable stream , and have a coal mine at their back doors . The coal that is used in the foundries along the Monongahela is only shovelled twice . Deep in the heart of the hifl that rises behind the foundry , the coal is mined , and thrown upon a car , by which it is conveyed to the mouth of the mine , and thence down an inclined plane to the foundry , where it is dumped at the door of the furnace which is to consume it . And , it seems , there are fifteen thousand square miles of " this sort of thing . " The " great Pittsburg coal seam , " as it is called , which consists of bituminous coal only , is put down in the books as covering eight and a half millions of acres . Mr. George H. Thurston of Pittsburg , who is learned in everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area contains a trifle of about three trillions and a half of bushels of workable coal , - or fifty-four billions of tons . Supposing this coal to be worth at the mine two dollars a ton , and supposing that we could sell out the whole seam for cash , Mr. Thurston assures us that we could immediately pay the national debt twenty-seven times over . He also remarks , that it would take the entire product of the California gold mines for a thousand years to buy the coal of this one seam . We fervently hope these statements are correct . What we need is , a grand National , or , rather , a Continental Survey , on the scale of the Coast Survey , to take an inventory of our natural wealth , that could be implicitly relied on . It is but thirteen years ago , that a writer in the " Encyclop*dia Britannica , " who seemed deeply versed in his subject , assured his readers that there wasin the coal mines of Great Britain workable coal enough to last nineteen // hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and startles the world by the assertion that the supply will be practically exhausted in eighty years ! If Mr. Thurston is right , and if Mr. Mill is right , the time is at hand when Sheffield , Birmingham , and the other iron cities of England will begin to cast inquiring eyes at these hills and streams about Pittsburg . If there is indeed a supply of bituminous coal in this region for many thousand years , we see no reason why Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , New York , and fifty smaller cities , may not make their gas in the coal region , and convey it across the country in pipes . The idea has been discussed , and there is talk of a company for carrying it into effect . This matter of the quantity and distribution of coal is of importance beyond calculation . There was one " tow ' * of coal sent down to New Orleans last year by a Pittsburg house , that contained all the coal of three and a quarter acres of seam . It were well to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it up at that rate . To observe the whole process of getting coal out of the hills , it is only necessary to walk half a mile from the city . Cross one of the bridges over the Monongahela , walk up the hill that rises from the banks of that tranquil stream , and you behold , in the side of the hill , a round hole about large enough for a man to stand upright in . This cavity has smooth* walls of coal , and there is a narrow railroad track in it . The air within is neither damp nor chilly , and often delicate flowers are blooming about the entrance . Strangers usually enter this convenient and inviting aperture , which may lead into the hill a mile , or even three miles . After walking a hundred yards or so , strangers usually think it best to go no farther . It is as dark in there as darkness itself , and as silent as a tomb . The entrance shows like a distant point of light . The visitor listens for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal-car ; but nothing breaks the horrid silence of the place , and , retracing his steps , he sees with pleasure the point expanding into a round Q. Reassured , he peers agaip into the mountain 's heart , and discerns in the far distance a speck of light . This speck slowly , very slowly , approaches . A low and distant rumble is heard . The speck of light enlarges a little . A voice is heard , - the voice of a boy addressing an observation to a mule . The light , that was but a speck , begins now to disperse the gloom ; and at last we discover that it is a lamp fixed upon a mule 's head , and that the mule is drawing two or three car-loads of coal , and is driven by a perfectly black white boy , who also has a lamp upon his head . The coal is immediately dumped , the mule is attached to the other end of the train , and reenters the black hole . A stranger who has a proper respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black car ; but curiosity is frequently stronger than principle , and there are travellers who will ride into the black bowels of the earth if they see an empty car going thither . What a strange sensation ! How great the distance ! The round 0 of the entrance , after dwindling to a white dot , disappears quite , and it is long before anything becomes visible in the depths of the mine . As we pass along this black and narrow street , - just wide enough for a car , and not high enough for a man to stand upright in the car , - we observe openings llke doors into black , empty rooms . These are " rooms . " When a mine is opened , the first thing , of course , is to make a straight passage into it ; but on each side of the passage " rooms " are opened , one man being assigned to each , who excavates the apartment in solitude . The , partitions left between the " rooms " keep the hill from settling down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the partitions are knocked away and the coal removed . The hill is then only supported by upright logs , two or three feet thick , which , as the hill settles , // 24 are pressed slowly down and flattened out . After a long ride in the car , signs of life appear ; a speck of light is seen in the distance , and the click of a pickaxe is faintly heard . The train of empty coal-cars stops at the door of a " room , " and one of them is cast off , and pushed into this apartment by ' a turnout . The visitors alight as best they can , and find themselves in the coaliest coal-hole ever known . Nothing is seen , felt , or smelt but coal ; nothing is heard but the eager strokes of an invisible pickaxe , wielded by an unseen arm . The solitary occupant of this ' " room " is invisible at the moment , because he is employed in what the miners call " bearing in . " When a miner finds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to excavate convenient masses of that precious commodity , the first thing he does is to " bear in . " To " bear in " is to get down upon your knees , and with a pickaxe cut deeply in at the bottom of the seam of coal , - as far in as you can reach , even by lying down . When the miner has made his gash , three feet deep and six feet wide , it is very easy by wedges , or even by the pickaxe alone , to bring down all the upper part of the seam in pieces small enough to handle . Our miner was bearing in , at the moment of our entrance , with enthusiasm , owing to his being a little behind with his heap for the next load . Each miner expects to have a car-load ready when his car comes , and he lays out his work accordingly . His task is done when he has dug out the coal , and loaded it upon the car . And it is for doing these two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven years ago , that sum was three quarters of a cent ; it is now four cents ; and the miners used to get out more coal per day when the price Was low than they do now at the high price . Our eager miner , hearing voices in his room , rose at length , and dimly revealed himself by ths light of a very small tin lamp that hung loosely on his forehead . What a picture he was , as he peered over the heap of coal , with his black cap fitting close to his head , his dangling tin lamp , his coaly visage , his red lips and white teeth , and his black eyes glistening in the midst of the dull black of the rest of his countenanGe I He looked the Spirit of the Coal-mine . He was , however , introduced to the intruders as " Mr. Gallagher " ; and a very merry , social , pleasant fellow he was . People come into the mines prepared to regard with compassion these grimy workers in the eternal dark ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gayest of men , very cheerful and companionable , with a keen sense of independence and personal dignity . We discovered at once that this man of the dangling lamp was indeed Mr. Gallagher . He begins work when he likes , works as fast as he likes , or as slow , and goes home when he likes . His " room " is his own against the world ; and when he has dug out of it his regular hundred bushels , which he usually accomplishes about three o'clocl* in the afternoon , he takes up his oil-bottle and his dinner-kettle , gets upon a load of coal , rides to daylight , and saunters home . When he has had his thorough Saturday-afternoon wash , and has put on his fine Sunday broadcloth , he looks like a pale , muscular poet . The sun does not brown his skin , nor the wind roughen it . He works in the dark , in a still air , and at a uniform temperature of about sixty degrees , the year round . If he has a fancy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about here once dug coal at three quarters of a cent per busheL The people who live near the mines along the Monongahela speak well of the miners as a class . They are proud , honest , and orderly . A few of them , on festive days , indulge in their native pastime of whipping their wives ; but even the few who do this are acquiring a taste for nobler pleasures . The farmers say that their apples and watermelons are as safe here as anywhere . The miners are proud of their right to vote , are prompt to exercise that right , and generally send their children to school . We asked " Mr. Gallagher " whether // the practice of his vocation was attended by any danger . Like most other men in perilous employments , he protested that there was not the least danger , if a man was only careful . In proof of which he adduced the fact , that in this mine only one man had been killed in eleven months , and he was killed by a piece of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of remarkably heavy stone that is always found at the top of the stratum of coal , and which ought to fall when the coal is cut away from under it . But masses of it often adhere to the roof of the mine , and can not be dislodged without more labor than a miner is always willing to bestow . In almost every " room " of a mine , therefore , there will be heavy chunks of horseback clinging to the roof , which are sure to fall soon , and may fall at any instant . The solitary occupant of the room intends to avoid standing under these masses . He also intends to employ his first leisure in prying them off . But time passes ; he forgets , in the heat of his work , the overhanging peril ; and some day the solitary worker in the next room notices that his neighbor 's pickaxe has ceased to strike . Down there in the bowels of the earth , each man working by himself , separated from his fellow by a wall of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing how it fares with their friends in the rooms adjoining . They can tell what they are doing , whether they are forward with their load or behind with it , whether the coal is working easily or hard , whether they are working merrily or dully , whether they are good-tempered or cross . The sudden cessation of all noise in a room , at an hour when work is going on , soon attracts attention , and the poor miner is found with his lamp and his life crushed out , under half a ton of horseback . This is said to be the only danger to the miners of the Pittsburg Seam . If noxious gases are generated , it is easy to open a passage through to the other side of the hill for ventilation , or make a chimney through the roof It is difficult to see how fifty or sixty billions of tons of coal could be put where man could get at them more conveniently . Sir Charles Lyell , who was in this region some years ago , was particularly struck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw anywhere else coal so easily worked and loaded . The population of the coal region near Pittsburg is about thirty - five thousand , and seven thousand of these are employed in and about the mines . The annual product of the mines is something near two millions and a half of tons , of which one third is consumed at Pittsburg , and the rest is sent away down the rivers to fill the valley of the Mississippi with smoke . 1n one week of i866 , seven steamboats arrived at New Orleans , having in tow fifty-eight coal-barges from Pittsburg , containing in all forty-five thousand tons of coal , worth at New Orleans three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . As to that third part of the coal product of the great Pittsburg Seam which Pittsburg itself consumes , it performs a prodigious quantity of work , assisted by nine thousand mechanics and laborers . There are in the congregation of towns which the outside world knows only by the name of Pittsburg , five hundred manufactories and " works . " Fifty of these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made , and which employ three thousand *ersons . This important branch of business was planted here in 1787 by a person , no less distinguished than Albert Gallatin , and it has grown to proportions of which no one seems to be aware out of Pittsburg . The fifteen bottle-works here produce the incredible number of seventy million bottles and vials per annum . But Pittsburg ( so we were told in Nicholas Longworth 's wine-cellar at Cincidnati ) has not yet learned to make a champagnebottle that will stand the pressure of that wine . A serviceable champagnebottle has never yet been made in the United States ; and we have to send to France for all that we require in Ohio , // Missouri , and California . *Ve learned ( in the same subterranean retreat ) that the Pittsburg champagne-bottle comes nearest to being what a champagnebottle should be , of any made in the United States . One in ten of the best French bottles bursts in the cellar of the bottler ; one in six of the best Pittsburg bottles . But the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abominable mess that admits of being bottled , labelled , and advertised , that the Pittsburg bottle-makers have not had time yet to develop the higher branches of their vocation . Any sort of glass will do for quack medicine . There are also fifteen window-glassworks at Pittsburg , which produce nearly half a million boxes of that commodity every year , worth about two millions and a half of dollars . It so happened that we had a burning curiosity to know how window-glass is made , and one of the first things we did at Pittshurg was to gratify this noble thirst for knowledge . Who would have thought that common window-glass is blown ? It is actually blown like a bottle . The blower stands on a bench , and as he blows , he swings his tube to and fro , which causes the soft globule to lengthen out into a cylinder , five feet long and one foot in diameter . This cylinder is afterwards slit down all its length by a diamond , and placed in an oven , with the diamond-cut uppermost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diamond marked it , gently falls apart , and lies down flat on the bottom of the oven . There is your sheet of window-glass . As soon as it is cooled , it is cut into the required sizes by a diamond . There are also fifteen flint-glass-works at Pittsburg , the annual product of which is more than four thousand tons of the finest glass-ware , worth two millions of dollars . The total value of the glass made at Pittsburg every year is about seven millions of dollars , which is almost exactly one half of the value of our whole annual product of glass-ware . This is one item of the yearly work done by Pittsburg coal at Pittsburg . Other tri fles are sixteen potteries , forty-six foun* dries , thirty-one rolling mills , thirtythree manufactories of machinery , and fifty-three oil-refineries . Such a thing it is to have plenty of coal ! Oil Creek is a branch of the Alleghany River , and empties into it one hundred miles above Pittsburg . Pittsburg is , consequently , the great petroleum mart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material became important ; and yet Lhere were received at Pittsburg during the year i866 more than sixteen hundred thousand barrels of it . The Alleghany River is one of the swiftest of navigable streams ; but there is never a moment when its surface at Pittsburg is not streaked with petroleum . It would not require remarkable talent in an inhabitant of this place to " set the river on fire . " The crude oil is floated down this impetuous river in the slightest-built barges , - mere oblong boxes made of common boards , - into which the oil is poured as into an enormous trough . Petroleum is lighter than water , and would float very well without being boxed in ; only it would be difficult to keep each proprietor 's lot separate . It needs but a slight accident to knock a hole in one of these thin barges . When such an accident has occurred , the fact is revealed . by the rising of the petroleum in the barge ; and the vessel gets fuller and fuller , until it overflows . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the swift river , making its way toward Pittsburg , while the barge is filled with water and sunk . We were prepared to discourse wisely upon the subject of oil , - its discovery , the fortunes made and squandered " in " it , and the healthy , proper way in which oil is now rising from the rank of a game to that of a business . We give place , however , to the editor of the " Crawford Journal " ( published in the oil region ) , who related while we were at Pittsburg a story which is worth more than preaching . An iten* appeared in the papers , recording the sale of a certain farm on Oil Creek for taxes , which elicited from the editor of // the " Crawford Journal " the following remarkable explanation - " This farm was among the first of the oil-producing farms of the valley . Early in 1863 , the Van Slyke well , on this farm , was struck , and flowed for some time at the rate of twenty-five huri7dred barrels per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hundred barrels were struck at subsequent periods . Beside these , there were many smaller wells ; and the territory , though sadly mismanaged , is still regarded as among the best in the oil re " ion . In 1864 , Widow McClintock died from the effects of burns received while kindling a fire with crude oil . At this time , the average daily income from the landed interest of the farm was two thousand dollars ; and by her will the property , with all her possessions in money , was left , without reservation , to her adopted son , John W. Steele , then about twenty years of age . In the iron safe where the old lady kept her money was found one hundred and fifty thousand dollars , two thirds of the amount in greenbacks , and the balance in gold . Mrs. McClintock was hardly cold in her coffin before young Steele , who appears to have had nothing naturally vicious in his composition , was surrounded bya set of vampires , who clung to him as long as he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned by his good fortune , as has been that of many an older man who made his pile in oil ' and he was of the opinion that his money would accumulate too rapidly unless it was actually thrown away , and throw it away he did . Many of the stories concerning his career in New York and Philadelphia savor strongly of fiction , and would not be credited were they not so well authenticated . Wine , women , horses , faro , and general debauchery , soon made a. wreck of that princely fortune ; and in twenty months Johnny Steele squandered two millions of dollars . Hon. John Morrissey , M. C. , went through him at faro to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars in two nights ; he bought high-priced turnouts , and after driving them an hour or two gave them away ; ecpiipped a large minstrel troupe , and presented each member with a diamond pin and ring , and kept about him , besides , two or three men who were robbing him day after day . He is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord 's Minstrels , the company he organized , and is - to use a very expressive , but not strictly classical phrase - completely played out . ' " The wealth obtained by those who worked so assiduously to effect Steele 's ruin gave little permanent benefit to its possessors . The person most brazen and chiefly instrumental in bringing about the . present condition of affairs was the notorious Seth Slocum , who hung around this city several weeks last summer . He was worth at one time over one hundred thousand dollars , which he had captured* from . Steele , and laid aside for a rainy day ; but when the latter 's money vanished , this amount soon took unto itself wings , and he is at present known among his old associates as a dead beat . ' At last accounts , Slocum was incarcerated in the jail of a neighboring county for various breaches of the peace , and was unable to obtain bail in the sum of five hundred dollars . Exemplifications these of the old adage , Easy come , easy go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are soon parted . ' " This is merely the most striking and best known of many similar instances . It is dci'ubtful if wealth , suddenly acquired , without merit on the part of the recipient , has ever been of real service ; and we presume Johnny Steele did the best thing possible for him in getting rid of his absurd millions in twenty months . He might have staggered under them twenty years , and even then had enough left to keep him from his proper place in the world . Happily , all this is over in the oil country , where the business languishes aftez* the ex* citements of recent years , and is settling down to be a safe and legitimate ' pursuit , like coal , iron , and salt . // Uan:uai'y , It is , however , the iron-works of Pittsburg that usually attract the stranger first , astonish him most , and detain him longest . We all know the precise quantity of " dirt " which each of us has to eat in a lifetime . It is one peck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitant of the United States " consumes " about one hundred and twenty-five pounds of iron every year ? So we are assured ; and we are also informed that the fact is highly honorable to us , since the quantity of iron consumed by a nation is one of the tests of its civilization . A Spaniard , for example , gets along with only five pounds of iron in a year , and a Russian finds ten pounds sufficient . An Austrian is satisfied with fifteen , a Swiss with twenty-two , a Norwegian with thirty ; but a German must have fifty pounds , a Frenchman sixty , a Belgian seventy . Of the iron consumed in the United States , it appears that about two fifths are manufactured at Pittsburg , in those hundred and thirteen iron-works mentioned before . There is not one of those establishments in which an intelligent person may not find wonders enough to entertain him all day ; but in the compass of one brief article we can do little more than allude to one or two of the more famous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before remarked , is densely packed with marvels . Go where you will , you find something of the most particular interest , that demands to be examined , and most richly rewards examination . If ever *e establish a college , we shall arrange it so , that the senior class shall spend six weeks at and near Pittsburg , in order to vivify their knowledge of geology , chemistry , and the other sciences . Down by the swift and turbid Alleghany , close to the river , as all the great foundries are , we discovered with difficulty , on a very dark morning , the celebrated Fort Pitt Foundry , where twentyfive hundred of the great giAns were cast that blew the late " So-Called " out of water . In this establishment may be seen the sublime of the me chanic arts . Only here , on the continent of America , have there ever been cast those monsters of artillery which are called by the ridiculous diminutive of " the twenty-inch gun . " A twenty-inch gun is one of those corpulent pieces of ordnance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which weigh sixty tons , cost fifty thousand dollars each , and send a ball of a thousand pounds three miles . To be exact , the ball weighs one thousand and eighty pounds , and it costs one hundred and sixty-five dollars . To discharge a twenty-inch gun , loaded with one of these balls , requires one hundred and twenty-five pounds of powder , worth forty cents a pound ; so that every time one of the guns is fired it costs a hundred and ninety-five dollars , without counting the wear and tear of the gun and its carriage , and the pay of the men . The foundry where these huge guns are made is large , lofty , dark , and remarkably silent . Nearly every operation goes on in silence , and without the least fuss or hurry . We will endeavor to show , in a few words , how it is that a large lump of iron with a hole in it should cost so much . To people outside of the iron world iron is iron ; but to people inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are sources of supply . We have often been amused at the positiveness with which the inhabitants of iron districts declare their iron to be the " best in the world . " The people of Marquette , upon Lake Superior , the people interested in the Iron Mountain of Missouri , the iron-makers of Lake Champlain , and all who have anything to do with an iron mine , assert the superiority of their own iron . The best of it is , that all these people are right ; for each of the great brands of iron actually is the best in the world - for some purposes . The iron for these large cannons comes from the Bloomfield Mine , in Blair County , Pennsylvania , and there is in the United States but one other iron as good for guns ; and that is found in far-off Massachusetts . Everything depends upon the even and // sufficient density of the iron ; therefore , the pigs of iron from the Bloomfield Mine are again melted and purified here . They have an ingenious machine for testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a round piece of iron , one inch thick , is subjected to a steady pull until it breaks , and the operator is enabled to ascertain precisely how many pounds ' weight it will b*ar . The same machine tests it by twisting and by crushing . It is this machine which determines the rank and value of all iron . The mould in which the cannons are cast is an enormous structure of iron and sand , which weighs , when ready for the metal , more than forty tons . The preparation of th' mould is the most difficult and delicate of all the work done in the foundry ; but it would be nearly impossible to convey an idea of it on paper . When it is ready , it is hoisted by steam-derricks , and let down into a pit , where it stands on end , with open mouth , ready for the fiery fluid . Those steam-derricks are wonderful . One man , by their assistance , lifts , carries , and deposits upon a car , in thirty minutes , a twenty-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste metal ) one hundred and thirty tons ; and this he does with about as much physical exertion as is required to draw a glass of beer from a barrel . The whole force of the foundry - two hundred and fifty men - could not move such a mass one inch in twenty-four hours , unaided by machinery . The thrilling event of the day is the casting , which occurs here at two o'clock in the afternoon , one great gun being cast every day . Three furnaces , early in the morning , are stacked full of pigs of iron , as high as a man 's head , and about ten o'clock . the fires are lighted under them . In some three hours the stacks of pigs are all melted down into a pool of liquid iron one foot deep . From each of , the three furnaces an iron trough , lined with clay , extends across the wide and gloomy foundry , to the mould which is this day to be filled . The distance is a hundred feet , perhaps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a too rapid flow of metal . ( The Ohio River is arranged on the same principle . ) Men are stationed along each trough to comb off the dross , and there are men at the monld with levers and other implements ; while Joseph Kaye , the foreman and genius of the place , who learned his trade here thirty years ago , and who is the inventor of important parts of the process we are beholding , stands apart , to give the word and overlook the whole . The word is given . A man at each furnace sets the stream running . At once , three FIERY SERPENTS of the fieriest fire come coiling down those troughs with a kind of slow rush , and make for the mould , into which they go headlong , and fall to the bottom with a sputtering thud . The resemblance to a serpent is perfect , until the stream has reached the gun . The stranger fancies that he can see the fiery devil 's eyes , and that the sparks that fly from his head are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about twenty minutes , and then , at a signal , a lump of clay is thrust into the aperture of each furnace ; the streams dwindle to threads , and dry up . Usually , all goes so smoothly that it seems as if it could go no other way . But there are frightful perils in the business . Sometimes an obstruction will occur in one of the troughs , and the liquid metal will overflow , and spread about the ground ; or the supply of iron will be exhausted before the mould is quite full ; or a break will occur in the mould , and the iron burst through , spoiling the mould , and wasting itself in the bottom of the pit . It is a such times that Joseph Kaye asserts his kingly power , and stands self-possessed in the midst of panic-stricken men . Many a great gun about to lapse into hopeless ruin he has saved by his courage and skill . There have been times when every man fled but him , and he sufficed . They point out one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking of a steam-derrick with a gun hanging to it , that he ran home *t // 30 the top of his speed , and could not be coaxed back till six months had passed . Another German was once in a most painful dilemma . The furnaces having run dry before the gun-mould Was quite full , the foreman , to save the gun , ordered metal to be brought from another furnace in iron pails . These pails of liquid iron are swung *ipon a lever , and carried by two men . Our German *was so unfortunate as to stumble a little , which caused some of the melted metal to fall into his low shoe . But , exquisite as the agony was , he was obliged to endure it ; since , in the hurry of the moment , there was no pne who could stop to help him , while to have let go his load had been ruin and death . The man walked steadily to the mould , and assisted his comrade to empty the pail into it , before seeking relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precautions are taken to cause the eighty tons of iron to cool in the manner most conducive to the strength of the gun . If nothing of this kind were done , the gun would be thirty days in getting cool enough to handle ; but , by the constant flow of cold water in and out of the bore , the cooling is shortened to eighteen days . Then the huge thing is gently lifted out of its pit , gently swung across the dim foundry , and gently laid in the turning-shop ; where the great rough end is cut off , where the outside is turned smooth , where the inside is bored to the proper size , where it loses twenty tons of metal . The mere boring of one of these monsters takes four weeks , night and day , Sundays and week-days . When once the boring has been begun , it can never stop until it is finished , without spoiling the gun ; since , if the gun cools , the temperature that existed. , at the moment when the boring ceased can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variation in the size of the bore . A variation in the bore of a hundredth part of an inch insures the rejection of the gun , and a hundredth part of an inch is less than the space between the teeth of a fine-tooth comb . Issuing from the lathe all shaven and shorn , the gun is laid upon two cars fastened together , taken seventeen miles out of town , fired ten times , and delivered to the government inspector . Formerly , they used to cram the great guns full of powder , and fire them off , thus overloaded , until . they were on the point of bursting , and would burst with only an ' ordinary charges This error has been avoided since the Princeton gun killed a Secretary of State , and came near destroying the whole government . From seeing one of these enormous guns cast , the visitor at Pittsburg may go , if he chooses , to an establishrAent where they make tacks 50 minute that it takes a thousand of them to weigh an ounce . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how nails and tacks are made . How startling the contrast between the slow movements , and tranquil , gloomy vastness of the cannon foundry , and the animation of the great rattling , roaring , crowded nail-works of Chess , Smyth , &amp; Co. , all glaring and flashing with light , with many tall chimneys pouring out black smoke and red blaze into the December evening ! Noise ? There is only one place in this world as noisy as a large nail-factory in full operation , and that is under the sheet at Niagara Falls . How should it be otherwise , when the factory is making many thousand nails a minute , and when every single nail , spike , brad , an*l tack is cut from a strip of cold iron , and headed by a blow upon cold iron ? We saw one machine there pouring out shoemakers ' brads at the rate of three thousand a minute , and it required the attendance of only one boy . They came rattling down a tin gutter as fast as meal comes from a mill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to see a girl in the packing-room who wezg*hs and packs two thousand papers of tacks in nine hours , Nails are made thus : - n . Pig-iron is rolled into long bars ; 2 . These long bars are cut into lengths of one foot ; // .3 ' 3 . These lengths are piled into heaps of nine ; 4 . These heaps of nine are rolled into sheets as thick as the nail is to be ; * . Those sheets are cut into strips a little wider than the nail is to be long ; 6 . These strips are cut into nails by the nailing-machine , which also heads the nails as they fall . A man holds the strip of iron in the machine 's jaws , which instantly bite off a nail . But a nail tapers off from the head to the point , , and consequently the strip has to be turned over before the machine can be allowed to bite again . But for this necessity of turning the strip , men could be dispensed with . Imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , with rows of nailing-machines as close together as sewing-machines in a clothing factory , and all on the full champ , - some biting off spikes three to a pound , and others nipping tacks at the rate of thousands a minute . This most interesting establishment employs two hundred and ten men , forty boys , and twenty-five girls ; consumes one hundred and fifty tons *f iron in a week ; makes two hundred kinds of nails , tacks , and brads ; makes in a week two thousand four hundred kegs of nails , one hundred and fifty boxes of tacks one hundred pounds to a box , and one hundred boxes of brads . The crowning glory of Pittsburg is the " American Iron-Works " of Messrs . Jones and Laughlins . This establishment , which employs twenty-five hundred men , which has a coal mine at its back*door and an iron mine on Lake Superior , which makes almost every large and difficult iron thing the country requires , which usually has " on hand " seven hundred thousand dollars ' worth of finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole magazine would not contain an adequate account of it . Here are machines ponderous and exact ; here are a thousand ingenuities ; here is the net result of all that man has done in iron masses during the whole period of his residence upon earth . What should there be here , too , but a specimen of what man can und*.i in iron , in the form of a great heap of rusty twisted rails from Georgia , so completely spoiled by General Sherman 's troops that there was nothing to be done with them but sell them for old iron ! It is at these wQrks alone that iron is subjected to the new process called " cold-rolling . " Every reader has stood by a steamengine , and admired the perfect roundness , the silvery brightness , and the irresistible thrust of the piston-rod . A piston-rod is usually made thus . A huge , jagged mass of white-hot iron , just on the point of fusion , is fished out of the furnace , and is swung across the foundry to the rolling-machine , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker than the piston-rod is to be . It is next put into a turning lathe , where it is turned and polished to the size required , - a long and costly process . That is the usual way . The " cold-rolling " process is this : the long round roll , a little thicker than the piston-rod is to be , is passed cold through another rolling-mill of immense power , and simply squeezed to the size required . Advantages : i . The process is quicker and cheaper ; 2 . , Th.e rod issues from the mill as brilliantly polished as the plate on a queen 's table ; 3 . The pressure so increases the density of the iron , that the rod is about two and a half times stronger than those made in the old way . hen plates and bars are made on the same principle . We can not linger among these wondrous " works " of the strong men of Pittsburg . The men themselves have claims upon our notice . The masters of Pittsburg are mostly of the Scotch-Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their affairs , indifferent to pleasure , singularly devoid of the usual vanities and ostentations , proud to possess a solid and spacious factory , and to live in an in*ignificant house . Where are no men of leisure in the town . Mr. George H. Thurston , President of the Pacific and Atlantic Telegraph Coin pany , // - who , from having superintend-* ed the preparation of the Directory for many years , as well as from his very great interest in all that relates to the prosperity and glory of Pittsburg , knows the town better than any other person that ever lived in it , - assured us positively that there were not , in all the region which we call Pittsburg , three persons ou* of business who were physically capable of conducting business . The old men never think of " retiring , " nor is there anything for them to retire to . The family tie being powerful in this race , the great firms are usually composed of near relatives , and generally survive the generation that founded them . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cast cannon for every war in which the United States has been engaged , and is now conducted by the worthy and talented nephews of the Charles Knap who made the establishment what it is . In the American IronWorks , we find six partners , namely , the two chiefs , Messrs . Jones and Laughlin , two sons of one of these chiefs , and two brothers of the other , - a nice family party . Hence , there are few hired clerks in Pittsburg . These mighty " works " are managed with the minimum of expense . The visitor generally finds " the old man " bustling about the " works " in his cap and fustian jacket ; while perhaps his eldest son is keeping the books , a son-in-law or nephew is making up the wages accounts , and a younger son is in the warehouse . The conservative elements here are powerful , as they are in all communities in which families endure . Until very recently , in Pittsburg , it would have boded ill for a man to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to this day it is said that a Pittsburg man of business who should publish a poem would find his " paper " doubted at the bank . " A good man , sir , but not practical . " These excellent and strenuous men accuse themselves vehemently of a want of public spirit , and it is evident the charge is just . For the last few years , business has rushed in upon them like a torrent ; and all their force having been expended in doing this business , they now awake to the fact , that a GREAT CITY is upon their hands , to be consolidated , organized , paved , policed , parked , purified , and adorned . They now feel that some of those iron kings , those great men of glass , oil , coal , salt , and clay , must leave business to their sons and nephews , and take hold of Pittsburg . The masters work too hard . We wish we had room to tell the story of one of the great brains of this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can but indicate the outline . His own master at sixteen . At twenty-eight , one of a firm about to found new iron-works . Capital , one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . Plunged into a business of a million per annum . Ticklish work this ! A slight miscalculation in estimating for a contract , an unexpected rise in the price of something , and away goes the small capital , and honor with it . Hence he worked eighteen hours a day for fourteen years . Called at six every morning but Sunday . At warehouse in Pittsburg till nine . At the works until two . At the mine until dark . Home to tea , and to lovely family , well beloved ; but too tired and dull to enjoy or be enjoyed . At seven , would " drag " round to the office , and there write or " estimate " till twelve . Then home to bed , and instantly to sleep . Felt always as if playing a great , splendid , complicated Game , upon which fortune and honor both were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - honor as a man of business , honor as ' . a man of ability . The game was won ! Capital increased from one hundred and fifty thousand to three million dollars . Finest , grandest iron-works in America . Glorious scene of triumphant ino*enuity . Three hundred brick cottages owned by the firm , all tenanted by their own workmen . Paper , giltedged. // BUT One night , two years ago , instead of dropping asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow , this successful man could not go to sleep for hours , and then slept ill . Many such nights followed . One day , when he was abstrusely calculating , his mind suddenly lost its power ; he could not keep his attention upon his figures , nor make any safe progress in his work . Alarmed , he ivent to the doctor , who told him , to his great astonishment , that he had been working too hard , and must rest . He took this advice and a short journey ; but soon after , resuming his ordinary labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about eleven o'clock in the morning , and he tried to think of something to do that would amuse without fatiguing his mind . He could think of nothing but the dentist 's ; so to the dentist 's he went , hoping to enjoy a little anguish till dinner-time . But this recreation was denied him , for , while waiting in the dentist 's parlor , he fainted dead away . He was now seriously alarmed , and for the first time began to consider his case with the intelligence he had been in the habit of bestowing upon iron alone . He lived thenceforth as became a man , a husband , and a father ; worked ten hours a day , and spent every evening in playing with his children , and conversing with his wife and their friends . Thanks to a *vonderful constitution , it was not too late . He recovered his health , and is now in the full enjoyment of life . It is such as he who should leave iron to the youngsters , and amuse themselves for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought does not , it is said , ever cross their minds . When we suggested it to a son of Pittsburg , and mentioned an individual who could soon put the city in order , the reply was : " If Mr. - should sell out for three millions , he would never be easy till he had built a new factory for seven millions and then give himself no rest till he had paid off the four millions of debt . " #VOL . XXI. - NO. 123. 3 .33 This is mania . There* will be , perhaps , asylums for this class of patients some day . The workmen , - what of them ? As the stranger goes about among the " works , " and sees men performing labors so severe that they haVe to stop , now and then , in summer , take off their boots , and tour the *erspiration out of them , he is apt to become a fanatical free-trader on the spot . He says to himself : " If there is any foreign country that is willing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation that we can afford to pay , why should not that foreign country be allowed to do it , so that these American citizens could turn their at*tention to something more agreeable ? " But , then , if the work is terrific , the wages are extraordinary . ' Some of these " puddlers , " rollers , nailers , modellers , and others of the aristocracy of the mills , receive from ten to twentyfive dollars a day ; and the average wages of skilled labor do not probably average below five dollars a day . The necessaries of life are cheaper here than in any other large city , East or West . For several years past , too , the men have generally been the masters , because there has been work offering beyond the capacity of the town to execute . But all who have power abuse it , more or less . Considering that during the greater part of man 's existence on earth workingmen have been oppressed , it is not surprising that they should avail themselves of a passing opportunity to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trades here have guilds , or societies , for protection against the capitalists , who also coinbine to resist the demands of the workmen . What both these combinations need , to keep their intercourse dignified and friendly - to prevent that fierce and vulgar hostility which rages in England between employers , and men - is KNOWLEDGE , the great want of all men everywhere ! But the workingmen especially need it . Every one of those workingmen 's societies ? hould // have a little library of the best works upon political economy . If only one man in the whole guild had the spirit to study them , that one man might , at a critical time , prevent a whole trade from running full tilt , blindly , against a law of nature . But more than one man would study them , for there are evidently a great number of excellent heads among the men of the mills . One of the best little papers we ever read is one conducted by and for them at Pittsburg , called the " Workmen 's and Soldiers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union is strength , - KNOWLEDGE is power . " We saw no indication at Pittsburg of the infernal feeling that appears to exist in Sheffield and Birmingham between employers and employed . The men laugh a good deal at the alleged narrowness of some of the capitalists of the town . A writer in the little paper just mentioned says : " Some one started the idea of making a public park on the northern face of Grant 's Hill ; but the public beneficence of the project was so un-Pittshurg-like , that the projector found he was either behind or in advance of the age so far . A soldiers ' monument was next spoken of ' , hut several of our wealthiest men ( who had become so by the war ) could only give two or three dollars apiece , and it has so far failed . " Again : " It has become the prevailing opinion that landlords are not among our most benevolent citizens ; and it is quite proba*ble that public opinion does them injustice , since they are to be found among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , carrying round the money - basket for c6llections , leading the way to the sacrament , inviting the minister to tea , and reproving the outbursts of hilarious youth on all occasions . None of the Pittsburg landlords owned the houses where Christ travelled , and had not where to lay his head . ' But if he should ever happen to be in Pittsburg , - which is doubtful , - he would find that it would require an enormous amount of scrip in his purse. *** It is only such harmless fun as this that the grimy man of the furnace pokes at the slightly less grimy man of the counting-room . But if these passages show the good-humor of the me ; how clearly they reveal their need of a. course of political economy ! All talk of that kind about the landlords is ig*. norance , - pure ignorance . An American mechanic should be above it . Is not the law of nature which impels the workingman to get as much as he can for his labor a universal law ? Here , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mass of men the few are selected whom nature has fitted to be masters . Manyof the men who get from fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars a week waste their money and themselves . Some men drink twenty glasses of beer perday , the year round . About one third of the whole number of men save money , and live cleanly and sensibly ; and it is from this third that the future foremen and proprietors will be gradually sifted out . Nothing in the life of Pittsburg is more striking to a visitor than the completeness of the cessation from labor at the close of the week . The ScotchIrish race are strict Sabbatarians , and nothing goes on in Pittsburg on Sundays which it is possible to stop . Of all those five hundred tall chimneys , there will not usually be more than two that smoke on Sundays . During the week the town gets under such a headway of industry , that it takes all Saturday afternoon for it to come to a stand . The regular work ceases at noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , cleaning up , making repairs , and getting ready for a fair start on Monday morning . By seven in the evening , the principal streets of Pittsburg are densely filled with washed men . They stroll about ; they stand conversing in groups ; they gather , in thick semicircles , about every shop-window that has a picture in it , or any bright or curious object ; especially do they haunt the news-stands , which provide a free picture-gallery for them 34 // of Illustrated News , Comic Monthlies , and Funny Fellows . The men are so numerous , that the whole width of some of the streets is filled with them ; and there is not a woman to be seen ! Not a single petticoat among thousands of other coats ! Yet no crowd could be more orderly and quiet . These men , after a week of intense monotony , - gazing at dull objects and doing the same dull act ten hoars a day , - how hungry they seemed for some brightness to flash into their lives ! How we longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them a banquet of splendors ! Mere brilliancy of color and light is transport , we should suppose , to a man who has been making nails or digging coal from Monday morning until Saturday noon . We need not say that every theatre and show in Pittsburg is crammed on Saturday night . By putting forth the greatest efforts , we did manage to get into one of the theatres , into which dense masses of men were crowding . Not a woman was present . The place was packed with brawny men and noisy boys , all washed , all well-disposed , though half mad with joyous excitement . On the walls were posted such admonitions as these : " Hats off , " " No hallooing or whistling allowed , " " Applaud with your hands , " " Order must be observed , " " No walk around by performers in white faces allowed . " What the last of these announcements may mean we can not tell ; but , with regard to the rest we can say that the audience paid no heed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiftieth power , comic songs , and legs . Never have we seen an audience so amusable . It often happened , during the performance of a farce , that the people would keep up such a roar of laughter , that for many seconds at a time not a word could be heard from the stage . We discovered here what the play-bills mean when they speak of " roaring farces , " and of farces that are " screaming . " The reader will say , perhaps , that this is a poor ending to a week of hard 35 labor . Perhaps it is . But the natural kings of Pittsburg do not provide anything better , nor heartily encourage the production of anything better . These poor hungry fellows of the dark mine and the dim foundry want some change , some pleasure , some brilliancy . They can get this for twenty-five cents , and it is better than nothing . There are two other theatres in the town , where performances of a more " legitimate " character are given ; and , considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to attend them , they are respectable . Nine miles and three eighths from Pittsburg , on the shores of the Monongahela7 is the pleasant and growing village called " Braddock 's Field . " Its principal streets are " Washington , " " Braddock , " " Halkett , " " Frazer , " " Beaujean , " " Aliquippa . " We need not say why this village is so called , nor why these names were given to its streets . The ford by which the fated army crossed the'river was used a a ford until a few years ago , when the river was dammed to improve the navigation . The ancient Indian trail which led up from the ford is still a lane , fenced and used . The two ravines in which the Indians lay in ambush are visible . They are not more than three or four feet below the general level ; the ambush having been afforded by a close growth of hazelbushes that long ago disappeared . There are several trees standing on the field that must have been of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient oak , that stands where the bullets must have flown thickest , and from which many have been picked by the prying knives of visitors . Near it is a rough enclosure of common rails , such as farmers make for a hay-stack , within which are buried a considerable - number of human bones that were dug up when the track of the Pennsylvania Railroad was laid across the scene of the battle . Interesting relics of the encounter are still occasionally found . Colonel Edward J. Allen , whose agreeable and hospitable house stands upon // the battle-field , close to the plac*e of the greatest slaughter , informed us that his garden has never yet been dug up in the spring without the exposure of something of the kind , an arrow-head , a bullet , or even a bayonet . A sword with a name engraved upon it has been recently found in the neighborhood . How changed this scene in a hundred and twelve years ! The bluff beneath which those seven hundred men laid down their lives is pierced with holes , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glistening coal . On the opposite bank , rows of the blazing chimneys of cokeovens glare through the night . A beautiful village , noisy with the schoolchildren at play , covers a great part of the field . Two railroads cross it , over which one hundred and twenty trains pass every twenty-four hours !
