ARTICLE 111. - OBSERVATIONS ON THE MODERN GREEKS . IN estimating the present condition of the Greeks as a nation , there are several things which must not be left out of view , if we would do them justice . These things are not excuses for their faults or failures , but conditions of their national life-independent , in part , of their character-which have affected their progress . One of these is th' state from which they came into existence as a nation , taken together with the shortness of the time that they have had since that event for development . Under the Turkish rule the Greeks were in a state of degrading slavery . It was a slavery worse in many respects than most cases , b&amp;canse the people of quick intellect and progressive spirit served the one of dull mind and stationary habit-the Christian served the Mahometan . Their restlessness under the yoke increased the severity of their masters , just as to-day the Greeks of Asia Minor are better off than the Cretans have been at any time during fifty years . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no proper means of - communication from town to town ; no secure possession of the profits of their labor . Then came the war of independence , lasting from 1821 to 1829 , which completely desolated their country . When they came out of this , they had to start from the very beginning to build up civilization . In Athens , for example , in 1830 , there was but one building fit to be inhabited . It is not quite forty years since they began at this point , and forty years in the Levant is not what it is in Chicago . Another thing to be considered is the small scale of the materials and means which they have had for their progress . The whole population is now a little over one million , having come up quite gradually to that point . Their territory is about nineteen thousand square miles , but less than half of it is cultivable , and of that part only about one-third is in private // hands . Improvident management during the ages of slavery has left the hills bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low laud suffers from want of water and from floods . While much of the soil is as thin and stony as any in New England , neither climate nor race fit the inhabitants to deal with it as the men of New England have with their rough inheritance . There is under cultivation a little more than an acre of land to every one of the population . In New England , in 1860 , the average was a little over four acres to every one of the population . With poor tools and so poor a soil , not much can be expected froni agriculture in Greece . The metayer system of rents also increases the distaste of the people for an agricultural life . Another thing to be considered is the anomalous political condition of the state since it gained independent existence . It has been during these thirty-seven years under a protectorate . The three powers , England , France , and Russia , which gave it ind*pendence , bound themselves to secure that independence ; and the two former keep each a vessel of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been of advantage to the infant state at first , but it has come to be felt as a burden , and on one occasion , at least-in 1854 , when the Greeks made a movement to use the opportunity of the Crimean war to attack their old eneiny ,  --  Turkey ,  --  . it prevented their action by force . It has given the people a king of foreign birth and race , and in choosing him there has been no thought of special adaptation in character or tastes to the country and people . This has been an underlying cause , tending to excite dissatisfaction at any time . The present king was entirely ignorant of the Greek language and history when he came to the country . Then , too , the artificial limits imposed upon the new state at its creation , excluding Thes*aly , Epirus , the lonian Islands , and Crete , have continually caused disappointment and irritation , and kept the people restless from the wish for more and better territory . The recent cession of the lonian islands , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the kingdom , but even the fervor of Greek patriotism and love of liberty could not raise the islanders themselves above a sort of mercenary regret at the change // froni gainful dependence upon England to union with the fortunes of poor , though independent , Greece . Now making due allowance for these hindrances to progress , let us look for a moment at the actual progress of the country during these thirty-seven years . They have established and kept working a reasonably stable government , with no more revolutions than other and older nations of Continental Europe have had during the same period . They have organized and carried on a system of education , modeled upon that of Germany , which , though it has the usual fault of such systems , a neglect of the lower departments in comparison with the higher , yet does good service and is full of promise for the future . They have built some three hundred miles of roadan amount which appears less insignificant when we consider that the nature of the country makes elaborate engineering , like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonnage of the commercial marine has quadrupled since 1833 , and the custom-house receipts have doubled in the last ten years . The population has increased from some six hundred thousand in 1833 , to over one million ; and Athens , to say nothing of Patras , Syra , Tripolitza , and Kalam*ta , has grown from a heap of ruins to a well-lighted , well-built ( in the better half of it ) , and orderly city of fifty thousand inhabitants . So much , at least , may be said for the actual progress of the Greeks since they became a nation . But these statistics give a somewhat more favorable impression than will be derived from a general view of the present state ot society . It has been said that the people were obliged to build up civilization almost from the very beginning . There are still to be found in their social state traces of the barbarism from which they have so recently emerged . To most of these , indeed , it would not be difficult to find parallels in the social history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in Greece because they appear side by side with a civilization in other things as advanced as England has now attained , and , we may add , with the ruined remains of a civilization which , in its own sphere , no country of modern Europe has surpassed . One such trace of barbarism is the existence of brigandage , so often urged as the standing disgrace of the Greek government . // It can not be denied that brigandage exists , and has existed at intervals ever since the nation began to govern itself . A year ago last August , a prominent politician , who had been minister of finance the previous winter , was seized by brigands at his country-house in* the Peloponnesus , kept wandering among the hills for thirty-six days , and released on paying a ransom of $10,000 . It seems probable that the tendency of the Greeks to this kind of life grew naturally out of the character of their warfare in the revolution of 18*1-9 . Unable to keep large armies in the fields , they occupied the mountains and passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks just as the Cretan insurgents are doing now . These wandering warriors are the heroes of the people 's songs and stories still , and their name ( *rc*Xsx*pi* , from *r&amp;XXa* ? ) is assumed by the brigands continually . The mountainous nature of the country and consequent want of good roads has made it difficult for the government to put them down with regular troops , and left the scattered peasantry to be terrified into concealing their movements and supplying them with food . Northern Greece especially has been at their mercy , because they could defy pursuit by crossing the frontier into Turkey , where , it is said , the wish of the authorities to injure Greece in any way , secures them impunity . After each revolution or interreguum through which the country has passed , there has sprung up a crop of these outlaws , men who have committed some crime in the time of disorder and thus found themselves forced into hostility against society and law to escape punishment . It is difficult to say exactly whose fault it is that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a government is weak , in any country ? At times it has been put down and kept down , until some general disurbance of society loosened the rule of order again . That the people , as a whole , are capable of self-restraint and respect for law , the bloodless revolution of 1843 satisfactorily showed . It may be true that some political leaders have been weak and wicked enough to use brigands to control votes by intimidation , but something like this has been known to occur once or twice in other countries . As the period of conflict with barbarism recedes into the past , as the system of roads is extended , // as the nation becomes habituated to government by a royal family of its own religion , or civilized up to the point of obeying a ruler chosen from among its own sons , this blot upon its character will disappear entirely , as it is disappearing in Italy . Akin to this is another trace of barbarism , or of semi-barbarons civilization ,  --  the need of guarding the public executioner from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article saw in an old fort on a little island in the harbor of Kauplia , one of the two men who do this public service for the whole kingdom . They are themselves criminals , who saved their heads by undertaking this unpopular duty , and they live always under military guard . Executions are not by hanging , but by beheading with the sword . The passions of individuals are so unrestrained , their minds so little disciplined by the idea of public duty , so little used to distinguishing between the act of the individual and that of the official , that the life of the executioner would not be safe among them . The treat . ment of criminals in prisons , too , is a disgrace to the country . The want of occupation and of provision for comfort or cleanliness shows the need of such a work as John Howard did for the rest of Europe in the last century . Some among the Greeks themselves see the evil , but do no more than lament that the government is prevented by its poverty from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university building on a greater scale and better adapted to its purpose than most of our colleges have , a number of fine school buildings , and several museums and hospitals , built by government or by private means , the whole kingdom is in want of a good prison , properly built for the purpose . The position of woman betrays the recent influence of Tnt -- key and the nearness of oriental customs . Marriages are arranged , not by the parties themselves , but by their parents or friends , and often while those most concerned are in their cradles . A lady told me that she had received several offem-s for one of her sons , but none for the other . It is said that the experiment was tried some years ago , of letting the young people manage the matter themselves , but the first results were so unsatisfactory that the old system was speedily restored . In // other respects the condition of woman is much the same as in other countries of Continental Europe , except for slight , scarcely perceptible indications that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the education of women . Most of the older women , whose early life was passed under the Turkish rule , are quite uneducated . There is no more hopeful sign for the future than the continued increase of facilities for the education of girls and young women . There is a sort of roughness about the society and life of the Greeks like that of the surface of their country , from which , as an obstacle to free communication , it may in part result . Except in Athens and the chief sea-port towns , there are no hotels ; a traveler must lodge in a khan , or be quartered on some family by the authorities . The domestic ways , in regard to washing , beds , arid other household arrangements , are generally , away from a few principal towns ( and in them among the common people ) , of a very primitive character recallino ' b often certairn Homeric descriptions to the mind . The implements of agriculture , too , belong to the same distant age , such as ploughshares of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibility of using wagons over most of the country puts heavy loads on the backs of men and donkeys . Manufactures are in a very backward condition , and most of the exports are fruits of the earth which require little preparation to fit them for the market . When we turn from the social condition to the character of the people , we find much to regret , and less evidence of progress than in external matters . We need to bear in mind that we are looking at a people which lives under much the same physical conditions with those of Italy and Spain , in which , therefore , we should not seek the peculiar virtues of more northern latitudes. - under an ecclesiastical influence hardly differing from that of the church of Rome , where , therefore , we should not look for the virtues of Protestantism ,  --  and on the confines of civilization and barbarism , over which the wave of history has once passed in its westward course . The vices of the nation which are most prominent are such as result from the thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Concealment and deceit , the natural // weapons of the weak against the strong , have become the habit of the Greek mind . The ancient Greeks may not have had the opposite virtue in the days of their freedom , but , if they had , it has perished with them . Xothing discourages so much as this him who sincerely wishes well to the modern Greek nation ; scarcely anything is so serious a hindrance to their real progress . It appears both in word and in deed ; they lack truthfulness , and they lack honesty . In neither church nor family is example or teaching given on this point on the side of good morals . These are painful things to say , but they must in truth be said . * o greater benefit could be done this people than to convince those in it who are teaching the young of the prime importance of teaching them the lesson of truth . The state of the national finances is an apt illustration . It is believed that the revenue , in every year of fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual receipts and the published statement have always , with the exception of one or possibly two years , shown a deficit . The interest on the loan made in England , in the time of ardent Philhellenism , has not been paid for many years , and the arguments by which the people justify this , only make the matter worse . At the present day a nation must be solvent to command the respect of the world , and Italy shows that she knows it by her efforts to attain that position . If Greece would take rank among the nations , let her by public honesty and economy right herself financially and begin to pay the interest of her debts . The ages of subjection and the short period of independent existence , given and secured by a protectorate , have not educated the nation into a habit of self-reliance . In their discussions and anticipations about Crete and the extension of their territory northwards , it is striking how much they feel their own weakness and rely upon the hope of the intervention of the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing appears , an oriental want of energy and self-helpfulness , but not to so great a degree , and in a far less degree than in their more oriental neighbors , particularly in all matters of trade . In these , they are the Yankees of the Levant . The high character and success of the Greek houses in leading comnmer // cial cities , everywhere outside of Greece itself , are too well known to need proof here . It need hardly be said either , that in speaking of nntruthfulness and dishonesty as national faults , it is not meant that there is no person in the kingdom whose word may not be fully trusted . There are many whose word and credit are above suspicion . With all this want of self-reliance , they have a boastfulness and extravagance in language quite equal to any American newspaper . To read an editorial in the " E*vo*6xc* " or one would think it was only necessary for the Greeks to rouse themselves , to remember their glorious ancestry and history , in order to sweep the Turks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternates with expectations of intervention by other nations in their behalf , but no one is troubled by the inconsistency . But such boastfulness is only a false manifestation of one of the great virtues of the Greeks . It often springs from vanity in individuak , but the same persons may be modest about themselves who are very boastful about their nation . Their patriotism , though it appears so much in this questionable form , is a strong deep-seated feeling , and has borne bitter fruits . The many public institutions which Athens owes to the liberality of Greeks grown wealthy in other countries , and the large contributions from the same sources in such crises as the present Cretan revolution , are substantial proof of this . This patriotism has indeed sometimes given way before bribery and factious ambition , yet it is the one strong and universal virtue of the Greek character . Their enthusiasm for education is another point in their favor . Though , perhaps , as already hinted , the zeal for education has been somewhat extreme , and other needs of society have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of knowledge will lead to the supplying of these deficiencies , and the error is on the right side . We need not inquire too closely into the motive which prompts the desire for education in individuals . Even if it is often the gain in social position and opportunities of advancement , it is better that men should be moved by these hopes to seek education than that they should remain in barbarian indifference to it . And it is evi // dence of life and health in the social system that men have reason to hope they may rise by this means above the level at which they start . The quality of the education given may be open to criticism , but hardly when one considers the circumstances , and compares it with that in older countries rather than with an ideal standard . If we think how Greece is separated from the rest of Europe , and by what it is surrounded , such a university and such gymnasia as it has must excite our admiration and wonder . The passionate love of freedom , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appears also in their modern descendants . It was in old times often perverted into mere license and the tyranny of a mob , and to-day it tends in the same direction . The fullest personal freedom of religion , and of opinion , and of speech is not yet secured or understood . It would hardly be safe to oppose or discourage the Cretan revolution in any part of Greece , and neither Protestantismn nor Freetnasonry can be publicly advocated without danger fromn the law or the mob . Yet their desperate struggles against the Turkish dominion , and their attachment to the constitution which declares all citizens equal before the law , attest their love for political and civil liberty . It is only reasonable to expect that education and experience in self-government will teach them the lessons of practical freedom which other nations have been none too quick in learning . The danger to freedom is rather from the weakness of the government than from its strength . These forty years of enlarged activity and increased intercourse with Europe have not left the character of the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs , and the introduction of new ones from abroad . They tell the traveler that he must go to the inland country villages to see Greek life in its genuine form and the Greek church in its proper position and purity . They lament that the ancient nsages of the Church are dying out in the larger cities , and that it is losing its control over the morals of the people . The popular feeling with regard to the use of Sunday has changed . When it was necessary to fit up a building for King Otho 's residence , the workmen refused to work on Sunday , though // greatly pressed for want of time . But since then the presence of the foreigners , they say , has spread among the people the continental idea of the day . Many of the young men who go from home to study in Europe , return without any religious faith . Indeed the educated people generally are lifted above the superstitions of the Church , and , seeing nothing else in it to hold their faith and reverence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneducated and as a bond of national union . There is nothing in Greece that has so much genuine nationality and antiquity about it as the Greek Church . The government is wholly modern , the society and literature have a French tone , the system of education is after a German model , the language itself is a mosaic of foreign idioms , and of classical forms revived from so remote antiquity that they seem foreign . But the Church has borrowed nothing ' from Western Europe , b and prides itself on having undergone no improvement since the first ages of Christianity . Calling itself simply " the Orthodox Church , " claiming to preserve uncorrupted the doctrines and usages of Apostolic days , untouched by the Reformation which left its mark on all the rest of Christendom , having a " Christian year " and a ritual peculiar to itself ,  --  to all these claims upon our interest it adds yet another , that it has been the ark of Greek nationality and the preserver of the Greek language and literature . This nationality of the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks themselves ascribe the preservation of their national existence to their church more than to any other agency . Its organization and its services have never been wholly interrupted . It has kept the people distinct from their Mahometan and Roman Catholic neighbors . It has preserved in its ritual their ancient language , in its New Testament and Byzantine forms . Its clergy have been the most active promoters of education , when the Turkish rule threw the whole burden of it upon the enslaved people . It has been a centre of national feeling in the absence of a government , and has given the sanction of religion to their struggles for freedom . It is , perhaps , in consequence of this antiquity and nationality , together with a want of enlightenment , that the Greek Ch*irch is so intolerant . It looks down upon all other forms of // Christianity as merely so many subdivisions of schism , and can not easily come to regard them as having equal rights with itself . To it , the Church of Rome with its centuries of history and tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sects . So identified is it with the Greek nation , that any attack upon it , even anything tending to draw away a single member from it , is regarded as an injury to the nation itselt This is the main obstacle to missionary work in Greece . Any citizen may change his religion , but if it can be proved that he did so under any influence from a foreigner resident in Greece , both parties are liable to punishment , and any religious organization including foreigners and Greeks as members , is a violation of the law . Thus religious liberty exists ; that is , members of any religious body may live unmolested in the country ; but proselytism is forbidden , and the question between our missionaries and the courts has been generally what constitutes proselytism . For a Greek to leave the church , is almost to become * traitor to his country . An American , resident for a short time in Greece , saw in a theological journal a representation of Protestantism , by a theological teacher in the University , which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same journal , and it was published , with the addition , undesired by him , of his name and nationality . This called out two public denunciations of him as residing in Greece for the purpose of making proselytes . All this shows a want of enlightenment on the part of both clergy and people . But the ignorance of the clergy has more serious consequences , too obvious to need to be stated here . For the work which they actually do , no education beyond the power to read and learn by heart the ritual is needed . Nor is it strange that educated young men very rarely enter clerical life , while the position of the parish priest is so low , the pay , made up of what fees the people can give for special services , so small , and the opportunities of advance to high station so rare . Some of the highest dignitaries are men of little or no education . There is a fine school in The outskirts of Athens for young men intending to become priests , but the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where their education finds a better market . Without a general education // of the priesthood superior to that of the common people , it is difficult to see how the Greek Church can reform itself from within . But of some reformation there appears to he great need . At present the Church seems to be full of formality and superstition . The doctrine of baptismal regeneration , the rite of baptism with its useless ceremonies , the practice of admitting infants to the communion , the kisses and prayers given to pictures of saints , the practical divorce of morality and religion ( every baptized person being a Christian , and everybody being baptized ) , the use of masses for the dead , the worship of the Virgin , the doctrine of transubstantiation , the virtue imputed to the outward acts of fasting and partaking of the cornmunion ,  --  such things as these indicate a mournful departure from the truth and spirituality of the Gospel . It is interesting to know and appreciate these facts in view of the tendency manifested by a small party here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witfi the Gr*eek tendency the Ureeks have heard about , and which has confirmed them in their confidence of superiority . They make a boast of it as a sign of a desire of the wanderers to return to the true orthodox Church . The Episcopal Church in this country has gone farther on the way back to the middle ages than most of us think , if it can cordially fraternize with the Greek Church as it is . There are some good things to be said , however , of the Greek Church ; that it does not prohibit or discourage the use of the Bible by the people , that its services , though recited or chanted at such a rate of speed as to be almost unintelligible , are still in a language understood and in a form obtainable by all , that it does not actually avow the policy of keeping the people in ignorance in order to control them , but rather encourages education except by its example . On these things , and on the desire of the people for education , must rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if the latter outruns the former , as it is now doing , if the people make progress in enlightenment while the Church remains unchanged , and the study of the Bible is neglected , the result can hardly fail to be that the educated classes will become infidel , and the ignorant superstitious , even more than now . // There are two different systems of missionary work among the members of such a church as this . One is to endeavor to promote reform within the existing organization , discouraging every attempt to form a new church , and dissuading individuals who may be awakened to new life from leaving the old Church . This is the policy of the " Anglo-Continental Society " of the English Church , on whose list of patrons are the names of haifa-dozen bishops of the American Episcopal Church . The dther missionary system is to promote the study of the Bible , in the expectation that the conscience of the converts will under that influence alone revolt against the errors of the corrupt church , and so they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the missionaries of the " American and Foreign Christian Union " at Athens ; the former has , we believe , no active representative in Greece . It is much to be desired that an earnest effort should be made to give the principle of the Anglo* Continental Society a thorough trial in Greece . For if it should succeed , it would accomplish the great object of missions at less cost in the excitement of sinful passions and the wounding of feelings ; if it should fail ( as seems more probable ) , its failure would define the position of the Greek Church , and concentrate missionary effort on the other plan . The only other hope for Christianity in Greece is in the formation of a pure Protestant Church under the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty . As the law is now , such a Church , consisting , pastor and people , of Greek citizens only , may be formed , and may claim the protection of the government against violence . It would meet with fierce opposition at first , and its members would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could be maintained . Let such a Church , by the blessing of God , have wise management and pure character , and it would soon make for itself a hearing , and command respect . The intolerance of the Greeks is of the kind that would give way before enlightenment , and there could be no better enlightenment than the sight of such a church . It would in course of time work reform in the Greek Church by the influence of its example . The Greeks themselves see and confess in private their need of reform , and now and then a bold priest advocates it publicly . But they must do the work themselves . The best // way to bring them to it is to build up such a church as we have described . On the whole , the tendency of things in Greece is toward improvement in education* in civilization , and in government . We hope that when the Gospel they have buried out of sight is brought back to them , even from the distant West , the improvement will begin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a few particulars about the University of Athens ( * i*vix6v iravnrnr*j.uov ) . It was organized soon after King Otho 's coming to Greece , by some German scholars who came with him , and , as has been said above , strictly on the plan of the German Universities . Like them , it has a rector ( in Greek , *rpi*ravi* ) appointed yearly from among the professors . Like them , it has four faculties , of law , medicine , theology , and philosophy , containing ordinary and extraordinary professors ( raxq*uco coc ixm-axm*oi x*7*m** ' ) , and privat-do. centen ( *** . Lzs ' * . Like them , it gives instruction almost entirely by lectures , and confers degrees on condition of a certain term of residence , and after examinations . The lectures are free and open to all , and are attended by many who do not enroll themselves as students . Many , probably most , of the professors have been educated in Germany or France , and present the fruits of European science in their instructions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well arranged for its purpose . It contains a lecture-room for each faculty , an anatomical theatre , a laboratory , and a large hall for public occasions . There is deposited in it also the national library , the property of the government , which is said to number over 80,000 volumes , and a smaller one , containing some 5,000 or 6,000 volumes , belonging to the University , and for the use of the instructors only . The nucleus of this latter was the private library of Thiersch . A newspaper just received from Athens contains some statistics about the University , from which the following facts are derived . The whole number of students enrolled as candidates for degrees from Sept. 1 , 1837 , to Sept. 1 , 1866 , was 4,347 , classified as follows : - in the theological faculty , 198 ; in the law faculty , 1747 ; in the medical faculty , 1986 ; in the philo // sophical , 182 ; and in the school of pharmacy , 244 . Those who obtained the degree of doctor during this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several faculties , except that there were only five in the theological school , and 158 in the school of pharmacy . Of ' instructors of all grades , there have been 8 in theology , 20 in law , 28 in medicine , 36 in philosophy . During the year 1865-6 there were 1182 students enrolled , more than in any year before , of whom more than half , 678 , were in the law faculty . The expenses of the University for that year are given as about $10,000 , of which a little more than half was to make up the salaries of the professors for two months when the government was unable to pay them . The receipts from all sources are stated to have been a little over $29,000 , and a large part of the surplus was invested in shares of the National Bank . The lectures are all in Greek , and show in an extreme degree tllie tendency to conform the modern language as far as possible to the model of the ancient . The degree of this tendency is the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of most of the modern Athenians . Many people attend the lectures for the mere pleasure of hearing their language skillfully and elegantly wielded , or even to improve their own style of expression by hearing from the professors a sort of Greek which they never hear in common life .
