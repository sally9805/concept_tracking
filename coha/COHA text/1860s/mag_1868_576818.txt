AMERICAN TRAITS AS SEEN FROM ABROAD . " THERE , I thought , in America , lies nature sleeping , over-growing , almost conscious , too much by half for man in the picture , and so giving a certain tristesse , like the rank ve*etation of swamps and forests seen at ni , , ht , steeped in dews and rains , which it loves ; and on it man seems not able to make much impression . There , in that great sloven continent , in high Alleghany pastures , in the sea-wide , sky-skirted prairie , still sleeps and murmurs and hides the great mother , long since driven away from the trim hedge-rows and over-cultivated garden of England . " The power of machinery in Great Britain , in mills , has been computed to be equal to six hundred million men , one man being able , by the aid of steam , to do the work which required two hundred and fifty men to accomplish fifty years ago . " EMERsON . OF all this wealth of nature the Americans are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all their applications , the Americans are also the masters . Now , just at the moment when the race has arrived at such perfect management of mechanical forces that every thing can be accomplished almost without human labor , it falls heir to a hidden hoard of boundless treasures , a continent full of gold and silver , food and clothing , fuel and useful metals ! Haying such a wonderful supply of the raw materials of existence , you could have been very comfortable without machinery ; and , on the other hand , with such machinery , you could have made yoursclves happy and respected in a desert . Behold ! you find yourselves starting with two outfits , each of a value not dreamed of hitherto ; the gifts of nature and of science , the real and the personal estate of mankind . The bridegroom and the bride , heirs of all the earth , meet in the new world and are married . The woi*d 's romance culminates in your ph*ce and your time . * * * * * No one will deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as to how much of the splendor is enjoyable now , and how much is only the looming of something still below the horizon , opinions must differ , even among Americans at home : much more among observers from abroad . Are the Yankees versatile , or are they volatile ? Is their prevailing trait of insouciance a foolish carelessness , or a happy freedom from care ? Are their ways impudent , or only independent ? Each takes care of himself , and does it , as a rule , successfully and pleasantly : is this enlightened freedom , or is it rude barbarism ? Each is , usually , richer every year than he was the year before : is this thrift , or is it greed ? He has always , luckily , a home ; the only misfortune is that he always has several homes in his lifetime . Socially America seems to me the gayest and happiest community the sun shines on ; to you , perhaps , it is a dreadful muddle of incongruous elements all levelled downward . How will the America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may get some idea by noting how it looks now , to outside observers . The distance of space supplies in some degree the coolness and cleamess that distance of tune will give to the future historian . It is only with English fellow-travellers that the American tourist can have much intelligent intercourse on national topics . The true foreigner ( not counting any English speakers as such ) is very polite and assiduous in showing any thing admirable in his own country , but very deficient in any intelligent curiosity respecting ours . In fact , he is apt to labor under an unlucky confusion of ideas as to any material distinction between North America and South America . An Italian innkeeper said to me that he had heard that New York was a very fine place ,  --  whereupon my opinion of his intelligence rose rapidly , - " New York , and also Rio Janeiro , " he added ,  --  whereupon my admiration // dropped to zero again. * Even with the more intelligent classes of foreigners , probably by reason of the toil of translations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a translation between him and all knowledge of the other 's affairs , we talk as an effort , and listen as to an essay-appear as an exhibition and observe as a spectator . The mass of continental Europeans seem to regard America as a distant land to which many of their countrymen have gone , and whence they never come back except as visitors ; for it is , strictly speaking , an American trait , that every adopted citizen strongly disclaims the idea of living in any other country after haykg once fairly made the acquaintance of ours . A bourne from whence no traveller returns , can not be a very cheerful aspect to present . But the English are not foreigners . We Anglo-Saxons are all English , though not all Americans . We own England in common ; all the immaterial and immortal part , by right of inheritance and possession . It is only the poor material portion from which we Americans can be excluded . All things England has done , unless within a short century or so , were done by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen . And all things she has said , written , and invented up to this day , are ours , whet her honestly come by or not . The English one meets abroad recognize this close internationality . The traditional stiff and surly Briton would'be a curiosity now on the continent . We know that he still exists , for we occasionally hear growls , in his very voice , from Carlyle and the like , who continue to regard ours as the Reuben among the nations ; " unstable as water , thou shalt not exceL 's They represent the England by which our republic was borne and weaned-always grievous operations . That England was our mother-country ; and it is noticeable that while human children come into the world sure of affection and even partiality from one if not two persons o* their kind , young * There is some Italian emigration to Rio . nations ( though they must have infancy and childhood ) have no natural friends and protectors , no apologists for the inevitable failures and follies of immaturity . The family of nations can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought forth alive , but is at once disowned  --  a foundling , never a fondling-thrust forth to make its own way , earning jibes and jeers in place of encouragement , and only beginning tp be respected when it learns to return injuries in kind . Well ! the United States must have graduated in this hard school , for , since our war , we American travellers experience only the most complimentary greeting , from all we meet ; and it looks more as if our enemies were trying to spoil us by flattery , since they have failed to injure us by abuse . It is like the fabled rivalry of the Wind and the Sun , in trying to deprive the traveller of his cloak . English travellers are the most cordial of all those we encounter . They wait for no introduction before entering into conversation with Americans , whatever may be their practice regarding their brother Britons . They approve of nearly every thing American . They praise our railway system . Their roads are bankrupt , or drifting that way , principally by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been built in such a fashion , they would scarcely have reached west of the seaboard States by this time . Cheap construction in America has spread railroads wherever they were needed . Few trains , well loaded , run at low speed and good prices , show a result which contrasts finely with that of the English system of roads in the eyes of their unhappy shareholders . They praise our long , wide , and light passenger-cars , wherein , though all are in one compartment , each can have really more privacy than in the divided foreign cars , unless in the latter he secures a whole compartment to himself and his party . In publicity there is protection for each , and it is easy to see that this difference in the style of carriages partly explains the fact that it // Is easier for a lady to travel alone and unprotected in America than in Europe . In England , even gentlemen have found to their cost that it is at the peril of their money and their reputation if they allow themselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disprove unfounded charges . And , a few years ago , London was shocked by a cold-blooded murder and robbery committed by a villain who found his victim alone with him in one of these separate compartments. * They praise our " coupon tickets " for passengers and our " checks " for baggage . They praise our steamboats with their spacious deck-cabins . The highest recommendation they can bestow on a couple of new steamers just put on the Rhine between Mayence and Cologne is , " They are quite like American boats . " They especially ridicule the English backwardness in the little matter of engine-signals  --  the word being passed , in all their small steamers , by the voice , the captain shouting to a boy , who shouts to the engineer . They praise our fighting on land and on sea , and our quick disarmament when the war was done . They praise our finances and our financial principles and prospects . They may have a sly laugh among themselves at our selecting the non-interest-bearing debt as the first to pay off ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it is the gold-interest bonds they hold and wish to keep . They praise our yachts , our monitors , our sewing and reaping machines , our school system , our hotels , where one unvaried charge covers a day 's entertainment , and there is no question of each item of lodging , board , light , service , &amp;c. ,  --  a great saving of temper and clerk-hire. * The fundamental difference between the American and foreign styles of car-building is , that onr car-bodies rest on two separate and independent centre-bearing " trucks , " of four , six , or eight wheels each , while the foreign cacs are set directly on their four wheels , like a wagon . Our ears would float unshaken over their fine smooth roads , while theirs wouli soon jolt to pieces on our rough cheap structures . The most characteristic thing about all this is , that our friends the English select as topics the points wherein they can praise us , and quite slur over or ignore those wherein they could not . They are never tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , and sometimes put us quite to the blush by inquiring concerning things we ought to know of , but do not . And then they pay us the highest compliment in their power by confounding us with themselves . A cheery John Bull voice asked , at a chance meeting in Switzerland , " More English ? " " Americans , " we answered . " All the same , " was the stranger 's pleasant rejoinder . These same English are conspicuously deprecatory in speaking of the present aspects and prospects of their own country . One has to imagine who are the supporters of the Reform Bill , for one rarely or never meets them . As it is middle-class people with whom we naturally fall in , not members of the nobility nor of the working classes , we are led to suspect that the movement ( instituted as it was by a Tory government ) is at the expense and to the disadvantage of the middle class . Roughly stated , it may be somewhat thus : the House of Commons is the real governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House of Commons ; to add to the number of electors tends to dilute or dissipate the overweening power thus resting in the hands of a few . And whether the new voters vote conservatively or not , the conservative majority is secured by creating a division in the ranks which were becoming too strongly liberaL A more probable supposition , however , is , that we are looking too deep to penetrate motives really very shallownothing more than a successful effort on the part of the minority to take the wind out of the sails of the liberal party . " We are no more a monarchy , you know , than you are , except in name , " the English are fond of saying . But whether it is said more in pride or in regret , it is difficult always to decide . // The Fenian troubles , the Hyde Park riots , the Sheffield outrages , are classed with the diminution of British influence abroad as symptoms of decay , and adduced with no little bitterness as illustrations of the painful though flattering suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . In vain do you urge that there is great glory to their free institutions , in the fact that when the people think they have a right to go into the parks , the Queen , Lords , and Commons combined dare not try to keep them o.ut ; and further try to show that the other irregularities are mere crimes , fully put down , and therefore signs of strength rather than weakness ; and , further , argue that , as to foreign influence , the people are happiest under that government that has least of it . They shake their heads-point to the fact that the franchise is extended to some of the very men responsible for the violent demonstrations-mourn the good old days when England dictated the honorable and unselfish arrangements that followed Waterloo , and point with regret to the absorption of German States and Free Cities , the almost ruin of poor little Denmark , their ally , and the huge growth of France and Prussia ; finding only comfort in the thought that the two latter balance eaeh other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard for Great Britain . Let those mourn that will , and let those laugh that win . The love of martial glory and national prestige have never been American failings , and long may it remain an American trait to view them with distrust . Mountain-peaks are good for castle-builders , and heroic eras are rich fields for historians . But happy are the common people in lands that lie level and in times wherein the historian and romance-writer are at a loss to find material for their work . The absence of news from America more than enough to make the shortest of paragraphs in the Times and Galignani , is a continual disappointment to the traveller in these days . But " no news is good news ' * for us . Let us hope to continue to be a newsless land . We have been furnishing quite too many thrilling paragraphs of late years . There is a question which strangers are fond of asking , which suggests a fear that these moderate hopes are not wellfounded . It is , " What are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of interest from our side of the water if we are to become the inheritors of the debts and disorders , the home and foreign quarrels , of that wretched tropical climate and people . Heaven grant that this new complication is not so imminent as from this ( European ) side it seems to be ! " Paris is a kind of large , exaggerated , inferior New York . " So said to me an Englishman in Paris during the summer of 1867 . He is a man of wit , sense , and taste , who had lived in both cities , and who knew what he was talking about , and meant what he said . My only disagreement with his estimate would be that he did too much honor to Paris . For comfort and happiness of old and young , rich and poor , male and female , no continental city can compare with New York or several of her sister-cities on your side of the water . Where young girls are treated as they are in America , the innocent gayety they naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gayety may almost be said to be characteristic of Paris . It does not lessen the gayety of a city or country that its gentlemen should be men of affairs . No wise housewife likes an establishment where the " men-kind " are too much at home . Absence is wholesome , and variety is the spice of domestic life . Idleness means ennui , and that is incompatible with enjoyment . Business , when made a subject , not a master , is the happiest as well as the most respectable position for all men . ( Even study must be made a business . ) The ideal American is he who is full of business in business hours and places , and full of pleasure at home or abroad with his family . New York is the busicst and gayest city in the // world . Wall-street is the gayest street in New York , and Fifth avenue the next . Hence it arises that the Americans are the sunniest of travellers here in Europe . The English enjoy enough in their way . " 118 8'amusaient tristement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Froissart , and so they do to this day . That is , they are sufficiently happy without smiles or laughter . The Frenchman does not travel nowadays unless it be to a watering-place , and then he seems to be always regretting his Paris . The German , too , as a rule is not a pleasuretraveller , though a very sensible and charming fellow when you do meet him , having always some art or other near his heart and at his finger-ends . ( They say the German can travel when he pleases at half the sum it costs us English-speaking tourists . ) But our countrymen , with their handsome trains of women and children , carry their own sunshine , and care not in the least that it illumin*s other people and things fortunate enough to be near by . A little vociferous , perhaps , sometimes , but that is easily remedied , for they are quick to learn . And a little too much freedom is better than a stiff and priggish attention to appearances . This is our holiday , and as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus do it well and joyfully , so we here make a business of our pleasure , and do it in the same style . An Englishman of the best class supplies the need for employment by hunting , racing , yachting , farming , legislating , travelling , or something else . But the Frenchman does not take naturally to these manly occupations . The Parisian society-man unfortunately has no Wall-street , so he has late rising and ennui . He has no money-making , so he has gambling . He has no exercise , so he has indigestion . He has no simple tastes , so he has absinthe , chartreuse , cura*ao , or hell-and-honey under some other name . He has no politics , so he has a " glorious** empire and a perfect system of gendarmerie-in fact , a paternal government , under which he is " libre , mais re*glement* . " He has no travel , so he has egotism . Fin*l1y , he has no young lady-friends , so he has-woman enemies , young or old . Who would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste for more wholesome and natural food , so does the living in Paris incapacitate for living elsewhere or appreciating things not Parisian . The mysteries of Paris , the wonders of Paris , the joys and pains of Paris , the loves and hates of Paris , the nights and days of Paris , the glories of Paris , form the theme toward which are turned the eyes of all-Paris ! A witty Frenchman has lately published an article in which he threatens the Parisians with lunacy or idiocy if they do not turn their attention away from themselves . He reminds them of the days renowned in history when Frenchmen shared with the rest of Christendom the victories , material and moral , gained by civilization over barbarism . And he urges them to go away from home , as do the English and Americans , to see the rest of the earth , and so form a just estimate of their own little world of Paris . VainT . It is no use to struggle against fate . " Latin supremacy " is a thing of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Frenchman of 1867 prefers to sit at home and bring the rest of the worid to see him and his Great Exposition , while he smokes the opium-pipe of selfcomplacency . For us , on the contrary , regarding this as well as other shows , we prefer the role of spectator to that of showman . The true place of America in the Exposition is in the Visitor Department-much obliged for all the trouble taken to get up the affair-glad to buy whatever is new and valuablenothing to advertise for sale , and therefore nothing ( comparatively speaking ) to exhibit . There are our pianos , our locomotives , our reaping-machines and our sewing machines ; but we offer none like them for sale , as no foreigner could afford to buy them at such prices as we can ourselves afford to give . Seriously speaking , we have nothing to learn from any other nation in the // way of new , quick , simple , and beautiful applications of mechanical forces . The dearness of manual labor has forced us to a degree of ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequalled elsewhere , however it may be destined to be surpassed hereafter . In perfecting manufactures they are beyond us ; in cheapening them we are , probably , in advance . Take the use of coal , for example . The French set thousands of women , girls , and boys , to breaking , picking , and sorting , the rough coal and separating all impurities . We , on the other hand , burn the rough coal , unassorted , with perfect success . So our women can be where they belong , in the household , and the girls and boys at schooL In France they earn a franc or so a day each . In our country they earn a good deal more , in the long run , let us hope . A minute and well-defined division of labor into classes and of society into castes , , is the marked trait of the old countries ; the absence of such divisions and castes the marked trait in ours . This of course causes , in Europe , a marvellous perfection of the products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The portentous ignorance of the general run of continental Europeans , in any department other than their own specialty , would seem incredible to usquite as much so as their marvellous attainments in their own allotted direction . I travelled with a Jewish Rabbi ; a man of respectable age and appearance and much intelligence in his way . As his residence or pastorate had included Vichy , he had seen many of the magnates who go there to drink the waters - among others the Emperor and Empress and Minister Fould ; with all of whom he had " talked by the hour , " to use his own expression . I learned from him many things I was glad to know. * And he probably * Among other items of information I got from him was this , that he received the same stipend from the French Government as would a catholic priest having charge of the same number of parishioners , or a Protestant minister . learned some things from me , for he asked where our locomotive got hot water ! I pointed out the roadside water-stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water boiling ? " I explained that it was cold when they received it , and they boiled it by their own fire . " Ah ! ouioni-oui-oui-*a -- -*a ! " said he , quite edified . " But of course they must have some hot water at the very first , to begin with , before they started . " I do n't know what he meant-I can only give his words . It is very difficult , when talking with fellow-travellers of other nations , to avoid talking " at a mark , " so to speak . The American , having an object in view ,  --  a national fault to extenuate or a point of national doctrine to propagate ,  --  is tempted , quite unconsciously , to represent things as he wishes them to appear to the hearer , rather than as they do appear to the speaker . A talent for silence is what we lack ; that perfectly good-natured observation of other people 's idiosyncrasies in preference to the exploitation of our own , which marks the true cosmopolitan , the beau-ideal of travellers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , we care less for others ' opinions about us . Foreign approval is not a bad thing , quite the contrary ; but the more desirable it is , the less it should be sought after . It is a growth that thrives best by a judicious neglect  --  a boon which is lost by being demanded . Another failing , which may almost be called a national trait , is the tendency to imitate , more or less successfully , the personal peculiarities of those we meet and admire abroad , more especially the English , as they seem to occupy , individually , the most respected position in nations foreign to their own . So far as this leads us to speak in the style of the best Englishmen , slowly and carefully , weighing and selecting words so that we can , when they are chosen , stick to them forever , * it is a good thing . It is this moderation and exactness of statement that makes the style so respectable // as to attract imitation . But when we go beyond the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not feel , clip our final syllables , and connect the words with " aa- " it is the mere weakness of imitation  --  the imitation of weakness . Oh for a little more of Mr. Lincoln 's good-humored superiority to appearances ! His forgetfulness of his dignity was true natural dignity , and sure to be recognized as such , even in the most artificial atmosphere in the world . Fancy his being taken for an Englishman ! Still more , fancy his wishing to be so mistaken ! I can picture to myself the good old humorist laughing at the idea , and saying something like this . " That reminds me of a little story I 've heard somewhere , of a turkey that was a very good turkey until he undertook to be a peacock ; and after that neither turkeys nor peacocks would have any thing to do with him . Do n't know as he 'd have b'en any better if he had b'en a peacock , neither ! " The gentle , genuine , unaffected simplicity of Mr. Lincoln 's bearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our manners , so far as they can properly be made the subject of effort . While un-American eyes regard us thus and so , the question naturally arises , How do our own traits appear from this new point of view , to our-selves ? Our eyes become , to a certain extent , Europeanized , and to the same degree things in the western world appear unstable , evanescent , unreal , unrespectable . We see that ours is the land of bubble speculations and collapses ; of great gains and great losses ; of uncertain collection of debts ; of appalling accidents ; of wooden cities built in a day and burnt in a night ; of gigantic frauds and defalcations ; of unpunished crimes and outrages ; of bowie-knives and revolvers ; of vigilance committees and Lynch-law mobs ; of exaggerated and caricatured popularity and unpopularity , and storms of praise at one time and blame at another lavished on persons who deserved neither the first nor the last ,  --  in short , the very Empire of Immoderation . We see , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high wages for poor services and high prices for poor goods ; that while Europeans are enjoying the accumulations of generations of surplus labor , we are toiling to create those accumulations . We see from this other side ,  --  what at home we had nearly forgotten ,  --  that if Americans were the victors in our war , Americans were also the vanquished ; so that , alas ! we have no banners to hang up in our memorial halls except the tattered standards we ourselves carried ; that all the wounds we inflicted and all we may hereafter inflict are on American health and wealth ; and even in our greatest and noblest achievement , the abolition of slavery , we destroyed an industry which hitherto , at least , has not been rebuilt . We see that the horrible partisan doctrine , " to the victors in elections belong the spoils of office , " prevails in the United States alone of all the nations on earth ; that this principle has given us the worst set of office-holders it is possible to imagine ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties in succession , the one to which we belong not having shown any more virtue in the matter than did that of our opponents . And we know that among our politicians of all parties , the thought as to what will advance is right or wrong . We see that in the United States the illogical and artificial system of tradeunions , with all its interference with the freedom of competition between supply and demand , and all its tyranny of workmen over fellow-workmen and over employer , is assuming proportions threatening to be as overshadowing there as they have become in England , where the " unions** are the tools of every demagogue and the greatest peril of every branch of industry . Indeed , the evil threatens to be more destructive with us in proportion as the class composing // the combinations is more politically powerful . We see that the purchase of our bonds abroad , however gratifying as an evidence of foreign confidence , is simply the creation of a load of foreign debt ; for every bond we now sell abroad for seven hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , two thousand dollars before we get it back again . Nevertheless , our surplus of four million dollars a month is being applied to reduce the quiet and costless debt held at home , while the foreign debt is piling up at such a frightful discount and with such a frightful rapidity . Even in congratulating ourselves on our splendid crops , we tremble to think what would have been the result of a failure in the harvest , and so come to hesitate about putting too much confidence in a financial prosperity which is at the mercy of a bad season . We are an extravagant people . The subjeeP of money , as we all know , is tabooed among Americans of the first class , except in private or business conversations . There is not ever that exact balance between income and expenses which prevails among people of other nations . A foreigner of second-rate means goes to a second-rate hotel . An American of third-rate resources goes to the best he can hear of . The best , without regard to cost , is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockbrokers-still less are we all millionaires ; but we act , or rather talk , as our money came without toil and could be expended without thought . All our extravagances we make publicly , and our economies privately or even secretly . Yet no thinking American , of all the host now travelling abroad , can have quite escaped the occasional feeling that he was revelling in a fool 's paradise ; that his gayety was out of place ; that he was giving away hard-earned and muchneeded American funds to grasping foreigners , for " service** he did not need , and " bougies " he did not burn . Po8t equitem sedet atra cura " and even in our lightest moments we think with a pang of the price of gold in New York . Looked at from abroad , it seems as if we had before us a very severe ordeal . Our times look harder from without than they do from within . Our depreciated currency seems like a deceitful sod over a quaking morass ; the premium on gold like a premium on extravagance instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and threatening , while the resources are unseen . From within , we see that the debts-national , state , municipal , and personal-though almost immeasurable , bear only the relation to our resources that icebergs do to the supporting ocean . But to European eyes the icebergs seem to overtop and chill the sea . We may as well make a clean breast of it , and confess that the sight of the stability of the governments abroad , the mainly just and humane public institutions , the general contentment of the people , even in those classes we have been accustomed to pity as oppressed , the sure and quiet protection to person and property of rich and poor , give a perceptible shock to our previously rampant republican democracy . No American is probably ever changed to a monarchist , but he may be so unsettled in his convictions as to allow that there are , possibly , two sides to the question , and that the anti-republican may honestly think himself in the right ; and even this is , to most of us , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps exposed to a fire in the rear in the shape of some mortifying or disgraceful paragraph copied from American newspapers , he is liable to certain puzzling thoughts ,  --  doubts as to how much of our political strength and success is due to our financial prosperity , and how much to the inherent righteousness of republican principles and the innate virtue of the masses ; in other words , whether universal suffrage would comfort as well with universal scarcity as it does with universal abundance . When the road from poverty to wealth is no longer so open as now , will the equality of voting-privileges and superiority of numbers tempt the poor to vote for // equality of the other goods of this world ? " Vote yourself a farm " does very well so long as there are public farms to be voted . How when the unclaimed farms are all gone ,  --  will it be vote yourself somebody else 's farm ?

" Such are the captious and skeptical thoughts that come into the mind of a travelling Yankee during his re-actionary -. low-spirited - cowardly moments . They do not indicate a decrease in his love of home ; on the contrary , lie is perhaps most subject to them when he is a little ho1 esick and tired of his exile .

Let older nations enjoy the fruit of by-gone harvests , we prefer to plant and reap our own crop , and to eat our bread while it is fresh . And whatever is best among their treasures we can buy for our own use with the surplus of ours . It is pleasanter to earn than to inherit  --  to build than to invoL. i. - 20 habit .

Railway crossings are characteristic things . On the Continent , on coming to a railway , you are as likely as not to find the gates down , and yourself detained until the coming train has gone by . In England , you find that the unlucky railway builders have been compelled to make an excellent permanent way over or under the track . In America , you simply encounter a great signboard , " Railroad Crossing . Look out // for the cars ! " Your feeling at the Continental railway would probably be , " I wish they had forgotten to shut the gate .

We in America look to a man 's property or his probity for the security of our claims against him ; but abroad , in most countries he must pay or go to prison . Therefore credits here are freely given , and hence arises the prevalence of those loads of personal debt , so common among all classes , from the poor student to the greatest lights of literature and artfrom the princes of the blood-royal to the pawnbrokers ' customers . There is a whole strain of humor in English literature which puzzles the uninitiated  --  the bewailing of " debt " as a misfortune , like sickness or accident ; and the stigmatizing of " duns " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like organ-grinders , beggars , swindlers , and pickpockets . In America , your creditor is a man who has entrusted you with something , and his dun is his representative asking you for the promised equivalent . In England , the first is your enemy , and the last a " bore . " There the expedients for getting other people 's goods , and then avoiding restitution , have furnished some of the funniest bits of history and fiction . The creditor , whom they regard as the offender , we should sympathize with , while the debtor , whom they pity , we should call a thief . " With years , our faults diminish , while our vices increase . " This cruelly cynical maxim is true of nations , whether it be universal among individuals i*r not . Heaven be praised that we have the youth of a nation for our own , even if it be one of the last that can ever be young before the earth shall be finally and once for all full of its troublesome human children . Better the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national failings than national crinies . Tobacco-chewing and spitting are less objectionable than bigotry and superstition . The custom of keeping standing armies is more dangerous to human life than the custom of carrying deadly weapons . We talk through our noses , doubtless , but our speech is , in other respects , free ; we prefer an unlicensed public press to one that is licensed ; give us the liberty of private censure , and we gladly do without a public censor . T is a good thing to see law well dispensed-still better to see it well dispensed with . Great and beautiful realities may cast shadows most monstrous and hideous ; and before condemning such a principle as that of universal suffrage for the sake of something repulsive we see in its outline , we should be very sure that the ugliness is not a contortion of its shadow or some imperfection of vision in the critic . Perhaps we can not trust " the masses . " Perhaps " the masses " can not trust us . Perhaps it is a matter we can safely leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it necessary to arrange every thing beforehand for fear it should go wrong . To quote Mr. Lincoln again ( and this time authentically ) , " if we jest keep a-peggin ' away , it 'll all turn out right . " In America , each man must build his own house . But he finds room to put it , and materials to build it of-two essentials which are not to be had in Europe by the majority of mankind . No living in " flats " satisfies an AngloSaxon-his neighbors must be by his side on the same level . From the nadir to the zenith he must have clear dominion. * // And he is right , too ; it is one of his most sturdy and manly traits . Perhaps sometimes lie remembers what a vast deal of earth he holds , measured perpendicularly ; and also , starting with nothing at the centre of the world and spreading to a few acres at the surface , what a glorious tract of the spacious firmament belongs to his farm ! A good fixed standard to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they regard army-life , the latter being pretty much the same in all times and countries -- certainly it is never more tolerable than it is made to the American soldier . Yet nothing but a severe sense of duty could retain our men in service , while in other countries the profession of arms is the favorite calling , and how to disband an army has been among the most puzzling problems for great rulers and conquerors . During our war , an eminent English writer asked me , " How ari you going to get rid of this great force when you are done with them " Muster them out at once . " " You 'll find that more easily said than done . History teaches that such masses of men are more easily collected than disbanded . When they feel their power , they will want to make the most of it . " " You do n't know them , " said I. " All they want is to be allowed to go home . They would give up any thing , to-day , except their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arms and go , each to his own home . " " Suppose your General " ( naming my own commander ) " should use his popularity among the soldiers to give himself supreme power . " " I would be the first to oppose him , and every man in his command would do the same ! " " Oh , my dear young friend ! I hope it may turn out so , but I fear you will find that your army is like other armies , tenacious of the power it has acquired , * " I want my land doom to the eccentric , " said an illiterate Illinoisan to me , objecting to the reservation of the mining right under his purchase . and disposed to make the best terms it can before surrendering it . " He had history , experience , Sagacity , to back him . I had nothing on my side but common sense , knowledge of American character , and correctnes8 , as proved by the result . What is to be the upshot of this great union of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions such as marked the Decline and Fall of Rome ? Or to great feudal estates like those of the Dark Ages ? Or to princely splendor of certain families , repeating the magnificence of the Medici and the Foscari in old Europe and the heavier though less showy fortunes of the Rothschilds and Hopes of the present Europe ? Or more like the hosts of overgrown fortunes in England ? Probably there will be men as rich as any of these millionaires . As to the means of personal enjoyment , we may even hope that the generality of men will equal the richest of them . The hoarding and spending of great sums was the fatal vice of the Decadence ; but no satrap of them all could afford to travel thousands of miles for amusement or change of air . The Medici filled Florence with palaces , pictures , and statues . The " Medici Chapel " alone cost twenty-two million francs , all paid for out of the Medici private purse . We modern tourists are much obliged to the generous spendthrifts ; but it must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you ask after the present status of the family , you are told " the name exists still , but only the name . " No wonder * Angelo Medici drove our carriage over the Alps this summer-possibly a happier man and certainly a better driver than he would have been if all the wealth of his greatest ancestor had descended to him . At any rate , he can afford a spring-carriage , a photograph , and a daily newspaper , which Loreuzo the Magnificent could not have done . Even the absolute sum of coined golden income will probably be as great in many a single purse as ever has fallen to any men in any age . But there will // probably be no massive , overshadowing edifices of wealth , looming up the greater on account of the general poverty about them . Probably also there will be no towering piles of learninb like Oxford *nd Cambridge , and no contrasting prisons of vicious ignorance . An everlasting redistribution of knowledge and of property will raise the general level , so that even the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . It will be a broad , elevated plateau of intelligence **27;54;TOOLONG according to the old ideas of the picturesque ; but probably there is a new and truer standard of beauty to grow up for the new and perfect conditions of happiness about to arise . The foreign common people surprise us Americans by their generally contented aspect ; but our people look more than contented . They look sanguine and hopeful , and with reason . With what absolute glee does the American traveller return to his home and business I Nothing to regret , either in his absence or in his return . " As soon as I return to Massachusetts , I shall lapse at once into the feeling , which the gee aphy of Asnerica inevitably insp es , that we play the game with immense advantage ; that there , and not here , is the set nod centre of the British race ; and t*t no skill or activity can long compete with the prodigious natural advantages of that country , in the hands of the same race ; and that England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he contented , like other parents , to he strong only in her children .
