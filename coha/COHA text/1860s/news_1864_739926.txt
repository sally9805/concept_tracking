txt Sir : Many persons , against whom criminal indictments or against whom property proceedings under the confiscation laws are pending in the courts of the United States , growing oat of the participation of such persons in the existing rebellion , have in good faith taken the oath prescribed by the Proclamation of the President , of the 8th of December . 1863 , and have therefore entitled themselves to the full pardon and restoration of all rights of property , except as to slaves and where the rights of third parties have intervened , which that proclamation offers and secures . The President 's pardon of a person guilty of acts of rebellion will , of course , relieve that person from the penalties incurred by his crime , and where an indictment is pending against him therefor , the production of the pardon , signed by the President , or of satisfactory evidence that he has complied with the conditions on which the pardon is offered , if he be not of the class excepted from the benefits of the proclama lion , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from custody therein . Nor is ' Mess doubtful that a bona fide acceptance of the terms of the President 's Proclamation by persons guilty of acts of rebellion , and not of the excepted class , will secure to such a person a restoration of all the rights of property except as to slaves , and where the rights of third parties shall have intervened ; notwithstanding such property may , by reason of those acts of rebellion , have been subject to confiscation under the provisions of the Confiscation Acts of Aug. 6 , 1861 , chapter 60 , and July 17 , 1862 , chapter 195 . For without adverting to any other source of power in the President to restore their rights of property , the 13th section of the Act of July 17 , 1862 , authorizes the President , at any time thereafter , by proclamation , to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion , in any State or part thereof , pardon and amnesty , with such exceptions and at such times and do such conditions as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will littraly be questioned , I suppose , that the purpose of this section , inserted in a law mainly intended to reach the property of persons engaged in the rebellion was to vest the President with full power to relieve such persons on such conditions as he should prescribe from the penalty of loss of their property by confiscation . Although the proceedings for confiscation under the Acts of August 6 , 1861 , and July 17 , 1862 , are in rem ' against the property seized , ye under both acts the ground of condemnation is the personal guilt of the owner in aiding the rebellion . By the pardon and amnesty , not only is the punishment of that personal guilt remitted , but offence the offen itself is effaced , that izeini ike special effect of an act of amnesty of the Government . Of course it arrests and puts to an end all penal proceedings founded thereon , . whether they touch the person or the property of the offender . There is , therefore , no case of judicial proceedings to enforce the penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured by the constitutional or statutory powers of the President to grant pardon and amnesty , whether those proceedings be against the person of the offender by criminal indictment , or against his property under the Confiscation Acts referred to . The President has accordingly directed me to instruct you that in any case where proceedings have been commenced and are pending and undetermined in the district or Circuit Courts of the United States for your District , against a person charged with acts of rebellion , and not of the excepted class , whether they be by indictment or seizure and libel of his property for confiscation , the rights of other parties not having intervened , you will discontinue and put an end to these proceedings , whenever the person so charged shall produce evidence satisfactory to you that he has , in good faith , taken the oath and complied with the conditions prescribed by the President 's Proclamation of the 8th of December11883 . Nor islit necessary that the evidence he produces should be a deed of pardon signed by the President . It would be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now availing themselves of the benefits of the proclamation . and who are likely to *do so hereafter , with this formal evidence of pardon ; it will be sufficient to justify your action if the party seeking to be relieved from further proceeding shall prove to your full satisfaction that he has in good faith taken the oath , and brought himself within the conditions of pardon and amnesty set forth in the proclamation . If in any case you have good reason to believe that the oath has been taken for the mere purpose of obtaining the possession of personal property seized under the Confiscation Acts , with intent to remove it from the subsequent reach of the officers of the law . you will make report of the facts and reasons for your belief at this office before discontinuing the proceedings or restoring such prop A Handsome Compliment Well Deserved . The public doubtless remember the energetic and serviceable efforts of Mr , LIONARD W. Jams to promote the success of the great popular gathering at Utica last Summer , under the auspices of the Loyal League of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldiers who had just returned from the war . A dozen or more of the prominent members of the Loyal League , desirous of testifying their appreciation of Mr. Janus 's services in this matter , gave him a dinner at Delmonico 's , on Fifthavenue , on Friday evening last , and presented him a most elegant souvenir of the Utica meeting . in the form of a superb quarto volume , containing the original letters , telegrams , and other documents connected with it , handsomely engrossed copies of the . address and resolutions adopted on the occasion , ( photographic likenesses of the most conspicuous participants , views of interesting scenes connected with it . and other matters of a similar kind . The collection is most skillfully arranged , bound in superb style , and bears inscribed upon the cover the name of Mr.Jsama and the occasion of its presentation . It was prepared under the careful'and tasteful supervision of Gen. WmtoRs , whose action and well directed efforts contributed so largely to the success of the meeting . Among those present at the dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ex-Mayor Opdyke , James T. Brady , Esq , . James Wadsworth , Esq. , Ex-Lieut. - Gov . Tyler of Connecticut , : and ; others . Mr. JEROME acenowledged the compliment of the presentation , which was made by Mr. WADSWORTH , in brief and very appropriate terms . There was a good deal of speaking on public topics from the several gentleman present , and the occasion was one of unusual interest . We can not avoid saying in this connection that , since its enlargement by the addition of the adjoining house , Delmonico 's is the most spacious , elegant and complete restaurant in me world . There is nothing in Paris or any other European city , so far as we are aware , that can surpass it in tue excellence of its appointments and the general elegance and comfort of everythil g connectdd with It . It has added immensely to the comfort and convenience of living in town , and is abundantly patronized , as it deserves to be . sudden Deathiof Austin B. Williams , a wellknown Printer . Mr. AUSTIN B. WILLIAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years past employed in the Naw-Yona Timm establishment , died suddenly at the Hydropathic Institution of Dr. TEALL &; Co. , in Laight-street , yesterday morning , Feb. 21 . Mr. WILLIAMS ' personal appearance ? ( being , perhaps , the largest and heaviest man since the days of Mr. Hots , in this City , weighing some 420 pounds , and requiring no less than seventeen yards of broadcloth to complete his exterior outfit ) ? made him an object of eapeciat and peculiar interest to all associated with him . His humor and ready wit were of a superior order , and these , with his extraordinary proportions , made him a " host " among his associates . Mr.P.T.BARNUM repeatedly sought him for his popular resort as a natural curiosity , but his exceeding sensitiveness and peculiar character would never permit him to become an object of popular curiosity . He was extremely timid and bashful when in the presence of ladies , and would resort to any subterfuge to escape their company . Still more notable characteristics of Mr. WILLIAM ! may be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ araent spirits nor tobacco , never wore an overcoat , and eschewed the common vices of mankind to a degree seldom annalled . He was a native of Exeter , N. H. , and in the 31st year of his age . About a week since , while on his way home , he was seized with an attack of apoplexy , and lingered until Sunday morn ing , when he passed away . REOPENING OF ST . JAMES ' Cituncn. ? Yesterday was celebrated the grand reopening of St. James ' Church . Since its close the interior has been entirely renewed , and it is now one of the most beautiful churches in the City . The three new altars are most elegant , and in richness of appearance surpass almost all . The decorations of the church are very fine , particularly the three paintings over the altar , representing " The Crucifixion , " " The Savior Raising to Life the Daughter of Gallus , " and " The Holy Family . " On the walls amuna the church are numerous figures In bas relief , Illustrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed , and addgreatly to the beauty of the church . In the morning the solemn and impressive ceremonies of grand high mass Were performed by the pastor , Rev , J. Bauman celbrant , assisted by Deacon Rev. Mr. Barony , ' SubDeacon Rev. Mr. KEEGAN/ and Master of Ceremonies Rev , Mr. Csu , saart , the progstant pastor . The Very Rev. Father STARits , administrator of the dlocegii , delivered the sermon . There were also present a great number of the dignitaries of the Catholic Church , among whom were Rev. Father Moitems . NET , of the Cathedral ; Rev. Father FARRELL , of St. Joseph 's ? Rev. Fathers MoCserv , O'DONNELL , RayMOLDS and GLeason . Also , Rev. Fathers MoLsuaatirt , of Flatbush , CASSIDY and MoKstoss. , of Brooklyn , and numerous others . Long before the hour of service , the church was crowded to its utmost , and many were turned away unable to gain admission . Judge DALY and lady and many other distinguished persons were present . THE SKATING AT CENTRAL PARS. ? The last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic , musical or Terpsichorean event , seems to stir up every one who had delayed till the last moment participating In its pleasures ; for the various routes to the Fifth-avenue Pond and Central Park Lakes , were more than usually alive on Saturday , . with all classes of persons , on their way to mingle in the skating carnival . Strings of carriages lined the approaches to the Fifth-avenue Pond , where the company was more select , yet very numerous ; a fine band of music enlivening the attractions , and the excellent arrangements in the spacious saloons adding to the comfort of visitors . Yesterday , the delightful weather caused such a scene on the various routes to the Park , and at the Park itself , as has seldom been witnessed on any great occasion in New York . The carslwere not able to accommodate the skaters , although every available one which could be got ready , was put on the different routes by the companies . The scene at the Central Park can not easily be described . To lessen the danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 and 3 o'clock , to check the coming adventurous thousands ; the lee being very much cut up by the 990,12ined influence of the sun and the tens of thousands of skaters . If the icons in condition to-day , the usual signal will be raises OR the cars ; the Fffth-avenue trona will be open as usual , as it was not so much cut up as the Central Park Lakes . ? REHM FROM DROWNING. ? Early yesterday morning two children playing on the ice in the vicinity of Harlem Bridge , broke through and were rescued from drowning by Mr. E. R. WUNDIR , doing business on Bleecker-street . Mr. Winton , at the time of the accident , was in his buggy , driving near the bank of the river , and was attracted to the scene of disaster by the cries of the children . It was with considerable personal danger and great difficulty he succeeded in drawing them to the shore . Learning the residence of tee parents . which was near by , Mr. Wyman took the children is his buggy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age , in me robe , carried theta to their home . Fugitives under section 5 of the Act of July 13 , 1861 , chapter 3 , are not of the class reached DV the Presidentai Proclamation ; for under that act , the question whether the property seized is subject to forfeiture depends upon the predicament of the property itself , and not upon the personal guilt or innocence of its owner . In this respect forfeitures under that act have more resemblance to cases of prize of war captured at sea as enemy 's property , than to proceedings under the Act of August 1861 , and July 1882 . Such forfeitures are provided , not so much to punish the owner for disloyal acts , as to prohibit commercial intercourse and weaken the public enemy , which are always efficient instruments and legitimate effects of public war . But although the remission of forfeitures under the Act of July , ** thus not within the scope of the Proclamation of Pardon , still ample power is conferred on the Secretary of the Treasury by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penalties incurred under the act . And it is not to be doubted that in all proper cases under that act , where the owner of the property residing in the territory in rebellion complies with the condition of the proclamation , the Secretary of the Treasury will exercise the power of remission of such forfeiture in the same spirit of generous forbearance and liberality which inspired and characterized the proclamation .
