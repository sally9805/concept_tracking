txt A fortnight ago , discussing the military outlook in Virginia from the point of view of the successful assault of . the 30th of July , I adventured the ' prophecy that " LEE 'S temerity would ' be GU/aces opportunity . " Uertatnly there was very much in teat amor to stimulate , if not to justify , rash enterprises on the part of the enemy . With the best , possible combinations , wrought out in all their preliminary details with admirable success , the upshot was a bloody repulse . Equally shut out from turning either to the right hand or the left , our army was seemingly condemned to attacks as slaughterous as they are fruitless ; or , in a hopeless dead-lock , to watch from behind - its earthworks the motions of an enemy into whose hands the power of initiative would have passed . . ' Nor was this all that appeared disconraging . Still more ominous than the failure itself was the inference it seemed to warrant of the enfeebled and dispirited condition of our troops . It , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; of reason , that the Copperhead press exultingly proclaimed that the campaign was endeds -- that , " Richiliond ' could norrba taken . " This ' opinion was eagerly taken up and echoed ' by the rebel press . " The Northern mind , " said the Richmond Whig , a day or two ago , " has reached the conclusion that GRANT 'S campaign IS a failure , ' and that ' Richmond can not be taken ; ' and we are content to put that weighty fact in the scales against GRANT 'S self-excusing and unsustained declarations . " In a similar strain wrote the Petersburgh Express : " We are inclined to think that this calm does not presage a coming storm , but simply means that the jig is up , or ; to discard figure , that the siege is a failure , and the Yankees are busy in getting ready to slip away , bag and baggage , if Ronsisx LEE will only let them . " If the only effect of the late repulse had been to inspire this kind of blague on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of but little moment . But it had far weightier results than this ? it influenced the action of the enemy . It has not been unknown to Gen , GRANT that for some time past lag , relying on the improbability of any further move on the part of his antagonist , was making large detachments from his force at Petersburgh . First one division was sent to reinforce EARLY in the valley , then another , till the gross of his subtraction amounted to not less than twenty thousand men . Other troops were dispatched to the aid of HOOD at Atlanta , and to meet the attack on Mobile , and though information is not so precise touching the number of men sent to these named points , there is no doubt that certain detachments have been made . It is for precisely such a turn of affairs that Gen. GRANT has been waiting and watching day by day . It is easy to believe that he has been not unwilling that LEE should adopt and ad on the theory of the demoralization of our army , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siseiet inward joy that he has learnt through-his scouts of the late doings of the enemy . And it may be remarked that , if it was a grievous humiliation to see an assault with such results made by the least efficient corps of the army , while fifty thousand splendid troops stood idly by , that humiliation will find a partial compensation if it produced in the minds of the rebels those " exsullicate and blown surmises " that appear in their journals ; and , above all , if it ininduced the rebel commander to enter on any such rash enterprises as he seems to have adventured . There was ene man who was determined that the Virginia campaign should not*go out in any such lame and impotent conclusion as the Petersburgh fiasco . Gen. GRANT is not the man , with such an army es he yet commands , to cry a halt or admit a failure . Ignorant of when he is beaten , esteeming nothing concluded till everything is tried , and every resource exhausted , he was content to await other and better opportunities for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " fights it out " on , he has already crossed every line ever proposed against Richmond , and will try them all over again , if need be . It is but a day or two ago since every sign seemed to portend that the rebel predictions of the raising of the siege of Petersburgh , would be fulfilled . A large portion of the army was cral arked Ln transports , under sealed orders , and speculation was rife as to what line of operations would next be adopted . And if in the meantime , elite : projects are on foot , it is still not beyond the reach of possibility that the siege of Petersburgh n ay be raised . Gen. Grant will cerlaildli do so , if his judgment should  --  dictate this step . It remains as yet a secret with those in the confidence of the ecinnunding General , what was the original detination of the troops that were a few days ago placed upon transports in Ulu James River . That they were shipped merely for the purpose of deceiving the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling into play an apparatus enormously cumbersome to effect what might have been equally efficaciously accomplished by much simpler means . The indications , therefore , seem to be that it was the original purpose to withdraw the body of troops named to some other , field of operations ; but that at the last moment it was determined , from some information suddenly received , to throw this body to , the north bank of the James , for a . new sally toward Richmond by that line . With this view , the starting of the fleet in broad day down the James , and its sudden and seers recall after night , followed by : the debarkatibn of the troops at Deep Bottom , was a well-designed ruse de , guerre , in keeping with Gen. GRANT 'S favorite system of military stratagems . The line of advance taken up in the late movement has been twice already , during the present campaign , the scene of operations ; l ? ut they both differed from the present movement in that both were but feints . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , the Fifth Corps was thrown forward on the roads leading to Malvern Hill ; and it is fresh in the public recollection that ? three days previous to the late assault on the lines of Petersburgh ; the Second Corps , accompanied by the cavalry , made demonstrations on the roads by the north bank of the James , with a view of calling away detachments of LEE 'S army from Petersburgh , while the real action was made elsewhere . The present movement , whether ' designed to aim directly at the capture of Richmond by a coup de main , or only to secure such positions as may further and facilitate subsequent operations against the rebel capital by a slower process , is at least a serious one . Indeed , from the distribution of force , it would appear that the troops left in the works before Petersburgh are reduced to a purely subsiduary role ; and what they do wil depend almost entirely on the , developments made by the powerful body operating on the north side of the James . Of the preliminary operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been marked by entire success ; and.though no decisive action has yet taken place , the positions sdcured are of high value in view of future operations . Sunday morning saw the Second Corps ( HANoocx ) and the Tenth Corps ( Bums ' ) planted on the north side of the James at Deep Bottom ; the Tenth Corps holding the left of the line and resting on the west bluff of Deep Bottom ; the Second Corps on the right of Four Mile Run . A successful charge in the morning by portions of both corps resulted in driving the enemy from their first line of rifle pits , and in the evening a successful assault and flanking movement , by Gen. BIRNEY 'S command , dislodged the rebels from their second line . These positions were not gained without severe loss ; but they were worth what they cost , as the points secured admitted an extension and development of our ? line . Accordingly , on Monday , the Tenth Corps , which had previously held the left of the line , was moved round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These manoeuvres would seem to indicate a purpose on the part of Gen. GRANT to wheel the line of battle round by the right on the James River , planting it opposite Fort Darling , where the heights of Ball 's Bhif ? give a commanding position . With our force on the rear of the forts dominating the bluffs of the James , their reduction will be a simple problem of engineering . Nor is this all . Possession of the locality named would plant the army ; in an interior position relative to Richmond and Petersburgh , thus permitting rapid concentration for an offensive movement against either point at pleasure . On the whole , the situation of the army on the James is very.much brighter than it has been before , and the effect of the movement has been to cut an apparently inextricable knot . But in looking beyond this litin  --  diate bounds of events happening and likely to happen in the present scene of military operations , and essaying to estimate their bearing on the general scope of the campaign in Virginia , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the other forces operating in this theatre of war . The time has passed away when we saw the aggregate of all the contending forces massed in two solid " points of mighty opposites . " Looking at the distribution of Gen. GRANT 'S forces in Virginia , we find it bisected into two nearly equal parts , or rather we find two bodies sufficiently formidable to be called independent armies . The one is the army now operating south of Richmond ; the other the army operating in the Shenandoah Valley . This division of force is not the result of any willful policy of taking up two different lines of operation against one and the same objec ? five point , which would be contrary ? to an approved maxim of the military art , the violation of which has too often cost us dearly , but has rather been forced upon the director of the armies by the turn of events and the action of the enemy . The presence near the bordersof the loyal States of a rebel force powerful enough to defeat the and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprising enough to set at will the population of that State andyeririsYlviniainto a blaze , imposed the obligatiOn of drMiag.:thiss.standing menace to a sufficient ierncivetoyno longer a cause of national shame alit ! humilitition : : - ' After this force had retired ' Sonth " cirtheTotornac ; the dui 's , still remained of pi4hing ? it ? out of the Shenandoah Valley  --  Where it wati accumulating large supples from the . growing crops . Real work looking towarsAthitipidwas begun when Gen.

Conesponding additions were accordingly made to SHERIDAN 'S force . And thus it happens that , as already inoicated. the forces in.Virginia appear to be almost equally divided between the Army of the James and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as composes the column in the Shenandoah Valley will not justify all that should be hoped from it if it ; did no more than drive the rebel force back toward Richmond . A retreat in this direction ; whether voluntary or compulsory , is ' quite open to the enemy , and this , indeed , is the crowning advantage which EARLY has in his position interior to the two halves of the Union army . Such a policy on the part of the rebels could only be regarded as a very great disadvantage to us ; for while it is open to the enemy by a two or three days ' march to effect a junction with LEE , our column in the Shenandoah Valley could only reach GRANT by an extremely roundabout course . It will be Gen. SHERIDAN 'S care to prevent the execution of , this design on the part of the enemy , and this he is now doing by vigorously following him up , while , if the necessities of the situation should tempt Lea to withdraw the force from the valley , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force powerful enough to defend that point and the important line of railroad communication there tapped . It is in this way that the column under Gen. SHERIDAN will act as a powerful diversion to the main operation under Gen. GRANT . That operation is the siege of Richmond , which the assured possession of the positions on the north banks of the James , secured by the late movement , will enable him to open within half a dozen miles of the rebel capital .
