txt LAST DAYS OF WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR . PART I. WHEN , in October , 1864 , the European steamer brought us the intelligence of Walter Savage Landor 's death , which occurred the month previous at Florence , newspaper readers asked , " Who is Landor ? " The few who remember him remotely through the medium of Mr. Hillard 's selections from his writings exclaimed , " What ! Did he not die long ago U ' The halfdozen Americans really familiar with this author knew that the fire of a genius unequalled in its way had gone out . Two or three , who were acquainted with the man even better than with his books , sighed , and thanked God ! They thanked God that the old man 's prayer had at last been answered , and that the curtain had been drawn on a life which in reality terminated ten years before , when old age became more than ripe . But Landor 's walk into the dark valley was slow and majestic . Death fought long and desperately before he could claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years that body acd mind grew thoroughly apathetic . " I have lost my intellect , " said Landor , nearly two years ' ago : " for this I care not but alas ! I have lost my teeth and can not eat ! " Was it not time for him to ( ro ? b " Sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything . " The glory of old age ceases when second childishness and oblivion begin ; therefore we thanked God for His goodness in taking the lonely old man home . Long as was Landor 's life and literary career , little is known of him personally . There are glimpses of him in Lady Blessington 's Memoirs ; and Emerson , in his " English Traits , " describes two interviews with him in 1843 at his Florentine villa . " I found him noble and courteous , living in a cloud of pictures . I had inferred from his books , or magnified from some anecdotes , an impression of Achillean wrath , - an untamable petulance . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certainly on this May-day his courtesy veiled that haughty mind , and he was the most patient and entle of hosts .

Its instinct is a species of divining-rod , the virtue of which seems to he limited to a fatal facility in discovering frailty . Great men and women live in glass houses , and what passer-by can resist the temptation to throw stones ? Is it generous , or even just , in scoffers who are safely hidden behind hricks and mortar , to take advantage of the glass Could they show a nobler record if subjected to equally close scrutiny ? Worshippers , too , at the shrines of inspiration are prone to look for ideal lives in their elect , forgettin* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , - that great thoughts are not the daily food of even the finest intellects . It is a necessity of nature for valle ) *s to lie beneath the lofty mountain peaks that daringly pierce the sky ; and it would seem as though the artist - temperament , after rising to sublime heights of ecstasy , plunged into corresponding depths , showing thereby the supremacy of the man over the god . Then is there much sighing and shaking of heads at the failings of genius , whereas genius in its depths sinks no lower than the ordinary level of mankind . It simply proves its title-deeds to mortality . Humanity at best is weak , and can only be divine by flashes . The Pythia was a stupid old woman , saving when she sat upon the tripod . Seeing genius to the best advantage in its work , - not always , but most frequently , - they are wisest who love the artist without demanding personal perfection . It is rational to conclude that the loftiest possible genius should be allied to the most perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great man , however , need not be a great artist , - that is , of course , understood ; but time ought to prove that the highest form of art can only emanate from the noblest type of humanity . The most glorious inspirations must flow through the purest channels . But this is the genius of the future , as far remQved from what is best known as order is removed from chaos . The genitrs most familiar is not often founded on common sense ; the * ? us of one faculty denotes the minus of another ; and matter-of-fact people , who rule the world , - as they should , - and who have never dreamed of an inclination from the perpendicular , bestow little patience and less sympathy on vagaries , moral and mental , that , partly natural , are aggravated by that " capacity for joy " which " admits temptation . " Landor 's characteristic fault , in fact his vice , was that of a temper so undisciplined and impulsive as to be somewhat hurricanic in its consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently returned whence it came , and injured no one but the possessor . Circumstances aggravated , rather than diminished , this Landorian idiosyncrasy . Born in prosperity , heir to a large landed estate , and educated in aristocratic traditions , Walter Savage Landor began life without a struggle , and througbout a long career remained master of the situation , independent of the world and its favors . Perhaps too much freedom is as unfortunate in its results upon character as too much dependence . A nature to be properly developed should receive as well as give ; otherwise it must be an angelic disposition that does not become tyrannical . All animated nature is despotic , the strong preying upon the weak . If men and women do not devour one another , it is merely because they dare not . The law of self-preservation prevents them from becoming anthropophagi . A knowledge that the eater may in his turn be eaten , is not appetizing . Materially and ptofessionally successful , possessed of a physique that did honor to his ancestors and Nature , no shadows fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he endured of a private nature grievous in the extreme , yet calculated to harden rather than soften the heart , - trials of which others were partially the cause , and which probably need not have been had his character been understood and ri*htly dealt with . There is a soothing system for men as well as horses , - 386 April , // even for human Cruisers , - and the Rarey who reduces it to a science will deserve the world 's everlasting gratitude . Powerful natures are likely to he as strong in their weaknesses as in their virtues ; this , however , is a reckoning entirely too rational to he largely indulged in by the packed jury that holds inquest over the bodies , rather than the souls , of men . In his old age at least , Landor 's irascihility amounted to temporary madness , for which he was no more responsible than is the sick man for the feverish ravings of delirium . That miserable law-suit at Bath , which has done so much to drag the name of Landor into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any respect for themselves or any decent appreciation of their victim . But Landor in his best moods was chivalry incarnate . His courtly manners toward ladies were particularly noticeable from the rarity of so much external polish in the new school of AngloSaxon gallantry . It was a pleasure to receive compliments from him ; for they generally lay imbedded in the sauce j51-quazite of a bouz mot . Having one day dropped his spectacles , which were picked up and presented to him by an American girl , Landor quickly exclaimed , with a grace not to be translated into words , " Ah , this is not the first time you have caught my eyes ! " It was to the same young lady that he addressed this heretofore unpublished poem* - " TO K. F. Kisses in former times I ye seen , Which , I confess it , raised my spleen ; They were contrived hy Love to mock The battledoor and shuttlecock .

Perhaps it was a dream ; but this I know was not ; I know a kiss Was given me in the sight of more Than ever saw me kissed before . Modest as wing*d angels are , - And no less brave and no less fair , She tame across , nor greatly feared , The horrid brake of wintry heard . " WALTER SAVAGE LAzuole . " Siena , July , iI6o . ' The following papers , in so far as they relate to Landor personally , are not reminiscences of him in the zenith of fame . They contain glimpses of the old man of Florence in the years 1859 , i86o , and 1861 , just before the intellectual light began to flicker and go out . Even then Landor was cleverer , and , provided he was properly approached , more interesting than many younger men of genius . I shall ever esteem it one of the great privileges of my life that I was permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers are given to the public with the hope that they may be of more than ordinary interest to the intelligent reader , and that they may delineate Landor in more truthful colors than those in whrch he has heretofore been painted . In repeating conversations , I have endeavored to stand in the background , where I very properly belong . For the inevitable egotism of the personal pronoun , I hope to he pardoned by all charitable souls . That Landor , the octogenarian , has not been photographed by a more competent person , is certainly not my fault . Having had the good fortune to enjoy opportunities beyond my deserts , I should have shown a great want of appreciation had I not availed myself of them . 1f in referring to Landor , I avoid the prefix " Mr. , " it is because I feel , with Lady Blessington , that " there are some people , and he is of those , whom one can not designate as Mr. ' I should as soon think of adding the word to his name , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , to prefix it to theirs . " It was a modest house in a modest street that Landor inhabited during the last six years of his life . Tourists can have no recollection of the Via Nunsiati ; in , directly back of the " Carmine " in the old part of Florence ; but there is no loving lounger about those picturesque streets that does not remember how , strolling up the Via dci Seragli , i866. 387 // one encounters the old shrine to the Madonna , which marks the entrance to that street made historical henceforth *r having sheltered a great English writer . There , half-way down the via , in that little two-story casa , No. 2671 , dwelt Walter Savage Landor , with his English housekeeper and cameriera . Sitting-room , bed-room , and diningroom opened into each other ; and in the former he was always found , in a large arm-chair , surrounded by paintings ; for he declared he could not live without them . His snowy hair and beard of patriarchal proportions , clear , keen , gray eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble Michel Angelo 's world-renowned masterpiece of " Moses ; nor was the formation of Landor 's forehead unlike that of Shakespeare . " If , as you declare , " said he , jokingly , one day , " I look like that meekest of men , Moses , and Shakespeare , I ought to he exceedingly good and somewhat clever . " At Landor 's feet was always crouched a beautiful Pomeranian dog , the gift of his kind American friend , William W. Story . The affection existing between " Gaillo " and his master was really touching . Gaillo 's eyes were always turned towards Landor 's ; and upon the least encouragement , the dog would jump into his lap , lay his head most lovingly upon his master 's neck , and generally deport himself in a very human manner . " Gaillo is such a dear dog . said Landor , one day , while patting him . " We are very fond of each other , and always have a game of play after dinner ; sometimes , when he is very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not live , if he died ; and I know that , when I am gone , he will grieve for me . " Thereupon Gaillo wagged his tail , and looked piteously into j5adrone 's face , as much as to say he would be grieved indeed . Upon being asked if he thought dogs would be admitted into heaven , Landor answered : " And , pray , why not ? They have all of the good and none of the bad qualities of man . " No matter upon what subject conversation turned , Gailb 's feelings were consulted . He was the only and chosen companion of Landor in his walks ; but few of the Florentines who stopped to remark the z'eccliio con quel bel canino , knew how great was the man upon whom they thus commented . It is seldom that England gives birth to so rampant a republican as Landor . Born on the 30th of January , two years before our Declaration of Independence , it is probable that the volcanic action of those troublous times had no little influence in permeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love of liberty for which he was distinguished in maturer years . From early youth , Landor was a poor respecter of royalty and rank *er Se . He often related , with great good-humor , an incident of his boyhood which brought his democratic ideas into domestic disgrace . An influential bishop of the Church of England , happening to dine with young Landor 's father one day , assailed Porson , and , with self-assumed superiority , thinking to annihilate the old Grecian , exclaimed , " We have no opinion of his scholarship . " Irate at this stupid pronunciamento against so renowned a man , young Landor looked up , and , with a sarcasm the point of which was not in the least blunted by age , retorted , " We , my Lord ? " Of course such unheard of audacity and contempt of my Lord Bishop 's capacity for criticism was severely reprobated by Landor Senior ; but no amount of reproof could force his son into a confession of sorrow . " At Oxford , " said Landor , " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take care , ' said my tutor . They will stone you for a republican . ' The Whigs ( not the wigs ) were then unpopular ; but I stuck to my plain hair and queue tied with black ribbon . " Of Landor 's mature opinion of republics in general we glean much from a passage of the " Pentameron , " in which the author adorns Petrar*a with his 0 -n fine thoughts . " When the familiars of absolute princes taunt us , as they are wont to 388 April , // ( 10 , with the only apothegm they ever learnt by heart , - namely , that it is better to be ruled by one master than by many , - I quite agree with them ; unity of power being the principle of republicanism , while the principle of despotism is division and delegation . In the one system , every man conducts his own affairs , either personally or through the agency of some trustworthy representative , which is essentially the same : in the other system , no man , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct ; but a tutor has been as much set over him as over a lunatic , as little with his option or consent , and without any provision , as there is in the case of the lunatic , for returning reason . Meanwhile , the spirit of republics is omnipresent in them , as active in the particles as in the mass , in the circumference as in the centre . Eternal it must be , as truth and justice are , although not stationary . " Let Europeans who , having predicted the dismemberment of our Union , pro-. claimed death to democracy , and those thoughtless Americans who believe that liberty can not survive the destruction of our Republic , think well of what great men have written . Though North America were submerged to-morrow , the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans rushing over our buried hopes to a riotous embrace , republicanism would live as long as the elements endure , - borne on every wind , inhaled in every breath of air , abiding its opportunity to become an active principle . Absorbed in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Being has cast the cause of humanity upon one die , to prosper or perish by the chances of our game . What belittling of the Almighty ! what magnifyin* of ourselves ! Though often urged , Landor never became a candidate for Parliamentary honors . Political wire-pulling was not to the taste of a man who , notwithstanding large landed interests , could say : " I never was at a public dinner , at a club or hustings . I never influenced or attempted to influence a vote , and yet many , and not only my own tenants , have asked me to whom they should give theirs . " Nor was he ever presented at court , although a presentation would have been at the request of the ( at that time ) Regent . Landor would not countenance a system of courtfavor that opens its arms to every noodle wearing an officer 's uniform , and almost universally turns its back upon intellect . He put not his faith in princes , and of titles says : " Formerly titles were inherited by men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will not let others . Theirs may have been the darker age ; ours is the duller . In theirs a high spirit was provoked ; in ours , proscribed . In theirs the bravest were pre-eminent in ours , the basest . " Although a democrat , Landor was not indifferent to the good name of his own ancestors , not because of a long pedigree , but because many of these ancestors were historical personages and served their country long and well . That stock must be worthy of honorable mention which , extending with its ramifications over several centuries , gives to the world its finest fruit in its latest scion . It is a satisfaction to spring from hidalgo blood when the advantages of gentle rearing are demonstrated by being greater than one 's fathers . In Landor 's most admirable " Citation and Examination of William Shakespeare , " the youngster whom Sir Silas Gough declares to be as " deep as the big tankard says , " out of his own head " : - " Hardly any man is ashamed of being inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which the great should blush , if , indeed , the great in general descended from the worthy . I did expect to see the day , and , although I shall not see it , it must come at last , when he shall be treated as a madman or an impostor who dares to claim nobility or precedency , and can not show his family name in the history of his country . Even he who can show it , and who can not write his own under it in the same or as goodly characters , must submit to the imputation of degeneracy , i866. 389 // from which the lowly and obscure are exempt . " Good old Penn , too , is made a lay figure upon which Landor dressed his thoughts , when the Quaker tells Lord Peterborough : " Of all pride , however , and all folly , the grossest is where a man who possesses no merit in himself shall pretend to an equality with one who does possess it , and shall found this pretension on no better plea or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather had . I would use no violence or coercion with any rational creature ; but , rather than that such a bestiality in a human form should run about the streets uncured , I would shout like a stripling for the farrier at his furnace , and unthong the drenching horn from my stable-door . " Landor could write his name under that of his family in as goodly characters , therefore he was not ashamed to relate anecdotes of his forefathers . It was with honest satisfaction that he perpetuated the memory of two of these worthies in the " Imaginary Conversations " between King Henry IV . and Sir Arnold Savage , and Oliver Cromwell and Valter Noble . " Sir Arnold , according to Elsynge , was the first who appears zq5on auiy record ' to have been appointed to the dignity of Speaker in the House of Commons , as now constituted . He was elected a second time , four years afterwards , a rare honor in earlier days and during this presidency he beaded the Commons , and delivered their resolutions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words " were , that no subsidy should be granted to Henry IV . until every cause of public grievance had been removed . Landor came rightly by his independence of thought . " Walter Noble represented the city of Lichfield ; he lived familiarly with the best patriots of the age , remonstrated with Cromwell , and retired from public life on the punishment of Charles . " Landor was very fond of selecting the grand old Roundheads for his conversations . In their society he was most at home , and with them he was able to air his pet opinions . Good Andrew Marvell , a man after the author 's own heart , discourses upon this matter of family : " Between the titled man of ancient and the titled man of recent date , the difference , if any , is in favor of the last . Suppose them both raised for merit , ( here , indeed , we do come to theory ! ) the benefits that society has received from him are nearer us Some of us may look back six or seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In England , where the institutions are such that a title of nobility is considered by the majority to be the highest reward attainable by merit , it is not surprising that the great god of Rank should be worshipped at the family altar of Form . In England , too , it must be acknowledged that men of rank are men of education , frequently of culture , and are useful to the nation as patrons of art and of science ; therefore nobility frequently means absolute gentility . But in America what good can be said of those who , living upon the fortunes of fathers or grandfathers , amassed in honest trade ,  --  residents of a particular street which is thereby rendered pluperfectly genteel , - with no recommendation but that derived from fashion and idleness , - draw the lines of social demarcation more closely than they are drawn in Europe , intellect and accomplishments being systematically snubbed where the possessors can not show their family passes ? Is not this attempt to graft the foibles of an older and more corrupt civilization upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth known , we should be able to report the existence of many advocates of monarchy , a privileged class , and an established church , among those into whose ancestry it would be unsafe to dig deeper than a second generation ; by digging deeper we might touch sugar or tumble into a vat of molasses , and then what blushes for false pride ! A very different idea of a great man from that of the vulgar do we get out of Landor 's writings . His Diogenes tells us , ( and very like the original seeker after honesty do we take him to be , ) that // " the great man is he who hath nothing to fear and nothing to hope from another . It is he who , while he demonstrates the iniquity of the laws and is able to correct them , obeys them peaceably . It is he who looks on the ambitious both as weak and fraudulent . It is he who bath no disposition or occasion for any kind of conceit , no reason for being or for appearing different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call together the most select company when it pleases him . " And Petrarca says that " Time the Sovran is first to discover the truly great . " Yet , though we put faith in the justice of posterity , even Time plays many a one false through misplaced favoritism . " They , 0 Timotheus , " exclaims the imaginary Lucian , " who survive the wreck of ages , are by no means , as a body , most worthy of our admiration . It is in these xvr@.cks as in those at sea , - the best things are not always saved . Hencoops and empty barrels bob upon the surface , under a serene and smiling sky , when the graven or depicted images of the gods are scattered on ii'ivisible rocks , and when those who most resembled them in knowledge and beneficence are devoured by cold monsters below . " We claim , however , that Lucian 's theory is good for this world only , as we believe that soul , though it may be temporarily wrecked , speeds on to the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fever of military glory is upon us , remember that , great as may be the man who conquers his country 's enemies upon the battle-field , he is far greater who conquers the prejudices of his age and instils into groping masses the doctrines of a more glorious civ-ilization ? " For civilization perfected Is fully developed Christianity . " Every generation has two or three such men ; no age has enough moral courage to give birth to more . They live under protest , - thought along is free , - and when these men , fifty years in advance of their times , proclaim God 's truth with the enthusiasm begotten of religion , grub-worms that rule the great status quo sting the prophets with all the virus of their nature , and render each step forward as difficult as was once the passage of the Simplon . There is no stumbling-blo&amp;k like that of ignorance , and he who would remove it must wear the holy crown of thorns . We speak of the horrors of the Inquisition as things of the past . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exquisite tortures for reformers of all ages ? America has her sins to answer for in this respect . " Because ye prosper in God 's name , With a claim . To honor in the old world 's sight , Yet do the fiend 's work perfectly In strangling martyrs , - for this lie This is the curse . " On the stubbornness of Status Quo none have written better than Landor . " Unbendingness , in the moral as in the vegetable world , is an indication as frequently of unsoundness as of strength . Indeed , wise men , kings as well as others , have been free from it . Stiff necks are diseased ones . " It was impossible to he in Landor 's society a half-hour and not reap advantage . His great learning , varied information , extensive acquaintance with the world 's celebrities , ready wit , and even readier repartee , rendered his conversation wonderfully entertaining . He would narrate anecdote after anecdote with surprising accuracy , being possessed of a singularly retentive memory , that could refer to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conquests . Names , it is true , be was frequently unable to recall , and supplied their place with a " God bless my soul , I forbet everything " ; but facts were indelibly stamped upon his mind . He referred hack to the year one with as much facility as a person of the rising generation invokes the shade of some deed dead a few years . I looked with wonder upon a person who remembered Napoleon Bonaparte as a slender young man , and listened with delight to a voice from so dim a past . " I was in Paris , " said Landor one day , " at the time that Bonaparte made his entrance as First Consul . I i866. 39 ' // was standing within a few feet of him when he passed , and had a capital good look at him . He was exceedingly handsome then , with a rich olive complexion and oval face , youthful as a girl 's . Near him rode Murat , mounted upon a gold-clad charger , - and very handsome he was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , Landor had his prejudices , - they were very many . Foremost among them was an antipathy to the Bonaparte family . It is not necessary to have known him personally to he aware of his detestation of the first Napoleon , as in the conversation between himself , an English and a Florentine visitor , he gives expression to a generous indignation , which may well he inserted here , as it contains the pith of what Landor repeated in many a social talk . " This Holy Alliance will soon appear unholy to every nation in Europe . I despised Napoleon in the plenitude of his power no less than others despise him in the solitude of his exile I thought him no less an impostor when he took the ermine , than when he took the emetic . I confess I do not love him the better , as some mercenaries in England and Scotland do , for having been the enemy of my country ; nor should I love him the less for it , had his enmity heen principled and manly . In what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble follower , Toussaint l'Ouverture ? He was thrown into a subterranean cell , solitary , dark , damp , pestiferously unclean , where rheumatism racked his limbs , and where famine terminated his existence . " Again , in his written opinions of C*sar , Cromwell , Milton , and Bona*arte , Landor criticises the career of the latter with no fondness , hut with much truth , and justly says , that " Napoleon , in the last years of his sovereignty , fought without aim , vanquished without glory , and perished without defeat . " Great as was Landor 's dislike to the uncle , it paled before his detestation of the reigning Emperor , - a detestation Zoo general to he designated an idiosyn crasy on the part of the poet . We always knew who was meant when a sentence was prefaced with " that rascal " or " that scoundrel , " - such were the epithets suhstituted for the name of Louis Napoleon . Believing the third Napoleon to he the worst enemy of his foster-mother , Italy , as well as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , than the majority of Englishmen . Having been personally acquainted with the Emperor when he lived in England as an exile , Landor , unlike many of Napoleon 's enemies , acknowledged the superiority of his intellect . " I used to see a great deal of the Prince when he was in London . I met him very frequently of an evening at Lady Blessington 's , and had many conversations with him , as he always sought me and made himself particularly civil . He was a very clever man , well informed on most subjects . The fops used to laubh at him , and call him a hore . A coxcombical young lord came up to me one evening after the Prince had taken his leave , and said , Mr. Landor , how can you talk to that fool , Prince Napoleon ? ' To which J replied , My Lord , it takes a fool to find out that he is not a wise man ! His Lordship retired somewhat discomfited , " added Landor with a laugh . " The Prince presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his house . He had a very handsome establishment , and was not at all the poor man he is often said to have been . Of this hook Landor writes in an article to the " Quarterly Review " ( I think ) : " If it is any honor , it has been conferred on me , to have received from Napoleon 's heir the literary work he composed in prison , well knowing , as he did , and expressing his regret for , my sentiments on his uncle . The explosion of the first cannon against Rome threw us apart forever . " I shall not soon forget Landor 's lively narration of Napoleon 's escape from the prison at Ham , given in the same language in which it was told to him by the Prince . I would feign repeat it here , were it not that an account of this wonderful // escape found its way into print some years ago . Atrotos of Napoleon , an old friend of Landor 's told me that , while in London , the Prince was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would sip cafef noir , smoke a cigar , ply his host with every conceivable question , but otherwise maintain a dignified reticence . it seems then that Louis Napoleon is indebted to nature , as well as to art , for his masterly ability in keeping his own counsel . Among other persons of note encountered by Landor at Lady Blessington 's was Rachel . It was many years ago , before her star had attained its zenith . " She took tea with her Ladyship , and was accompanied by a female attendant , her mother I think . Rachel had verb little to say , and left early , as she had an engagement at the theatre . There was nothing particularly noticeable in her appearance , but she was very ladylike . I never met her again . " Landor entertained a genuine affection for the memory of Lady Blessington . " Ah , there was a woman ! " he exclaimed one day with a sigh . " I never knew so brilliant and witty a person in conversation . She was most generous too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an ill - natured remark . It was my custom to visit her whenever the laurel was in bloom ; and as the season approached , she would write me a note , saying , Gore House expects you , for the laurel has begun to blossom . ' I never see laurel now , that it does not make me sad , for it recalls her to me *o vividly . During these visits I never saw Lady Blessington until dinner-time . She always breal*fasted in her own room , and wrote during the morning . She wrote very well , too ; her style was pure . In the evening her drawing-room was thrown open to her friends , except when she attended the opera . Her opera-box faced the Queen 's , and a formidable rival she was to her Majesty . " " D'Orsay was an Apollo in beauty , very amiable , and had considerable talent for modelling . " Ta king me into his little back sitting-room , Landor 393 brought out a small album , and , passing over the likenesses of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napier , and other celebrities , he held up an engraving of Lady Blessington . Upon my remarking its beauty , Landor replied : " That was taken at the age of fifty , so you can imagine how beautiful she must have been in her youth . Her voice and laugh were very musical . " Then , turning to a young lady present , Landor made her an exceedingly neat compliment , by saying , " Your voice reminds me very vividly of Lady Blessington 's . Perhaps , " he continued with a smile , " this is the reason why my old , deaf ears never lose a word when you are speaking . " Driving along the north side of the Arno , one summer 's day , Landor gazed sadly at a terrace overlooking the water , and said : " Many a delightful evening have I spent on that terrace with Lord and Lady Blessington . There we used to take our tea . They once visited Florence for no other purpose than to see me . Was not that friendly ? They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . When Lady 3lessington died , I was asked to write a Latin epitaph for her tomb , which I did ; but some officious person thought to improve the Latin before it was engraved , and ruined it . " This friendship was fully reciprocated by Lady Blessington , who , in her letters to Landor , refers no less than three times to those " calm nights on the terrace of the Casa Pelosi . " " I send you , " she *vrites , " the engraving , and have only to wish that it may sometimes remind you of the original Five fleeting years have gone by since our delicious evenings on the lovely Arno , - evenings never to be forgotten , and the recollections of which ought to cement the friendships then formed . " Again , in her books of travel , - the " Idler in France " and " Idle*r in Italy , " - Lady Blessington pays the very highest tribute to Landor 's heart , as well as intellect , and declares his real conversations to be quite as delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days of Wa//er Savage Landor. // 394 long in history as the friend of great men now lies " beneath the chestnut shade of Saint Germain " ; and Landor , with the indignation of one who loved her , has turned to DOrsay , ask-ing " Who was it squandered all her wealth , And swept away the hloom of health ? " Although a Latinist , Landor did not approve of making those who have passed away doubly dead to a majority of the living by Latin eulogy . In an interesting conversation he gives the following opinion : " Although 1 have written at various times a great number of such inscriptions " ( Latin ) , " as parts of literature , yet I *hink nothing is so absurd , if you only inscribe them on a tomb . Why should extremely few persons , the least capable , perhaps , of sympathy , be invited to sympathize , while thousands are excluded from it by the iron grate of a dead language ? Those who read a Latin inscription are the most likely to know already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be excited in them but the language of the country tells the ignorant who he was that lies under the turf before them ; and , if he was a stranger , it naturalizes him among them ; it gives him friends and relations ; it brings to him and detains about him some who may imitate , many who will lament him . We have no right to deprive any one of a tender sentiment , by talking in an unknown tongue to him , when his heart would listen and answer to his own ; we have no right to turn a chapel into a library , locking it with a key which the lawful proprietors can not turn . " I once asked Landor to describe Wordsworth 's personal appearance . He laughed and replied : " The best description I can give you of Wordsworth is the one that Hazlitt gave me . Hazlitt 's voice was very deep and gruW and he peppered his sentences very bountifully with sirs . ' In speaking to me of Wordsworth , he said : Well , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes . ' Then , sir , you have seen Wordsworth , sir ! He looks exactly like a horse , sir , and a very long-faced horse at that , sir ! ' And he did look like a horse , " added Landor . Those who have seen good likenesses of Wordsworth will readily remark this resemblance . A greater length of ear would liken the Lake poet to an animal of less dignity . Continuing the cotiversation thus begun , Landor said : " I saw a great deal of Hazlitt when he was in Florence . He called upon me frequently , and a funny fellow he was . He used to say to me : Mr. Landor , I like you , sir ,  - -  I like you very much , sir , - you re an honest man , sir ; but I do n't approve , sir , of a great deal that you have written , sir . You must reform some ' of your opinions , sir . " ' And again Landor laughed with great good-will . " I regret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in answer to many questions asked concerning this delightful man and writer . " Lamb sent word by Southey " ( I think it was Southey ) " that he would be very happy to see me , whereupon we made him a visit . He had then retired from the India House , and lived at Enfield . He was most charming in conversation , and his smile impressed me as being particularly genial . His sister also was a very agreeable person . During my visit , Lamb rose , went to a table in the centre of the room , and took up a hook , out of whicis he read aloud . Soon shutting it , he turned to me , saying : Is not what I have been reading exceedingly good ? ' Very good , ' I replied . Thereupon Lamb burst out laughing , and exclaimed : Did one ever know so conceited a man as Mr. Landor ? He has actually praised his own ideas ! It was now my turn to laugh , as I had not the slightest remembrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to whom the following lines will not be better than new ? " Once , and only once , have I seen thy face , Elia l once only has thy tripping tongue Run o'er my breast , yet never has been left Impression on it stronger or more sweet . Cordial old man I what youth was in thy years , What wisdom in thy levityl what truth In every utterance of that purest soull April , // Few are the spirits of the glorified I d spring to earlier at the gate of Heaven . " Being asked if he had met Byron , Landor replied : " I never saw Byron but once , and then accidentally . I went into a perfumery shop in London to purchase a pot of the ottar of roses , which at that time was very rare and expensive . As I entered the shop a handsome young man , with a slight limp in his walk , passed me and went out . The shopkeeper directed my attention to him , saying : Do you know who that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young Lord Byron . ' He had been purchasing some fancy soaps , and at that time was the fashion . I never desired to meet him . " As all the world knows , there was little love lost between these two great writers ; but it was the man , not the poet , that Landor so cordially disliked .
