txt A CENTURY has elapsed since BROWN UNIVERSITY was founded , and nearly three quarters of a century have passed away since the death of DR . MANNING ; yet no extended history of the one or life of the other has been published . This neglect to record the honors , the struggles , and triumphs of the founder , so to speak , of the ven erable seat of learning , with the early history of which his own his tory is so thoroughly identified , must be ascribed , in part , to the almost habitual indifference which Baptists have thus far manifested to the characters and the fame of their fathers and departed worthies . " It is mortifying , " says a writer in one of the earlier numbers of the Christian Review , " that we have allowed men like Clarke and Callender , Backus and Manning , each of them an honored and true-hearted advocate of the faith which we profess , at a time when this faith was despised and derided over the greater part of New England , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were all scholars , who compared well with the foremost of their time . Some of them , also , have linked their names with the history of the country , by the services they rendered in the days of her early settlements , and her subsequent struggles for national /z/ independence . But no one of them has found among their own brethren a biographer to set forth their labors and sacrifices , and to delineate their characters in connection with the peculiar faith which they professed . Their lives , in some instances , at least , were filled with important events , which illustrated the civil and religious char acter of the age to which they belong . They were made beautiful , too , by their simple manners , their all-enduring faith , their deep devotion to truth . It is sad to think that their memory has so nearly perished , and it is humiliating to think that this would have been permitted in no other denomination than our own . " In 1815 , twenty-four years after Dr. Manning s death , a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Howland , Esq. , was published in the Rhode Island Literary Repository . It com prises sixteen pages , and consists chiefly of personal recollections . Mr. Howland , although his calling was humble , possessed original and vigorous powers of mind , which he had cultivated by extensive reading , and a close observation of men and manners . He was a warm admirer of President Manning , who , with the leading men of the town , used to frequent his shop . Although differing from him in his religious sentiments , he has furnished a sketch of Manning which the Rev. Dr. Hague , in his " Historical Discourse , " pronoun ces " an elegant tribute to his memory . " Nearly a quarter of a century later , a memoir of President Man ning , from the pen of William Giles Goddard , LL.D. , at that time the accomplished Professor of Belles-letters in Brown University , was published in the American Quarterly Register . This memoir PREFACE . Vlf is necessarily brief , and although an admirable specimen of the author s skill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning , his materials having been limited mainly to the College records , and the traditions that had come down to his time . As an illustration of this dearth of material , the Rev. Dr. Elton , a few years later , in his " Literary Remains of Jonathan Maxcy , " D.D. , thus remarks : " President Manning embodied in an enduring form few of the productions of his noble mind . Of his writings , after diligent inquiry for several years , we have been able to obtain only two of his familiar letters , and an address delivered to the graduating class in 1789 . " The present work owes its origin to a train of circumstances , by which the author came into the possession of new and original sources of information in regard to Manning and his associates . In the year 1848 , soon after he entered upon his duties as librarian of Brown University , a handsome morocco portfolio , lettered on the back " MANNING PAPERS , " was placed in his hands , as the custodian of the Library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , were found on examination to be his correspondence with friends in England , he having preserved copies of his own letters to them . They came from the late Mrs. Ludlow , wife of the Rev. Peter Ludlow , and daughter of the Rev. Stephen Gano . Mr. Gano , upon the death of Mrs. Manning , who was his aunt , took possession of Mr. Manning s papers , as administrator of the estate . Upon his own death , in 1828 , the portfolio containing Manning s foreign correspondence , as above described , fell into the /z/ hands of his daughter , Mrs. Ludlow , who finally presented it to the Library . The greater portion , however , of Dr. Manning s papers , being loosely kept in barrels , were , through a sad mistake which good housewives sometimes make , unfortunately destroyed . These papers comprised without doubt private diaries , important narratives , records pertaining to the Church , the College , the Association , in short , ample materials for his own personal history , and the history of his times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garrets and storehouses of private dwellings places of deposit for valuable manuscript papers , for the care and preservation of which historical societies are instituted . The acquisition of the " MANNING PAPERS " awakened on the part of the author a desire to obtain further information in regard to the early history of the College , and the life of its first President . By means of letters and circulars , and by persistent effort , a large number of manuscript documents , printed pamphlets , sermons , addresses , catalogues , theses , programmes , minutes of the Warren Association , etc. , have been collected and carefully arranged for preservation in the College Library . The titles of most of these , are given in Bartlctt s Bibliography of Rhode Island ( see under BROWN UNIVERSITY , pp. 45-66 ) . From these varied materials the present work has been mainly compiled . In preparing a history of this kind , a large number of books and pamphlets have of necessity been consulted and used , many of which are referred to , both in the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers and correspondence of Hczekiah /z/ Smith , D.D. , the papers of the lion . David Ho well , and the early College records , together with riles of the Providence Gazette , con stitute , it may be added , the basis of the book . The author takes great pleasure in acknowledging herewith his obligations to David Benedict , D.D. , the veteran historian , from whom he obtained Manning s diary and the correspondence of Hezekiah Smith , together with other valuable letters and documents , in cluding a set of the printed Minutes of the Warren Association , from the year 1771 ; William B. Sprague , D.D. , of Albany , who kindly furnished copies of Manning s letters to General Miller , and who also presented to the Library the original draft of the College Char ter , of which an account is given inthe first chapter , and in the Ap pendix ; Horatio Gates Jones , Esq. , of Philadelphia , from whom he obtained copies of Manning s letters to the Rev. Thomas Ustick , and also much information essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raynham , Mass. , to whom he is indebted for a copy of Backus s man uscript minutes of the first four meetings of the Warren Association ; Capt . G. L. Dwight , for papers belonging to his great-grandfather , the Hon. David Howell , including letters to him from Manning ; the Rev. Thomas S. Drowne , of Brooklyn , N. Y. , for many rare docu ments and pamphlets pertaining to the early history of the College ; the Rhode Island Historical Society , for the free use of their ac cumulated treasures ; and , in fine , to all the numerous friends who have in any manner aided him in his work . Justice to his feelings requires the author to express his special gratitude to Barnas Sears , D.D. , President of Brown Univer- /z/ si . y , for valuable suggestions and counsels , and for friendly en couragement , given him from time to time while engaged in the prosecution of his labors . The publishers also , Messrs . Gould and Lincoln , deserve grateful mention for the interest which they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste which they have displayed in its mechanical execution , and for the liberality and promptness with which all their arrangements have been made and completed . The undertaking was entered upon with great diffidence . It has been continued from year to year , under all the disadvantages of accumulated public and professional duties , and amidst frequent in terruptions . Historical accuracy , and not literary excellence , is all , therefore , to which the author has been able to aspire . Sincerely wishing that he had possessed greater skill and more ample leisure for the performance of the task to which his position as librarian seems naturally to have assigned him , the work , with all its imperfections , is herewith submitted to the public , in the hope that it may be ac ceptable to the general reader , and especially useful to the College , and to the religious denomination under whose auspices the College was founded . /z/ Manning s Birth and Parentage Home Influence Early Education Sent to the Hopewell Academy Isaac Eaton Conversion and Baptism Ben jamin Miller Admitted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Finley , and Blai/ Extracts from the College Laws Student Life Letter from Rev.

" ! T is a homnge due to departed worth , whenever it rises to such a height as to render its possessor an object of general attention , to endeavor to rescue it from oblivion ; that , when it is removed from the observation of men , it may still live in their memory , and transmit , through the shades of the sepulchre , some reflection , however faint , of its living lustre . " This language of Robert Hall , on the /z/ death of Dr. Ryland , is especially applicable to the subject of the present memoir . Nearly three quarters of a cen tury have elapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says the Hon. William Hunter , our late Ambassa dor to Brazil , " he inspired with a deep sense of his qual ities as a scholar , - an orator , a statesman , a theologian , and an educationist . " A general impression of his remarkable talent and influence still remains , but what composed them has become a matter of tradition . Of all Dr. Man ning s intimate associates , and of his numerous pupils , not one is now living to aid by personal recollections any endeavor to embody , in a suitable form , memorials of his character and deeds . To perpetuate , therefore , his memory through his life and correspondence , and to exhibit the ori gin and early progress of the institution of learning whose infancy he fostered , and whose resources he nurtured and developed , will be the object of our present work . The Reverend James Manning , D.D. , was born in Elizabethtown , New Jersey , on the 22d of October , 1738 . Concerning his remote ancestors we have no authentic information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original thirteen members of the Scotch Plains Baptist Church , which , as appears from the records , was consti tuted on the 7th of August , 1747 . Being a proprietor and cultivator of the soil , his children were trained to agricultural pursuits , and thus James acquired that skill in husbandry for which he was ever distinguished . His mother , Catharine , was also a member of the church . So far as we may judge from the character and disposition of her son , she was a woman of superior mental and physical endowments , one who exemplified in her daily life the happy and sanctifying influences of the Christian religion . James thus enjoyed all those advantages which are de- 173 &-1764.; BROWN UNIVERSITY . 2o rived from the watchful care of sensible and religious parents . To their counsel and example he was indebted for those principles of right conduct , and those cultivated moral sensibilities , which saved his youth from frivolity and vice , and to which , ere he had attained to manhood , God was pleased to add the regenerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can ascertain but little . It is a matter of regret that no memorials of his early life have been transmitted to his descendants . He probably enjoyed better advantages for education than most lads of that early colonial period . Elizabethtown was then the chief city of New Jersey , and the centre of comparative wealth and refinement . Whatever was the character of its schools , it is certain that he was thoroughly instructed in the elementary branches of learning . He was an accomplished reader , an excellent penman , and a good speller . His manuscript writings furnish abundant evidence of his thorough proficiency in this latter useful though too often neglected " rudiment . " These may be regarded as matters of trivial importance , yet they show that he did not neglect his early opportunities , whatever they were , for mental culture . At the age of eighteen he left the parental roof to pre pare for college , under the instruction of the Rev. Isaac Eaton . 1 This gentleman had recently opened an academy at Hopewell , New Jersey , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him , therefore , says a distinguished 1 Mr. Eaton was a son of Joseph Eaton of Montgomery . At an early age , having made a profession of religion , he commenced his career as a public speaker . In April , 1748 , he came to Hopewell , and on the 29th of November following was ordained pastor of the Baptist Church . In this relation he con tinued until July 4 , 1772 , when he died , in the forty-seventh year of his age . His funeral sermon was preached by the liev . Dr. Samuel Jones , one of his /z/ writer , belongs the high honor of being the first American Baptist to establish a seminary for the literary and theo logical training of young men . For this work his natural endowments of mind , his varied attainments in knowledge , and his genuine piety happily qualified him . Here , under the guidance of his faithful and beloved teacher , Manning became the subject of renewing grace . Of the exercises of his mind at this interesting period of his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pious loved ones at home contributed towards his conversion , and how great an influence was thus to be exerted over the destiny of multitudes in his after career , eternity alone will reveal . A striking instance of the importance of prayer in behalf of colleges and seminaries of learning is here presented . Little did the Principal of the Hope well Academy realize how greatly the interests of learning and religion were to be affected by the conversion to God of this promising youth . Having finished his preparatory studies , Manning re turned to Elizabethtown , where he made a public profes sion of religion . He was baptized by the Rev. Benjamin Miller , 1 who for many years had been the pastor of the Scotch Plains Baptist Church . Soon afterwards , being now twenty years of age , he was admitted into the College earliest pupils , who thus briefly portrays his character : " The natural endow ments of his mind , the improvement of these by the accomplishments of litera ture , his early and genuine piety , his abilities as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and books , his Catholicism , etc. , would afford ample scope to flourish in a funeral oration ; but it is needless . " He received the de gree of Master of Arts from three colleges , the College of New Jersey , in 1756 ; the College of Philadelphia , in 1761 ; and Rhode Island College , in 1770 . " In him , with grace and eminence , did shine The man , the Christian , scholar , and divine . " i Benjamin Miller , a native of Scotch Plains , was a wild and reckless youth , /z/ of New Jersey as a member of the Freshman Class . This flourishing institution had been founded by the Presby terian Synod of New York , in the year 1746 . Its first location was Elizabethtown , whence it was removed to Newark , where it remained eight years . In 1756 it was again removed to Princeton , its present location , where Nassau Hall , one of the largest and finest buildings in the colonies , had been erected for its use . Here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man distinguished for his wisdom , piety , and eloquence , 1 and whose varied gifts and talents gave lustre and efficiency to the college over w T hich he presided . During his Senior year he was taught Latin , Greek , and Hebrew by President Finley , Mr. Davies successor . Mr. Finley possessed extensive learn ing , and was especially remarkable for sweetness of dispo sition and politeness of behavior . He was also instructed by tutors Halsey , Treat , Ker , and Blair , all of whom after wards became eminent clergymen . The last named , Dr. Samuel Blair , was in 1767 elected to the presidency of the college , Dr. Witherspoon having declined this honor . but was converted in consequence of a sermon preached by the celebrated Gil bert Tennent , who encouraged him to enter the ministry . He was ordained on the 13th of February , 1748 , as pastor of the church in his native place . Here he continued until November 14 , 1780 , or about thirty-four years , when he died , in the sixty-sixth year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and successful min ister . " Never , " said the Rev. John Gano , who preached his funeral sermon , " did I esteem a ministering brother so much as I did Mr. Miller , nor feel so sensibly a like bereavement as that which I sustained by his death . " i Dr. Davies spent the early part of his professional life in Virginia . It is well known , says one , that from the eleventh to the twenty-second year of his age , Patrick Henry heard the patriotic sermons which Mr. Davies was accus tomed to deliver , and which were said to have produced effects as powerful as those ascribed to the orations of Demosthenes ; that he was an enthusiastic ad mirer of Mr. Davies and his opinions ; and that it was Mr. Davies who first kindled the fire and afforded the model of Henry s elocution . ( See History of the College of New Jersey , 174G-1783 , in the " Princeton Whig " for Febru ary , 1844. ) /z/ Blair did not accept the appointment , and Witherspoon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructors . That the teachings of these ex cellent men , and the associations of his academic and col legiate life , had a most important influence in developing his character , and in determining his subsequent career , no one will deny . Among the requirements for admission to the College of New Jersey , was one obliging every student to transcribe the laws and customs thereof , which copy , being signed by the President , was to be in testimony of his admission , and to be kept by him while in college as a rule of his good behavior . From a manuscript copy of these laws , made by the Rev. Dr. Hezekiah Smith in the summer of 1758 , we make a few extracts , illustrating as they do the char acter and spirit of the institution where Manning , and Howell , who was afterwards associated with him , received their education . These laws , somewhat modified , became , it may be added , a basis for the government and discipline of Rhode Island College : 1 . No students may expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been examined by the President and tutors , and shall be found able to render Virgil and Tully s Orations into English , to turn English into true and grammatical Latin , and to be so well acquainted with Greek as to render any part of the four Evangelists in that language into Latin or English , and give the grammatical construction of the words . 2 .

If any student shall be convicted of drunkenness , fornication , lying , theft , or any other scandalous crime , he shall be admonished , make a pub lic confession , or be expelled , according to the aggravation of the crime ; provided , always , that no member be expelled the college without the consent of at least six of the Trustees , the President , in the interim , having power to suspend such offenders . 5 . None of the students shall frequent taverns or places of public enter tainment , or keep company with persons of known scandalous lives , who will be likely to vitiate their morals . Those that practise contrary to this law , shall first be admonished , and if they still persist in such dangerous courses , they shall be expelled the college . 6 . None of the students shall play at cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the penalty of a fine not exceeding five shillings for the first offence ; for the second , public admonition ; and for the third , expul sion. 7 . Those students who bring into their chambers , without a permit from the President or some of the tutors , wine , metheglin , or any kind of distilled spirituous liquors , shall be punished in a fine not exceeding five shillings for each offence . 8 . None of the students shall be absent from their chambers , without leave first obtained from the President or one of the tutors , unless half an hour after morning prayers and recitation , an hour and a half after dinner , and from evening prayers till seven o clock , on the penalty of fourpence for each offence . 9 . If any scholar shall persist in the careless neglect of his studies , and shall not make suitable preparation for the stated recitations , and other scholastic exercises appointed for his instruction , he shall , after due admo nition , be expelled . 10 . Scholars shall not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tu tor s license , unless it be in the stated vacation , on penalty of such fine aa the President shall think proper , not exceeding five shillings for the first offence ; and if , after admonition , they continually repeat the offence , they shall be expelled . /z/ direct and encourage them in their studies , and see that they are diligently employed about their proper business . 12 . No jumping , hollaring , or boisterous noise shall be suffered in the college at any time , or walking in the gallery in the time of study . 13 . Whoever shall do any damage , designedly , by writing , marking , etc. , in any part of the college , shall pay fourfold the real damage ; if acci dentally , shall make it good ; and what damage is done , and the authors thereof can not be detected , shall be levied equally on them that live in the room or in the gallery where it is done ; if in the library or hall , or any part of the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any scholar refuses to open his door to the President or tutors , who may signify their presence by a stamp , they may break it down ; and the scholar so refusing shall be punished as in a case of contempt of authority . 15 . The students of the college shall be obliged to appear in such habits as the President , tutors , and any of the Trustees shall fix upon . 16 . Every member of the college shall treat the authority of the same , and all superiors , in a becoming manner , paying that respect to every one considered in his proper place . 17 . Every scholar in college shall keep his hat off about ten rods to the President , and five to the tutors . 18 . Every Freshman sent of an errand shall go and do it faithfully , and make quick return . 19 . Every scholar shall rise up and make obeisance when the Presi dent goes in or but of the hall , or enters the pulpit on days of religious worship . 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest place . 21 . If called upon or spoken to by a superior , he shall , if within hear ing , give a direct and pertinent answer , with the word Sir at the end thereof . 22 . If overtaking a superior , or if met by him going up or down stairs , he shall stop , giving him the banister side . 23 . No Freshman shall wear a gown . 24 . No member of the college shall wear his hat in the college at any time , or appear in the dining-room at meal-time , or in the hall at any public exercise , or knowingly in the presence of the superiority of the col lege , without an upper garment , and having shoes and stockings tight . While a member of college , Manning occasionally re- /z/ turned to Hopewell , and assisted Mr. Eaton in the instruc tion of the pupils under his care . Concerning his studentlife our information is very limited . He was remarkable for diligence and attention to his studies , habits which soon gained for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence , moral philosophy , and the classics , he especially excelled . He was fond of athletic exercise , and devoted many of his hours for recreation to manly and invigorating sports . " Sana mem in sano corpora " was his motto . In his conduct he was uniformly regular , and he thus maintained a good standing with the officers of the college , without losing thereby the friendship and esteem of his fellow-students . While a student at the academy , Manning had formed an acquaintance with the Hev . Oliver Hart , pastor of the Baptist Church in Charleston , S. C. This proved to him a source of great pleasure and profit . Mr. Hart was his senior by about fifteen years , and was eminently a re ligious man . He was the main founder of the " Charles ton Baptist Association , " that venerable and useful body , through the medium of which he continued to shed upon the denomination at the South the benign influences of his well-balanced mind , for thirty years . He also , in con nection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1755 , " The Religious Society , " to aid pious young men in obtaining an education for the public services of the church . One of the earliest beneficiaries of this society was the Rev. Dr. Stillman , whose name occurs so fre quently throughout these pages . During the latter part of Manning s Junior year in college , and shortly after the death of President Duvies , Mr. Hart addressed to him a letter , which we here introduce , although it interrupts for a moment the narrative : /z/ CHARLESTON , April 27 , 1761. /z/ I received your kind letter of the 1st of March , ult. , together with President Davies sermon on the death of his late Majesty , for which favors I return my most unfeigned thanks . You intimate that you have written me several letters heretofore . I have received only one of them , as near as I can remember , above two years ago , and to which I returned an answer by the first opportunity . I lament with you ( and surely all the friends of Zion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davies . Oh , what floods of sorrow must have overwhelmed the minds of many , when it was echoed from house to house and from village to village , as in the dismal sound of hoarse thunder , President Davies is no more ! Oh , sad and melancholy dispensation ! Arise , all ye sons of pity , and mourn with those that mourn . And thou , my soul , let drop the flowing tear while commiserating the bereaved and distressed . Alas for the dear woman , whose beloved is taken away with a stroke ! May Jesus be her husband , her strength , and her stay . Alas for the bereaved children ! May their father s God be their God in covenant . Alas for the church of Christ ! Deprived of one of the principal pillars , how grievous the stroke to thee ! But Jesus , thy head and foundation , ever lives . And thou , Nassau Hall , lately so flourishing , so promising , under the auspicious management of so worthy a President what might we not have expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in thee ! How cloth the large and beautiful house appear as a widow in sable weeds ! And thy sons , lately so gay and pleasant , as well as promising and con tented how do they retire into their apartments , and there with bitter sighs , heavy groans , and broken accents , languish out , My Father , my Father ! the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof ! But I can write no more . Yours , affectionately , /z/ Manning graduated on the 29th of September , 1762 , with the second honors of his class . This class consisted of twenty-one , and included some excellent scholars , who afterwards distinguished themselves in their several profes sions and walks of life . Among them may be mentioned /z/ his most intimate friend and companion , the Rev. Dr. Hezekiah Smith , of Haverhill , Mass . ; Ebenezer - Hazard , who was the first Postmaster General of the United States after the adoption of the Federal Constitution , and who afterwards published in two quarto volumes a valuable collection of documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of Congress and the first Attorney General of Pennsylvania ; Joseph Periam , for several years a tutor in the college ; Hugh Alison , a Presbyterian clergyman ; and the Hon. Isaac Allen , who was the valedictorian of the class . The distinction conferred upon Manning by the college authorities , in awarding to him the salutatory addresses , provoked , it is said , some discontent among his ambitious compeers . This , however , is by no means an unusual thing in the annals of our literary institutions . His Latin oration , with which the exercises of Commencement were introduced , is spoken of in the Pennsylvania Gazette as " an elegant salutatory . " Soon after his graduation , he made arrangements to enter upon the duties of the profession to which he had already consecrated his life . By a vote of the church , taken , as appears from the records , on the 30th of Novem ber , 1762 , he was called to engage in the work of the Christian ministry . On the 23d of March following , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John Stites , Esq. , of Elizabethtown . Mr. Stites was a " ruling elder " in the Scotch Plains Church , to the use fulness and respectability of which his judicious counsels and large liberality greatly contributed . He was in afflu ent circumstances , 1 and for several years was the mayor 1 Mr. Stites lost the greater part of his property during the revolutionary war . This will in part account for various allusions to Dr. Manning s strait ened circumstances towards the close of his life . /z/ or chief magistrate of the place . His home at Connecticut Farms , in the immediate neighborhood of the city , was the centre of an abundant hospitality , where Manning and his wife were ever welcome guests . This marriage proved a source of great domestic felicity . Mrs. Manning pos sessed those elegant accomplishments and superior qual ities which well accorded with her husband s character , and happily fitted her for the discharge of duties insepa rable from public positions of honor and usefulness . She was also lovely and attractive in person , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a branch of the family . The blessings of offspring were , however , denied them . She survived her beloved companion many years , and , after a long and retired widowhood , died in Providence , Nov. 9 , 1815 , at the advanced age of seventy-five . At the time of their marriage , she was not a professor of re ligion . During a revival under her husband s preaching , in 1775 , she became a hopeful convert , and was received into the fellowship of the Baptist Church . The joys and consolations of a well-grounded hope in Christ thus com forted her in her bereavement , soothed her declining years , and cheered her dying hours . On the 19th of April , a few weeks after his marriage , he was publicly ordained , and set apart for his chosen work . The sermon on the occasion was preached by his brotherin-law , the Rev. John Gano , 1 who had but recently been 1 Mr. Gano , whose name frequently occurs throughout these pages , was re garded by the early Baptists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " prince among the hosts of Israel . 1 Possessed of superior natural talents and a great knowl edge of human nature , he adapted himself with singular readiness to the varied circumstances of his eventful life . His ancestors were Huguenots . Francis Gerneaux , his great-grandfather , escaped from the island of Guernsey during the hloody persecution that arose in consequence of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , and , arriving in this country , settled at New Rochelle , where lie died /z/ settled over the newly-constituted Baptist church in New York . His teacher and spiritual guide at the academy , the Rev. Isaac Eaton , gave the charge , and his beloved at the extraordinary age of one hundred and three years . John was born at Hopewell , N. J. , July 22 , 1727 . His parents were eminently pious , and from his earliest years he was faithfully instructed in the great principles of religion . At the close of 1754 , or early in 1755 , he was united in marriage to Miss Sarah Stites , who proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his usefulness . Eleven children seven sons and four daughters were the fruits of this union ; one of whom , Dr. Stephen Gano , was for a period of thirty-six years ( 1792-1828 ) the honored pastor of the First Baptist Church in Providence . In June , 1762 , the First Baptist Church in New York , consisting of twentyseven members dismissed for this purpose from the Scotch Plains Church , was organized , and Mr. Gauo became its pastor . Here he continued for a quarter of a century , excepting the time he was absent from the city in consequence of the war . During his ministry the church was greatly prospered , receiving by baptism about three hundred members . Mr. Gano early espoused the cause of his country in the contest with Great Britain . At the commencement of the war he joined the standard of freedom in the capacity of chaplain , and by his preaching contributed not a little to im part a determined spirit to the soldiers . He continued in the army till the con clusion of the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in administering reproof . A lieutenant , after uttering some profane expressions , accosted him , saying , " Good-morning , Doctor . " 1 Good-morning , sir , " replied the chaplain . " You pray early this morning . " " I beg your pardon , sir , " said the lieutenant . " Oh , I can not pardon you ; carry your case to God . " Stand ing near some soldiers who were disputing whose turn it was to cut wood for the fire , one of them said he would be d d if he would cut it . Mr. Gano im mediately stepped up , saying , " Give me the axe . " " Oh no , " replied the sol dier ; " the chaplain sha n t cut wood . " " Yes , " said he , " I must . I just heard you say you would be d d if you would cut it ; and 1 should rather take the labor off your hands than to have you made miserable forever . " In 1788 , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kentucky . He died at Frankfort , in 1804 , in the seventy-eighth year of his age . " He was in person , " says Dr. Furman , " below the middle stature , and when young of a slender form ; but of a firm , vigorous constitution , well fitted for performing active services with ease , and for suffering labors and privations with constancy . In the more advanced stages of life , his body tended to corpulency . His pres ence was manly , open , and engaging , and his voice strong and commanding . Like John , the harbinger of our Redeemer , he was a burning and a shining light , and many rejoiced in his light . Resembling the sun . he arose in the church with morning brightness , advanced regularly to his station of meridian splendor , and then gently declined , with mild effulgence , till he disappeared , without a cloud to intercept his rays or obscure his glory . " /z/ friend , the Rey . Isaac Stelle , 1 of Piscataway , made the ordaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning travelled through the colonies , to ascertain the actual state of religion , and to prepare himself for more widely-extended usefulness , by a thorough acquaintance with men and manners , and an accurate knowledge of the condition and wants of the denomination to which he was attached . No record is left to indicate the extent , or to exhibit the incidents , of his journeyings . He preached during this period to various destitute churches , and every where his labors appear to have been highly acceptable . By the following letter from the Rev. Oliver Hart , it appears that Manning was invited to assist him in his Memoirs of Mr. Gano s life , written principally by himself , were published , in a small duodecimo , in 1806 . He was one of the first trustees of Rhode Island College , and , until his removal to Kentucky , cooperated most efficiently with President Manning in his efforts to promote the cause of sound learning and ministerial education . 1 Mr. Stelle was the son of Benjamin Stelle , a worthy magistrate , who for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Benjamin , in 1759 , he was succeeded by his son Isaac , who continued in this pastoral office until Oct. 9 , 1781 , when he died , in the sixty-third year of his age . He possessed a temperament exceedingly active , and a disposition uncommonly amiable . Fired by ardent piety , he longed for usefulness , and , under the guidance of Mr. Miller , to whom we have already referred as Manning s early pastor , he engaged in itinerating labors remarkable even for that age . Between these brethren there existed the strongest ties of personal friendship and esteem . " Lovely and pleasant , " says one , " were they in their lives , and in death they were not much divided , the one having survived the other only about thirty-five days . " " If one was grieved , it did them both annoy ; If one rejoiced , the other felt the joy ; When one was gone , the other could not stay , But quickly hastened to eternal day . " Benjamin , a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Jersey in the year 1766 . He came to Providence and established a Latin school , as we learn from a letter of President Manning to David Howell , dated July 14 , 1766 . The late Hon. Nicholas Brovn married a daughter of this Mr. Stelle for his second wite. /z/ labors as pastor of the Baptist church in Charleston . This invitation , or , strictly speaking , call from the church , fortunately for the interests of learning and religion in New England , he declined , having already entered upon the great educational work to which his future life was to be consecrated . The Rev. Nicholas Bedgegood , it may be added , was afterwards employed as an assistant to Mr. Hart ; and , by his popular talents and pleasing address , gained so much upon the admiration of many , that an attempt , although unsuccessful , was made to supplant Mr. Hart , and to place the assistant in the pastoral office .

If the call should happen , by any means , to miscarry , pray look /z/ upon this as one , and do not engage till you receive a duplicate of that already sent . I wish you great grace , and am Yours , in Jesus , /z/ It was about the time of Manning s graduation that the plan of establishing a Baptist college or university for the education , more especially , of young men for the ministry , was freely discussed by many prominent men in the de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind . The only colleges in New England were Harvard l and Yale , 1 both under the control of Congregationalists . The College of New Jersey 1 had been established by the Presbyterians . The remaining colleges , Columbia 1 in New York , William and Mary l in Virginia , and the University of Pennsylvania , 1 had been established by Episcopalians , and were under their control . Those who consult the pages of our early historians , and , indeed , the correspondence of Manning in future chapters of this work , will readily perceive that towards the Baptists , as a people , the Congregationalists of New England enter tained unfriendly feelings , taxing them unjustly , and op pressing them in various ways , in accordance with the narrow and illiberal policy of a past age . In regard to Episcopalians , the opinion was entertained , " whether cor rectly or not , " says Prof. Kingsley in his Life of Dr. Stiles , " it is unimportant here to determine , that the Episcopal clergy generally , and the leading individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , i Harvard College was founded in 1638 ; William and Mary , in 1692 ; Yale , in 1701 ; College of New Jersey , in 1746 ; University of Pennsylvania , in 1753 ; and Columbia College , in 1754 . Of the two hundred and thirty-six colleges men tioned in the National Almanac for 1864 , Brown University , therefore , which was founded in 1764 , is the seventh in the order of date . /z/ were hostile to the privileges granted in several of the royal charters , and were endeavoring to undermine them . " Hence from political considerations , aside from all others , the majority of religious people throughout the colonies found themselves opposed to the interests of the Episcopal church . In this feeling the Baptists , who from their earli est history have always advocated religious freedom , and equality among men , very naturally shared . The fact that the English Government , in its appointments to office , re stricted its selection to members of the Episcopal church , contributed not a little to this feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they regarded with no favorable eye institutions of learning where sectarian and restrictive influences prevailed . In order , however , to a proper un derstanding of the origin of Brown University , it may be well at this point to go back half a century , and consider briefly the first distinct organization on this continent of the Baptists as a religious society . In the year 1707 , on the 27th of July , a meeting of del egates from Baptist churches in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and Delaware was held at Philadelphia . The object of this meeting , as appears from the records , was " to consult about such things as were wanting in the churches , and set them in order , " and in general to promote the welfare of the denomination . Hence the origin of the Philadelphia Association . The brethren who assembled on this occa sion represented the churches at Lower Dublin , Middletown , Piscataqua , Cohansie , and Welsh Tract . The General Meeting , so called , which had been held at Philadelphia from 1689 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective churches to de vise and execute designs of public good . From its begin ning , it has been a flourishing body . According to the /z/ statistics of its 156th anniversary , held on the 6th , 7th , and 8th of October , 1863 , it now comprises sixty churches , with a membership , if we may so speak , of 12,862 . At a com paratively early period , the churches thus associated pro jected plans to secure an educated ministry . In looking over the records , we find in 1722 a proposition " for the churches to make inquiry among themselves , if they have any young persons hopeful for the ministry , and inclinable for learning ; and if they have , to give notice of it to Mr. Abel Morgan , before the first of November , that he might recommend such to the academy , on Mr. Hollis , his ac count . " Reference is here had to Thomas Hollis , Esq. , of London , the distinguished benefactor of Harvard Uni versity. 1 He had recently founded ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were intended for the " ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ ; " " and that none , " to use his own language , " be refused on account of his belief and practice of adult bap tism , if he be sober and religiously inclined . " In a letter to the Rev. Ephraim Wheaton , of Swanzey , Massachusetts , which we find published in the first volume of the Massa chusetts Missionary Magazine , Mr. Hollis , in reference to 1 Mr. Hollis commenced his donations to Harvard in 1719 . Besides making valuable additions to the library and philosophical apparatus , he established a fund for the support of ten poor scholars , a Professor of Divinity , and a Pro fessor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy ; the scholars to receive each 10 currency per annum , and the professors each a salary of 80 currency , or 26 sterling . " The aggregate of his donations , " says Peirce in his history of the University , ; wr.s not much , if at all , short of 2000 sterling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before by any one individual ; and when it is considered that all this came from a stranger in a distant land , from one of the then poor , despised Baptists , during the lifetime of the donor , and at a time when the value of money was vastly greater than it is now , what breast does not glow with grateful admiration ! Some idea may be formed of the difference in the value of money then and now , by considering that the salary of a professor was at first only 26 sterling , and that this was then called an honorable stipend . " /z/ these scholarships , speaks of having made provision for " Baptist youth to be educated for the ministry , and equally regarded with Psedobaptists , " and requests Mr. Wheaton to inform him of any duly qualified , that he may recommend them for the first vacancy . He also corre sponded with the Philadelphia Association on the subject . Hence the churches were fully authorized to avail them selves of his generosity . This provision , however , of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence of the growing unfriendliness exhibited towards them throughout most of the New England States . Meanwhile , churches of their faith and order were rapidly multiplying ; and as educated ministers could not be had in numbers sufficient to supply the demand , they were compelled to accept the services of men , who , though destitute of the aids of literary and scientific culture , were nevertheless taught by the Holy Spirit ; and who , with hearts overflow ing with love and zeal , proclaimed the precious truths of the gospel with a power , unction , and success which have not always been the accompaniments of a learned ministry . In the year 1756 , the academy at Hopewell was estab lished , as we have already stated , by the Rev. Isaac Eaton , a name dear to the Baptist society in America , and to all true friends of learning and religion . In the welfare and progress of this academy , the Philadelphia and Charleston Associations ever manifested a lively interest . They ap pointed certain trustees to have a general oversight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund , of which the parent association furnished about four hundred pounds . Under the wise supervision of its founder and principal , it was continued eleven years , during which time , many , who afterwards became eminent in the ministry , received thereat the rudiments of an education . Among /z/ them may be mentioned , besides Manning , Dr. Samuel Jones , Dr. Hezekiah Smith , Dr. Isaac Skillman , David Thomas , John Davis , William Williams , Robert Keith , Charles Thompson , David Jones , John Sntton , David Sutton , James Talbot , John Blackwell , Joseph Powell , Wil liam Worth , and Levi Bonnel . Not a few of Mr. Eaton s students distinguished themselves in the professions of medicine and law . Of this latter class was the Hon. Judge Ho well , of whom we shall have occasion hereafter to make frequent mention . This attempt to introduce learning in the Baptist society having succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations of its friends , the churches were encouraged to extend their designs for the promotion of letters , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college or university . Many of them had been supplied with able pastors from the academy , and had thus become convinced from expe rience of the great usefulness of a classical and scientific education , in more thoroughly furnishing the man of God for the work of the gospel ministry . At first it seemed most fitting to commence the undertaking in some one of the southern colonies ; but several members of the Associa tion having visited the New England States , and seen the great increase of Baptist churches there , and having ascer tained the fact that the government of Rhode Island 1 was chiefly in the hands of those who would be likely to favor i Mr. Edwards , in his " Materials , " etc. , says , " The Province of Rhode Island and Providence may on some accounts be styled the Land of Baptists ; " first , be cause " they who settled the country were chiefly of that denomination ; " second ly , because : &lt; they have always been more numerous than any other sect of Chris tians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , being reputed Baptists ; " thirdly , because " the Baptists in this Government have always had much power in their hands , both legislative and executive . Their governors , deputy governors , judges , assembly men , justices , and officers ( military and /z/ the design , it was determined to make the effort in that colony , which originally had been settled by persons of the Baptist persuasion . On the 12th of October , 1762 , the Association , now com prising twenty-nine churches , met at the Lutheran Church , in Fifth Street , Philadelphia . The Rev. Morgan Edwards was chosen moderator , and the Rev. Abel Morgan , clerk . At this meeting , says Backus , " the Association obtained such an acquaintance with the affiairs of Rhode Island , as to bring themselves to an apprehension that it was prac ticable and expedient to erect a college in the colony of Rhode Island , under the chief direction of the Baptists , in which education might be promoted , and superior learning obtained , free from any sectarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan Edwards , to whom , with the Rev. Samuel Jones , the business in general appears to have been intrusted . This gentleman , who had but recently been settled in Philadelphia , was a native of Wales , having come to this country upon the recommend ation of Dr. Gill and other prominent ministers in London . He had been bred an Episcopalian , but in 1738 he embraced the sentiments of the Baptists . He received his academ ical education in Bristol , under Dr. Foskett , and in his sixteenth year entered upon the work of the Christian ministry . Possessing superior abilities , united with great perseverance and zeal , he became the leader in various denominational enterprises , devoting to them his time and talents , and thereby rendering essential service to the cause . Many of his sermons , treatises , and historical civil ) have been chiefly of that denominatibn . The last reason I shall mention is , that their college is a Baptist college ; the Baptists only made the motion for it , the Baptists only gathered money to endow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirds of the Fellows and Trustees , must ever be of that denomination . " /z/ works have been published . In one of them , entitled " Ma terials towards a History of the Baptists in Pennsyl vania , " he speaks of himself as having " labored hard to settle a Baptist college in Rhode Island Government , and to raise money to endow it ; which he deems the greatest service he has done or hopes to do for the Baptist interest . " This was in 1770 . Mr. Edwards died on the 28th of Jan uary , 1795 , in the seventy-third year of his age . His funeral sermon , preached by the Rev. Dr. William Rogers , was published in Dr. Rippon s Anmial Register , a work printed in London . This sermon gives an analysis of his charac ter , 1 and an enumeration of his published writings . 1 Dr. Rogers friendly estimate of Mr. Edwards s character and influence , as recorded in this sermon , was that of his brethren and associates generally . It is understood , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadel phia during the latter part of his ministry were not entirely harmonious . In 1770 , he preached a New Year s sermon from the text , " This year thou shalt die . " He had , from some unaccountable impulse , been led to believe that he should die on a particular day , and this sermon was supposed by some to have been intended as his own funeral sermon . This circumstance could not but eflect his reputation injuriously . In addition to this , he is said to have indulged , occasionally , in the excessive use of intoxicating drinks . Under these circum stances , he voluntarily resigned his charge , preaching occasionally until the set tlement ot his successor , Dr. Rogers , in 1772 . The following extract from letters addressed to the Rev. Hezekiah Smith , by the Rev. Francis Pelot , of Eutaw , South Carolina , shows Mr. Edwards s position at this time in a friendly light . The letter is dated Oct. 28 , 1771 . " I then wish " ( referring to the Philadelphia church ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus I argue to myself : - If he may preach occasionally , why not steadily ? Oh ! but he has not behaved as well as he should . I reply , There can not be anything immoral , or he would not be allowed to preach occasionally , and the mantle CHARITY , would easily cover small imperfections . Besides , the present dissatisfaction , no doubt , would make him more cautious for the future , and might be a means of preserving the usefulness of a talented man , a man who has scarce his lellow in a warm attachment to the Baptist interest . " In a letter dated April 8 , 1772 , Mr. Pelot adds , t ; We were favored with the company of Rev. Morgan Edwards at my house for about u week in last January . We also had his company at our Asso ciation . We all esteem him as a sensible , good man , and he left us all full of love to him . " Kev . Oliver Hart , of Charleston , South Carolina , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on his tour through the colonies , after his ordination , that Manning , to whom this enterprise had been specially intrusted , first made his appearance in Rhode Island , accompanied by the Rev. John Button , of Elizabeth town . Both were members , at this time , of the Philadelphia Association . He was now twenty-five years of age , of a fine , commanding appearance , pleasing man ner , and polished address . His person , says a writer , was graceful , and his countenance handsome arid remarkably expressive of sensibility , dignity , and cheerfulness . He possessed a voice of extraordinary compass and harmony , to which , in no small degree , may be ascribed the vivid impression which he made upon other minds . In his manners , which seemed to be the natural expression of dignity and grace , he combined ease without negligence , and politeness without affectation . Blest with an amiable disposition , and possessing versatile colloquial powers , he was most engaging and instructive as a companion . He possessed , moreover , genuine piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when to all these dated Feb. 27 , 1772 , thus writes : " Rev. Mr. Edwards from Philadelphia has been here , and tarried with us about three weeks . He is a great good man , but some say he preaches too slow . " And in a second letter , written the next month , he further adds , " In my last I informed you that we had the pleasure of Mr. Edwards s company at our Association . He is a great good man ; firmly attached to the Baptist interest , to promote which he cheerfully encounters all difficulties . " These testimonials , coming voluntarily from two of the most prominent Baptist ministers of the South , show that Mr. Edwards , even at a time when his sun ap peared to bo obscured , was a man highly esteemed , and that he was worthy of the honor , which is accorded to him , of having been the prime mover in origi nating and founding Brown University . Mr. Edwards was twice married . His first wife was Mary Nunn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several children . His second wife was Mrs. Sinclair , of Delaware , whose decease occurred previous to his own . One of his sons was a military officer in the British service . During the war he himself adhered to the cause of Great Britian , and was justly ranked with the Tories ; although his Toryism seemed rather a matter of principle than of action . /z/ gifts and accomplishments we add sterling good sense , for which he was preeminently distinguished , and superior learning , it will readily be perceived that he was well fitted to act as a pioneer in the great educational work before him . The history of the enterprise from this point may best be given in Manning s own language , which we find in a work among the manuscript writings of the Rev. Morgan Edwards , entitled " Materials towards a History of the Baptists in Rhode Island . " " In the month of July , 1763 , we arrived at Newport , and made a motion to several gentlemen of the Baptist denomination whereof Col. Gardner , the Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , subject to the government of the Baptists . The motion was properly attended to , which brought together about fifteen gentlemen of the same denomination at the deputy s house , who requested that I would draw a sketch of the design , against the day following . That day came ; and the said gentlemen , with other Baptists , met in the same place , when a rough draught was produced and read , the tenor of which was , that the institution was to be a Baptist one , but that as many of other denom inations should be taken in as was consistent with the said design . 1 Ac- 1 " Never , " says the Kev . Dr. Cutting , in an article in the New York Recorder , published Sept. 20 , 1854 , which we here quote , " were men more decided in religious faith than the settlers of Rhode Island . It was their positive and zeal ous traits which from the four quarters of the earth sent them thither for shelter , and there they contended with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance , because the rights of conscience were inviolable , and charity was a duty and a grace . " We suppose this to be the true spirit of Brown University in its relations to religion . Providing in its charter for a majority of Baptists in its corporation , it embraces in certain proportions , likewise , Episcopalians , Quakers , and Congregationalists ; not because the differences between Baptists , Episcopalians , Quakers , and Congregationalists are not of importance , but because the things which they hold in common , and the spirit of their common faith , furnish ample ground for cooperation in the cause of polite literature . It is the honor of the Baptists that , when , by the intolerance of other colonies , they were driven to /z/ cordingly , the Hon. Josias Lyndon and Col. Job Bennet were appointed to draw a charter to be laid before the next General Assembly , with a petition that they would pass it into a law . But the said gentlemen pleading unskilfulness touching an affair of the kind , requested that their trusty friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be solicited to assist them . This was opposed by me as unwilling to give the Doctor trouble about an affair of other people ; but they urged that his love of learning and Catholicism would induce him readily to give his assistance . Ac cordingly their proposition was consented to , and his assistance obtained ; or , rather , the draughting of the charter was left entirely to him , 1 after being told that the Baptists were to have the lead in the institution , and Rhode Island to establish their college , they proceeded at once , and of their own motion , to call in the counsels of gentlemen of other denominations , and to admit them to a share in the government , though their catholicity had wellnigh cost them the total loss of all which they had undertaken . They did this , not to merge their faith in a common indifferentism , but to illustrate a compre hensive charity . They had a main design , and a subordinate and collateral one . The main design was a Baptist college , especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consistent with it , was the design of an institution which , enlisting a common interest , should confer common blessings upon other denominations and upon the State . Such a scheme was at the time utterly without a parallel , and must have been regarded in the other col onies with something of the amazement with which the inhabitants of Massa chusetts Bay had looked , at an earlier day , upon the broad religious liberty of Rhode Island and the Providence Plantations . In this original spirit , as we believe , should the University be administered forever ; men of diverse faiths working together , not because of indiffereutism , but of charity , not as the less Baptists , Episcopalians , Quakers , and Congregationalists , but as men of common interests in a work which honors and blesses all . It would be a shame if such an institution should not be , as always it has been , in the highest and best sense catholic . In our view , if its catholicity degenerated to indifferentism , it would cease to represent both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. Kingsley , in his Life of Dr. Stiles , states that " a committee of Baptists and Congregationalists was appointed to draft a charter of a college ; and of this body , Mr. Stiles and Mr. William Ellery were designated to prepare such an instrument for their consideration . " " It is highly probable , " he further adds , " from internal evidence , that the charter was drawn principally by Mr. Stiles ; Mr. Ellery having little concern in preparing it , except to see to the correctness of the legal language . Whoever drew it , he had obviously before him the char ters of Yale College , and was familiar with the questions which had arisen with respect to them . The privileges secured to the University by this charter are very ample ; and the language of the several provisions is remarkably full , /z/ the government thereof , forever ; and that no more of other denominations were to be admitted than would be consistent with that . The charter was drawn , and a time and place were appointed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel in which I was to sail for Hali fax going off that day , prevented my being present with them long enough to see whether the original design was secured ; and as the corporation was made to consist of two branches , Trustees and Fellows , and these branches to sit and act by distinct and separate powers , it was not easy to determine , by a transient hearing , what those powers might be . The Trustees were presumed to be the principal branch of authority ; and as nineteen out of thirty-five were to be Baptists , the Baptists were sat isfied , without sufficient examination into the authority vested in the fellowship , which afterwards appeared to be the soul of the institution , while the trusteeship was only the body . Placing , therefore , an entire con fidence in Dr. Stiles , they agreed to join in a petition to the Assembly to have the charter confirmed by authority . The petition was preferred , and cheerfully received , and the charter read ; after which a vote was called for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this was opposed by others , particularly by Daniel Jenckes , Esq. , member for Providence , who con tended that the Assembly required more time to examine whether it was agreeable to the design of the first movers for it , and therefore prayed the house to have the perusal of it , while they adjourned for dinner . This was granted , with some opposition . Then he asked the Governor , who was a Baptist , whom they intended to invest with the governing power in said institution ? The Governor answered , " The Baptists , by all means . " Then Mr. Jenckes showed him that the charter was so artfully con structed as to throw the power into the Fellows hands , whereof eight out precise , and explicit . It is , undoubtedly , in many respects , one of the best college charters in New England . " ( See Appendix . ) From Prof. Kingsley s statements , it would appear that Baptists and Cougregatioualists were alike interested in the movement , and that a joint committee representing the two denominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , of Backus , Edwards , Manning , and Jenckes , it is evident that Baptists alone were the originators of the undertaking ; that Baptists alone met at the Deputy Governor s house in Newport , in July , 1763 ; that , of their number , Lyndon and Bennet were appointed to draft a charter in accordance with a plan sketched by Manning ; that these gentlemen , " pleading unskilfulness , " requested that Dr. Stiles " might be solicited to assist them ; " and that this was at first opposed by Manning , who was " unwilling to give the Doctor trouble about an affair of other people . " /z/ of twelve were Presbyterians , usually called Congrcgationalists , and that the other four might be of the same denomination , for aught that appeared in the charter to the contrary . Convinced of this , Governor Lyndon imme diately had an interview with Dr. Stiles , the Presbyterian minister of Newport , and demanded why he had perverted the design of the charter . The answer was , " I gave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had done so with regard to our society ; " l and finally observed , that " he was not the rogue . " When the Assembly was convened again , the said Jenckes moved that the affair might be put off to the next ses- 1 In Prof. Kingsley s Life of Dr. Stiles , to which we have already alluded , we find it stated that the project of a college in Rhode Island had been the subject of serious deliberation a considerable time before the charter was actually granted by the Legislature , and that in this matter Dr. Stiles had taken a prom inent part , collecting statistics , etc . His plan was , to unite several denominations of Christians in the enterprise , both in America and in Great Britain , and thus , by proper care , make the dissenting interest eventually exceed the Episcopal establishment . The whole number of churches of the Congregational , Presby terian , and Baptist denominations , not only in the colonies , but in Great Britain and Ireland , he ascertained to be three thousand six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches might be induced to contribute to the establishment and support of an institution which would so greatly subserve their interests . " The arrival at Newport of Mr. Manning , and the proposition made by him for the establishment of a Baptist college , interfered , of course , with his cherished views and plans . It is therefore not surprising that he should have been unwilling to see them defeated , without a struggle on his part to carry them into effect . We can understand how an attempt should have been made , either by Dr. Stiles or his associates , in drafting an act of incoporation for a college in Rhode Island , to pay special " regard " to the interests of their own " society . " That there was disappointment on both sides , and at the time mutual recriminations , is evident from the narrative . Under similar circum stances there doubtless would be again , human nature being very much the same now as in the days of our ancestors . It is due to Dr. Stiles , to state that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected to a fellowship in the college , and solicited by repeated deputations from the corporation to accept the trust , he thus writes to the chancellor and Trustees . " I was too sincere a friend to literature not to have taken part in the institution at first , upon my nomination in the charter , had I not been prevented by reasons which a subsequent immediate election could not remove . " One of the reasons assigned in this letter , as stated by Dr. Manning , in a letter to the Rev. John Ryland , dated May 20 , 1773 , was " the offence he should give his brethren should he accept it . " Whatever the reasons were , they still influenced him to decline the office to which he was invited , with suitable acknowledgments of the politeness and respect with which he was treated on this occasion . His letter /z/ sion ; adding , that the motion for a college originated with the Baptists , and was intended for their use , but that the charter in question was not at all calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this matter by the Baptists professed they had been misled , not to say imposed upon , it was necessary that the Baptists in other parts of the colony should be consulted previous to its passing into a law , especially as few , if any of them except himself , had seen it ; and he prayed that he might have a copy for the said purpose , which he promised to return . All which was granted . When the charter came to be narrowly inspected , it was found to be by no means answerable to the design of the agitators and the instructions given the committee . Consequently , application was made to the Philadelphia Association , where the thing took its rise , to have their mind on the subject , who immediately sent two gentlemen 1 hither to join with the Baptists of this colony in making such alterations and amendments as were to them specified before their departure . When they arrived , Dr. Eyres 2 of Newport was added to the committee , and they concludes with the catholic and pious wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down every good and perfect gift , may excite the public munift " cence , and raise up benefactors , through whose liberalities this institution shall be completed with an ample endowment . " ( Holmes s Life of President Stiles , page 117. ) 1 On the margin of the manuscript , in the handwriting of the Rev. Dr. Jones , who was Morgan Edwards s intimate friend , is the following , namely , " Why their names are not mentioned , I can not say . However , there was no one sent but myself , although Mr. Robert Strettle Jones was so kind as to bear me com pany to Rhode Island on the occasion . SAMUEL JONES . " Mr. Jones , it will be remembered , in connection with Mr. Edwards , had been intrusted by the Association with the business in general of founding a Baptist college or univer sity . He had , at this date , but recently been ordained in Philadelphia . He was a young man of liberal education , and a ready and skilful writer ; hence his special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following extract from notes to a century sermon delivered by him before the Philadel phia Baptist Association , Oct. 6 , 1807 , nearly fifty years afterwards , shows the manner in which he performed his mission : " In the fall of 1763 , the writer of these sheets , on request , repaired to Newport in Rhode Island , and new-modelled a rough draught they had of a charter of incorporation for a college , which soon after obtained legislative sanction . " 2 Thomas Eyres , a physician , the first secretary of the corporation , and a Fellow of the college from 1764 until his death in 1788 . He was graduated at Yale College , in the Class of 1754 . His father , Elder Nicholas Eyres , was pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Newport from 1731 until his death , Feb. 13 , 1759 . ( See Backus. ) /z/ happily draughted the present charter , and lodged it , with a new petition , in proper hands . The most material alterations were , appointing the same number of Baptists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Stiles ; settling the presidency in the Baptist society ; adding five Baptists to the Trustees , and putting more Episcopa lians than Presbyterians in the corporation . " Among the alterations not here enumerated by Manning , were , electing the President by the corporation instead of exclusively by the Trustees ; providing for convoking an assembly of the corporation on twenty days notice instead of six ; making five a quorum of the Board of Fellows instead of eight ; and striking out the clause making the places of Trustees or Fellows who should re move out of the State , vacant . By confining membership in the corporation to persons residing within the limits of the colony , the original charter excluded the originators and founders of the college . Hence , in the list of names proposed by Dr. Stiles to be incorporated , the following , which we find in the printed charter , as suggested by the committee , are omitted ; namely , Rev , Morgan Edwards , Rev. Samuel Jones , Rev. James Manning , Rev. Isaac Eaton , Rev. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Robert Strettle Jones , Esq . The names of Hezekiah Smith , Isaac Backus , William Williams , and others from out of the State , who rendered such signal service in the early history of the college , would also have been excluded from membership in the corporation by the charter as originally drafted . ( See Appendix . ) Mr. Jenckes , to whom Manning refers in his Narrative , was a wealthy merchant of Providence , and an active mem ber of the Baptist church . He died July 7 , 1774 , in the seventy-third year of his age , having continued , says the record , a church-member forty-eight years " without cen- /z/ sure . " He was for forty years a member of the General Assembly , and for nearly thirty years Chief Justice of the Providence County Court . His daughter Rhoda was the mother of the Hon. Nicholas Brown , from whom the University derives it name , and also of the late Mrs. Hope Ives , after whom Hope College was named . Among the manuscript writings of Morgan Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Manning s Narrative is taken , a history of the college charter , by Judge Jenckes , which we here give , as follows : " While I attended the business of the Assembly , held August , 1763 , Capt . William Rogers came to the Council Chamber and presented me with a paper , with a design I should sign it ; adding , that , as it was a peti tion for a Baptist college , he knew I would not refuse . Business not permitting me to attend to it immediately , I requested he would leave with me the petition and charter . Meanwhile , the sergeant made procla mation requiring the members to take their seats . In my seat I began to read the papers , but had not done before the petition and charter were called for , which I gave to the sergeant , and he to the speaker at the board . The petition being read , a motion was made to receive it , and grant the charter . After some time I stood up to oppose , proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this effect . I understood that the college in question was sought for by the Baptists ; and that it was to be under their government and direction , with the admission only of a few of other religious denominations to share with them therein , that they might appear as catholic as could be , consistent with their main design ; but , on the contrary , I perceived by glancing over the charter , while I sat in my place just now , that the main power and direction is vested in twelve Fellows , and that . eight out of the twelve are to be Presbyterians ; and that the others may or may not be of the same denomination ; but of necessity , none of them are to be Baptists . If so , there is treachery somewhere , and a design of gossly imposing on the honest people who first moved for the institution . I desire , therefore , that /z/ the matter may lie by till the afternoon . This was granted . In the afternoon the matter was resumed , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events ; but I had influence enough to stop proceed ings then also . That evening and the next morning , I made it my busi ness to see Governor Lyndon and Col. Bonnet , and to inform them of the construction of the charter . They could not believe me , for the confidence they had in Dr. Stiles s honor and integrity , until seeing convinced them ; what reflections followed may be better concealed than published . How ever , we all agreed to postpone passing the charter into a law , and did effect our purpose for that session , notwithstanding the attempts of Mr. Ellcry and others of the Presbyterians to the contrary . Before the break ing up of the Assembly , the house , at my request , directed the speaker to deliver the charter to me , after I had made a promise it should be forth coming at the next meeting of the Assembly . I took the charter to Providence , and showed it to many who came to my house ; others borrowed it to peruse at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newport , which occa sioned the committee of Newport te send to me for the charter . I asked for it of Dr. Ephraim Bowen , who had borrowed it last . The Doctor said he lent it to Samuel Nightingale , Esq . Search was made for it there , but it could not be found ; neither do I know to this clay what became of it . 1 When the next General Assembly met ( last Wednesday in October , 1763 ) , the second charter was presented ; which was much faulted , and opposed by the gentry who concerned themselves so warmly about the other . And one in particular demanded that the first charter , which had been in trusted to me , might be produced . Then I related , as above , that it was lost , and the manner how it was lost ; but the party , instead of believing this , very rudely suggested that I had secreted the charter , and in the i This important document , which was lost for nearly a century , has re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was found , some twenty years since , among the files and papers of the church over which Dr. Stiles presided . It is in the handwriting of the author , and was evidently copied from the " rough draft " with great care . A careful comparison of this docu ment with the charter which was finally granted by the General Assembly , fully confirms all the statements in reference thereto made by Manning and Jenckes . It shows also how much the University is indebted to Dr. Stiles for the phrase ology of the instrument that gave it an existence , and for the fulness and pre cision with which all its privileges are granted and its provisions stated . The document is published in the Appendix , with the changes made by the commit tee or " messengers. " /z/ face of the court charged me with a breach of trust ; which brought on very disagreeable altercations and bickerings , until , at last , I was necessi tated to say , that if there had been any foul doings , it was amongst them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we gave way to them that session for peace sake . Meanwhile , Dr. Bowcn , who is a man of strict honor and integrity , used all means to recover the former charter , posting an advertisement in the most public places in town , and making diligent inquiry ; but to no purpose . At the next Assembly , which met in February , 1764 , the new charter was again brought on the carpet ; and the same clamor against it , and unjust re proaches against me , were repeated . It was said that the new charter was not like the old , and was constructed to deprive the Presbyterians of the benefit of the institution . To which it was replied , that it was agreeable to the designs of the first undertakers , and if calculated to deprive the Presbyterians of the power they wanted , it was no more than what they themselves had attempted to do to the Baptists . After much and warm debate , the question was put and carried in favor of the new charter , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or narratives , it appears , ( 1 ) That President Manning drew up a plan of the college , and presented it to a company of Baptist gentlemen , at Newport , in the month of July , 1763. ( 2 ) That the Hon. Josias Lyndon and Colonel Job Bennet were appointed to draw a charter , in accordance with said plan , to be laid before the next General Assembly , with a petition that it might be made a law . ( 3 ) That the assistance of the Rev. Dr. Stiles , afterwards President of Yale College , was solicited and obtained . ( 4 ) That the drafting of the charter was left entirely to Dr. Stiles ; and that lie , in turn , was assisted by the Hon. William Ellery. ( 5 ) That the charter was accordingly drawn , and a time and place were appointed for the parties concerned to meet and hear it read . ( 6 ) That Manning , being obliged to leave on that day for Halifax , was unable to be with the committee long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Baptists , being satisfied , without sufficient examination into the authority vested in the fellowship , and reposing entire confidence in Dr. Stiles , agreed to join in a petition to the General Assembly to have the charter confirmed by authority . ( 7 ) That the petition and charter were accordingly presented to the General Assembly in August , 1763 , but that action thereon was postponed until the next session , through the influence of the Hon. Daniel Jenckes , the attempts of Mr. Ellery and others of the Pres byterians to the contrary notwithstanding . ( 8 ) That the charter was found on inspection to be so drawn as to vest the main power and direction of the institution in a board of twelve Fellows , eight of whom were to be Presbyte rians , and the other four of the same denomination , for aught that appeared to the contrary ; and that in general it did not answer to the original design . ( 9 ) That in this emergency application was made to the Philadelphia Association , " where the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . ( 10 ) That they immediately sent to Newport the Rev. Samuel Jones , who was accompanied by Robert Strettle Jones , and that when they arrived , Dr. Eyres , of Newport , was added to the committee . ( 11 ) That , meanwhile , the original copy of the charter , presented to the General Assembly in August , which had been intrusted by that body to Mr. Jenckes , had been lost . ( 12 ) That the committee found at Newport a rough draft of a char ter , which they happily remodelled , and that the most material alterations were , appointing the same number of Baptists in the fellowship that had been appointed of the Presbyterians by Dr. Stiles ; settling the presidency in the Baptist society ; adding five Baptists to the Trus tees ; putting more Episcopalians than Presbyterians in the corporation ; and extending the membership of the /z/ corporation to persons residing out of the colony or state . From all this it is evident that the " rough draft " which the last committee remodelled was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the first committee in July , and from which a copy was undoubtedly made for the General Assembly . This copy , as we have already remarked , has recently been found among the archives of Dr. Stiles s church , and is now in the possession of the University . That the college owes its origin to the efforts of men who were members of the Philadelphia Association , is ev ident from its history thus far . The following extracts from the minutes of this venerable body show the interest which it continued to manifest in the welfare and prog ress of an institution which it had aided in bringing into being : 1764 . " Agreed , to inform the churches to which we respectively belong , that , inasmuch as a charter is obtained in Rhode Island Government towards erecting a Baptist college , the churches should be liberal in con tributing towards carrying the same into execution .

" N. B. The several churches are desired to insert in the above blank the name of the most suitable person in the society for this service . " /z/ The plan proposed by the Association in Charleston , S. C. , for raising a fund for Rhode Island College , and adopted by the Philadelphia Association in 1774 , as we learn from the foregoing extracts , and also during the same year by the Warren Association , was , in the language of the record , the " recommending to every member to pay sixpence sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder , or some suitable person : this money to be paid to the treasurer of the college . " At the same time , the Rev. Messrs . John Gano , Oliver Hart , and Francis Pelot were appointed , says Benedict , to address the Bap tist associations throughout America , and urge their co operation in these efforts to raise funds for the college . In reading this record , we are amused at the gravity with which a body of men recommended the payment of so small a sum as sixpence , or twelve and one half cents , towards endowing an institution of learning , especially when we contrast this with the princely benefactions of later days . But further reflection soon changes any dis position of this kind into a feeling of respect , and even of admiration . The Baptists of that early period were , as a people , poor , and , as Dr. Manning in one of his letters adds , " despised and oppressed . " The gifts and offerings which they thus contributed for the college were from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to the noblest of all causes , the advancement of human learn ing . All honor for the zeal and perseverance , the sacri fices and the prayers , of these early friends of the college ! Were their spirit emulated by their descendants , how soon would the resources of our public institutions be augmented , and their means of influence largely increased ! But to return . The charter finally granted by the Gen eral Assembly , out of which , says Mr. Edwards , " the /z/ Baptists narrowly escaped being jockied by a set of men in whom they reposed full confidence , " is now , and must forever continue to be , the unalterable constitution of the college or university . x By it the corporation is made to consist of two branches ; namely , that of the Trustees and that of the Fellows , with distinct , separate , and respective powers . The Trustees are thirty-six in number , of whom twenty-two are forever to be elected of the denomination called Baptists or Antipaedobaptists , five of the denomina tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Episcopalians , and four of the denomination called Congregation alists . These were the denominations of New England a century ago . The number of the Fellows , in cluding the President , who must always be a Fellow , is twelve , of whom eight are forever to be elected of the denomination called Baptists , and the rest indifferently of any or all denominations . The President must forever be a Baptist . Once in three years the corporation , at its annual meetings , must choose from among the Trustees a chancellor of the university , and a treasurer ; and from among the Fellows , a secretary . The office of the chancel lor is merely to preside as moderator of the Trustees ; the President , or , in his absence , the senior Fellow , being the moderator of the Fellows . The instruction and immediate government of the college is , and must forever continue to rest in the President and Fellows , or fellowship , to whom , as a " learned faculty , " belongs exclusively the privilege of adjudging and conferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Baptists , as al ready stated , the control of the college , recognizes repeat edly , and in most unequivocal terms , the grand principles of religious freedom , for which the descendants of Roger Williams , and all true Baptists of every ago , have always /z/ resolutely contended . Some of its provisions are as fol lows : And , furthermore , it is hereby enacted and declared , That into this lib eral and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests ; but , on the contrary , all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full , free , absolute , and uninterrupted liberty of conscience : And that the places of professors , tutors , and all other officers , the President alone excepted , shall be free and open for all denominations of Protestants : And that youth of all religious denominations shall and may be freely admitted to the equal advantages , emoluments , and honor of the college or university , and shall receive a like fair , generous , and equal treatment during their residence therein they conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof : And that the public teaching shall , in general , respect the sciences : And that the sectarian differences of opinions shall not make any part of the public and classical instruction ; although all religious controversies may be studied freely , examined , and explained by the President , professors , and tutors , in a personal , separate , and distinct manner , to the youth of any or each denomination : And , above all , a constant regard shall be paid to , and effectual care taken of , the morals of the college . The statutes of the college have been framed from time to time in accordance with the spirit of this charter . So long ago as 1783 , those students who regularly observed the seventh day as the Sabbath , were exempted from the operation of the law which required every student , as a moral duty , to attend public worship on the first day of the week . Those who statedly attended the Friends meeting were expressly " permitted to wear their hats within the college walls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were formally exempted from the operation of the law which commanded , on penalty of expulsion , that no student should deny the divine author ity of the Old and New Testaments . And yet more , in /z/ 1770 , the corporation of the college declared , as appears from the records , that " the children of Jews may be ad mitted into this institution , and entirely enjoy the free dom of their own religion , without any constraint or impo sition whatever . " These provisions of the charter , and of the statutes of the college , manifest , says a distinguished writer , a " delicate regard for the rights of conscience , for which , it is believed , hardly a parallel can be found in the history of similar institutions . " And to " this liberal and catholic institution " the youth of all religious denominations have freely resorted , during the first century of its existence , for their education . Not a few of the prominent religious teachers and theologians connected with our various Christian sects or societies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the revivals with which the college or university has , from its beginning , been graciously visited . We close this chapter with the following extract from Backus s Church History of New England . Were the work generally accessible to the reading public , a mere reference might answer our purpose ; which is , to remove , as far as possible , all doubts in regard to the origin of this venerable seat of learning . It is , as will be seen , a brief recapitulation of the leading facts in the early history of the college , and serves to establish and confirm the state ments already presented . The accuracy of Backus as an historian has never , we believe , been questioned . Ban croft awards to him the highest praise . Being in the prime and vigor of life when the college was established , and one of the first Trustees , he was , of course , familiar with all the facts pertaining to its origin and early progress . /z/ " The uppermost party among Christians have ever had the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as other men of supe rior learning , until very lately . Even in 1780 , no ministers but Congrega tional ministers were allowed to be Overseers of the University at Cam bridge , by the Massachusetts constitution of government . And great sums have been given to that University by the government , from time to time , ever since it began in 1638 . But as Providence and Rhode Island Colony was planted by men who were banished from the Massachusetts , because they conscientiously dissented from the use of force in religious affairs , and that colony suffered amazingly from neighbor colonies for more than an hundred years , the people have grown up with great preju dices against colleges , and against obeying the laws of Christ for the sup port of his ministers . Bat as a minister hath died this year ( Dr. Man ning ) who has done much towards removing those prejudices , I shall give a concise account of the affair . Mr. Isaac Eaton , who was pastor of the Baptist Church at Hopewell in New Jersey from 1748 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth for the ministry , as well as for other callings , in 1756 , and kept it for eleven years . One of his scholars was Mr. James Manning , who went from his school to the college at Princeton , where he took his first degree in September , 1762 . And as the Philadel phia Association were for erecting a college in Khode Island Government , they fixed their eyes upon him as a proper leader in the affair . He there fore called in at Newport , on his voyage to Halifax , in July , 1763 , and proposed the matter to a number of Baptist gentlemen , who readily con curred therewith ; and as they had a high opinion of a learned Congrega tional minister among them , they desired him to make a draught of a charter for a college in that Government . It was proposed to take in some members of the several denominations among them , but that the Baptists should always be the majority of the corporation . He drew a charter , which appeared to be upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but a Baptist gentleman discerned that there was a door left open for the Congregational denomination to become the majority here after . Therefore the charter was not then passed into a law ; and when their legislature met again , the charter was not to be found . When this was heard of at Philadelphia , two gentlemen were sent from thence , who assisted in drawing a new charter , which was established by the legisla ture of Rhode Island , in February , 1764.

THE first meeting of the " Corporation for founding and endowing a College or University within the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England in America , " was held at Newport , on the first Wednes day in September , 1764 . From this point , therefore , the commencement of the college properly dates . At this meeting the following gentlemen , twenty-four in number , as appears from the records , were present , and qualified themselves by taking the oath prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hon.

Stephen Hopkins , Esq. , was chosen chancellor , John Tillinghast , Esq. , treasurer , and Dr. Thomas Eyres , secretary . The form of a certificate , authorizing persons to receive donations for the college , was adopted , and also the form of a receipt therefor . A " Pre amble " was adopted , setting forth the nature and design of the institution , and its need of funds . Committees to re ceive subscriptions for the college were appointed through out Rhode Island , in the southern and western parts of the continent , and in the States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a seal for the use of the corporation , and to assist in digest ing and recording the proceedings of the meeting . It is interesting , in this connection , to observe the char acter of the men , who , a century ago , met for the first time , as a corporate body , to transact business for the col lege . Of the four religious denominations recognized in the charter , the Congregationalists were represented by Dr. Ephraim Bowen , one of the most distinguished physi cians in Providence previous to the Revolutionary War . To him , Lieut . Gov . Arnold , in his History of Rhode Island , ascribes the peculiar honor of originating a patriotic order , composed of the gentler sex , known as the " Daughters of Liberty . " The Episcopalians were represented by Gov governor Joseph Wanton and Hon. James Honeyman , both residents of Newport , and gentlemen of culture , wealth , and high social position . The former was first elected /z/ Governor in the year 1769 . He continued to fill the office from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was suspended by the General Assembly for disloyalty . Mr. Honeyman was the son of the Rev. James Honeyman , Rector of Trinity Church , Newport . He was an able lawyer and a prominent politician , filling many high offices in the State . For many years he was Advocate General of the Court of Vice Admiralty for the colony , having been appointed to this office by the British Government . The Quakers or Friends were represented by the Hon. Stephen Hopkins , John G. Wanton , Edward Thurston , and Nicho las Easton . No name is more prominent in the history of this period than that of Hopkins , and few men of any period have exerted so wide an influence upon the desti nies of the country . For nearly forty-five years , as chief justice , governor , member of Congress , legislator , or repre sentative , he was engaged in some kind of official duty connected with the town , the State , or the national Con congress . His name appears among the signers of the Decla ration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he was elected at this first meeting , he held until his death , in 1785 , a period of twenty-one years . He was a warm personal friend of President Man ning , and , by his extensive learning and genuine love of literature , proved a most efficient coadjutor in all the plans and efforts of the latter for the efficiency and usefulness of the college . Mr. Wanton was an opulent merchant of Newport , and was allied by blood and affinity with the wealthiest and most popular families in the colony . The name of Nicholas Easton appears in Arnold s History of Rhode Island , as a member of the General Assembly from Middletown , in the year 1776 . He was probably a de scendant of Governors Nicholas and John Easton . Of /z/ Thurston we have been unable to ascertain anything defi nite . He was a trustee , as appears from the Triennial Catalogue , until the year 1782 . The remaining seventeen members of the corporation were Baptists , or , as they are also designated in the charter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Newport , Warren , Westerly , and Boston . Among them we notice Samuel Ward , the popular Governor of Rhode Island during the years 1762 , 1765 , and 1766 , a Justice also of the Supreme Court , and one of the most influential mem bers of the First Congress , in 1774 ( his Life , written by Prof. Gammell , is published in Spark s American Biog raphy ) ; Judge Daniel Jenckes , a brief sketch of whom has already been given in connection with the history of the college charter ; Josias Lyndon , who , in 1768 , was elected Governor , by an overwhelming majority of nearly fifteen hundred ; Nicholas Brown , the distinguished mer chant and liberal benefactor of the college , and also father of the Hon. Nicholas Brown , after whom the institution was finally named ; Rev. Edward Upham , pastor of the First Church at Newport , and a graduate of Harvard College , in the class of 1734 ; Rev. Gardner Thurston , an intimate friend and associate of Dr. Stiles ; Rev. Jeremiah Condy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the class of 1721 ; Dr. Joshua Babcock , of Westerly , who , in 1775 , was appointed a major-general of the Rhode Island militia , and who also held various public offices of respon sibility and trust ; and Dr. Thomas Eyres , of Newport , who held the office of secretary of the corporation until the breaking out of the Revolutionary War . In the records of subsequent meetings of the corporation , previous to the removal of the college to Providence , we find among the Baptist members the names also of Rev. /z/ Morgan Edwards of Philadelphia , Rev. Hezekiah Smith of Haverhill , Rev. Samuel Stillman of Boston , Rev. John Gano of New York , Rev. Isaac Backus of Middleborough , Rev. John Davis of Boston , Rev. Russell Mason of Swanzey , Nathan Spear of Boston , Sylvester Child of Warren , and Joseph , brother of Nicholas Brown , of Providence . Among the Episcopal members we find the names of Rev. George Bisset of Newport , Joseph Russell and George Hazard Esquires . The last named was mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the State Legisla ture . Among the Quakers , Jonathan Easton , a physician . Among the Congregationalists , Nicholas Cook , for several years Governor of the colony , and Jabez Bowen , LL.D. , Deputy Governor . The latter succeeded Gov . Hopkins as chancellor of the college . , During the spring previous to this first meeting of the corporation , Manning had removed with his family to Warren , a pleasant town in Bristol County , R. I. , about ten miles from Providence . Here he at once opened a Latin school , with an ultimate view to the commencement of college instruction . This school , which soon became flourishing , he continued to teach or superintend for many years , in connection with his professional duties and callino- . It was removed to Providence in 1770 , and , upon /z/ the completion of " University Hall , " to rooms in that building . In 1810 , a brick house for its accommodation was erected by the friends of the college , under the direc tion of a committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Thomas Lloyd Halsey . It is now called the " University Grammar School , " and is taught by Messrs . Merrick and Emory Lyon , they having the entire responsibility of its management . This school has ever been an efficient auxiliary to the college or uni versity. /z/ At the time of Manning s arrival in Warren , there were nearly sixty Baptist communicants residing in that town , the majority of whom were members of the venerable church in Swanzey . The population of the village was then rapidly increasing , and the time seemed to have ar rived when they could best secure their religious interests by forming themselves into a separate and independent body , instead of being considered as a branch of the mother church . It was this fact , perhaps , which determined the first location of the college . Without funds it could not , of course , in its feeble beginning , support itself . It seemed therefore desirable to connect it with some church , over which its President should be pastor , that he might there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time and circumstances pointed to Warren as the place for this design , and accordingly Manning set tled himself here , 1 and , while engaged in teaching , employed also a portion of his time in preaching to the people the gospel . His zeal and eloquence soon attracted a numerous congregation . The fruits of his ministry were apparent , and not a few persons became believers in Christ and were baptized . On the 15th day of November , 1764 , a church of fifty-eight members was duly organized and constituted . By previous appointment , they had engaged the Rev. John Gano of New York , the Rev. Gardner Thurston of New port , and the Rev. Ebenezer Hinds of Middleborough , Mass. , to assist in the proposed undertaking . The day 1 In an early diary of the Rev. Dr. Hezekiab Smith , we find the following : " Saturday , April 21 , 1764 . I went to Warren ( from Newport ) with Mrs. Man ning , Esq . Coles , Capt . Wheaton , and Mr. Lillibridge . Sabbath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii . 4 , two sermons . Staid in Warren till Wednesday , 25th , at Esq . Coles s . " Mr. Smith , it appears , with Mr. and Mrs. Manning , left New York for New port , Wednesday , April 11 . They reached Newport on the 13th. when Mr. Man ning proceeded at once to Warren . /z/ being kept in the solemn exercise of fasting and prayer , " in the forenoon , " says the record , " Mr. Thurston preached a sermon , and after a short intermission of service , the people returned , and Messrs . Gano , Manning , and Hinds each made a prayer suitable to the occasion , after which the church covenant , previously prepared by Mr. Manning , was presented and read . " This covenant , the original of which , in Manning s hand writing , is still in existence , we here present , as follows : /z/ Whereas we , unworthy sinners , through the infinite riches of free grace , as we trust , brought out of darkness into the marvellous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transformed into the kingdom of God s dear Son Jesus Christ our only Lord and Saviour , and made partakers of all those privileges which Christ purchased with his precious blood , think it our duty , and the greatest privilege we can enjoy here on earth , to walk in all the commandments and ordinances , not only for our own comfort and peace , but for the manifestation of the glory of God and for the mu tual help and society of each other ; and as it hath pleased God to appoint a visible church relation , to be the way and manner whereby he is pleased to communicate to his people the blessings of his presence , a growth in grace , and furtherance in the knowledge of our Lord God We , therefore , this day , after solemn fasting and prayer for help and direction , in the fear of His holy name , and with hearts lifted up to the most high God , humbly and freely offer up ourselves a living sacrifice unto him who is our God , in covenant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed word , in visible gospel relation , both to Christ our only head and to each other as fellow-members and brethren of the same household of faith . And we do humbly engage , that , through His strength , we will endeavor to perform all our respective duties towards God and each other , and to practise all the ordinances of Christ , according to what is and shall be made known to us in our respective places ; to exercise , practise , and submit to the government of Christ in this church . And we declare that it is our mind that none are properly qualified /z/ members of this Christ s visible church but such as have been wrought upon by the grace of God , delivered from their sins by the justifying right eousness of Christ , have the evidence of it in their souls , have made profession thereof , that is , of a living faith in Christ , and have been baptized , by immersion , in the name of the Holy Trinity . Further , it is our mind that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not essential to church communion , and that where the image of Christ is discerned , according to the rules of God s word , and those previous duties but now mentioned are submitted to ac cording to gospel rules , we arc ready to hold communion with all such walking orderly in the church of Christ . And now we humbly hope , that , although of ourselves we are altogether unworthy and unfit thus to offer up ourselves to God , or to do him any service , or to expect any favor or mercy from him , yet that he will gra ciously accept of this our freewill offering , in and through the merits and mediation of our dear Redeemer , and that he will employ and improve us in his service to his own praise , to whom be all the glory , both now and forever . After the members had signed the foregoing covenant , " they were asked , " continues the record , " by the Rev. Mr. Manning , whether they , in the presence of that assem bly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a church relation , which question was answered by them all in the affirmative , standing up ; after which , three of the brethren , Samuel Hix , Amos Haile , and John Coomer , in behalf of the church , presented a call , previously prepared by the brethren , to the Rev. James Manning to become their pastor . The call was read publicly by the Rev , Mr. Gano , after which , he asked the Rev. James Man ning if he accepted it , which was answered in the affirma tive . " Then Mr. Gano preached a sermon , suitable to the occasion , in which he reminded both pastor and people of their respective duties , and urged the mutual performance of both , from those important motives which the nature of /z/ the relation requires . Thus ended the solemnities of the day . " The relations which Manning now assumed proved alike pleasant and profitable to pastor and flock . During the six years of his ministry in Warren , the church greatly increased in numbers and strength , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the corporation , held in New port , on the first Wednesday in September , 1765 , he was formally appointed " President of the College , Professor of Languages , and other branches of learning , with full power to act in these capacities at Warren , or elsewhere . " This is the language of the record , which , as has been playfully remarked , " though not obnoxious to the charge of legal precision , seems to imply , on the part of the cor poration , no want of confidence in the variety of the Pres ident s attainments . " A letter addressed by Backus to the Rev. Dr. Gill , of London , an extract from which we here present , illustrates Manning s position at this time , as a pioneer in introducing polite literature or learning among the Baptists of New England : One grand objection made use of against believers baptism , has been that none but ignorant and illiterate men have embraced the Baptist sen timents . And there was so much color for it as this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist ministers ( Jeremiah Condy of Boston , and Edward Up ham of Newport ) in all New England who had what is called a liberal education ; and they were not clear in the doctrines of grace . But three others have lately come from the Southern govern ments ; namely , Mr. Samuel Stillman , who is settled in Boston ; Mr. Hezekiah Smith , who has had remarkable success at Haverhill , where he has gathered a large society ; and Mr. James Manning , who is settled at Warren , R. I. And as the Baptists have met with a great deal of abuse from those who are called learned men in our land , they have been not a little prejudiced against learning itself ; but , latterly , there /z/ has been considerable alteration in this respect . A charter was ob tained from the General Assembly of Rhode Island in February , 1764 , incorporating a number of Trustees and Fellows , for founding and en dowing a college for the education of youth ( of which you will be likely to hear more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their annual meeting , last September , chose the aforesaid Mr. Manning President . He has commenced a school , which appears in a likely way to increase fast . But as there are scarce any books suitable for such business to be sold in that colony , he has thought of sending to London for a quantity ; and as he is unknown there , he requested that I would write a few lines in his favor . Therefore , my dear sir , if my poor testimony may be thought worthy of any notice , I desire that you would mention to Mr. Keith , to whom he has thoughts of sending , that , from near two years acquaintance with him , I am well satisfied that he is a man of piety , integrity , and ability , who will make conscience of fulfilling his engagements . I remain , sir , your humble servant , /z/ It was about this time that Manning conceived the plan of uniting the churches of New England on some common basis , in order to promote their harmony and growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the " Standing Order " in Massachusetts and Connecticut , and especially to disarm his brethren of all existing prejudices against human learning , and thereby effectually advance the interests of the college . The undertaking was one of no ordinary magnitude . The government of Baptist churches had been from time immemorial , as now , of the independent form , each particular church having an ex clusive right of jurisdiction over its own members , elect ing and dismissing its own officers , and transacting all its business by final issue within itself , without appeal to any power on earth , either civil or ecclesiastical . With the Baptist churches of New England , especially , it had long been an article of belief , that civil government , although desirable and necessary for civil purposes , has nothing to /z/ do with Christ s kingdom , which is spiritual and not of this world , and has nothing to do with the visible church , which is subject to Jesus Christ alone as the head thereof . Hence they regarded all synods , conventions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of particular churches , inflict censure , form platforms , and prepare articles of frith , as useless and unfriendly to the independency of the churches ; as having more or less re spect to the civil state , and therefore partaking too much of the carnal wisdom of this world . They had suffered too much from measures adopted at these meetings among the Congregational ministers of Massachusetts and Con necticut to be easily persuaded to meet in any association , even though it were upon a plan altogether different from the associations and conventions in New England . It is true that at a former period the Baptists had been united in some kind of an organization . Knight , in his History of the Six-Principle Baptists , whose sentiments generally prevailed in the early history of Rhode Island , says , " The churches of Providence , Newport , Swanzey , and North Kingston , about the close of the seventeenth century , uni ted in a yearly meeting composed of elders , messengers , " etc . Comer , who was a decided advocate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manuscript diary gives an account of this meeting in 1729 . Callender , also , in his Historical Discourse , alludes to the same meeting or asso ciation . We have before us now a letter printed in 1741 , from sundry persons in Newport , addressed to the " several Baptist churches in New England , that are , or have been , united in the general meetings usually held at Providence , Swanzey , " etc . In the progress of time , however , some of the Six-Principle churches which organized this meeting became extinct , others ceased to maintain their peculiar /z/ sentiments , and it was gradually , by most of the regular Baptist churches , at the period of which we are now speak ing , abandoned . It was Manning s wish to unite all the churches of his faith and order in New England in an association similar to the one formed in Philadelphia , which was simply advi sory in its character , having respect to the advancement of the Redeemer s kingdom by spreading through the churches an account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to the members of his own church , who cordially seconded his views , as appears from a formal vote on the subject , which we find recorded under date of August 28 , 1766 . He also conferred with his brethren in the ministry , who were occasionally at his house . 1 Let ters of invitation were accordingly sent out , and on the 8th of September , 1767 , a meeting of pastors and delegates from the principal Baptist churches in Massachusetts and Rhode Island met at Warren . Hence the origin of the Warren Association , the first organization of the kind in New England , and , according to Benedict , the sixth in America . The Rev. Isaac Backus , of Middleborough , who was chosen clerk of this meeting , thus commences the minutes : " Whereas there hath of late been a great increase of Baptist churches in New England , which yet have not such an acquaintance with each other and orderly union together as ought to be , it has been thought by many that a general meeting or association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to promote the general good of the churches . There- i Mr. Manning , it seems , also visited the pastors and churches in person , and conferred with them on the subject . From the diary to which we have already referred , we learn , for instance , that he visited the Rev. Hezekiah Smith , Tuesday , April 15 , 1766 , and stopped until Thursday , preaching both days in his meeting house . On Monday , April 21 , Mr. Smith set out for Rhode Island , joining Mr. /z/ fore a number of ciders , being occasionally together last year , did appoint a meeting at Warren , in Rhode Island Colony , on Sept. 8 , 1767 ; and sent an invitation to others of their brethren to meet them there , to confer upon these affairs . Accordingly a considerable number of elders and brethren met at the time and place appointed ; and Elder John Gano , from New York , opened the meeting with a suitable sermon , from Acts xv . 9 . " Eleven churches were represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; namely , Warren Rev. James Manning , and brethren Benjamin Cole and Daniel Brown ; Second , Rehoboth Rev. Richard Round , and brethren Samuel Bullock and Daniel Bullock ; Haverhill Rev. Hezekiah Smith , and brethren Jacob Whittier and Jonathan Shepard ; Norton Rev. William Carpenter ; Bellingharn Rev. Noah Alden ; First , Middleborough Rev. Isaac Backus ; Second , Middleborough Rev. Ebenezer Hinds ; Cumberland Rev. Daniel Miller ; First , Bos ton Dea . Josiah Colburn ; Second , Boston Brother Philip Freeman ; Attleborough brethren Abraham Bloss and Joseph Guild . There were also present from the Philadelphia Association , Rev. Messrs . John Gano , Abel Griffith , and Noah Hammond . Mr. Gano was chosen mod erator , and , after looking to Heaven for guidance and direc tion , they proceeded to the business before them . The occasion , as we may well suppose , was one of unusual inter est . The Philadelphia Association , having been informed of the proposed meeting by President Manning , sent them the following timely letter , written by the Rev. Dr. Samuel Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Newport until Saturday , May 8th , a little more than two weeks , spending most of his time with Manning . On Monday , Aug. 4 , of this same year , Mr. Smith again visited Warren , stopping until Friday with his friend and classmate . On Wednesday , Nov. 12th , Mr. Manning was in Haverhill , and gave the charge at Mr. Smith s ordination . /z/ The Elders and Messengers of the several Baptist churches met in Associa tion at Philadelphia , the 14th , 5th , and 16th days of October , 17CG . To the Elders and Messengers of the several Baptist Churches of the same faith and order , to meet in Association at Warren , in the Colony of Rhode Island , the 8th day of September , 1767 , send greeting . DEARLY BELOVED BRETHREN : When we understood that you had concluded to meet at the time and place above mentioned , with a view to lay the foundation stone of an associational building , it gave us peculiar joy , in that it opened to our view a prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this our address to you premature , because as yet you have only an ideal being , as a body by appointment . But if you should call this our forwardness blind zeal , we are still in hopes you will not forget that our embracing the first opportunity of commencing Chris tian fellowship and acquaintance with you , affords the strongest evidence of our approbation of your present meeting , and how fond we should be of mutual correspondence between us in this way . A long course of experience and observation has taught us to have the highest sense of the advantages which accrue from associations ; nor in deed does the nature or thing speak any other language . For , as particu lar members are collected together and united in one body , which ye call a particular church , to answer those ends and purposes which could not be accomplished by any single member , so a collection and union of churches into one associational body may easily be conceived capable of answering those still greater purposes which any particular church could not be equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations will still increase the body in weight and strength , and make it good that a threefold cord is not easily broken . Great , dear brethren , is the design of your meeting ; great is the work which lies before you . You will need the guidance and influence of the Divine Spirit , as well as the exertion of all prudence and wisdom . It is therefore our most ardent prayer that you may meet in love , that peace and unanimity may subsist among you during your consultations , that you may be animated with zeal for the glory of God , and directed to ad vise and determine what may most conduce to promote the Redeemer s kingdom . From considering the divided state of our Baptist churches in your /z/ quarter , we foresee that difficulties may arise , such as may call for the exercise of the greatest tenderness and moderation , that if haply , through the blessing of God on your endeavors , those lesser differences may sub side , and a more general union commence . As touching our consultations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a printed copy whereof we shall herewith enclose ) will in form you ; and if in anything further you should be desirous of informa tion with regard to us , we refer you to our reverend and beloved brethren Morgan Edwards , John Gano , and Samuel Jones , who , as our representa tive delegates , will present you with this our letter , and whom we rec ommend to Christian fellowship with you . And now , dear brethren , farewell . May the Lord bless and direct you in all things , and grant that we may all hereafter form one general as sembly at his right hand , through infinite riches of free grace in Christ Jesus our Lord . Signed by order and in behalf of the Association , by BENJAMIN MILLER , Moderator . SAMUEL JONES , Cleric . Neither Edwards nor Jones was present at this meeting , but , in their stead , Messrs . Griffith and Hammond , as has already been stated . Although the delegates in attendance " generally manifested , " says Backus , " a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the churches , most of them thought they were not prepared to join in an association . " The pastors and messengers of but four were ready at this time to unite ; namely , Warren , Haverhill , Bellingham , and Second Middleborough . The other delegates present seem to have hesitated , through fear of some usurpation of authority by the associated body over the particular churches composing it ; an evil which they were determined , if possible , to avoid . Besides , they were not altogether satisfied with the plan of organization and action now adopted . This plan was substantially that of the Philadelphia Association , and was thought to give /z/ undue authority to the united body . It was , however , soon after so explained and amended as to be less objec tionable . At the second meeting , also held in Warren , the churches of Sutton , Leicester , and Ware , and the First Church in Boston , over which the Rev. Dr. Stillman had recently been settled , joined the Association , thus swelling the number to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stelle , of New Jersey , both warm personal friends of Manning , were present upon this occasion , as del egates from the parent body at Philadelphia . In 1769 , the churches of Sturbridge , Enfield , Wilbraharn , and Montague joined the Association . At this meeting the following sen timents and plan , drawn up by President Manning , were adopted as a final basis for organization and action . /z/ 1 . That such a combination of churches is not only prudent , but useful , as has appeared even in America by the experience of upwards of sixty years . Some of the uses of it arc , union and communion among them selves ; maintaining more effectually the order and faith once delivered to the saints ; having advice in cases of doubt , and help in distress ; being more able to promote the good of the cause , and becoming important in the eye of the civil powers , as has already appeared in many instances on this continent . 2 . That such an association is consistent with the inde pendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no other than an advisory council , utterly disclaiming superiority , jurisdiction , coercive right , and infallibility. 3 . That an association should consist of men knowing an.d judicious , particularly in the Scriptures . The reasons are obvious : such men are the fittest to represent communities who profess the Scriptures to be the only rule of faith and practice in religious matters , and who expect that every advice , opinion , or direction they receive from an association be Scriptural . They should be skilled and expert in the laws of their God , as counsellors are in the laws of the land ; for that is the ground of the church s application to them . /z/ 1 . The Association to consist only of messengers chosen and sent by the churches . These messengers to be their ministers ( for a reason given in sentiment 3 ) , together with some judicious brethren . Their expenses to be borne by the churches which send them . 2 . With the messengers the churches send letters addressed to the As sociation . In these letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act for their churches ; also of the state of the churches touch ing their peace ; their increase by baptism , and by letters dismissive and commendatory from other churches ; touching their diminution by death , excommunication , and dismission to other churches , and the present number of members . If any questions are to be put to the Association , any advice to ask , or business to propose , these are to be expressed in said letters . 3 . All matters to be determined in this Association by the suffrage of the messengers , except what are detcrminable by Scripture : such matters are never put to the decision of votes . All that speak are to address the moderator , who is to take care that none be interrupted while speaking , and that no other indecorum take place , 4 . Churches are to be received into this Association by petitions setting forth their desire to be admitted , their faith , order , and willingness to be conformable to the rules of the associated body . When a petition is read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderator states the question . Suffrage being given in favor of the petition , the said moderator declares that such a church is received into the Association , in token of Avhich he gives the messengers the right hand of fellowship , and bids them take their seats . 5 . The Association to meet annually , at Warren , on Tuesday next after the first Wednesday in September , 1 at two o clock in the afternoon , and to continue till business be finished . It is to be opened with divine service : after which a moderator and clerk are chosen ; the letters from the churches are read ; the names of the messengers are written , that they may 1 " And as the annual Commencement at our college is on the first Wednesday in September , and some who come to it from a distance would desire to attend the Association also , it was appointed to be on the Tuesday after the Commence ment .

III. , p. 113. ) /z/ be called over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes thereof made ; a circular letter to the churches is prepared and signed , and a copy of it sent to every church , containing the minutes of the Asso ciation , the state of the churches , when and by Avhom vacancies are to be supplied , who is to preach the next Association sermon , and whatever else is needful for the churches to know . 6 . A connection to be formed and maintained between this Association and that of Philadelphia , by annual letter and messengers from us to them and from them to us. 7 . The faith and order of this Association are expressed in a confession put forth by upwards of a hundred congregations in Great Britain , in the year 1689 , and adopted by the Association of Philadelphia in 1742 . Some of the principles in said confession are : The imputation of Adam s sin to his posterity ; the inability of man to recover himself ; effectual calling by sovereign grace ; justification by imputed righteousness ; immersion for baptism , and that on profession of faith and repentance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon evidence of sound conversion , etc . The meeting this year ( 17G9 ) was rendered unusually interesting by the presence , as messengers from the Phila delphia Association , of Rev. Messrs . Morgan Edwards ( who had but recently returned from England and Ireland on his mission in behalf of the college ) , Samuel Jones , and John Davis . " Many of the letters from the churches , " says Backus , " mentioned grievous oppressions and perse cutions from the standing order , especially the one from Ashfield , where religious tyranny had been carried to great lengths . " Whereupon petitions to the General Courts of Massachusetts and Connecticut for redress were prepared , by a committee of seven , of which the Rev. John Davis acted as chairman . The same having been read and approved , Messrs . Samuel Stillman , Philip Freeman , Philip Freeman Jr. , John Proctor , and Nathan S. Spear , all of Boston , were chosen a committee to present them . The following proposal and plan to collect grievances , /z/ which we copy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meeting and approved : " Whereas , complaints of oppressions occasioned by a non-conformity to the religious establishment in New England have been brought to this Association ; and whereas the laws obtained for preventing and redressing such oppressions have , upon trial , been found insufficient ( either through defect in the laws themselves or iniquity in the execution thereof ) ; and whereas humble remonstrances and petitions have not been duly regarded , but the same oppressive measures continue : This is to inform all the oppressed Baptists in New England that the Association of Warren ( in conjunction with the Western or Philadelphia Association ) is determined to seek remedy for their brethren where a speedy and effectual one may be had . In order to pursue this resolution by petition and memorial , the following gentlemen are appointed to receive well-attested grievances , to be by them transmitted to the Rev. Samuel Stillman of Boston ; namely , Rev. Hezekiah Smith of HaverhilJ , Rev. Isaac Backus of Middleborough , Mr. Richard Montague of Sunderland , Rev. Joseph Meacham of Enfield , and Rev. Thomas Whitman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Baptists in behalf of civil and religious freedom , through the agency of the Warren Association , will be further illustrated in successive chap ters of our present work . Those who may wish to consult fuller and more detailed accounts , are referred to Backus s Church History of New England , and especially to Prof. Hovey s Memoir of the Life and Times of Backus . Gradually the Association won the confidence of the denomination , until in a few years it had extended over New England . By its means mutual acquaintance and harmony were promoted ; the weak and the oppressed were relieved ; errors in doctrine and in practice were ex posed and guarded against ; warnings against false teach ers in religion were published ; feeble and destitute flocks were provided with preachers ; the college was materially /z/ aided and strengthened ; students were encouraged to study for the ministry , and the gospel was preached in the wilderness . During the period of the Revolution it presented able addresses in behalf of civil and religious freedom to the Governments of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although , says Arnold , in his History of Rhode Island , it no longer has that intimate connection with the University which at first existed , and the growth of Baptist churches in New England has given rise to numerous other associations of a similar character , the parent body still continues to ex ert a widespread and beneficent influence over the objects of its charge . The Minutes l of the Association show that Manning , during the whole period of his connection with it , was one of its most prominent and useful members . By his coun sels and personal influence he first called it into being . As has already been stated , he drew up the plan of its organ ization . In the years 1776 , 1781 , 1784 , and 1787 , he pre sided over its deliberations as moderator . In 1778 and in 1787 he preached the introductory sermon . In 1785 he made the opening prayer . From year to year we find his name on various important committees . He was likewise prominent as a member of the Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , to attend its sessions , although thereby subjected to great 1 The manuscript minutes of the first four meetings of the Warren Association are among the Backus papers , from which they have been carefully copied by the Rev.

The Minutes were first printed in the year 1771 , since which time they have been published with out interruption down to the present date .

To the sev eral churches they represent , greeting . DEAR BRETHREN : We have had the pleasure of meeting your repre sentatives at the Association , whp in general have brought us good news from the churches . We rejoice to see that the Son of man is pleased to walk in the midst of his golden candlesticks , the churches , to dispense his blessings to his people , and to attend the word of the kingdom with di vine power to the salvation of sinners . Come ! help us to magnify the Lord for his unspeakable mercy and goodness ! Yet we find that the en emies of truth are busily employed in endeavoring to subvert it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of God . Brethren , Ave sympathize with you under your afflictions , while we call to mind the declaration of your ascended Head to his beloved flock whom he left be hind , In the world ye shall have tribulation . Yet how refreshing is what follows , But be of good cheer , I have overcome the world . Those who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution . Let not the powers of the world , who set themselves to oppose , discourage you . Search for the mind of Christ in his word ; which being discovered , pay a sacred regard thereto . Call no man master on earth ; and remember that the followers of Christ carry their cross in imitation of their Divine Master . Brethren , suffer us , however , to beseech you to use all proper means to obtain relief from the burdens imposed upon you , by taking heed to the general plan which we as a body propose to pursue . But while you attend to human means , let your cries be incessant to Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppress . Pray for those who despitefully use you . Remember that /z/ love enters deeply into the spirit of our holy religion ; and that the glorious Founder thereof has given us the most striking example of it in living and dying for his enemies . Walk soberly and inoffensively toward those without ; and let your conduct prove that it is the power of truth , the force of conscience , that makes you Baptists , and not an affectation of singularity . And as you are persuaded that you have been taught by the Spirit of God , so let your light shine before others that you may win them to the truth . In the meantime , carefully guard against any designs to ensnare you , or to engage you in any combination with them that may eventually prove to the detriment of the cause . Finally , may the Lord Jesus afford you his presence , and bless you with abundant increase in all grace , to the glory of his great name . Signed by order and in behalf of the Association . HEZEKIAH SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Manning , of which we have any knowledge , is the following , addressed to David Howell , a student about to graduate from the College of New Jersey : SIR : I some time ago received a line from you by Mr. Stelle , in which you requested my advice relative to your destination when you have done with college . I was glad to find that you had not yet determined upon any place or employment , because I was desirous that you should make a visit to these parts before your settlement . But to give advice , without having some prospect of advantage , I should think imprudent ; and indeed the matter is important , for if it should not succeed according to your wishes , you might entertain hard thoughts of me . However , at present it appears to me that you can not do better than to visit Rhode Island . The success Mr. Stelle has met with encourages me . He has a Latin school in the town of Providence of nearly twenty scholars , and may have more if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gives good satisfaction , and is much esteemed by the gentlemen of the town . I thought when he came here that he would much more readily have found employ in Newport ; and although the people there were for making the attempt , yet he chose first to see Providence , whjfher I accom- /z/ panied him . They would not , however , consent that he should go buck , but immediately employed him ; so that if you are disposed to keep a school , I imagine one may easily be obtained in Newport . I would gladly invite you to come and live in my family , if the infant state of our college could promise you proper encouragement ; but at present it is hardly to be expected , although in the revolution of a year it will doubtless need more help . Upon the whole , I think if I were in your circumstances , as near as I can judge , I should come ; and I would advise you to see me before you engage anywhere . A taste for learning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give you a more particular account of matters in these parts , as he will be with you at Commencement ; and if you can get your affairs in readiness , he will be your company over . After telling you my family is well , as also your friend Stites , etc. , I bid you farewell , wishing you the best blessings of heaven , and that I may have the pleasure of waiting upon Mr. Howell at the house of Sir , your humble servant , /z/ WARREN , July 14 , 1766 . Agreeably to President Manning s advice , Mr. Howell came to Warren , and was at once associated with him as tutor in the college . In 1769 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy , which position he occupied until the breaking up of the college in con sequence of the Re volution ary War . In addition to the regular studies of his professorship , he taught the French , German , and Hebrew languages . For thirty-four years he was Professor of Law , although he never delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was fifty-two years a member of the Board of Fellows , and for many years was secretary of the corporation . He was thus intimately connected with the college during a large portion of his protracted life . On several occasions , after President Manning s decease , he presided at the college Commencements , and delivered to the graduating /z/ classes Baccalaureate addresses , which were greatly ad mired . He practised law in Providence for many years , and was regarded as the leading member of the Rhode Island bar . Under the Confederation , he was a member of Congress , and he subsequently filled , with great ability , several high offices , civil and judicial . In 1812 , he was appointed United States Judge for the District of Rhode Island , and this office he sustained until his death , in 1824 . " Judge Howell , " says Prof. Goddard , " was endowed with extraordinary talents , and he superadded to his endow ments extensive and accurate learning . As an able jurist , he established for himself a solid reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen and brilliant wit , and as a scholar extensively acquainted not only with the ancient , but with several of the modern languages . As a pungent and effective political writer , he was almost unrivalled ; and in conversation , whatever chanced to be the therne , whether politics or law , literature or theology , grammar or criticism , a Greek tragedy or a difficult prob lem in mathematics , he was never found wanting . Upon all occasions which made any demands upon him , he gave the most convincing evidence of the vigor of his powers , and of the variety and extent of his erudition . " To all this may be added extraordinary physical powers , and a majestic , dignified presence . Such was the intimate friend and early academical associate of Manning . The first Commencement of the college was held in the meeting-house at Warren , on the 7th of September , 1769 . Four years had elapsed since the President , with a solitary pupil , 1 commenced his collegiate duties as an instructor . 1 It is stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , and for several days the only student of Rhode Island College . He was then a mere lad of fourteen . Indeed , the entire Freshman Class of 1765-6 consisted of but three students . /z/ Through toils , and difficulties , and opposition , he had qui etly persevered in his work , until the seminary under his care had won its way to public favor . And now his first pupils were about to take their Bachelor s degree in the Arts , and to go forth to the duties of life . They were young men of promise . Some of them were destined to fill conspicuous places in the approaching struggle for in dependence ; others were to be leaders in the church , and distinguished educators of youth . Probably no class that has gone forth from the University , in her palmiest days of prosperity , has exerted so widely extended and bene ficial an influence , the times and circumstances taken into consideration , as this first class of seven that graduated at Warren . The occasion drew together a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaugurating the earliest State holiday in the history of Rhode Island . " And as each recurring anniversary of this time-honored institution of learning calls together from distant places the widely-scattered alumni of Brown University , we do but renew , on a more extended scale , the congratulations that crowned this earliest festival . " 1 The performances of the day excited universal admiration . " We can readily imagine , " says a writer , 2 " how the beautiful and benevo lent face of President Manning was radiant with smiles on this occasion ; with what joy he beheld the first fruits of his anxieties , and labors , and prayers ; with what glowing eloquence he poured forth , at the throne of grace , the pious effusions of a grateful heart , invoking the blessing of God upon the future efforts of the friends of the infant /z/ institution , and filling every heart with emotion , if not every eye with tears , as , with the affection of a friend and the solicitude of a father , he commended to the care of Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a period of no ordinary moment , to enter a world of temp tation and trial . " The following account of this " first Commencement , " taken from The Providence Gazette and Country Journal , needs no apology for its insertion here . It will be read with special interest by those who have attended the com mencements of a later day . /z/ On Thursday , the seventh of this instant , was celebrated at Warren the first Commencement in the college of this colony ; when the following young gentlemen commenced Bachelors of Arts ; namely , Joseph Belton , Joseph Eaton , William Rogers , Richard Stites , Charles Thompson , James Mitchel Varnum , and William Williams . About ten o clock , A. M. , the gentlemen concerned in conducting the affairs of the college , together with the candidates , went in procession to the meeting-house . After they had taken their seats respectively , and the audience were composed , the President introduced the business of the day with prayer ; then followed a salutatory oration in Latin , pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him great applause from the learned part of the assembly . He spoke upon the advantages of liberty and learning , and their mutual dependence upon each other ; concluding with proper salutations to the Chancellor of the college , Governor of the colony , etc. , particularly expressing the gratitude of all the friends of the college to the Rev. Morgan Edwards , who has encountered many difficulties in going to Europe to collect donations for the institution , and has lately returned . To which succeeded a forensic dispute , in English , on the following thesis ; namely , " The Americans , in their present circumstances , can not , consistent with good policy , affect to become an Independent State . " Mr. Varnum ingeniously defended it , by cogent arguments handsomely dressed ; /z/ though he was subtly but delicately opposed by Mr. Williams ; both of whom spoke with emphasis and propriety . As a conclusion to the exercises of the forenoon , the audience were agreeably entertained with an oration on benevolence , by Mr. Rogers ; in which , among many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that infant seminary stands in of the salutary effects of that truly Christian virtue . At three o clock , P. M. , the audience being convened , a syllogistic dis pute was introduced on this thesis : " Materia cogitare non potest , " Mr. Williams the respondent ; Messieurs Belton , Eaton , Rogers , and Varnum the opponents , in the course of which dispute , the principal arguments on both sides were produced toAvards settling that critical point . The degree of Bachelor of Arts was then conferred on the candidates . Then the following gentlemen ( graduated in other colleges ) at their own request received the honorary degree of Master in the Arts ; namely , Rev. Edward Upham , Rev. Morgan Edwards , Rev. Samuel Stillman , Rev. Hezekiah Smith , Hon. Joseph Wanton Jun . Esq. , Mr. Jabez Bowen , and Mr. David Howell , Professor of Philosophy in said college . The following gentlemen , being well recommended by the Faculty for literary merit , had conferred on them the honorary degree of Master in the Arts ; namely , Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rev. Samuel Jones , Mr. John Davis , Mr. Robert Strettlc Jones , Mr. John Stites , Rev. James Bryson , Rev. James Edwards , Rev. Wil liam Boulton , Rev. John Ryland , Rev. William Clark , Rev. Joshua Toulmin , and Rev. Caleb Evans . A concise , pertinent , and solemn charge was then given to the Bache lors by the President , concluding with his last paternal benediction , which naturally introduced the valedictory orator , Mr. Thompson , who , after some remarks upon the excellences of the oratorial art , and expressions of gratitude to the patrons and officers of the college , together with a val ediction to them , and all present , took a most affectionate leave of his classmates . The scene was tender , the subject felt , and the audience affected . The President concluded the exercises with prayer . The Avhole was conducted with a propriety and solemnity suitable to the occasion . The audience ( consisting of the principal gentlemen and ladies of this colony , and many from the neighboring governments ) , though large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , the Rev. Morgan Edwards , by particular request , /z/ preached a sermon , 1 especially addressed to the graduates and students , from Phil . iii . 8 : " Yea , doubtless , and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord ; " in which ( after high encomiums on the liberal arts and sciences ) the superior knowledge of the knowledge of Christ , or the Christian science , was clearly and fully illustrated in several striking examples and similes ; one of which follows : " When the sun is below the horizon , the stars excel in glory ; but when his orb irradiates our hemisphere , their glory dwindles , fades away , and disappears . " Not only the candidates , but even the President , were dressed in American manufactures . Finally , be it observed , that this class are the first sons of that college which has existed for more than four years ; during all which time it has labored under great disadvantages , notwithstanding the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence ; and it is hoped , from the disposition which many dis covered on that day , and other favorable circumstances , that these disad vantages will soon , in part , be happily removed . Mr. Edwards , to whose labors in behalf of the college we have already referred , set out for Europe in February , 1767 , and returned in 1769 , having been absent about two years . The amount which he obtained , and which was afterwards invested in a permanent fund for the payment of the President s salary , was 888 10s. 2d. sterling . This was truly a noble benefaction , considering the value of money at that period , and greatly encouraged the friends of the institution . The original subscription-book , contain ing the names of the subscribers in their own hand- writing , was presented to the Library in the year 1849 , by Mr. Joshua Edwards , a son of the Rev. Morgan Edwards . He was then living , being at the time upwards of eighty years of 1 The custom , thus inaugurated by Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was continued down to the beginning of Dr. Waylaud s administration in 1828 , when the " President s Levee " took the place of the " Commencement Sermon .

Among the subscribers thus obtained to the first funds of the college , we notice the names of our own coun trymen , Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin West , both re siding in London at this time ; Thomas Llewelyn , LL.D. , the distinguished Cambro-British scholar ; Samuel Roffey , Esq. , whose name appears upon the earliest records of the corporation as a benefactor of the college ; Rev. Dr. Sam uel Stennett ; Thomas Penn ; Rev. Dr. A. Gifford , for many years sub-librarian at the British Museum ; Thomas Hollis and Timothy Hollis , the well-known benefactors of Harvard College ; and Rev. Dr. Gill , author of " Exposition of the Old and New Testaments , " a work published in nine folio volumes . Mr. Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect funds . for the college , says that he " succeeded pretty well , considering how angry the mother country then was with the colonies for opposing the Stamp Act . " The following brief biographies of several members of the class , who more particularly distinguished themselves in public life , may very appropriately close this chapter . /z/ If , among her " first fruits , " Trinity College of Dublin may boast of her Archbishop Usher , and Harvard Univer sity of her Dr. Woodbridge , Brown University may , with equal reason and propriety , boast of her Dr. Rogers , as the first student who enrolled his name upon her records , and as one whose character and life reflect the highest honor alike upon his revered instructor and the institution over which he presided . William , the second son of Capt . William and Sarah /z/ Rogers , was bora in Newport , R. I. , on the 22d of July , 1751 . Having finished a preparatory course of study un der the care of the Rev.

This latter fact is mentioned , as an illustration of the views that prevailed in many of the Rhode Island churches in reference to this point . Soon afterwards , he removed from his native city to Philadelphia , where , on the 31st of May , 1772 , he was ordained pastor of the Baptist church . The sermon on the occasion was preached by the Rev. Isaac Eaton , from the words , " And who is sufficient for these things ? " It proved to be the last sermon that Mr. Eaton ever preached , while the text was the basis of Mr. Rogers first discourse . During the three years that Mr. Rogers continued his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospered , and the congre gation largely increased . Among his hearers , whom his eloquence attracted , was the celebrated Dr. Rush , who afterwards , it is stated , became an adherent of the Rev. Elhanan Winchester . During the war of the Revolution , Dr. Rogers held important offices , as chaplain of the forces appointed by Pennsylvania for the defence of the State , and also as chaplain of a brigade in the Continental army . His rela tions with the prominent actors of the Revolution were intimate , and he enjoyed in a high degree the confidence and esteem of the commanding general . He was an hon- /z/ ored member of the Masonic fraternity , and frequently addressed them on public occasions . In the year 1789 , he was appointed Professor of Oratory and Belles-lettres in the College and Academy of Philadelphia , and in 1792 he was elected to the same office in the University of Penn sylvania . His last years were spent in dignified retirement , and in the cultivation of pious and devout feelings . He died in Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an instance of the general estimation in which he was held as a preacher , it may be stated , that , at one time , during the year 1782 , he received invitations from three very important churches , and of as many dif ferent denominations , in the States of Rhode Island , Con necticut , and Maryland , either to supply the pulpit steadily , or to settle as pastor . One of these invitations was from the Episcopal church of St. John s in Providence . The invitation was given , of course , with a proviso , as will be seen by a reference to Updike s History of the Narraganset Church . A fine picture of Dr. Rogers , executed by his only sur viving daughter , Miss Eliza J. Rogers , has recently been added to the collection of portraits in Rhode Island Hall . It is copied from an original portrait by Rembrandt Peale , taken in the year 1795 , when the subject was in the prime and vigor of life . In Evans s Life of Richards occurs the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English gentleman , in a letter dated New York , June 25 , 1793 . The writer was travelling through the country with a view to final settlement . The extract serves to illustrate Rogers s social character , and also gives an agreeable view of Gen. Wash ington in his private relations . /z/ " After travelling through an extreme pleasant country , vc arrived at Philadelphia , and waited on Dr. Rogers . Dr. Rogers is a most entertain ing and agreeable man , and received your letter with much pleasure . We were with him a great part of the time we remained in the city , and were introduced by him to Gen. Washington . The General was not at home when we called , but , while we were talking with his private secre tary in the hall , he came in , and spoke to Dr. Rogers with the greatest ease and familiarity . He immediately asked us up into the drawing-room , where was Lady Washington and his two nieces . When we were seated , the General called for wine and cake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wishing us success in all our undertakings . The General asked us a number of questions respecting the situation of things in Europe , to all which we answered , you may be sure , in our best manner . It is his general custom to say little ; but on this occasion we understood he was more than usually talkative . He made one remark , which , un der the circumstances in which it was delivered , has a peculiar energy , that we had chosen a happy country , and one large enough ! After sitting about half an hour , we retired , highly gratified with having con versed with ihejirst character of the age . " Dr. Rogers was of the middle size , and in his habits and manners was more than ordinarily refined . In seasons of relaxation , he was agreeably facetious . He was very active , and walked with the agility of youth , until within a few weeks of his decease . The light and beauty of his charac ter were especially manifest in the circle of his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was twice married . His first wife , a daughter of William Gard ner , of Philadelphia , died Oct. 10 , 1793 , of the yellow fever , at that time prevalent . The following extract from a letter dated Philadelphia , Dec. 9 , 1793 , and addressed to the Rev. William Button , of London , is in reference to this event . The letter , with an engraved likeness of the au thor , was first published in London , in the New Baptist Magazine for 1825. /z/ Before this reaches you , you will probably have heard of the irrepara ble loss I have met with in the death of my dear and lovely Mrs. Rogers . She died during the prevalence of the awful epidemic with which our city was lately visited . I enclose you a paper which contains a short ac count of her exit . It is needless for me to enlarge on this mournful vis itation , having by the William Penn , which sailed ten or twelve days ago , forwarded for Dr. Rippon s Register a concise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that as she lived , so she died , a uniform and sincere Christian .

She was I must desist ; my swelling breast forbids my proceeding . I am a poor lonely creature ! The week following her decease , I was taken down with the fever myself , and anticipated a speedy and eternal union with my dear departed wife , and other saints in glory . The dark valley began to assume the appearance of a flowered path ; but , contrary to my own and the expectations of all my neighbors and attendants , I was summoned back into life ; being snatched , as it were , from the very brink of the grave .

Morgan Edwards , whose funeral sermon he published by special request : PHILADELPHIA , April 14 , 1795. /z/ A combination of causes has prevented my addressing you for some time past .

She is a worthy member of our church , and peculiarly well calculated , should God spare her life , of rendering me much assistance , both in my temporal and spirit ual progress . You see by this that I have married in the Lord . Our union took place on the 15th of January ; and we join in soliciting an inter est in your prayers .

Mrs. Rogers joins in affectionate regards to self and dear Mrs. Smith . Yours , in a precious Saviour , /z/ Hon. James Mitchell Yarnum was born in Dracut , Mass. , in the year 1749 . At the time of his graduation he was twenty years of age . While a student he developed a remarkable capacity for learning , and , although somewhat dissipated in his habits , made liberal acquisitions in gen eral knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delighted in its pursuit . Af- /z/ ter leaving college he taught a classical school , and to this period of his life he ever afterwards referred as a season of special benefit . In the year 1771 he was admit ted to the bar , having studied law in the office of Oliver Arnold , Esq. , then the Attorney General of the colony . Soon afterwards he established himself in the town of East Greenwich , where he rapidly rose to distinction in his profession ; his great talents securing for him an exten sive practice . The following extract from the " Memoirs of Elkanah Watson , or Men and Times of the Revolution , " presents a pleasing description of his powers of eloquence at this period : " Mr. Varnum was one of the most eminent lawyers and distinguished orators in the colonies . I first saw this learned and amiable man in 1774 , when I heard him deliver a Ma sonic oration . Until that moment I had formed no concep tion of the power and charms of oratory . I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has re mained for forty-eight years indelibly fixed upon my mind . I then compared his mind to a beautiful parterre , from which he was enabled to pluck the most gorgeous and fanciful flowers , in his progress , to enrich and embellish his subject . Lavater would have pronounced him an or ator , from the vivid flashing of his eye and the delicate beauty of his classic mouth . " Mr. Varnum had a decided taste for military life , and in 1774 was appointed commander of the " Kentish Guards , " a company which , from their acquirements in military tactics , became the nursery of many distinguished officers during the Revolutionary War . Among them may be mentioned Major Whitmarsh , Col. Christopher Greene , and Rhode Island s greatest general , Nathanael Greene , who was second only to Washington , The prominent /z/ part which Varnum had taken in the colonial controversy induced him , upon the breaking out of hostilities , to offer his services to the Government . He was at first a colonel in the American army , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of brigadier-general . He continued in the army several years , and saw some service , commanding a brigade in Sullivan s expedition on Rhode Island . He was a good disciplinarian , and invaluable in council . He wielded a vigorous pen , commanding a rich flow of eloquence , em bellished by the ornaments and graces of rhetoric . While in command at Taunton , he addressed an admi rable letter to the chief officer of the Hessians in Rhode Island , and sent it in by a flag . The letter was a tran script of his views on the great controversy with England , and was considered an able argument on the subject . It was subsequently published in England , and reflected much credit on the author . In 1779 he resigned his com mission , and returned to his former profession . The Leg islature , in consideration of his national services , and the more effectually to secure them in defence of the State , elected him Major-General of the Militia of Rhode Island , an office to which he was annually reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed a dele gate to the Congress of the Confederation , and again in 1786 . As that body sat with closed doors , his voice could not be heard by the public ; but his name often appears in the published journals of the proceedings . The great forensic effort of Gen. Varnum was in the celebrated case of Trevett against Weeden , in the fall of the year 1786 . The General Assembly , at its May session , with a wilful blindness unparalleled in the annals of civiliza tion , had emitted the enormous sum of 100.000 in paper bills , making them u a good and lawful tender for the com- /z/ plete payment and final discharge of all fines , forfeitures , judgments , and executions of every kind and nature what soever . " They also passed acts making it criminal to refuse said bills in exchange for articles of merchandise , and depriving their opponents of the sacred palladium of Britons , the trial by jury , and furthermore rendering them , even though freemen , ineligible to any office . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had purchased meat of John " Weeden , a butcher , and tendered to him bills of the emission of the May session of the Legislature in pay ment ; which bills Weeden refused . Whereupon a com plaint was made and filed , in accordance with the acts of the General Assembly , before Paul Mumford , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . The court consisted of Paul Mumford , Chief Justice , and Joseph Hazard , Thomas Tillinghast , and David Howell , associates . When the case came up for trial , the whole public was in a state of feverish excitement . The merchant closed his store , the farmers left their fields , the mechanic his workship , and all congregated in and around the courthouse to await the final issue . If the complaint was sustained , then would they be prostrated in utter ruin , and the commerce and business of the State be effectually destroyed . Yarnum proved himself equal to this emer gency . By his resistless eloquence he stemmed the tide of power and misrule , and successfully vindicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amend ed acts of the Legislature were unconstitutional , and so void . The tyranny of the demagogues was thus over thrown , and the State was saved . In the year 1787 , Gen. Varnurn was appointed by Con gress one of the judges of the Northwestern Territory , and in the following spring entered upon his duties . But dis ease had enfeebled his body , and his race was nearly run . /z/ He died at Marietta , Ohio , on the 10th of January , 1789 , at the early age of forty . His funeral was conducted with great solemnity and respect . A long procession of mourners private citizens , civil and military officers , gen tlemen of the Order of Cincinnati , and Free Masons fol lowed his remains to the grave . Early in life Gen. Varnum married Martha , the eldest daughter of Cromcl Child , of Warren , a most estimable lady , whose acquaintance he had formed while prosecuting his college studies . She survived her husband forty-eight years , dying at Bristol , without issue , Oct. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following affectionate and interesting letter , addressed to Mrs. Varnum. in the autumn of 1788 , shows the religious views and feelings of the writer in a pleasing light , and affords good evidence that he died in the full assurance of a blessed immortality , notwithstanding the sceptical and philosophical opinions in which he had previously indulged . The letter was first published in the Massachusetts Magazine for November , 1790 , with the following note from the author s friend and early instructor prefixed : To THE EDITORS , etc . : GENTLEMEN : From a full conviction that the enclosed letter from the late Gen. Varnum to his most amiable lady ( written a few days before his departure from this distempered state of being ) will give pleasure to every feeling heart , I have obtained leave to present it to your numerous readers . I am , with respectful esteem , yours , etc. , /z/ I now write from my sick-chamber ; and perhaps it will be the last letter that you will receive from me . My lungs are so far affected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of air and a wanner climate . I /z/ expect to leave this place on Sunday or Monday next for the Falls of the Ohio . If I feel myself mend by the tour , I shall go no further ; but if not , and if my health should continue , I expect to proceed to New Or leans , and from thence by the West Indies to Rhode Island . My physi cians , most of them , think the chances of recovery in my favor . However , I am neither elevated nor depressed by the force of opinion , but shall meet my fate with humility and fortitude . I can not but indulge the hope that I shall again embrace my lovely friend in this world , and that we may glide smoothly down the tide of time for a few years , and enjoy together the more substantial happiness and satisfaction , as we have had already the desirable pleasures , of life . It is now almost nineteen years since Heaven connected us by the tenderest and the most sacred ties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath been increased by every rational and endearing motive ; it is now stronger than death , and I am firmly persuaded will follow us into an existence of never-ending felicity . But , my lovely friend , the gloomy moment will arrive when we must part ; and should it arrive during our present separation , my last and only reluctant thoughts will be employed about my dearest Martha . Life , my dearest friend , is but a bubble : it soon hursts , and is remitted to eternity . When we look back to the earliest recollections of our youthful hours , it seems but the last period of our rest , and we appear to emerge from a night of slumbers to look forward to real existence . When we look forward , time appears as indeterminate as eternity , and we have no idea of its termination but by the period of our dissolution . What particular relation it bears to a future state , our general notions of religion can not point . We feel something constantly active within us , that is evidently beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of ourselves , or an emanation from the pure Source of existence , or reabsorbed when death shall have finished his work , human wisdom can not determine ; whether the demolition of the body introduces only a change in the manner of our being , or leaves it to progress infinitely , al ternatively elevated and depressed according to the propriety of our con duct , or whether we return to the common mass of unthinking matter , philosophy hesitates to decide . I know , therefore , but one source from whence can be derived complete consolation in a dying hour , and that is the divine system contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ . There life and immortality are brought to light , there we are taught our existence is to be eternal ; and , secure in an interest in the atoning merits of a bleeding Saviour , that we shall be /z/ inconceivably happy . A firm and unshaken faith in this doctrine must raise us above the doubts and fears that hang upon every other system , and enable us to view with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to behold him as a kind and indulgent friend , spending his shafts only to carry us the sooner to our everlasting home . But should there be a more extensive religion beyond the veilj and without the reach of mortal observation , the Christian religion is by no means shaken thereby , as it is not opposed to any principle that admits of the perfect be nevolence of Deity . My only doubt is , whether the punishment threat ened in the New Testament is annexed to a state of unbelief which may be removed hereafter , and so restoration take place , or whether the state of the mind at death irretrievably fixes its doom forever . I hope and pray that the Divine Spirit will give me such assurances of an acceptance with God , through the merits and sufferings of his Son , as to brighten the way to immediate happiness . Dry up your tears , my charming mourner , nor suffer this letter to give too much inquietude. - Consider the facts at present as in theory , but the sentiments such as will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity must and will be indulged in its keenest grief ; but there is no advantage in too deeply anticipating our inevitable sorrows . If I did not persuade myself that you would conduct with becoming pru dence and fortitude upon this occasion , my own unhappincss would be greatly increased , and perhaps my disorder too ; but I have so much confi dence in your discretion as to unbosom my inmost soul . You must not expect to hear from me again until the coming spring , as the river will soon be shut with ice , and there will be no communication from below ; if in a situation for the purpose , I will return as soon as practicable . Give my sincerest love to those you hold dear . I hope to see them again , and love them more than ever . Adieu , my dearest friend . And while I fervently devote in one undivided prayer our immortal souls to the care , forgiveness , mercy , and all-prevailing grace of Heaven , in time and through eternity , I must bid you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Thompson , valedictorian of the class , was born at Amwell , ST . J. , on the 14th of April , 1748 . Before graduating he had already commenced preaching . Upon the removal of President Manning to Providence , the church at Warren were left without a minister , and Thomp son was accordingly invited to preach to them with a view to settlement . The following year he was ordained as pastor of the church , being at this time twenty-three years of age . His labors in the ministry were attended with a rich blessing ; so that during the four years of his continuance at Warren , the membership of the church was nearly doubled . But when the war of the Revolution broke out , its sad effects were specially visible among his people . He was at once appointed a chaplain in the Amer ican army , which office he held till 1778 , a period of three years . While at home on a visit , the English troops came up to Warren , and on the morning of May 25 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several private dwellings , and carried away Mr. Thompson as a prisoner . He was confined at Newport ; but in about a month he was released , by what means he never knew . He afterwards preached at Ashford , Ct. , until 1779 , when he became pastor of the church in Swanzey . During his ministry of twentythree years at this latter place , there were several extensive revivals of religion : one immediately after his settlement , when seventy-five persons were baptized and added to the church ; one in 1789 , when fifty persons were baptized ; and a third in 1800 , of still greater extent , which resulted in the admission to the church of a hundred new members . He died in Charlton , Worcester County , Mass. , on the 4th /z/ of May 1803 , at the age of fifty-five . Mr. Thompson , says his biographer , was tall , spare , and of a fine figure . The expression of his countenance was indicative both of a vigorous intellect and an amiable disposition . He placed a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good purpose . In his family and in the church he was a model of kindness combined with firmness . As a preacher he held a very high rank . He had a voice of great com pass , and its tones were at once sweet and commanding . His sermons were carefully studied , and were sometimes written ; but his manuscript was never seen in the pulpit , and his language was generally such as was supplied to him at the moment . He was very successful in the instruction of youth , and for several years received young men under his care , with a view to direct their education . He was fully master of whatever he attempted to teach . In a word , he may be regarded as an accomplished scholar , a devout Christian , and a successful preacher . From the year 1795 until his death he was a Trustee of the college . The original manuscript of his valedictory oration is still care fully preserved among the archives of the college library . 1 /z/ The Rev. William Williams was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1752 . His father emigrated from Wales , and settled in this country as a farmer , accumulat ing a handsome property . The son was fitted for college at the Hopewell Academy , taught by the Rev. Isaac Eaton . He came to Warren in 1766 , and entered the Sophomore Class . In the autumn following his gradua tion , he was married to Patience , daughter of Col , Nathan /z/ Miller , of Warren . In September , 1771 , he was baptized by his classmate , Mr. Thompson , and received as a member of the church under his care . For several years after leaving college he engaged in teaching , an employment for which his talents and inclinations especially qualified him . In 1773 , he removed with his family to Wrentham , Mass. , where he opened an academy , which soon attained to high distinction among the literary institutions of that day . He is supposed to have had under his care nearly two hundred youth , about eighty of whom he fitted for his Alma Mater . Not a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom may be mentioned the Rev. Dr. Maxcy , successor to Manning ; the Hon. David R. Williams , Governor of South Carolina ; and the Hon. Tristam Burgess , LL . D. , Professor of Oratory and Belles-lettres in Brown University , and for many years a distinguished Representative in Congress . Mr. Williams also conducted the theological studies of young men with a view to their entering the ministry . 1 On the 3d of July , 1776 , he was publicly ordained as pastor of the Baptist church in Wrentham , an office which he held for nearly half a century . Though strictly evangelical in his doctrines , he was not regarded as a popular preacher . Quite a number of his early manuscript sermons are among the archives of the college library . They are written in a plain , legible hand , and exhibit marks of careful prep aration .

In 1777 , when the college building was oc cupied by the army , the library was removed to Wrentham , and intrusted to his care and keeping . Mr. Williams was twice married . His first wife , as already stated , was a daughter of Col. Miller , Dr. Manning s colleague in Con gress . In 1804 he was married to Mrs. Dolly Hancock , of Wrentham , daughter of a Mr. Titus .

Then a building and the place of it were talked of , which opened a new scene of troubles and contentions , that had well-nigh ruined all . " Warren was at first selected as a suitable place for the final location of the college , and a committee was appointed to purchase materials for an edifice , secure a lot , and so licit subscriptions . The church in Warren anticipating , perhaps , the action of the corporation , voted that " the meeting-house in this town be and is for the use of the corporation and President at Commencement times , and oftener , if wanted by either , only so as not to interfere with divine worship ; provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county of Bristol ; and that the parsonage-house in said Warren be for the use of the President , so long as the President be our minister . " But soon afterwards , continues Edwards , " some , who were unwilling it should be anywhere , did so far agree as to lay aside the said location , and propose that the county which should raise the most money should have the col lege . " Application having been made to the corporation by gentlemen from East Greenwich and vicinity , setting forth that they had opened a subscription for the college , on condition that the edifice be erected in the county of Kent , and requesting an opportunity for assigning their reasons why the vote of Sept. 7th , fixing the location at Warren should be reconsidered , a special meeting of the corpora tion was held at Newport , on the 14th of November , 1769. 1 1 Although no formal action in reference to a building and location was taken by the corporation until about this time , it appears from the following extract from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earlier period : u Tuesday , Sept. 3 , 1765 .

At this meeting subscriptions and securities were finally offered to the corporation , from the town and county of Newport , to the amount of 4558 14s. , lawful money , the greater part being expressly conditioned that the college be placed in said town . From the town and county of Providence were offered subscriptions and securities amounting to 4399 13s . The final vote , as appears from the records , was as follows : " Whereas the corporation have fully heard committees from the coun ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application for a repeal of the vote of this corporation , on the 16th day of November last , for loca ting the college edifice in the town of Providence , and maturely considered the several sums offered , and all the arguments used by all the parlies concerned , and thereupon the vote being put , Recede or Not , it passed in the negative twenty-one votes to fourteen .

" We have thus given a brief account of the location of the college , compiled mainly from the original records . The following letter from the President to the Bev . Hezekiah Smith , who was now collecting funds for the institution , in South Carolina and Georgia , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cor poration : WARREN , Feb. 12 , 1770 . REVEREND SIR : Last week I received a letter from you of the 2d ult. , in which you inform me of your success at Georgia , and your expectations from the South province . All your friends here rejoice that you succeed so well in getting the needful for the college . " Great luck to you/ as said Mr. Francis in his prayer . I thought it strange that I had no letter by Capt . Durphee from you or Mr. Hart , as I wrote by him to you both . Last week I received a letter from Nelson , at Haverill , and he gives me a pleasing account of matters there . Had not his modesty forbid , I im agine he would have told me that the people were well suited with him . We had another meeting of the corporation last Wednesday , when there were thirty-five members present . They were called to consider proposals from Newport in favor of setting the edifice in that town , as they had raised by subscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscription . - But Providence presented 4280 , lawful , 1 and advantages superior to Newport in other respects . The dispute lasted from Wednes day last , ten o clock , A. M. , until the same hour on Thursday , P. M. The matter was debated with great spirit , and before a crowded audience . The vote was put , Recede or Not 1 It went Not , by 21 against 14 . You asked me in your last whether it had not raised a party in the government . I answer no ; but it has warmed up the old one something considerable . I was greatly censured by people in Newport for not joining to call a meet- i The reader will observe here a discrepancy between Manning s statement and the records . This we can only account for on the supposition that Man ning presents , in a familiar way , the general aspect of the question at the com mencement of the dispute , whereas the records give the final result . It is evi dent that other considerations besides those of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing about the first of January , and a great noise was made because I would not act contrary to an express vote of the corporation at the meet ing on the 10th of November . But at our last meeting the house gave me liberty to attempt a vindication of my conduct , and after hearing me through in the matter , they came to a vote , nemine contradicenle , that they saw no reason why I should be blamed in this matter , and that they ap proved of my conduct . In the course of the debates there was sometimes undue warmth , but , upon the whole , it subsided , and all parties seemed much more unanimous than I expected , in after business . Many of the gentlemen of Newport said they had had a fair hearing , and had lost it ; but their friendship to the college remained , and they would keep their places , pay their money , and forward to their utmost the design . The college edifice is to be on the same plan as that of Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and fifty feet long . I wish I had a draught to send you , but it is not in my power . They determine to have the roof on next fall , and to cover it with slate , as they are now able . Now if we can get it endowed , we shall be compos voti . This I hope you will in part accomplish . I have thought of going to the Jerseys in the spring . If I should , I can not go to Haverill the first of May ; for I must consult my westward friends in a matter of so much consequence as mov ing or not moving with the college . If I go to the Jerseys , it will probably be about the middle of April . Religion is upon the revival in these parts . Messrs . Stillman and Spear were up from Boston , and Backus from Middleborough . It is said that the eight ministers at the corporation meeting were all for Providence . This I shall not assert , however . But I believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . I could tell you a long tale if I had time , but can only tell you that we have twenty-three scholars , eighteen of whom are matriculated . Mrs. Manning joins in love to you , Mr. and Mrs. Hart , etc. , with , sir , Your unworthy brother , and servant in the gospel , /z/ At this meeting of the corporation it was also resolved : " That the Rev. Messrs . Edward Upham , Isaac Backus , Samuel Stillman , Gardner Thurston , John Maxson , Russell Mason , and Samuel Winsor , or any three of them , be a committee to wait upon Mr. President Manning , and inform him of the hearty approbation we have of his conduct , care , and government of the college , and request him still to sustain the office he hath discharged with so much honor , and to go with the college to /z/ Providence when it shall be removed ; and that they treat with the con gregation of which the President is pastor , and inform them of this request , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they report to the next corporation meeting . " This cautious delicacy , remarks Prof. Goddarcl , with which the corporation interfered with President Manning s existing relations , presents a somewhat grateful contrast to the unceremonious and otherwise questionable modes of procedure , which , under similar circumstances , are now sometimes adopted . The final decision to locate the college at Providence , although a wise one , as the result has proved , seems never theless remarkable in view of the relative importance of the two rival candidates for the honor . Providence was then a town , with a population of less than four thousand , while Newport was the second city in New England , and the centre of opulence , refinement , and learning . In her extensive commerce and trade , her numerous manufacto ries , and her merchant princes , she excelled indeed all other cities in the American Colonies . As early as 1729 , Bishop Berkley , in one of his letters to a friend in Dublin , described Newport " as the most thriving place in all America for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper arti- /z/ cle published in 1824 , thus writes : " The island of Rhode Island , from its salubrity and surpassing beauty , before the Revolutionary War so sadly defaced it , was the chosen resort of the rich , and philosophic , from nearly all parts of the civilized world . " Among the arguments advanced in favor of Newport , was the advantage to be derived by the professors and students from the Redwood Library . This was at the time the second library in the country , contain ing about fifteen hundred choice books on the arts and sciences , and especially rich in classical and theological lore . /z/ Providence , on the other hand , had no such literary ad vantages . But her situation was more convenient , and in case of any rupture with the British Government , of which there were strong probabilities at this time , she was much less exposed to an invasion or attack . Besides , here Roger Williams found his home and resting-place , and here was the centre of Baptist influence . Hence the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large , were not dissatisfied with the final action of the corpo ration . It will be observed that Providence , according to the records , offered a less amount in subscriptions and securities than her defeated rival . One of the results of the location of this institution at Providence , was an application to the General Assembly , by another set of petitioners , for another college . At the February session , 1770 , a charter for an academy and col lege , to be located in Newport , passed the lower house of the Assembly , by twenty majority . The application , says Judge Staples , was not favorably received in the upper house , where it was either rejected or indefinitely post poned. 1 The following action of the corporation , at a special meeting held in Warren on the 2d of April , is the probable explanation of the defeat of this project : " Resolved , That this corporation make application to the General As sembly , and pray that a petition now before the Assembly , for granting a charter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the Chancellor , the President , Hon. Darius Sessions , Eev . Samuel Stillman , Col. Job Bennet , and the Secretary ( Thomas Eyres ) , be a committee to draw a memorial to the General Assembly , pur suant to the preceding vote . " The said memorial or remonstrance . having been pre pared and approved , it was /z/ Voted That the Hon. Stephen Hopkins , Hon. Samuel Ward , Hon. Darius Sessions , Job Bonnet , Moses Brown , Daniel Jenckes , John Tillinghast , Oliver Arnold , and James Mitchell Varnum , be , and they or tl major.part of them are , appointed a committee to be present at the Gen eral Assembly , and enforce the said remonstrance . " The location of the edifice having thus been finally de termined upon , the building committee prosecuted their labors with great energy and zeal . The lot selected for it comprised originally eight acres , including a portion of the " home-lot " of Chad Brown , the " first Baptist elder in Rhode Island . " It was for this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same given by them to the corporation , that the college might stand on the original lot 1 of their pious ancestor . The plans which the i This lot , extending from Main Street to Tower Street , and also the homelots of George Rickard and John Warner , which came into the possession of ( Brown , descended , on the death of said Brown , to his eldest son , John , who , , 1G72 gave a deed thereof to his brothers James and Jeremiah , reserving the f ; ilv burial ground , situated a little west from the old Town House , on College Street It was afterwards sold to Daniel Abbot , from whom it descended to h : son Daniel , and from him , the middle part whereon University Hall now stands to Samuel Fenner , of Cranston , a nephew of Abbot s wife .

" ( See papers of the late Moses Brown . ) The following extract from the Record of Deeds , Book 19 , p. 108 , will be in teresting to the antiquarian . It presents a clear and accurate accc southern half of the original college premises . /z/ " To all people to whom these presents shall come : We , John Brown and Moses Brown , both of Providence , in the County of Providence and Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , merchants , send greeting : - Know y , that we , the said John and Moses Brown , lor and in consideration of the s three hundred and thirty dollars , to us in hand already paid by the .

Mr. Abbott , says the record , " took it by descent from his father Daniel Abbott , who received two thirds part of it , being on the north side , from Robert Williams , by deed of gift , who purchased it by deed of bargain and sale of Robert Morrice , who purchased of Daniel Abbott the first , who was an original proprietor after the native Indians .

This stone is said by Mr. Howland to have been the first one laid in the foundation , at the bottom of the cellar wall , in the southwest corner of the building . Tradition adds that Mr. Brown , in accordance with the customs of the times , generously treated the crowd with punch , in honor of the joyful occasion . Mr. Edwards describes the location selected by the com mittee as " remarkably airy , healthful , and pleasant ; being the summit of a hill pretty easy of ascent , and command ing a prospect of the town of Providence below , of the Narraganset Bay and the islands , and of an extensive coun try , variegated with hills and dales , woods and plains , " etc . Surely , he adds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Meanwhile the President was prayerfully considering the sundering of his connection with the church in Warren ; an event in which his tenderest and best feelings were in volved . It is true that the compensation which he had thus far received for his various labors had been barely sufficient for his support . " While , however , " says Prof. Goddard , " his outward man was thus a stranger to the luxurious accommodations of life , his inner man was sus tained by the ennobling consciousness that he lived not in vain ; that he was treading with cheerful alacrity the path of appointed trial ; and that through his agency multi tudes were becoming wiser and better , for time and for eternity . On this passage in the life of Dr. Manning it is delightful to dwell . It is delightful to turn aside from scenes of political ambition and ecclesiastical turbulence , which now mar our peace , and to repose for a while upon a bygone example of unaffected humility , of quiet duty , and confiding prnyer . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future prosperity of that institution was thought to depend on its removal to Prov idence . So affectionately desirous , however , was Dr. Man ning of the people of his care , many of whom had , through his instrumentality , experienced the transforming efficacy of the religion of Christ , that he could not find it iii his heart to leave them . To avoid a separation so painful to his sensibilities , he even proposed to resign the elevated station to which he had just been appointed . To this proposition his influential friends would not listen , and they persuaded him to abandon all thought of resigning the presidentship. 1 While we are compelled to think that his final decision was a wise one , we honor the feelings which well-nigh be trayed his judgment . Under similar circumstances , how few men would have faltered , how few would have sought to renounce the pathway to literary and social distinction , for the unambitious career of a village pastor ! " After consulting with his family and friends , and corres ponding with various members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , decided to resign his pastoral charge , which he did on the 26th of April , 1770 , " to the wonderment , " in the language of the church rec ords , " of his people ; he being greatly admired and re nowned . " In May following he removed with his pupils and undergraduates to Providence . On taking up his i On this subject the Rev. Morgan Edwards wrote him from Philadelphia as follows : " I can not help being angry with you when you talk of another Presi dent . Have you endured so much hardship in vain ? We have no man that will do so well as you . Talk no more , think no more of quitting the presidency , un less you have a mind to join issue with those projectors and talkers who mean no more than to hinder anything from being done . If you go to Providence , the Warren people may have a supply ; if they were willing to part with you , it is likely the college would have no reason to covet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ abode here , he occupied , says Rowland , the old house of Benjamin Bowen , on the lot at the corner of Bowen and North Main Streets , where Mr. Richmond s brick house now stands . Mr. Howell and the students boarded in private families , at one dollar and a quarter per week . There they studied , and at certain hours of the day met in one of the chambers of the brick schoolhouse , now the house of the Meeting Street colored school , for prayers and recitations . These details , trifling though they may appear , nevertheless afford an insight into the condition and management of the college at this period , and a view of Manning s position , better than more formal statements . " Dr. Manning , " says Goddard , whose chaste and expres sive language we again quote , " now entered upon a thea tre of enlarged and responsible action . The college was yet in its infancy , and demanded his parental supervision ; its funds were scanty , and needed to be recruited ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required not only to be improved , but to be adapted to the new circumstances under which it was hereafter to be administered . To these important objects he devoted himself , with patience and energy , and with that spirit of self-denial which is essential to the success of great enter prises , and which great enterprises are apt to inspire . In the beneficent work of establishing , within the little Col ony of Rhode Island , a public seminary for the educa tion of youth in the vernacular and learned languages , and in the liberal arts and sciences , he was aided by the effi cient cooperation of the Rev. Messrs . Edwards , Smith , Stillman , Backus , Gano , and others of his clerical brethren . It is , however , perhaps not too much to say , that , but for the enlightened zeal and substantial liberality of a few Baptist laymen , citizens of Providence , the college would /z/ have been slow in winning its way to general repute . These public-spirited men , though strangers themselves to the discipline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high intellectual culture . Though selfeducated , they were without a particle of hostility to the distinctions of learning , or of that affected contempt for learned men with which the uncultivated sometimes seek to console their deficiencies . Moved by a generous ardor , they determined that their children and the children of their contemporaries should enjoy , to the remotest gener ations , opportunities for intellectual improvement denied to themselves . Well have they been repaid for their efforts in this good cause . Their activity and enterprise in the accumulation of wealth are now well-nigh forgotten ; but still fresh is the memory of all their deeds in behalf of science and letters and religion . " A part of Manning s plan was to secure by correspond ence the cooperation and assistance of friends in England . In pursuance of this plan , he addressed a letter to the Rev. Dr. Samuel Stennett , for thirty-seven years the faith ful and affectionate pastor of the Baptist church in Little Wild Street , London . Mr. Stennett was regarded as one of the most eminent ministers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally , and with members of the Established Church , were large and respectable . One of his constant hearers was the philanthropist John Howard , whom Burke has so highly eulogized , George III. , it is said , was on terms of inti macy with him , frequently calling at his house on Muswell Hill . As a scholar and an author Mr. Stennett had no small repute . His Works , edited by the Rev. William Jones , were published in 1824 , in three octavo volumes . /z/ PROVIDENCE , June 7 , 1770. /z/ Although unknown to you , I take the freedom to trouble you with readin-a letter from an unworthy friend . I was urged to this partly by the desire of our common friend , Mr. Henry Williams , merchant of New York , and partly because I have often heard that you arc a lover of our nation , and are engaged to further the interests of the Baptist society ; as also that you may be informed of the state of our college , the interests of which I am told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable pre sent of your two Volumes of Sermons is an additional proof . I heartily wish that your example may be followed by others of our friends who have written for the public . It was resolved , after long deliberation , to place the college edifice in the town of Providence in this colony , as most conducive to the ends of its institution . This , however , has been attended with considerable diffi culty ; but I forbear to trouble you with the recital of our little affairs . The foundation of the college is now laid , and the building proceeds faster than could have been expected , its magnitude considered , which is one hundred and fifty by forty-six feet , with a projection in the middle , of ten feet on each side , for the public rooms . It is to be four stories high , with an entry of twelve feet through the middle of each , and is to be built of brick , " it will contain fifty-six rooms in all . The town of Providence it self has nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscrip tion near 4000 , lawful money , at six shillings per dollar . The beneficence of a few Baptists in this place , their fortunes considered , is almost unparal leled . I should rejoice to find many elsewhere like-minded . " Ve should then sec the college properly endowed , as well as founded . This we must expect from abroad . Added to the sum collected by Mr. Edwards in Eu rope , our Brother Ilezekiah Smith , of Haverhill , has collected and obtained subscriptions in South Carolina and Georgia , from whence he has just returned , to the amount of about 500 sterling . It would be happy for us if we could find in England a family of IIollises ! to patronize our college ; but I fear the Baptists are not to expect i Concerning the Hollis family , who for nearly a century continued their ben efactions to Harvard College , we may hero state in brief , what Pierce and Quincy have given at length in their histories of the University . Thomas Ilollis , the father of the " benefactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1718 . His son , called , by reason of his donations to Harvard , Thomas Hollis , 1st , died in 1731 . A second son , Nathaniel , died in 1738 . A third sou , John , was a partner in /z/ lL&gt;2 MANNING AND such an instance of public spirit in their favor , although I have heretofore indulged such hopes , and am yet unwilling to give them up . Two young men have already engaged in the ministry who have been assisted by this institution , and both from their beginnings give promise of usefulness . Their first attempts have thus far been highly acceptable to the public . May the Lord of the harvest thrust out many more faithful laborers . In this part of the world the field for labor is very large , while the faithful and well-furnished laborers arc truly few . To my great sat isfaction , I lately received certain information of the conversion to Baptist principles of a young Presbyterian minister , eminent for his piety and success as a preacher . The manner in which this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat singular . He was preaching upon John xiv . 15 , when truth was let into his mind with such vividness as com pelled him to open the nature of the ordinance of baptism so clcarlv as to convince the church , of which he was pastor , that believer s baptism by immersion only is a divine institution . In consequence of this , they sent a messenger to me to corne and administer the ordinance to both minister and people , the most of whom expect immediately to submit thereto . As they , however , arc more than one hundred miles distant from me , and near Mr. Smith , 1 he has engaged to supply my place . I am also told that God is do- business with his brother Thomas . Thomas Hollis , 2d , son of Nathaniel , died in 1735 . The total amount of the benefactions of this family up to this date , " ex ceeded , " says Quincy , " 6000 currency of Massachusetts , which , considering the value of money at that period , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most remarkable in stances of continued benevolence upon record . " Thomas Hollis , 3d , was born in 1720 , and died in 1774 . His donations to Harvard College during his lifetime exceeded 1400 sterling . Timothy llollis died in 1791 , at an advanced age . He gave 20 sterling for the library . Thomas Brand Hollis , the last of the bene factors , was born 1719 , and died in 1804 . His Memoirs were published in 1808 , in two handsome quarto volumes , by his friend the Rev. John Disney . 1 Rev. Hezekiah Smith . In his diary , now among the archives of the Univer sity , we find the following : " Wednesday , June 13th . Went to Deerfield , and preached from Acts xi.23 : ; Who , when he came , and had seen the grace of God , was glad , and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord .

I believe about 1000 is raised ; we have obtained also 1000 of the King . Trustees are appointed for the management of the moneys collected , among whom , of the Baptists , arc Mr. Stead , Dr. Llewelyn , and myself , who consider our selves as particularly obliged to look after the interests of our friends in Nova Scotia . As to political matters , my time will allow me to say but little now . The sovereignty of Parliament over all the British dominions seems to be the great object of Government ; and yet I believe they would be glad to have peace and harmony restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of the goodness of the cause itself , in favor of the discussion in Nova Scotia , and it was duly attended to . I hope the discouragements the Baptists have lately met with in America are removed , and their grievances in some degree at least redressed . I am sure , however , it would be good policy , to say no more of it , in the other denominations with you , to treat them well . And our friends , I hope , see the importance and rea sonableness of taking every united step that our divine religion teaches , before they proceed further . But I must not run out any further at present . It will , I assure you , my dear friend , afford me a very sensible pleasure to hear from you quickly , and often ; and you will oblige me much by favoring me with all the news you can .

He has met with much opposition , and bore many reflec tions , but none of these things have discouraged him .

SIR : You may think strange that I , a stranger to you , should ad dress you by this epistle ; but you will excuse me when I give the reason ; which is , an information that I have received that one Scott , a youth /z/ under my tuition , some time ago riding through Smithfield , in company with one Dennis , of Newport , rode up to , , and in a most audaciously wicked manner , broke the windows of the Friends meeting-house in said town , of which meeting I understand you arc clerk . Upon the first hear ing of this scandalous conduct , I charged him with the fact , which he con fessed , with no small degree of apparent penitence ; whereupon I thought good to inform you , and by you the meeting , that they shall have ample rep aration of damages , and such other satisfaction as they shall think proper ; being determined to punish with the utmost rigor all such perverse youth as may be intrusted to ray care , as I hold such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so good as to let me know when the first meeting of busi ness is held , that I may send him up to appear before them , and make not only reparation , but such a confession before the meeting as shall be fully satisfactory . I choose to mortify him in this way , and should be very glad that some of the heads of the meeting would admonish him faithfully and show him the evil of such doings , if this would be agreeable to them ; but I speak this , not to direct them in the matter , but what would be agreeable to me . When this is settled , we shall discipline him with the highest punishment we inflict , next to banishment from the society , and with that if he does not comply with the above . The youth has been but few months under my care , is a child of a re spectable family in Kingston , Massachusetts Bay , and had his schoollearning at New Haven . I am sorry for his friends , arid that it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vicious pupil ; but I am deter mined this shall be the last enormity , one exceptcd , of which he shall be guilty while under my care . I hope the meeting will inform me how he complies with these injunctions , if they think proper to take these or any other methods . Please , by the first opportunity , favor me with a line in answer to the above requests , and you will do a favor to A real friend , /z/ Mr. Thomas Lapham , Jr. , in Smithfield .

Whether his associate was the Dennis who graduated the Septem ber previous to this occurrence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a youth or person over whom Manning , at this time , had any special control . It would seem proper to introduce here some account of Backus , Stillman , and Smith , the three Baptist clergymen of New England , with whom Manning was intimately as sociated , and to whose active cooperation in all his plans for the advancement of learning and religion , the denom ination at the present day is so largely indebted for its prosperity and greatness . /z/ The name of Backus , it will be observed , is of frequent occurrence throughout our w r ork . The following brief sketch is compiled mainly from Prof. Hovey s Memoir , to which our readers are referred for a fuller account of his character and life . The Rev. Isaac Backus was born at Norwich , Conn. , on the 9th of January , 1724 . His parents were members of the Congregational church . At the age of seventeen , during the excitement that prevailed in consequence of the preaching of Whitefield , he received his first perma nent religious impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to devote himself to the preach ing of the gospel . In 1749 the subject of baptism was agitated in the church of which he was the pastor , and several of his members became , in consequence , Baptists . Mr. Backus himself was soon afterwards baptized by im mersion . On the 16th of January , 175G , the First Baptist /z/ Church in Middleborough was constituted , and he became the pastor . This relation he retained until the close of life . In 1772 he was chosen agent for the Baptist churches in Massachusetts , in place of Mr. Davis , whose ill-health had compelled him to relinquish his charge as pastor of the Second Church in Boston . This agency , which was de signed for the promotion of religious liberty , and espe cially to secure to the Baptists an exemption from the bur dens imposed upon them by law , he executed with great ability and success . In his labors in connection with this agency , he was greatly assisted by Manning , whose supe rior learning and more skilful pen proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides his volumes of history , published nu merous discourses , essays , treatises on religious liberty , and controversial tracts ; a list of which is given in the account of him in Sprague s Annals of the American Pulpit . He died on the 20th of November , 180G , in the eighty-third year of his age , and in the sixtieth of his ministry . " All New England , " says the late Hon. Zechariah Eddy , " is indebted to Mr. Backus more , I think , than to any other man , for his researches in relation to our early ecclesiastical history . Mr. Bancroft bears the most honor able testimony to his fidelity , and considers his history , as to its facts , more to be depended on than any other of the early histories of New England In his own day , his labors were certainly appreciated . It is truly wonderful that , amidst the poverty and privations incident to the war of the Revolution , there could have been awakened interest enough to defray the expense of publishing large volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then de manded for such works . . . . Mr. Backus was of a large , ro- /z/ bust , and muscular frame , made firm , probably , by his early agricultural labors , arid by his travels on horseback the greater part of his life . His large face and head appeared more venerable by reason of his very large wig an adorn ment of ministers in the times in which he lived . " Mr. Backus , we may add in conclusion , was a Trustee of the college for a period of thirty-four years , resigning his place in 1799 , in consequence of the infirmities of age , which prevented his attendance upon the meetings of the corporation . /z/ To the success which the college had in the earlier pe riods of its history , the Rev. Dr. Stillman , it may truly be said , was one of the principal contributors . His name ap pears in the act of incorporation as one of the Trustees . In 1765 he was elected a Fellow , an office which he held until his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was punctual in his attendance upon all the regular meetings of the corporation ; and the great influence which he exerted throughout the Baptist denomination was cheer fully given in aid of the various interests of the college . The following brief sketch of his character and life we have compiled from memoirs of him now extant . The Rev. Dr. Samuel Stillman was born in the city of Philadelphia , Feb. 27 , 1737 . At the age of eleven he re moved with his parents to Charleston , S. C. , where , under the direction of Mr. Rind , a teacher of some celebrity , he received the rudiments of his education . He early gave promise of intellectual and moral superiority . Having become the subject of religious impressions , under the preaching of the Rev. Oliver Hart , he was hopefully con- /z/ verted , and was afterwards received into the church , upon a public profession of his faith by baptism . He pursued his classical studies in part at the Hope well Academy , being one of the first beneficiaries of " The Religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aiding young men in preparing for the ministry . He also pursued his theologi cal studies at Charleston , under the care of his pastor , Mr. Hart . On the 20th of February , 1750 , at the age of twentytwo , he was ordained , in the city of his home , to the work of an evangelist . His first settlement in the ministry , which occurred shortly after his ordination , was at James Island , a beautiful place in the neighborhood of Charles ton . About this time he married a Miss Morgan , daugh ter of a highly respectable merchant , and sister of Dr. John Morgan , who was distinguished as a surgeon in the Revolution . This marriage proved to them both the source of long-continued happiness . She was the mother of fourteen children , only two of whom , however , survived their father . On the 9th of January , 1765 , he was installed as pastor of the First Baptist Church in Boston . This was a little less than two months after Manning had been installed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two distinguished men seem closely united in their efforts to bless the church , and to elevate the charac ter and standing of the Baptist denomination . Dr. Stillman retained his connection with the First Church in Bos ton until his death , which occurred on the 13th of March , 1807 , at the age of seventy . , Dr. Stillman s congregation at the time of his settle ment was the smallest in town . He left it one of the largest and most respectable . As a popular preacher he had no superior in New England . Among his admirers were the elder President Adams , General Knox , and Gov-/z/ governor Hancock ; the hitter of whom was for a season a member of his congregation . No clergyman of the day was so much sought after by distinguished strangers who visited the metropolis . His services were often required on public occasions , and he rarely if ever failed to meet the highest expectations . " In his person , " says the Rev. Dr. Jenks , " he was slender , and very small in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; agile in movement and erect in bearing ; in address polite , combining dignity with condescending kindness , so as to maintain rank with the most eminent , though affable with the meanest . He was scrupulously neat in his dress , wearing , as in his painted and engraved portrait , a wig such as was in his day com mon , with a gown and bands . " A volume of his sermons was published irr 1808 , with a portrait , and a biographical sketch of the author . In Sprague s Annals of the Ameri can Pulpit , Vol . VI. , may be found a highly interesting sketch of Dr. Stillman , accompanied with letters or remi niscences from James Loring , Esq. , and the Rev. Dr. Wm . Jenks ; also a fine engraved likeness . A view of the meeting-house in which Dr. Stillman preached may be found in Drake s History and Antiqui ties of Boston . It was built in 1771 , and dedicated on the 22d of December of that year . Its dimensions were fiftyseven feet long by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this step having been rendered necessary by the great increase of the society . Its site having become valuable for stores and inconvenient for public worship , the place was sold in 1853 , and the old building turned into shops for mart and trade . The proceeds of the sale have enabled the society to rear the most conspicuous spire in the city , upon the east point of Beacon Hill , overlooking the State House even , and commanding a view of the city /z/ and surrounding country , not surpassed , if equalled , by any other . " To such an eminence , " says Drake , " has that church attained , whose foundation was obliged to be clan destinely laid by its original founders . The present grand and lofty steeple will , it is hoped , long stand , not only an ornament to the city , but as a beacon for the intolerant . " The following is a list of the ministers of this church as re corded by Winchell and others : Thomas Gould , 1GG5-75 ; John Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1GS4-9D ; Ellis Cullender , 1708-18 ; Elisha Callcnder , 1718-38 ; Jeremiah Condy , 1739-G4 ; Samuel Stillman , 1765-1807 ; Joseph Clay , 1807-9 ; James M. Winchell , 1813-20 ; Francis Wayland , 1821-26 ; Cyrus P. Grosvenor , 1827-30 ; William Plague , 1831-37 ; Rollin H. Neale , /z/ The Rev. Dr. Hezekiah Smith , whose relations with Manning from early manhood down to the close of life were those of the closest intimacy , was born on Long Isl and , New York , on the 21st of April , 1758 . In his youth he became pious , and at the age of nineteen joined the Baptist church in New York City then under the pastoral care of the Rev. John Gano . He commenced his classical education at Hopewell , entered the College of New Jer sey at Princeton , and graduated in the year 1762 , in the same class with President Manning . After leaving college he travelled through the Southern provinces , in order to recover his health , which had become somewhat impaired by too close confinement to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four thousand miles , and laid the foun dations of lasting friendship with the Rev. Messrs . Hart , /z/ Pelot , and others of a kindred spirit , whose intercourse and correspondence proved a delight to him in his riper years . At Charleston , S. C. , he was ordained by sev eral ministers of the Charleston Association . The Baptist church in Haverhill , Mass. , gathered through Mr. Smith s instrumentality , was organized on the 9th of May , 1765 , and he was chosen the pastor . He was duly installed on the 12th of Nov. , 17GG . The ministers who officiated upon this occasion were President Manning , Dr. Stillman , and the Rev. John Gano . The relations which Dr. Smith thus assumed he sustained during a period of forty years . Under his ministry the church soon acquired great influ ence in the town , and indeed throughout all the surround ing country . On Thursday , June 27 , 1771 , Dr. Smith , as we find it stated in his diary , w r as married to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimable woman was a stranger to religion at the time of their mar riage . Her husband s letters to her during his service in the army express the most affectionate yearnings for her spiritual welfare . She survived him many years , dying Dec. 9th , 1824 . They had four children , namely , three sons and a daughter . In the year 1775 , our struggle with the mother country commenced . The Baptists had always been the friends of civil and religious freedom , and at this critical period they were ready to pledge their fortunes and lives in the defence of their country . Their chaplains , as Washington him self testifies , were among the most prominent and useful in the army . True to his patriotic principles , Dr. Smith , notwithstanding the tender ties binding him to his people and home , left llaverhill immediately upon the breaking out of hostilities , and joined the American army . Here , /z/ as chaplain , he continued five years . He became , says his biographer , the intimate friend of Washington , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the whole army . Repeatedly he exposed his life in bat tle ; and he was always among the foremost in encouraging the soldiers , and in soothing the sorrows of the wounded and the dying . On all occasions he reproved vice , with a boldness of tone and manner which , contrasting with his gentleness in the approval of virtue , awed the most hard ened into respect and fear . After the clouds of war had been dispersed , Dr. Smith returned joyfully to his family and his parish , and to the sacred duties to which he had consecrated his life . In his work at home and in his missionary tours abroad his time was fully occupied , and the even tenor of life flowed on . He died Jan. 22 , 1805 , in the sixty-eighth year of his age . An impressive discourse was preached at his funeral , by the Rev. Dr. Stillman , from Acts xiii . 36 , which discourse was afterwards published . His ashes repose in the village graveyard at Ilaverhill , surrounded by the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commanding presence , large and well proportioned , inspiring respect by his dignity , and winning affection by his affability and grace . His voice was one of unusual compass and power , and his genuine eloquence opened a way for his message . His views of truth were strictly evangelical , and his ministry combined , in due proportions , the doctrinal , the practical , and the ex perimental . He never wrote his sermons , but uniformly went into his study on Thursday morning , and devoted the residue of the week to careful preparation for the du ties of the Sabbath . As an illustration of his pastoral and missionary labors , it is stated in the journal to which we /z/ have already referred , that , from the time when lie entered the ministry to Aug. 1 , 1773 , he baptized two hundred and ninety-four persons . The following amusing instance of persecution which occurred to him is mentioned by his biographer , Dr. S. F. Smith , as an illustration of the times in which he lived . The constable of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a weak and inferior-looking person , was moved to go , clothed in the mnjcsty of the law , and " warn him out of the place . " The little officer , on com ing into the presence of one of such commanding person , and bearing all the airs of a consummate gentleman , on such an errand was very naturally much confused , and , on opening his mouth to deliver his message , said , " I warn you off of God s earth . " " My good sir , " said the preacher , " where shall I go ? " " Go anywhere , " was the reply ; " go to the Isle of Shoals . " It may be presumed , says the narrator , that the expounder of law was scarcely aware of the indignity done to the inhabitants of those seagirt rocks in placing their geographical position so far out of the ordinary track of navigators . Dr. Smith was one of the first Fellows of the college , retaining this position until his death , a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning , to promote the welfare of the institution , these pages through out abundantly show . He was conscientiously faithful in attending the annual Commencements , frequently preach ing the sermon customary upon those occasions , and , on the ensuing Sabbath , occupying the pulpit of the Baptist church . His visits to Providence were hailed with pleas ure , especially by his friend Mr. Nicholas Brown , whose hospitalities he shared , and at whose house he was a wel come and frequent guest . The last meeting of the cor- /z/ poration which he ever attended was in September , 1804 , only four months before his death . 1 Among the papers and correspondence of Mr. Smith are numerous letters written by him to his wife during his service in the army . From these we present a few extracts , as an illustration of the spirit and patriotism of the man , and as a valuable contribution to the history of the war . CAMP WINTER HILL , July 31 , 1775 . MY DEAR AND LOVING WlFE : Last night and this morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common , before you come to Charlestown Neck , was one , in which our people killed one regular , and got four or five of their guns , without losing a man . The second was at Koxbury Neck , in which we lost none , although we took three of the regulars , besides those that were wounded . The third was at the Lighthouse , which the regulars and Tories were rebuilding , in which we lost one or two men , and had a small number wounded . Our forces killed their captain of the guard , and took about twenty-five regulars and eleven Tories prisoners , besides the wounded . The pilot who pilots vessels in and out of Boston harbor was one of them . Thirty-six men were brought into Cambridge just be fore sunset , as I am informed . The Tories hang their heads . CAMP WINTER HILL , March 11 , 1776 . Since my last , the movements of the ministerial army give us reason to think they are about leaving Boston ; but in what direction they will go from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern col onies . If so , our army will soon move , and be ready to attack them where they land . The general order of to-day is , for all the army to get ready for a speedy remove . The field officers of the regiments I serve , as well as others , insist upon my going with them ; and , I must confess , the pros pect of usefulness in the glorious cause of our country , joined with that of usefulness to souls , inclines me to yield to their request . And since my people as a body have not manifested their disapprobation of my being in the army , during the present campaign , I think they can not justly blame me in struggling with others for the salvation of America , especially the i Sprague s Annals of the American Pulpit . /z/ United Colonies in America . Your zeal for the cause , united with con consideration , will , I doubt not , cause you to yield to the disagreeable parting for a few months . CAMP WINTER HILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston , where I saw a number of houses destroyed by the regulars ; but the damage in that town is not so great as I expected ; and what they left amounts to a large sum , which is a proof that they left the town in great fear , and with much precipitation . We have no partic ular orders about marching to the southward yet , but I am confident we shall be obliged to go before long . If so , you will not expect to sec me at Havcrhill very soon , as my horse is low in flesh , and not so well fitted for a long journey as I could wish . You may well judge that so long an absence from home is equally disagreeable to me ns to you ; but as duty in the course of Providence requires it , we ought to be reconciled to it , and bear up under it with a becoming fortitude . Let us place our confi dence in God , and take delight in him the Supreme Good . Then shall we be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us during my ab- scncc I a&gt; sorry my good Deacon Shepherd discovered such a temper at my yielding to what I think is my duty . It will be the best for you not to say much about it ; and if you hear reflections cast upon me , not to resent them , but to let them pass . The least said is the best . CAMP NEW YORK , June 8 , 1776 . We have expected something would be done before now by the minis terial troops in this city ; but their exported army has not , I believe , yet arrived . Only a few vessels lay down at the Hook at present . Our men in general arc healthy , and are daily at work in preparing for the enemy . If the enemy should take New York , I am persuaded they will find great difficulty , and sustain great loss in the acquisition . We received in this city the good news of our privateers . ucccss in taking throe large vessels , whose valuable cargoes we have sent to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress has greatly increased the American army , so that , with the blessing of God , I hope the ministerial army will be disap pointed the present campaign . I long to sec vital piety abound , and true godliness prevail ; then would I pronounce America blessed , arid her sons and daughters free . /z/ CAMP NEW YORK , June 27 , 1776 . In my last I informed you that there had been a plot formed in this city to destroy our generals and blow up the magazine , but that it had been providentially discovered . The Mayor of this city , amongst many others , is in confinement . I hope they will meet with their just reward . They arc now under examination daily . The British fleet has not yet arrived . Our army is strong , and great preparations are making in this place for the enemy Things are very dear here . I gave ten coppers yesterday for about one pint of strawberries . One may readily spend the most of his wages in this place . Some do spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . However , if we can but live and get the victory , it will be a favor ; when we die , we shall not want any of this world . CAMP STILL WATER , Aug. 5 , 1777 . We came to this place last Lord s Day evening ; but how long we shall tarry here I can not say . Our State of Massachusetts Bay is shamefully deficient in the number of Continental troops . We have not one half our number here yet , and what will be the consequence I can not say . Hope kind Providence will excite our people to a more vigorous exertion than heretofore , and that a , glorious event in favor of America will yet take place this present campaign . I am yet sanguine in my expectations , and trust the American armv will be victorious . CAMP SXILLAVATER , Sept. 13 , 1777 . We arc now on our march up the river to meet Mr. Burgoyne with his boasted strength . Expect soon to engage him , unless lie should retreat . Our army is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Gates , and a large body of troops ; so that I don t doubt of success , unless we should put our trust in the arm of flesh , which is forever attended with a curse . With the blessing of Heaven , I expect our army will soon do something grand for the salvation of our country . CAMP STILLWATER , Oct. 3 , 1777 . Since the battle mentioned in a former letter , we have either taken prisoners , or had deserters come in from the enemy almost every day . I have expected a general engagement before now , but when it will take place I know not . From the best information we understand that the enemy s provisions grow short . /z/ CAMP ALBANY , Oct. 22 , 1777 . Although I sent you a letter since our total conquest of Gen. Burgoyne s army , in which I enclosed the articles of capitulation ; yet I am loth to miss this opportunity by Mr. Chadwick to let you know that I am in a good state of health , ready to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southward , if Gen. Washington should stand in need . We have no very late intelligence from him ; but the last we had was fa vorable , and we daily expect to hear of a general battle . Hope the Lord will give success to our arms . The following is a list of the taken , killed , etc. , of Gen. Burgoyne s army : British troops by capitulation , 2442 Foreigners , 2198 Prisoners sent to Canada " , 1100 Staff , 12 Sick and wounded , 528 Prisoners of war , 300 Deserters , 400 Took at Bennington , 1220 Killed between Sept. 18th and Oct. 8th , ....... 600 Taken at Ticonderoga , 413 Total , 9213 The number of killed and taken at Fort Stanwick I can not ascertain . Gen. Burgoyne and three other officers taken were members of the British Parliament . CAMP CONTINENTAL VILLAGE , July 14 , 1780 .

Next Lord s Day I expect to preach to my brigade for the first time since I joined them this season ; for I found the brigade so scattered , and taken up with guards , etc. , that the brigade major said that he could not turn any out for public exercise , nor even furnish men to relieve the guards . But now the recruits have joined us we arc able to have religious worship in camp again ; and I pray that my prenrhing inny be attended viih power . /z/ The present seems a fitting place to make special men tion of the BROWNS , whose names so frequently occur throughout these pages . They were Manning s intimate friends . To their vigorous and united efforts the college is largely indebted for its early prosperity arid growth , if not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prominent members both of the colony and of the Baptist church . Their descendants , in pious emulation of their fathers , have nobly contributed of their abundant wealth to the present resources of the institution , its spacious grounds , its buildings , its library and ap paratus , and its endowments and funds , and Brown Uni versity will transmit , to the latest posterity the many vir tues and generous deeds of the family whose honored name it bears . /z/ Concerning the remote ancestry of the Brown family in Rhode Island , but little is now known . That they are the descendants of some one of the hundred and fifty-five fam ilies bearing that name in England , Ireland , and Scotland , whose escutcheons , or armorial bearings , are described in Burke s Encyclopaedia of Heraldry , is at least probable . The Rev. Chad Brown ( or Browne , as the name was at first written ) came over from England , according to Savage , in his recent edition of Winthrop s History of New Eng land , in the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two ships , " says Winthrop , " which came over this year ( 1638 ) , much pes tered , lost many passengers and some principal men . " In a note upon this pas sage , Savage , after speaking of the Nicholas of London as one of the pestered ships , remarks as follows : " Another of the pestered ships probably was the Martin , coming nearly at the same time with the Nicholas . I know , at least , that the nuncupative will of Sylvester Baldwin , one of her passengers , who died on the ocean , was proved July 13th , of this year , by Chad Brown , and other fel- /z/ Winthrop states that " there came over this summer twenty ships , and at least three thousand persons , so as they were forced to look out new plantations . " It was during this period , also , that many of the inhabitants of Boston , " and others who were of Mrs. Hutchinson s judg ment and party , removed to the Isle of Aquiday ( Rhode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation , and savored anabaptism , removed to Providence , so as those parts began to be well peopled . " In this latter class , thus described by Winthrop , may be included Chad Brown ; who , with his wife Elizabeth and his little family , at once sought a permanent home in the land which had afforded a friendly shelter to Roger Williams and his companions . The precise date of his arrival at Providence can not now be ascertained , as the early records of the town were loosely kept , and many of them were afterwards destroyed during the so-called King Philip s War . From the doc uments that have come down to us , it is evident that he soon exercised an important influence , as a leading man in the colony . The first written or civil compact of which low-passengers , before Deputy Governor Dudley . His wife and children are named . " It has been asserted that Chad Brown was " one of that little company who fled with Roger Williams from the persecution of the then Colony of Massa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the town of Providence , three quarters of a century ago , states that he was " exiled from Massachusetts for conscience sake . " Prof. Gammell , in his Memoir of Nicholas Brown , says that he arrived at Providence in the year 1636 , a few months after the arrival of Roger Williams . Dr. Hague , in his historical discourse delivered at the second centennial anniversary of the First Baptist Church , makes a similar assertion . Among the papers of the late Moses Brown , we find it stated that he came from Salem , Mass. , in the year 1637 . Edwards , Backus , and Benedict are equally confused in their brief notices respecting the early history of the great ancestor of the family from which the college derives its name . Mr. Savage , in his re marks as above quoted , proves conclusively that Chad Brown came to Provi dence in 1638 , more than two years after the arrival of Roger Williams and his five companions . For a further illustration of this point , see Savage s Genea logical Dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have any knowledge has his signature , with that of twelve others . A full account of this compact , which was probably entered into soon after Mr. Brown s arrival , may be found in Staples s Annals of Providence . On the 8th of October , 1638 , Roger Williams executed a deed , known as the " initial deed , " granting to twelve of his companions an equal share with himself of the lands which he had purchased from the Indians . Tnese , there fore , including the grantor , constituted the original thirteen proprietors of Providence . Soon after the execution of this deed , the proprietors divided the lands thus obtained into two parts , one called " the grand purchase of Prov idence , " the other " the Pawtuxet purchase . " Great dis sensions and difficulties grew out of this division , in al lusion to which Roger Williams , in his plea before the Court of the New England Colonies , in Providence , in the year 1677 , gives the following brief but comprehensive view of Mr. Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chad Browne , that wise and godly soul ( now with God ) , with myself , brought the remaining aftercomers and the first twelve to a oneness by arbitra tion . " In the first of the aforementioned divisions , " the grand purchase , " are recorded in a small book , among the files of the city clerk s office , the names of fifty-four per sons as the owners of " home-lots , " as they were called , extending from the " town street " ( now North and South Main Streets ) eastward to Hope Street . Among the names thus recorded is that of Chad Brown . In addition to these lots , each person had a six-acre lot assigned to him in other parts of the purchase ; some on the banks of the Seekonk , where Roger Williams s out-lot was located , and some on the Wanasquatucket river . We are thus particular in these details , because the college , as we have /z/ already seen , was located upon a portion of the home-lot of Chad Brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Cole , William Harris , and John Warner , to draw up a plan of agreement for the peace and government of the town ; the growth of the colony having rendered the purely democratic government , adopted at the first , im practicable . To this plan , consisting of twelve articles of agreement , his name is the first signed , followed by the signatures of thirty-eight others . It went into immediate operation , and for several years constituted the only ac knowledged government of the town . In 1643 he was employed , with three others , in making peace between the people of Warwick and the Massachusetts Government . The whole of this affair , which forms a painful chapter in our early New England annals , is told at length by the prin principal actor , Samuel Gorton , in his " Simplicity s Defence , " which , with Staples s notes , may be found in the second volume of the publications of the Rhode Island Historical Society . In addition to his various public duties , he was also a surveyor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . In 1660 , as appears by the records , he was appointed , with John Throckmorton and Gregory Dexter , to compile a list of the first town lots , from Mileend Cove , north of Fox Point , to Olney s Lane , and note the several divisions and grants of land made previous to that date . This list or record , much worn and defaced , is now on file at the clerk s office . But it is as a minister of religion , as the " first elder " of the oldest Baptist church in America , that Chad Brown claims our especial attention . It is true that the distin guished honor of founding this church belongs to Roger Williams ; who , having been baptized by Ezekiel Holliman , /z/ a man of gifts and piety , " baptized the administrator and ten others , in the month of March , 1639 . But in a few months , says Scott , 1 a contemporary with Williams , and one of the thirteen original proprietors of the soil , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds and reason of it , that their baptism could not be right , because it was not administered by an apostle . " He became what , in the history of New England , is denominated a Seeker ; a term , says Prof. Gammell , not inaptly applied to those who , in any age of the church , become dissatisfied with its prevailing creeds and institutions , and seek for more congenial views of truth , or a faith better adapted to their spiritual wants . Those writers who desire to place Roger Williams at the head of the Baptist ministers of America , do not sufficiently regard the facts as recorded in history . He indeed was instrumental in planting and establishing the Baptist denomination in this country ; but his true glory and greatness consist , not in his vocation as a Baptist preacher , but in his wisdom and benevolence as a legis lator , in founding , says a distinguished German statesman arid scholar , 2 " in 1636 , a small new society in Rhode Isl and , upon the principles of entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority in secular concerns , " principles , the same author continues , which have not only maintained themselves here , but have spread over the whole Union , superseding the aristocratic commencements of Carolina and of New York , the High- 1 Richard Scott . See his letter respecting Koger Williams in Fox s " New England Fire Brand Quenched , " Part II. , p. 247 . He came to Providence in 1638 . He was at first a Baptist , but afterwards became a Quaker . One of his descendants was married to Judge Jenckes , and thus became the grandmother of the late Hon. Nicholas Brown . 2 Professor Gervinus . See his recent " Introduction to the History of the Nineteenth Century . " /z/ Church party in Virginia , the theocracy in Massachusetts , and the monarchy throughout America ; which have given laws to one quarter of t ! ie globe , and which stand in the background of every democratic struggle in Europe . In the year 1642 , Mr. Williams was appointed by the colonists to visit England for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally ordained , assumed the pastoral office . Associated with him wese the Rev. Messrs . Thomas Olney , William Wickenden , and Gregory Dexter . The terms of their ministry , and the nature of their relations to Mr. Brown , are not definitely known . It is certain that for more than half a century they had no meeting-house , the church being accustomed to assemble in a grove or orchard for public worship , and , when the weather would not permit this , in private houses . In those primitive times the ministers , or elders as they were more commonly called , doubtless exercised their gifts after the manner of laymen in our modern conference meetings . This they called prophesying . Mr. Wickenden , who , during the latter part of his life , resided at a place out of town which he called Solitary Hill , is said to have been ordained by Mr. Brown . Mr. Dexter was formerly a printer in London , in company with one Coleman . He came to Providence in the year 1G43 , and was at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival both a Baptist and a preacher . He was not , however , according to Edwards , chosen to be their minister , until Mr. Wickenden s removal to his new residence rendered this step in a measure necessary . Mr. Olncy , according to Savage , came from Salem , Mass. , from which place he was banished in the year 1G38 . He was one of the original members of the church , having been baptized by Roger Williams at the time when it was constituted . /z/ During Mr. Brown s ministry there appears to have originated a controversy , which was long agitated in the town , and throughout the colony . It had reference to the " laying on of hands " mentioned in Hebrews vi . 1 , 2 , a doctrine which prevailed in the Baptist churches for more than a century . The principal leaders in this con troversy were Wickenden and Olney , both of whom fa vored giving up the doctrine altogether . Indeed , the latter , not succeeding in carrying his point , withdrew , with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a new one called the " Five-principle Baptist . " This last , says Callender , continued till about the year 1718 , when , becoming destitute of an elder , the members were united with other churches . It is more than probable that Wickenden s removal from town was owing , in part , to the un pleasant relations growing out of this controversy . Unmoved by the arguments of " Seekers " or " Sepa ratists , " Mr. Brown maintained his standing firmly in a church which he believed to be founded on the rock of eternal truth , even " the word of God , which abideth for ever . " The duties of his high calling he continued to dis charge , with greater or less regularity , until his decease , which occurred about the year 1GG5 . His death was regarded by the colonists as a public calamity ; for he had been the successful arbitrator of many differences , and had won the not unenviable reputation of being a " peace maker . " His other services , too , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over more than a quarter of a century . His remains were interred in a part of his original " home-lot , " lying on College Street , just west of the old town house , whence , in 1792 , they were removed to the family lot in the North Burying-ground . A plain , /z/ simple stone , erected by the town of Providence to his memory , indicates his final resting-place . Mr. Brown left five sons ; namely , John , who married a Holmes ; Judah , alias Chad , who died childless ; James , who removed to Newport , about the year 1672 ; Jeremiah , who also settled in Newport ; and Daniel , who married a Herenden . " We may easily suppose/ says Prof. Knowles , " that as Mr. Williams s connection with the church was very short , Mr. Brown was con sidered as the first pastor , even by his contemporaries , and that this impression was transmitted to their descendants . It was not unnatural , moreover , for the church to be willing to recognize Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who soon left them , and who refused to acknowledge them , or any other body of men , to be a true church . It is possible that other causes had some influence in the case . It is certain , however , that Mr. Brown has been generally believed to have been the first pastor of the church . He was , unquestionably , the first regular and permanent pastor , and may be regarded as one of the chief founders . It is not probable that he contended for the honor while he lived ; and we may be sure that there was no strife on this point between him and Roger Williams , who speaks of him in one of his letters as that noble spirit now with God/ and , on another occasion , as that holy man . " In a letter to Prof. Knowles , by the late John Howland , Esq. , the author says : " The college was built in 1770 . On the question among the founders of it , on what lot to place the building , they decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the home-lot of Chad Brown , the first min ister of the Baptist church . Other land could have been obtained , but the reason given prevailed in fixing the site . Had the impression been prev alent that Roger Williams was the first minister or principal founder of the society , his home-lot could have been purchased , which was a situation fully as eligible for the purpose . If any doubts rested in the minds of the gentlemen at that time as to the validity of the claim of Chad Brown to this preference , perhaps the circumstance of Mr. Williams deserting the order , and protesting against it , might have produced the determination in favor of Brown . " /z/ John , the eldest son of Chad , was born in England , in the year 1G30 , being eight years of age at the time of his arrival in Boston . His mother s name was Elizabeth ; but her maiden name we have not been able to ascertain . He married Mary , daughter of the Rev. Obadiah Holmes , of Newport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M. D. , the distinguished founder of Newport Col ony . He was a native of England , and was educated , says Ross , at Oxford University . Formerly he was settled in Rehoboth , Mass . He is noted in history as the first martyr to Baptist principles in New England , having been appre hended in Massachusetts , in company with John Clark , and cruelly whipped " for conscience sake . " Concerning Mr. Brown s life , but few memorials have come down to us . He appears to have been a man of influence in the colony , and to have inherited in a measure the character and spirit of his father . We first find his name on record in a docu ment dated Jan. 19 , 1646 , which reads as follows : " We , whose names are hereafter subscribed , having obtained a free grant of twenty-five acres of land , apiece , with the right of commoning accordino- to the said proportion of lands , from the free inhabitants of this town of Providence , do thankfully accept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or passive obedience to the authority of ( King and Parliament ) established in this colony , according to our charter , and to all such wholesome laws and orders , that are or shall be made by the major consent of the town of Providence , as also , not to claim any right to the purchase of the said plantations , nor any privilege of vote in town affairs , until we shall be received as freemen of the said town of Providence . " This document has the signature of John Brown , fol lowed by twenty-seven other signatures , including that of his brother Daniel . A few years after this transaction , /z/ commenced the most trying period in the early history of Rhode Island . In consequence of the ambition of Gov . Coddington , the local jealousies of the towns , and therefractory disposition of individuals , a spirit of disunion and misrule sprang up , which continued several years , and had well-nigh proved fatal to the peace of the colony . A happy settlement of all difficulties was at length effected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which assem bled at Warwick on the 31st of August , 1654 . One of the commissioners from Providence was John Brown , who was then twenty-four years of age . In the year 1662 he was appointed , with Roger Williams and Thomas Harris , Jr. , to make up the town council . Mr. Backus , in his Church History , further adds that he was a minister in the church . These records , scanty as they are , give all the information that can be obtained respecting his character and life . At what time he died is not known . In the year 1667 , we find his name as a witness to the signa ture of Roger Williams to the " initial deed , " so called , which Williams originally granted on the 8th of October , 1638 . He left five children ; namely , John , born March 18 , 1662 ; James , Obadiah , Martha , and Deborah . Martha was married to Gov . Joseph Jcnckcs , " of happy memory , " who was therefore the brother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as erroneously stated by Dr. Benedict in his History of the Baptists. /z/ James , the second son of John , was born in Providence , in the year 1666 . He married Mary , daughter of Andrew , and grand-daughter of William Harris , one of the first five who came to Providence in June , 1636 , in company with Roger Williams . Of him but little is known , save as /z/ pastor or elder of the Baptist church . He was a colleague of the Eev . Pardon Tillinghast , and his successor in the pastoral office ; but the time of his ordination does not ap pear on record . Associated with him in this work was the Rev. Ebenezer Jenckes , who was ordained in 1719 , soon after Mr. Tillinghast s death . During Mr. Brown s minis try , an event occurred which exhibits his character in a pleasing light . It was in relation to the doctrine of the imposition of hands , about which , in former years , there had been so much controversy , and which , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided and nearly rent asunder the church . It seems that a revival of religion was in progress at Newport , and Mr. Walton , a young minister of liberal education , had been invited to preach in Providence , with the hope of promoting one here also . He accepted the invitation , at the same time freely expressing his willingness to practise the laying on of hands , but not as a divine ordinance , necessary to church fellowship . Mr. Windsor , then a deacon of the church , was the leader of a party that urged the imposition of hands as a term or prerequisite of church communion . Gov . Jenckes , who was the leading member of the church , was then residing at Newport . He wrote to his pastor , Mr. Brown , on the subject , confirming Mr. Walton s view , that laying on of hands " should be no bar to communion with those who have been rightly baptized ; " and saying that he had been informed by ancient members of the church that such had been the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This interesting letter of Gov . Jenckes , which is dated March 19 , 1730 , is published in the second volume of Backus s Church History of New England . Mr. Brown perfectly accorded with these views ; for although himself a " Six-principle Bap- /z/ list , " holding and allowing with many of his brethren " the six principles in Heb. vi . 1 , 2 , to be the doctrine of Christ and the bounds of church communion , " he never theless strongly remonstrated with Mr. Windsor and his friends against this rigid innovation . So far as the case admitted , he thus evinced a liberal and catholic spirit , eminently befitting a Christian teacher . The result was the following agreement , or compromise , which we here present , as an illustration of Mr. Brown s views and of the spirit of the times : May 25th , 1732 . Whereas there was a meeting appointed by some of the Baptist church of Providence , this present day , at Elder James Brown s , the few of us that have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened of late about the bounds of our communion , we think it needful to bear each others burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ . The difference between us is this , that some of us have borne with larger communion than others . " We shall endeavor , by the help of God , not to offend our brethren in this thing , nor any thing whereby it shall offend their consciences , but shall endeavor to be a build ing up of peace and tranquillity within the spiritual walls of Jerusalem . We . do all further agree , that there be no contradictions , but that we may all speak the same things ; for as we all agree and allow the six principles in Ileb. vi . 1 , 2 , to be the doctrine of Christ , and to be the bonds of our communion , so we ought to be of one body , and not tearing one another to pieces . We further agree , that if any brother or sister shall join in prayer without the bounds of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church for their offending their brethren . /z/ Mr. Brown died on the 28th of October , 1732 , in the sixty-sixth year of his age . He was , says Edwards , " an example of piety and meekness worthy of admiration . " He had ten children ; namely , John , James , Joseph Martha , Andrew , Mary , Obadiah , Jeremiah , Elisha , and Anna . John died in 1716 , childless . The rest married into the Power , Field , Green , Knowlton , Harris , Comstock , Rhodes , Smith , and Barker families . /z/ James , the second son of the preceding , was born March 22 , 1G98 . Very few memorials of his early life and sub sequent career have been preserved . He engaged in active business , and became a successful merchant of Providence , thus laying the foundations of the wealth and prosperity of his descendants . During the year 1723 he married Hope , daughter of Col. Nicholas Power , and grand-daughter of the Rev. Pardon Tillinghast , one of the early pastors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England in 1G45 , is said to have been a soldier under Cromwell . He built , at his own ex pense , the first meeting-house ever occupied by the church ; a deed of which , and of the lot on which it stood , he exe cuted to them and their successors in the year 1711 . With the beloved wife of his choice he lived most happily until his death , which occurred on the 27th of April , 1739 , in the forty-first year of his age . She survived him many years , dying June 8th , 1792 , at the advanced age of ninety . Both she and her husband were worthy members of the church , and patterns of exemplary piety . She was re markably amiable in her temper , and brought up her boys well ; a proof , says one , of strength of character and mind , /z/ which few widowed mothers possess . They had five sons , and a daughter Mary . James , the eldest son , became mas ter of a vessel . He died at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1750 , at the age of twenty-six . The daughter was married to Dr. David Vanderlight , a German , who prac tised medicine in Providence until his death , which oc curred on the 14th of February , 1755 , while in his thirtieth year . She survived him long , dying on the 6th of May , 1795 . The remaining sons , Nicholas , Joseph , John , and Moses , familiarly known in Providence annals as the " Four Brothers , " will form subjects for more extended sketches . /z/ Nicholas , the oldest of the " Four Brothers , " was born in Providence , on the 28th of July , 1729 . At the age often he was deprived of a father s care , and in a measure thrown upon himself , as the senior representative of the family . To the good counsels and judicious training of his excel lent mother , for whom he ever cherished a profound re gard , he was , doubtless , indebted for many of those traits of character which rendered his life illustrious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness of his heart and of the benevolence of his disposition . Upon coming to man s estate , immediately after the death of his brother James , he could , as the eldest son , have inherited a double portion of his father s property , in accordance with existing colonial laws . Setting aside , however , all legal rights , - and following only his generous impulses , he promptly divided with his brothers and his sister Mary so much of the paternal estate as fell to their lot . So auspi cious a beginning of his career in life could hardly fail of a happy and successful termination . He at once engaged in 1769-1770 . BROWN UNIVERSITY . loV mercantile business , and thereby acquired a very ample fortune . His success in trade was truly remarkable ; but not more so than were his diligence and punctuality , traits of character for which his descendants have ever been distinguished . On the 2d of May , 1762 , at the age of thirty-three , he married Rhoda Jenckes , fifth daughter of Judge Daniel Jen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college charter . Her mother was Joanna Scott , a de scendant of Richard Scott , one of the original proprietors of the colony , and an early member of the Baptist church . This union proved a source of great domestic felicity . They were blest with a numerous offspring ; but of ten children , only two survived them ; namely , Hon. Nich olas Brown , from whom the University derives its name , and the late Mrs. Hope Ives , wife of Thomas Poynton Ives , Esq . After more than twenty-one years of happy married life , this most excellent lady , whose special de light it was to aid her husband in his deeds of charity , and to cheer the gloomy mansions of poverty and pain , was taken from him . She died on the 16th of December , 1783 , in the full assurance of a blessed immortality . Dur ing all her sickness she manifested a pious resignation to the divine will . For many days previous to her death she had expressed a desire to " depart and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind she continued , pa tiently waiting the summons for her to " come up higher . " On the 9th of September , 1785 , Mr. Brown married for his second wife , Avis , daughter of Capt . Barnabas Binney , of Boston . She was a woman of superior worth , and was well versed in books and useful learning . Happy in her society , and in the esteem and good-will of his fellow-men , his remaining years glided peacefully on until his death , /z/ which occurred on the 29th of May , 1791 , in the sixtythird year of his age . On the morning of this day , which was the Sabbath , he rode out , and on his return break fasted with his family as usual . After sending his son and daughter to church , and declaring his intention , weak as he was , to go himself to the house of God , he was taken worse , and in a few hours , by an easy death , gently trans lated from this state of change and trial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Tuesday follow ing , his remains were carried to the Baptist meeting-house , where a most eloquent and impressive funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr. Stillman , who for many years had been his intimate friend . From this sermon , which was afterwards published , we make the following extract , as an illustration of the man ner in which he was esteemed by those who had known him long and well : " Perhaps there is nothing more difficult than to give characters : we say too much for some , and too little for others ; but in this instance the deceased was too well known , and his character too long established , to need any commendation from me . Yet I wish to gratify my present feel ings , by saying that for twenty years I have enjoyed an intimate and pleasing acquaintance with him , and knew him well . He was the affec tionate husband , the tender father , the compassionate master , the dutiful son , the loving brother , and the steady , faithful friend . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform his mind , and had acquired general knowledge . But religion was his favorite subject . To Chris tianity in genera , as founded on a fulness of evidence , and to its peculiar doctrines , lie was firmly attached . And from his uniform temper , his love to the gospel and to pious men , together with his many and gen erous exertions to promote the cause of Christ , we may safely conclude that he had tasted that the Lord is gracious . Therefore we sorrow not as they who have no hope . He was a Baptist from principle , and a lover of good men of all denominations . Blessed with opulence , he was ready to distribute to public and to private uses . In his death , the college in /z/ this place , this church and society , the town of Providence , and the gen eral interests of religion , learning , and liberality have lost a friend indeed . " Mr. Brown , it is somewhat remarkable , never made a public profession of that religion which , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the animating motive of his conduct , and the source of his highest joys . He ap pears to have been distrustful of himself , and to have shrunk from a public avowal of his faith , from a too great timidity , perhaps , and a painful consciousness of imperfec tions and short-comings , which are but the common heri tage of our fallen natures . Perhaps , too , his awful reverence for Deity prevented his taking upon himself the solemn vows involved in church covenant and membership . This reverence impressed every one who heard him speak , or saw him w r rite the sacred name . It was his custom to write it in capitals , and he often desired others to do the same . The following letter , addressed to his intimate friend , the Rev. Hezekiah Smith , of Haverhill , Mass. , affords a happy illustration of his views and feelings in regard to his religious state . It is interesting also from its allusions to the college : PROVIDENCE , March 30 , 1772. /z/ This may serve to acquaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . We have received none of your favors since 28th September , by Mr. Manning ; yet we have no excuse for not writing to you before , except that of not having any particulars worthy your notice . Mr. Binney , 1 a worthy , humble , and meek young Christian , having been the evening with us , 1 engaged to forward these to you from Boston , as he is now going home the ensuing vacation . His conversation upon Chris tianity is really entertaining , and we sincerely wish , while we can say that we take knowledge of him that he has " been with Jesus , " that /z/ the same might be said of ourselves . This knowledge we are still waiting for . I hope , in the day of God s power , it will be made manifest in us ; and I take this opportunity of requesting your fervent prayers that God would remove from us the veil of ignorance and unbelief , and that Christ in his fulness may be savingly applied to our souls through faith , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saith the Scriptures . It is a very dull time in religion here , though we have to rejoice that God has not left him self wholly without a witness . We are informed that in Swanzey , among the Baptists in Messrs .

We have heard from Phila delphia that Rogers was much liked there , and that his preaching has been blessed . Mr. Edwards has gone to Carolina . I hope he may be able to promote the collection of your subscriptions got there , as they are much needed . There is nothing new here about the college . The lower rooms have been finished , so that the scholars have lived in them this winter .

Your most respectful and obedient servant , /z/ In a letter to Mr. Smith , written fifteen years after wards , Mr. Brown further remarks : " I am as rationally convinced of the reality of religion as ever , and wish to live with a more lively sense of it in my own soul . I know there is a great work of duty to be attended to , without which we have no promise . And I feel assured that this line of duty , however straight and plain , we shall not pursue , without the supernatural aids of that Spirit of love " To this sketch we append the following remarkable epi taph , written by the Hon. David Howell , and placed upon the monument erected by his widow and surviving chil- /z/ dren . It is a fitting and eloquent tribute to his memory , and presents in brief a comprehensive view of his entire life : - /z/ IpkljolHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors , Who were some of the first settlers in this State . His stature was large , his personal appearance Manly and noble , His genius penetrating , his memory tenacious , His judgment strong , his affections lively and warm . He was an early , persevering , and liberal patron Of the College in this town , And a member and great benefactor of the Baptist Society . His donations in support of learning and religion Were generous and abundant . His occupation was merchandise ; In which , by industry , punctuality , and success , He accumulated a large fortune . He was plain and sincere in his manners , a faithful Friend , a good neighbor , and an entertaining companion . His knowledge Of books , of men , of business , and of the world Was great , and of the most useful kind . He loved his country , And had an equal esteem of liberty and good government . He had deeply studied the Holy Scriptures , and was convinced Of the great truths of revelation . He was a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And trained up his household after him . He was a lover of all men , especially of good men , The ministers and disciples of Christ , Who always received a friendly welcome under his hospitable roof . As in life he was universally esteemed , So in death he was universally lamented . The conjugal affection of a mourning widow , And filial piety of an orphan son and daughter , /z/ Joseph , the second of the " Four Brothers , " was born Dec. 3d , 1733 . At an early age he gave proofs of a supe rior genius . He engaged in merchandise and in the man ufacturing business ; and by his industry and skill acquired , if not affluence , at least a competency , which enabled him to indulge his natural taste for science . The first display of his philosophical abilities was in electricity , in which he became an adept . At his death he left an electrical ap paratus of his own construction , equal , it is said , if not su perior , to any then existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other branches of science , particularly in astronomy , attracted the notice of the literati . But his favorite study was mechanics . The want of an early education was an ob stacle in the way of his literary career , but the efforts of his genius in surmounting it excited the greatest admiration . In testimony of his merits , the honorary degree of Master of Arts was conferred on him , and he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He was a warm friend of the college , of which he was a Trustee from the year 1769 until his death ; and in all that pertained to its prosperity and growth he was thoroughly identified . In 1784 he was made a Professor of Natural Philosophy ; and in consideration of the impoverished con dition of the college , resulting from the war , he generously gave his valuable services to the institution without com pensation . He was thus the second professor ( aside from the President ) ever appointed by the corporation ; the Hon. David Howell being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , being the only one of the brothers who ever made a public profession of religion . The meeting-house of this venerable society , which for /z/ nearly a century has adorned the place , still stands , a con spicuous monument of his skill as an architect . In the year 1775 , we find that he was appointed by the General Assembly , in company with the Hon. Esek Hopkins to co through the colony and decide what places should fortified , and in what manner . This shows the estimate which the public put upon his judgment and abilities as a man of science . He died on the 3d of December , 1785 , at the age off one . His funeral was attended by a numerous train of mourning relatives and friends , and a discourse suitable to the occasion was delivered by his pastor , Dr. Manning . The following , which we copy from his tombstone , is a brief summary of his character and virtues : /z/ f on .

He became an adept in Electricity , And well versed in Experimental Philosophy . But his great strength appeared in his Favorite study of Mechanics . He was a Patriot from principle , And zealous for his country s freedom and independence . In his life were exemplified charity and munificence , Preeminently , with other virtues of an Honest man . Erected by his disconsolate widow And four children . &gt; MANNING AND CHAP . III . Mr. Brown married Elizabeth , daughter of Nicholas Power , Esq . In 1774 he erected for his residence the ele gant house now owned and occupied by the Providence Bank . Here , in happiness and peace , he spent the closing years of his life . Of his children , Mary , the oldest , was married , in 1799 , to the Rev. Dr. Gano , who for nearly forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She died the following year , Dec. 8th , in the forty-first year of her age . A funeral sermon on the occasion of her decease was preached by President Maxcy , which sermon was afterwards published . She appears to have been a woman of great worth , possessing many and rare accom plishments . Obadiah , who was never married , died Feb. 14 , 1815 , at the age of fifty-three . Eliza , the third child , mar ried Richard Ward , a merchant of New York , son of Gov . Samuel Ward , of Rhode Island . She died in 1845 , without issue . Joseph , the youngest , died in 1791 , at the age of six teen . The only living representative of the family is Mrs. Eliza B. Rogers , wife of Joseph Rogers , and only daughter of Dr. Gano , by his wife Mary . At her death , therefore , she having no children , this branch of the Brown family be comes extinct . Mrs. Rogers has recently given to the University a scholarship , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her distinguished grandfather . We close this sketch of Mr. Brown with the following extract from a pamphlet , published nearly a century ago , entitled , " An Account of the Observation of Venus upon the Sun , the third day of June , 17G9 , at Providence , in New England . With some Account of the Use of those Observations . By Benjamin West . Providence : Printed by John Carter , at Shakspear s Head , 1769 . " Mr. West , it may be added , was Professor of Mathematics , Astronomy , /z/ and Natural Philosophy in Rhode Island College , from 1786 to 1798 . " It remains now to give an account of the preparations that were made in Providence for the observation of this transit ; 1 in doing of which I shall be as particular as possible , that the reader may the better judge of the merit of our work . " When it became more generally known that there would be a transit of Venus in 1769 , and the advantages that were like to accrue to as tronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations of it , Mr. Joseph Brown , 2 a very respectable merchant of Providence , being very desirous , if possible , to obtain an observation of it , was pleased to advise with me concerning an apparatus suitable for such an observation , and to know if we should be able to observe the transit with the necessary precision for answering the important design . " As the proposal was new and unexpected , my answer was not di rect , as it required some time to consider of it . At length I gave him my opinion concerning an apparatus proper for such an occasion ; and that I thought we could observe the transit with that accuracy as would render it worthy of notice , provided we could have such an apparatus as was described . My answer gave him so much satisfaction in the matter , that he immediately sent his orders to his correspondent in London to procure the instruments . His orders were accordingly executed with fidel ity and dispatch . They arrived in Providence about one month before the 1 The street called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The observations were taken on the hill where the street is laid out . 2 " Mr. Brown is a gentleman of a solid , active genius , strongly turned to the study of mechanics and natural philosophy , which has induced him to construct and furnish himself with as curious and complete an apparatus for electrical experiments as any , perhaps , in America , and of which he well knows the use . Heading Mr. Winthrop s account of the transit in 1761 , was what first occasioned him to send for a telescope , fitted in the manner Mr. Winthrop there describes . Afterwards , taking notice of the application of the American Philosophical Society to the Assembly of Pennsylvania for an apparatus for observing the transit of Venus , he found the orders he had sent were incomplete . He then ad vised with the author , as mentioned , and thereupon ordered a micrometer to be added . Mr. Brown s expense in this laudable undertaking was little less than 100 sterling , besides near a month s time of himself and servants in making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAP . III . transit . Our apparatus was made by Messieurs Watkins and Smith , London . It consisted of a three-feet reflecting telescope , with horizontal and vertical wires for taking differences of altitudes and azimuths , ad justed with spirit-levels at right angles , and a divided arch for taking al titudes ; a curious helioscope , together with a micrometer of a new and elegant construction , with rack motions , and fitted to the telescope . Such a noble disposition in Mr. Brown for promoting useful knowledge cer tainly merits the applause of the public ; and , in justice to him , I must acknowledge , our work could not have been done with equal accuracy had it not been for his skill and contrivance therein . " /z/ John , the third brother in age , was born on the 27th of January , 1736 . He was the most active and energetic of the family ; and in developing the industry and extending the commerce of the town , he has left his impress upon the entire community , in a degree seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is said , who carried trade to China and the East Indies . He fostered the interests of the church over which his ancestors had been elders or ministers , contributing liberally of his wealth for the support of preaching , and in creating a permanent fund for the society . In founding , endowing , and sustain ing the college , he was ever prominent and active , as our pages throughout show . Though a wealthy merchant , and having larger interests at stake than most men , he was a patriotic leader in the cause of the American Revo lution ; l and , at a later period , when his native State stood 1 In reference to Mr. Brown at the breaking out of the war in 1775 , we find the following , in a memoir of Elkanah Watson , published in the April number of the New England Historical and Genealogical Register for 1863 . Mr. Watson was an apprentice to Mr. Brown at this period . " Mr. Brown , finding the army desitute of every munition of war , particularly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their return voyages , to freight /z/ aloof from the Union , and refused to adopt the Federal Constitution , he was distinguished as a champion of the Federal party ; and he without doubt did more than any other man towards securing the final adoption of the Con stitution by the people of Rhode Island . In 1784 he was chosen a delegate to Congress , in place of Jonathan Ar nold , who had removed to Vermont . While here he was appointed one of the commissioners for erecting the Fed eral buildings , which it was then proposed to locate on the banks of the Delaware . At the spring election in 1785 , he was again returned to Congress as a delegate , and in 1799 he was elected a member , serving two years . This was about the last of his public life . He died on the 20th of September , 1803 , in the sixty-eighth year of his age . with that article ; and when the array at Boston had not four rounds to a man , most fortunately one of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pow der , and it was immediately forwarded , under the charge of young Watson , to Cambridge , attended by six or eight recruits to guard it Soon after this war , Brown , having contracted to supply the army of Washington with flour , sailed for Providence with a cargo from Newport . This vessel was seized , and Mr. Brown was himself made prisoner , and sent to Boston in irons , charged with heading a party , in 1772 , which burned his Majesty s schooner Gaspee in Providence river . " The whole community were indignant and exasperated at his seizure . A consultation was held immediately , and it was decided to send an express to Plymouth in order to lit out two armed schooners to intercept , if possible , the captured flour vessel , in her passage round Cape Cod . " Some sixty or eighty men embarked in two fishing schooners , equipped with two old cannon each ; but alter cruising about Cape Cod for ten days , they re turned without success . Mr. Brown was soon after released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Mr. Brown was taken prisoner Wednes day , April 26 , 1775 , and released the following week . ) As a further illustration of Mr. Brown s prominence and activity in the war , it may be stated that in the eighth volume ( just published ) of Bartlett s Colonial Records , including a period of four years ( 1770-79 ) , his name appears , in connec tion with important committees and various public services , no less than twentysix times . No other name has such frequent mention in the volume to which we have referred . /z/ The following inscription on his tombstone describes briefly , but well , his character and worth : Underneath this stone Are deposited the mortal Kemains of 0 ! jtt groixrit , The enterprising and accomplished Merchant , The tried Patriot and wise Legislator , The universal Philanthropist and sincere Christian .

Married November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brown has been happily described as " a man of magnificent projects and of extraordinary enterprise . " Whatever he did was in accordance with his enlarged views , and oftentimes far in advance of the age in which he lived . In his day Main Street was a sandy and disagree able walk . He first caused it to be paved ; and although at that time he had twenty sail of ships abroad upon the sea , he might be seen busily engaged upon the work him self , in order to be sure that it was properly done . " Uni versity Hall , " of which he laid the corner-stone , and in the planning and construction of which he bore so prominent a part , is even now one of the finest and best of the col lege buildings . No other man would have had the resolu tion and courage as " the committee man " to carry on the building of the Baptist meeting-house , at a time when Providence was comparatively a small town , and when /z/ hostilities between the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own stately mansion , built of imported brick and freestone , after English models , in the year 1786 , was long noted as one of the largest and finest private residences in all New England . It was at his former residence on South Main Street that he gave , in honor of Gen. Nathauael Green , the greatest private dinner , it is said , that had ever been given in Rhode Island . His Commencement dinners , to which all graduates and friends were freely invited , at a period when public dinners were not provided by the college , as at present , 1 were remem bered with pleasure years after the hospitable entertainer had passed away . In appearance and manners Mr. Brown was not perhaps so prepossessing as his brother Nicholas . He was short in stature , and inclined to corpulency . In his bearing he was somewhat imperious at times , and seemed like one born to command . Had he entered the army , he would undoubtedly have attained to military distinction , possess ing as he did the essential qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were first provided after the death of President Manning , as appears from the following entry in the records of the corporation : " COLLEGE HILL , Sept. 4 , 1792 .

" Voted , That Dr. Euos Hitchcock , Mr. Welcome Arnold , and Col. Daniel Tillinghast be a committee for directing the steward in providing the public dinner the next Commencement .

Francis , relates , that , while riding about the city with him , a fire broke out at India Point . He immediately hastened to the spot , and at once his stento rian voice was heard above the noise and din , giving com mands with clearness and precision . Order took the place of confusion . The crowd looked to him as their natural leader in this emergency , notwithstanding the presence of several fire organizations ; and soon the fire was extin guished . This was about a year before his death . Mr. Brown , as the inscription on his tombstone states , married a daughter of Daniel Smith , of Providence , by whom he had two sons and four daughters ; namely , James , who died Dec. 12 , 1834 , aged seventy-three ; Benjamin , who died July 7 , 1774 , aged ten ; Abigail , who died in infancy ; Abby , who married , Jan. 1 , 1788 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Alice , who mar ried James Brown Mason , a graduate of the college in the Class of 1791 . Mr. Brown is known in history by his connection with the affair of the Gaspee , without some mention of which our sketch of him would be incomplete . We have there fore compiled the following account from Judge Staples s " Documentary History of the Destruction of the Gaspee , " published in 1845 , and also from Lossing , Arnold , and other writers , as a fitting close to this brief biography . To his grandson , the Hon. J. B. Francis , we are indebted for some particulars of this transaction not found in the published accounts . In March , 1772 , the Gaspee , a British armed schooner , first appeared in the waters of Narragansett Bay , having been despatched thither by the commissioners of customs at Boston to prevent infractions of the revenue laws . Her /z/ appearance disquieted the people , and her interference with the free navigation of the bay irritated them , upon a spirited correspondence ensued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , and Lieut . Duddingston and Admiral Montague on the other . On the 9th of June , 1772 , Capt . Lindsey left New port for Providence in his packet the Hannah . The Gaspee as usual gave chase , but ran aground on Namquit , since called Gaspee Point , below Pawtuxet , and the Hannah escaped , arriving safely at Providence about sunset . Capt . Lindsey at once communicated the fact of the grounding of the Gaspee to Mr. Brown , who thought this a good opportunity to put an end to the vexations caused by her presence . He immediately ordered the preparation of eight of the largest long-boats in the harbor , to be placed under the general command of Capt . Abraham Whipple , after wards commodore , who was one of his most trusty ship masters . Information of the enemy s situation was pro claimed by beat of drum ; a man named Daniel passing along Main Street and inviting such of the inhab itants as were willing to engage in a perilous enterprise for the destruction of the Gaspee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the residence of Richard J. Arnold , Esq . The boats left Providence between ten and elevei o clock , filled with sixty-four well-armed men , and between one and two in the morning they reached the Gaspee . Two shots were exchanged , one of which wounded Lieut . Duddingston in the groin . This was the first British blood shed in the war of Independence . The schooner was now boarded without much opposition , and the crew and officers were compelled to leave with their effects , when she was set on fire and blown up . Mr. Brown was the last man to leave the deck , being determined that no one should /z/ from the vessel anything which might lead to the identi fication and detection of the parties . By so doing he nar rowly escaped with his life , in consequence of the falling timbers and spars . When the news of this daring feat reached England , the King s proclamation was issued , offering a reward of one thousand pounds sterling for the arrest and conviction of the two leaders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the offenders , with a free pardon in addition , to any one concerned , except the two chiefs , who would implicate the rest . A commission of inquiry , under the great seal of England , was established , which sat from the 4th until the 22d of January , 1773 . It then adjourned until the 26th of May , when it assembled and sat until the 23d of June . But not a solitary clew to the identity of the perpetrators of the deed could be obtained , notwith standing they were well known to the people . Many of them were among the most prominent citizens of the col ony . The price of treachery on the part of any accomplice would have been exile from home and country ; and the proffered reward was not adequate to such a sacrifice . Moreover , those whose weak moral principles or strong acquisitiveness might have tempted them into a compli ance with the terms of the proclamation , were bribed , it is said , to silence , by Mr. Brown and some of his associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Abra ham Whipple , John B. Hopkins , Benjamin Dunn , Dr. John Mawney , Benjamin Page , Joseph Bucklin , Turpin Smith , Ephraim Bo wen , and Capt . Joseph Tillinghast . Mr. Brown , says Gov . Francis , afterwards deeply regretted this affair , as foolhardy in itself , and resulting in so much needless ap prehension to himself and family . For a long time he was accustomed to sleep away from home , lest he should /z/ be arrested during the night . The first booming of the guns at Lexington and Concord filled his mind with glad ness . He was a stranger himself to fear , but he rejoiced when the anxieties and fears of others were merged in the open contest now commenced . History has given to the leader in this Rhode Island enterprise the fame which he so richly deserves . /z/ Moses , the youngest of the brothers , was born on the 23d of September , 1738 . His father dying while he was in his infancy , his youth and early manhood were spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy merchant of Providence , whose daughter he married , and a portion of whose estate he inherited by will . In 1763 , one year pre vious to his marriage , he engaged in mercantile pursuits , in connection with his three brothers ; but after ten years of active life he withdrew from the bustle of trade to that retirement to which his feeble health invited , and which was more congenial to his early-formed taste for intellec tual pursuits . Here on his beautiful estate in the environs of Providence , in rural quiet and simplicity , he spent a long and useful life , aiding by his judicious counsels and abundant wealth in the promotion of intelligence , piety , and freedom among men . In his religious sentiments Mr. Brown , like the rest of his family , was a Baptist . At the early age of thirty-five he became a member of the society of Friends ; and from that time until the close of life , a period of more than sixty years , he was a firm adherent to the primitive doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its concerns , both secular and religious ; sustained many of its most important offices with dignity /z/ and usefulness ; was long regarded as the patriarch of the society ; and was greatly respected and beloved for his many Christian virtues , not only by his own brethren , but by other denominations . He was the founder and patron of the excellent institution known as the " Friends Board ing School " in Providence , a school which , under the auspices of the yearly meeting of the society , has done much to diffuse the influences of intellectual culture amono- o the members of that estimable Christian denomination . Among Mr. Brown s donations to this institution , may be mentioned one of forty-three acres of land , on which the school edifices now stand , and , at his decease , a house and lot near the school , a valuable collection of books , and fifteen thousand dollars in money . Besides these , his fa therly regard for the children of others induced him to ap propriate one hundred dollars annually during life for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was , in accordance with the principles of the religious denomination to which he belonged , a friend of peace , and opposed to slavery in all its forms . He manumitted his slaves in 1773 ; was one of the founders , and for many years an efficient member of , the Abolition Society of Rhode Isl and , and was also an active member and liberal supporter of the Rhode Island Peace and Bible Societies . Though his constitution was originally feeble , yet he nearly com pleted his ninety-eighth year ; until his last illness retaining in a remarkable degree the use of his faculties of body and of mind . He spent much of his time in reading and writ ing , maintained an extensive correspondence , and rarely made use of a clerk or an amanuensis . He made his will at the age of ninety-six ; a long instrument , exemplifying , in an interesting manner , his attachment to his friends , and his desire to promote the cause of education , philanthropy , and /z/ religion . His death took place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masonic fraternity , being one of the earliest members of St. John s Lodge , Providence . He received his first degree on the 4th of Oc tober , 1758 . In December following , he was elected secre tary of the Lodge , an office which he retained eleven years . During this time the Lodge held ninety-seven meetings , at eighty of which he was present , an instance , says the Rev. Dr. Randall , of fidelity to official duties well worthy the imitation of the generations that have succeeded him . The discipline of the society of Friends , with which he subse quently connected himself , forbade all union with Masonry ; nevertheless , he continued to cherish a high regard for the institution , although compelled to withdraw from active connection with the fraternity . His brother John , it may be added , was initiated a member of the Lodge on the 29th of March , 1758 , and his brother Joseph on the 6th of April , 1757 . A fine portrait of this venerable philanthropist has been placed in Manning Hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was painted by Mr. Heade , from an original sketch by W. J. Harris . Mr. Brown was three times married ; but he outlived all his family lacking only two years , two weeks , and two days of being one hundred years old . By his first wife , Anna Brown , he had three children , a son and two daughters . One of the latter died in infancy . His daughter Sarah , who was married to William Almy , died in 1794 . His son Obadiah died in 1822 , in the vigor and strength of manhood . His only grandchild was the late Mrs. Anna Almy Jenkins , whose untimely death , at the burning of her mansion , cast such a gloom over the entire community . Tt&gt; Moses Brown /z/ Jenkins , the only son of this grand-daughter , he bequeathed the house and lands where , in peaceful retirement , he had spent sixty-five years of his life , and where he breathed out his latest breath . In closing these imperfect sketches of the Browns , we can but express our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas ( except in the case of Moses Brown ) , the looks and features of these great-hearted men , to whose Christian activity and benevolence the present generation is so largely indebted .

Abraham Booth , of London , author of " Reign of Grace . " THE connection of Dr. Manning with the Biptist church in Providence was an important event in his life , and is therefore deserving of special notice . This church was founded by Roger Williams , during the year 1639 ; and it is the oldest Baptist church in America . With its history prior to 1770 we have now no special concern . At that time it numbered one hundred and eighteen communi cants , and was under the pastoral care of the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting house , and finding the duties of his office too arduous for him , he made known to his people his earnest desire to be released from services which he could no longer perform without infringing upon family obligations , which he re garded as paramount to all others . The settlement of Dr. Manning in Providence was hailed by the church as a happy event , supposing , as they did , that , by calling him to be their pastor , they could carry into effect the wishes of Mr. Winsor . He was at once invited to occupy the pul pit . He accepted the invitation , and preached a sermon on a Sunday which happened to be the day for the admin istration of the Lord s Supper . Several of the members of the church were , however , dissatisfied that " the privilege of transient communion " should have been allowed to Dr. Manning ; believing that he held the doctrine of imposition of hands rather too loosely , and that he practised it more to accommodate the consciences of others than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the formation of a party , and to a series of church meetings , in which the majority , however , was , in every instance , found to be on the side of Manning . With this party Mr. /z/ Winsor himself sympathized and acted . This , however , was thought by some to be only " the ostensible reason " of dissatisfaction with Mr. Manning . The true cause of opposition to him was " his holding to singing in public worship , which was highly disgustful to Mr. Winsor . " On this point the sentiments of the Quakers appear to have prevailed in the church , and singing was discarded as unauthorized by the New Testament . What diversity of opinion once existed touching a point which seems clear to us , may readily be seen by consulting the controversial works , on this subject , of Keach , Russell , Allen , Marlow , Claridge , and others , published in London towards the close of the seventeenth century . Finally , adopting for the most part the language of the church records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church a writing , signed by a number of the members , stating that they were in conscience bound to withdraw from such as did not " hold strictly to the six principles of the doctrine of Christ as laid down in Hebrews vi . 1 , 2 . " In May following he accordingly withdrew , and joined the " Separates . " After advising with the Rev. Gardner Thurston of Newport , Rev. Messrs . Job and Russel Mason of Swanzey , and others , the church appointed a meeting to consider the propriety of calling President Manning to administer ordinances ; whereupon the following resolution was passed : " At a meeting of the members of the Old Baptist Church in Provi dence , in church meeting assembled this 31st day of July , 1771 , Daniel Jenckes , Esq. , moderator : Whereas , Elder Samuel Winsor , now of Johnston , has withdrawn himself , and a considerable number of members of this church , from their communion with us who live intown ; and we , being destitute of a minister to administer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose and appoint a suitable person for /z/ this purpose . Upon due consideration , the members choose and appoint Elder James Manning to preach and administer the communion accord ing to our former usage . " To the above resolve Mr. Manning returned the follow ing answer : " As the church is destitute of an administrator , and think the cause of religion suffers through the neglect of the ordinances of God s house , I consent to undertake to administer pro tempore ; that is , until there may be a more full disquisition of the matter , or time to seek other help ; at least , until time may prove whether it will be consistent with my other engagements , and for the general interests of religion . " Thus commenced a relation , which , through various vicissitudes and trials , incident to the disturbed times that soon followed , continued , with credit to the pastor and with great advantage to the church and congregation , down to a short period before Mr. Manning s death , in 1791 . At first his preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkable revival of religion at tended his labors , as the fruits of which one hundred and four persons were added to the church . " It is delightful , " says the Rev. Dr. Hague in his Historical Discourse , " to place ourselves in imagination amidst the scenes of that year , to picture before us the able and faithful preacher who then officiated here as he stood up amidst the large assemblies of the people who thronged around him , listen ing , as they did , to the gospel with intense attention , as a message from the skies the very word of God , which worketh effectually in them that believe , to mark the lively interest which was kindled in every bosom and beamed from every eye , as one after another came forth on the side of the Lord , and professed his faith in public baptism , to contemplate the fresh springs of spiritual /z/ life which were then opened in many a house when the family altar was first erected there , and parents and chil dren bowed together to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The following letter to the Rev. Dr. Stennett gives a pleasing account of Manning s feelings in view of the responsibility of his position as head of the college and pastor of the church : PROVIDENCE , June 5 , 1771. /z/ Your most agreeable favor of August 10th , 1770 , came to hand the 19th of January , 1771 , after our ships had sailed for London ; and conse quently I have had no opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of it be fore . There are two ships from this town which make two voyages a year to London , besides others from the colony , by which letters will have a safe conveyance . The captains names are Shand and Gilbert . I men tion this that there may be the most direct conveyance . I thank you for the expressions of kindness and respect in your letter , and am as desirous as before to keep up a correspondence as often as op portunity will admit . Mr. Gordon , the gentleman by whom you wrote , has never called on me , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ar rival in America . Your good wishes to the college are very acceptable , and we doubt not your readiness to contribute all in your power to its future growth and increase . The popularity , usefulness , etc. , of our first sons , is to me an object truly desirable ; but these things I leave to the wise conduct of the supreme Governor of the church . One of the youth , 1 graduated at our first Commencement , who is thought to be savingly brought home by grace , has joined Mr. Thurston s church in Newport , and appears eminently pious . As soon as his age will admit , for he is quite a youth , he will be called to the work of the ministry , with hopes of his making a distinguished figure in the pulpit . He bcai*s the greatest resemblance to Mr. Hezekiah Smith of any person I know , and I hope will make such another son of thunder . I am constrained to think that Providence placed me at the head of the college ; but for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for my ease and worldly advantage it could i William Rogers . /z/ not certainly be , for I have been constrained to forego these , and many more things desirable in life , on this account ; and in the discharge of my office here I have found my way strewn with thorns hitherto . Dr. Llewelyn s friendship for the college is highly satisfactory to us . He has it in his power , and , we have reason to believe , in his heart , to do it great service . I should highly prize a correspondence with a gentle man of his merit , were a door properly open for it ; but to address him with a letter , uninvited , and without particular cause for so doing , migbt be deemed too great forwardness in me . I therefore choose to defer it at present . We were sensibly affected at the news of Mr. Roffey s death , as he promised usefulness to the public ; but God can raise up men to carry on his own cause , in an unexpected way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to rejoice . But nothing gives one such sat isfaction as the account you give me of the success of the gospel in Eng land . I firmly believe there are yet glorious days for the church militant , and that the doctrine of believer s baptism will prevail in proportion to the prevalence of the religion of the heart . I do not imagine this only from my own sentiments that it is an important and glorious ordinance of the Lord Jesus , but from facts ; for I have observed for some years past that in this country it has been invariably the case where there has been a pow erful moving of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men . I will give you a recent instance . God has been doing wonders in Virginia and North Carolina within these few years past . Thousands have been hope fully converted to God in these two provinces ; and my Brother Gano , who travelled through these provinces last summer and fall , informs me that not less than two thousand have been baptized by immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been observed there , that persons were no sooner brought into the glorious liberty of the gospel than they fol lowed the example of their Divine Master by going down into the water ; and that , too , where the name of Baptist was scarcely known . This work , I am told , still continues , and extends five hundred miles in length through the country . Truly , light has risen to those who were in the re religion and shadow of death ; for when I travelled through that country about ten years ago , I thought as Abraham did of Zoar , that the fear of God was not in that place . To me it seemed to be the rendezvous of devils . But what can not God do ? This indeed is all my consolation when I view the unpromising appearance of religion in many places , that God not only can , but will work , and none shall let or hinder it . There is a gradual increase of the work of religion in sundry places in /z/ New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned in his labors , and that he was lately called to administer baptism to numbers at a distance from where he resides , and to constitute two or three Baptist churches . I can say but little of my success in the vineyard of the Lord , although I hope there are some promising appearances of conviction amongst us . The last Lord s Day there appeared an unusual solemnity in the assembly , and I trust God enabled me , though a worm , to speak with some happy degree of zeal and earnestness in warning souls of their danger ; and if flowing eyes may be thought a presage of the return of wanderers to God , I am not without hope of some seals of my ministry . But alas my unprofitableness ! my unworthincss to be employed in so sacred a work ! If ever one soul is converted by my instrumentality , it will clearly appear that the excellency of the power is all of God . But I cease to trouble you with my unprofitable complaints , and pro ceed to give you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provinces of Massachusetts Bay , New Hampshire , and Connecticut ; in the latter of which , I am told , some of our brethren arc now in jail for ministerial rat6s , and in the other two many are forci bly despoiled of their property for the same purpose . The Presbyterians , I believe , are determined , where they have the power , to use it against us to prevent our growth ; for no effectual remedy can yet be obtained , though it has been carefully and industriously sought . They arc afraid , if they relax the secular arm , their tenets have not merit enough and a sufficient foundation to stand . This has been so plainly hinted by some of the committees of the General Court , upon treating with our people , that I think it can not be deemed a breach of charity to think thus of them . However , I will not pretend to justify everything which has been said and done by Baptists during this controversy . I fear there has been too great warmth in some publications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocation to write and speak some bitter things . However , I am far from believing that the cause of God requires acrimony in defending it , especially as the great Example of his people " reviled not again when he was reviled . " Upon the whole , it is very uncertain what will be the issue of the matter , whether we must address the throne of our sovereign for relief , or not . The contention has been improved as an argument against sending scholars from that denomination to our college . How long this will continue I know not ; but at present the clergy use all their endeavors to this purpose . I am glad to hear that there are three Baptists in the trust of Dr. /z/ Moore s fund who will see that the money is appropriated according to the original proposal ; for our brethren of that denomination need good looking after in these matters , if we may judge from what has happened before . I suppose you have heard that Dr. Wheelock has obtained a charter for a college in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land as an endowment , from the Governor and other gentlemen who are largely concerned in lands there . He has begun his business , and carried it forward with great rapidity . In short , from what I can gather , it is to be a grand Presbyterian college , instead of a school for the poor Indians . There Avere but two Indians there at school last fall , and they were Narragansetts from this colony , brought up like us . Moreover , it is more than a hundred miles distant from any number of Indians . I have conversed with two intelligent gentlemen from that part of the coun try , and , from what I can gather , the money raised in England by Whitaker and Oakam will be as greatly prostituted as ever the fund for propagating the gospel in foreign parts has been by another denomination of Christians . As to political matters , all is peace and quietness with us , though we hear that the city of London and the House of Commons have proceeded to great lengths in opposing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver are committed to the Tower . We are anxious for the re sult of this procedure ; but hope that God will order all matters for the best , and bring good out of evil . We now proceed slowly with the college , as our succors from abroad fail . I hope we may have some more assistance from Great Britain as soon as may be . If your patience is not quite gone , permit me to request the favor of a letter by our vessels this summer , in which you need not fear trespassing upon my patience , though I have reason to fear I have upon yours , and therefore subscribe , what I am in truth , dear sir , Your very affectionate friend and brother in the Lord , /z/ Allusion having been made in the foregoing communica tion to an effort on the part of the denomination to seek redress from their grievances by direct application to the " throne of our sovereign , " or king , the following circular /z/ is presented as a sort of appendix thereto . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read with interest as an illustration of the spirit and zeal of our fathers , among whom Manning was regarded as a " prince and a leader . " It has never before , we believe , been printed . /z/ The they represent , and all others of the denomination of Baptists , send greeting : " We met in peace , and upon reading the letters from the several churches , found that they were generally at peace among themselves , some of them having had considerable additions , the number of which , in all the churches , amounts to fifty-six . We find that God hath not left himself without a witness , but is still carrying on the work of grace in the churches . We would not despise the day of small things ; yet at the same time desire you to unite in solemn prayer to the great Head of the church , that he would hasten the time when converts shall come as the clouds , and fly as doves to their windows . Oh happy period , which God in his wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord ! We have however to inform you , dearly beloved , that some of our churches are sorely oppressed on account of religion . Their enemies continue to triumph over them ; and as repeated applications have been made to the court of justice and to the general courts for redress of such grievances , but as yet have been neglected , it is now become necessary to carry the affair to England in order to lay it before the King . It is therefore warmly recommended to you to endeavor to collect money to defray the expense which will arise from such a proceeding . Should you not contribute in this matter , some of our brethren must unavoidably be ruined as to this world ; especially our brethren at Ashfield , some of whose lands have been taken from them and sold for a trifle . Brethren , make the case your own , and then do as you would be done by . We also recommend to you to search for prom ising gifts among yourselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great want of ministerial help in the churches . In fine , brethren , live in love ; preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace ; keep your /z/ garments unspotted by the flesh , and may the God of peace and love be with you . P. S. The churches are requested to be expeditious in sending their contributions to the Rev. Samuel Stillman , of Boston , who is appointed treasurer , and to take his receipts . If our agent , Mr. Hezekiah Smith , should not go to England , the money will be returned when demanded . It is also requested that the churches will unite in keeping the first Thurs day in October next as a day of fasting and prayer , to entreat God to favor our undertaking to obtain liberty of conscience , and to save our prop erty , and consequently our families , from ruin ; also that He will be gra ciously pleased to revive religion , and to deliver our nation from its pres ent difficulties . To his friend the Rev. Hezekiah Smith he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be observed , not unfrequently use the term Presbyterians for Congregationalists . The two denominations are much more distinct at the present day than they were a century ago . NEWPORT , May 1 , 1771. /z/ I perceive , by an application made to a neighboring Baptist church , that the people in Richmond , in Hampshire Government ( I mean the Baptist church there ) , are in great distress on account of the taxes for the clergy ; and so are the Baptists in sundry other towns thereabouts . The charter gave a farm to the first settled minister in that town ; and Mr. Balow , the Baptist minister , was the first , though a Eriend speaker was there before him . Now the Friends have united with the Presbyterians , and voted the farm for the use of the town . Upon the whole they seem troubled much , and some are likely to be totally ruined by the Presbyte rians . Now if you can lend any aid or assistance , you will do them a sin gular favor ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible , you might make interest with the Governor , or some of the great men , to re dress these grievances . I received a letter from Mr. Edwards , dated March , which informs me that he has a law of New Hampshire which obliges the Baptists to pay their ministers , that is , Presbyterian minis ters , and he is greatly afraid they will fall into the snare . Pray do your utmost to prevent the Baptists from taking the benefit of that law ; for the /z/ Presbyterians will triumph in that case . Mr. Rogers , the bearer , will give you information of my affairs , and other matters in these parts ; so that nothing remains but to desire you with Mrs. Smith to pay us a visit soon , to whom with yourself I give my sincere love , and remain , sir , Your very loving friend , /z/ The following letter was the commencement of a corres pondence with the Rev. John Ryland , of Northampton , England , for many years principal of a flourishing acade my in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a Baptist preacher , and was held in high esteem by Dr. Johnson and other eminent men of his time . He published " Contemplations on the Beauties of Creation , " in three volumes octavo , " Essay on the Advancement of Learning , " and various sermons and pamphlets . He died in 1792 . PROVIDENCE , June 1 , 1771. /z/ By the Rev. Morgan Edwards , last year . I was directed to draw upon you , the first of June , for five guineas , which you proposed to contribute annually to the support of the President of Rhode Island College during life , if your circumstances would admit of it . I drew accordingly in favor of Messrs . Joseph and William Russell , merchants of Providence ; and , according to my instructions , have done the like this year , in favor of the same gentlemen . Your zeal for the welfare of this young seminary , discovered in this as well as many other instances , has gained you the high esteem of all the true friends of the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid me under the strongest obligations of gi atitude , of which I hope not to be unmindful , in any instance , when in my power to express a proper sense of them ; and at present I can only do this by the strong est expressions of thankfulness , and fervent prayer to God that he would abundantly reward your beneficence in this and in the life to come . I was particularly obliged in your favoring me with the patterns of the regular Greek and Latin nouns and verbs , etc. , and find it the most easy method of leading boys into a general notion of grammar in a short time . The college in this place consists of twenty-three youths , five of whom are /z/ to leave us in the fall ; though we hope to have some additions at that time . The institution calls for the vigorous exertions of all its friends , as well on account of the smallness of its funds as the unreasonable opposi tion made against it by Pedobaptists ; especially the New England Pres byterians in general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part I have had to act in the matter has exposed me to numberless difficulties hitherto ; although I am cheerful under the hopes of its rising , at some future period , to be the joy of its friends and the denomination , as well as the mortification of its ungenerous enemies . The state of reli religion in New England is at a low ebb in general , except a few places , amongst which Mr. Stillman s of Boston is one , where there have been lately large additions to the church . Should there be any gentlemen of your acquaintance in England on whom diplomas might be well bestowed , we should always be glad to be advised thereof , and confer them accord ingly . Forgive this unsolicited scrawl , and believe that it had its birth in the unfeigned gratitude and real friendship of , sir , Your humble servant , /z/ To this letter Ryland thus replies : TO MY WORTHY FRIEND , Mil . JAMES MANNING , /z/ REVEREND AND DEAR SIR : I received your letter in due course by the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me for 5 5s. when it came for payment , which it did in the beginning of December . Where it lodged all that time after you drew it , I know not . Be assured that I have the interests of your college deeply at my heart ; and in order to serve it I have picked out the enclosed list of scholars , for whom I solicit some of your academical feathers , to the end that we may attach as great a number of active and learned men to your seminary as we can . Who knows but some of them may do you more service in the long run than we can at present imagine 1 I am determined to send over some names every year as long as I live ; but be assured I shall not rec ommend one that shall be a dishonor to your college , if I know it . Have you had a short account of the ministers and churches of the Bap tist denomination in England ? If not I shall take care to send it . At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fourteen churches and ministers . About twenty-four ministers , perhaps twenty-six , can read the original languages in which the Bible was written . Amongst /z/ them I have a son ( John ) , nineteen years of age , who was called to the ministry last year . He read his Greek Testament into English all through before lie was nine years old , and is very ready at Hebrew , Latin , and French . Grace called him at fourteen years of age . I baptized him when he was about fifteen , and we received hirn into the church . He proves a good , zealous boy , and the people of God love to hear him preach . He has ventured to publish a volume of poems on experimental religion , the whole edition of which , five hundred , has gone off in less than a year . If I can procure a copy , I will send you one for your public library . Per haps it may be a stimulus to some lazy student on your side of the water . My opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that young boys and students need all sorts of motives to keep them in a steady , regular , resolute pursuit of learning and religion/ and for this purpose academi cal honors were wisely instituted ; and t is for this reason I desire for my brethren in the ministry who desire it the honors of your college , in order to incite others to the same diligence . I am sorry to say it , but t is too true , that above one hundred and seventy Baptist ministers in England have been kept from reading the Hebrew Bible and Greek Testament more by laziness and cowardice than by the difficulty of attaining it . I want to rouse these sluggards into diligence , and for that purpose I ear nestly beg your assistance . N. B. Out of ten thousand clergy , we have seventy or eighty that preach the gospel . The Presbyterians are almost all gone off to Socinianism . We have a few in London that are excellent men ; namely , Dr. Langford , Dr. Trotter , Gco . Stephens A.M. , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not at present give you an exact list of our Inde pendent ministers in London and the country , but shall try to send you an account .

The writer supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Congregationalists , had not the Bap tists complained of the oppression of their brethren in New England , and threatened to carry their complaints to the throne of the King , in case the oppression should be con- 1 The seventeen names mentioned in the above list all received the honor ary degree of A.M. at the annual Commencement of the college in 1773 and in 1774 . ( See Triennial Catalogue . ) It does not , however , appear that Mr. liyland s good wishes in regard to the benefit which the college might thereby derive were ever realized , at least to any great extent . The unhappy feeling engendered by the war of the Revolution was , probably , the cause of this apparent neglect or indifference . /z/ tinned . The letter , which is published in Staples s Annals of Providence , is a brief recapitulation of facts already stated in other forms . Mr. Edwards was evidently accus tomed to express his opinions without reserve , and some times , perhaps , with a little too much pungency . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not facts , recent facts , decided the matter in my favor , and shown that the goodness and candor of the President have imposed on his judgment . Remember you not the first charter 1 While the Baptist college was yet in emhvyo they very disingenuously opposed it , as such , and contrived to make it their own ; since which disappointment Dr. Stiles would have nothing to do with it , though courted again and again to accept even a fellowship therein . And when the present charter was presented to the Assembly at South Kingston , remember you not what clamor they raised against it there ? And Avhat stout opposition they made to the passage of it , insomuch that its friends thought it best to desist ? And how they triumphed afterwards ? And when the affair was brought on again at East Greenwich , the next session , you can never forget with what heat and coarse expression the same oppositions were renewed , nor the morti fication and murmurings which the passing of it occasioned . It is true , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , appeared well pleased when you had set it on foot at Warren . But the reason of that is obvious . They knew that while the college stood friendless and moneyless , as it then did , they should have the pleasure to see it fall , and to mock those who began to build a tower and were not able to finish it . But seemed they good-humored when money came thither from Europe ? or did they look as the man of Bristol did , at your first Commencement , and put the same invidious construction upon everything that he did on the complaisance you showed him that day ? Their good affection toward the college edifice was but varnish ; for while with specious arguments they would have it here , and anon there , and then in another place , they were only working to prevent it being anywhere ; and soon as it had a locality and the beginning of its existence , at Providence , did they not , with some misled Baptists , attempt to get another college , to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ? This also failing , what remains but to prevent youth from resorting to it ? Their slandering the officers of instruction , as insufficient ; the town where it is /z/ in , as a lawless place ; the college , as wanting government ; their repre senting it as a nest of Anabaptists , calculated to make proselytes ; their visiting grammar schools and tampering with masters and parents ; their scolding Presbyterian youth when they enter with you , as your neighbor Eowley did , who is capable of nothing but what is gross and indelicate ; their refusing to pay their subscriptions , etc. , are all intended to hurt what they could neither prevent nor destroy . Think you that their pres ent opposition to the college is the effect of those newspaper complaints and threatenings of Presbyterian oppression in New England ? Why , then , did they oppose it before those complaints and threatenings had ex istence 1 ? . Think you they will be friends should we desist from these complaints and court their favor ? It can not be , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , and do as they would be done by . Destroying the Baptist college will pacify them , and noth ing else . The existence of that on the hill of Providence is a Mordecai in the gate . I told you , long " ago , that if you could not do without the Presbyterians , you could not do at all . I need not inform you that I deal in generals . I except the honest , the trusty , and the good , and some such Presbyterians I have met with , in their connections with this college . God send us more , and mend the rest . " These ecclesiastical oppressions , and this sectarian bit terness towards the college , have all passed away , and are now forgotten ; if occasionally recalled to remembrance , it is only in the spirit of kindness , as impressive admoni tions to the fuller exercise of that charity which " beareth all things . " As matters of history , they must of necessity appear conspicuous in any faithful account of the life and correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes of intolerance and persecution , which the enemies of religion may view with impious delight . On this point we may be allowed to quote the remarks of Professor Knowles , in " his preface to the Memoir of Roger Williams . " We must not , " he says , " in order to promote or defend religion , attempt to conceal events which history has already recorded , and much less to palliate conduct which /z/ we can not justify . Let us rather confess , with frankness and humility , our own faults , and those of our fathers ; learn wisdom from past errors ; and bring ourselves and others , as speedily as possible , to the adoption of those pure principles by which alone Christianity can be sus tained and diffused . The book of God records , among its salutary lessons , the mistakes and sins of good men . " On Wednesday , Sept. 4 , 1771 , was celebrated the third anniversary Commencement , at which six young men took their Bachelor degrees . From the account of this Com mencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President s address : " A concise , pertinent charge was then delivered to the graduates , by the President ; in which , besides many useful instructions and cautions , he remarked that this institution , though liberal and catholic in its foun dation and government , despising the contracted views of a party , aim ing at the good of mankind in general , and always studious to maintain a good agreement and harmony with others of the like nature , had not been so happy as to pass altogether without censure ; and that not only from the ignorant and pedantic , but even from some of those whose friendship it has sought , and would highly esteem , could it consistently be obtained . He concluded by requesting their friendship and kind offices to that semin ary of learning in which they had received their education ; and with great energy exhorted them that if they could not , by their joint testimony of the generous , free , and impartial manner in which they had been treated in the course of their studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the world the same kind of proof of the useful ness of the institution which some of its first sons now do , who fill public stations with honor to themselves and advantage to mankind . " Among the graduates this year was Samuel Ward , son of Governor Ward , who , at the age of eighteen , com manded a company , under Arnold , through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec . He served with reputation in the army during the Revolutionary War , attaining to the /z/ rank of lieutenant-colonel . Another graduate was Thomas Ustick , who was for many years the esteemed pastor of the Baptist church in Philadelphia , having succeeded the Rev. Dr. William Rogers . The following letter , addressed to Thomas Llewelyn , LL.D. , presents an idea of the condition and prospects of the college , and especially of the library , at this time . It affords an illustration of the author s skill in urcfmsr the /z/ claims of the institution over which he presided upon the attention of strangers of reputed benevolence and wealth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He published , in 1768 , a History of the Welsh Versions of the Bible , and , in the following year , " Histor ical and Critical Remarks on the British Tongue . " He died on the 7th of August , 1783 , bequeathing to the Bris tol Academy , where he pursued his early studies , his large and valuable library . Dr. Gibbons was accustomed , says Rippon , to speak of him " as the first scholar among the Protestant Dissenters . " PROVIDENCE , Feb. 21 , 1772. /z/ I am emboldened to address you , both from the recommendation of Dr. Stcnnett to do so , and from my knowledge of your friendship to the college in this town , of which you would doubtless be glad to know the state . The college edifice is erected on a most beautiful eminence , in the neigh borhood of Providence , commanding a most charming and variegated prospect ; a large , neat brick building , and so far completed as to receive the students , who now reside there , the whole number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions ; yet our numbers will probably be small until we are better fm-nished with a library and philo sophical apparatus . At present we have but about two hundred and fifty volumes , and these not well chosen , being such as our friends could best spare . Our apparatus consists of a pair of globes , two microscopes , and an electrical machine ; to this we are desirous of making the addition of /z/ an air pump , if one reputable can " be purchased for 22 10s. sterling ; a sum which two young men informed me they intended to give towards an apparatus or library . If , therefore , it would not be too much trouble to inform me whether or not that sum is sufficient , I shall receive it as a particular favor ; for if not , we shall appropriate it to some other use . Our whole college fund consists of about 900 sterling , being the whole sum collected abroad ; for no money collected without the colony is made use of in the building , but solely applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s intent . The interest of this sum is quite insufficient to provide for tuition , as two of us are now employed , and we stand in need of further help . May we not expect some further assistance from our friends in England 1 ? or must we conclude that the Baptists , only , are inattentive , to their own cause , while seminaries of other denom inations have the highest reason to extol their generosity ? or is it be cause we use less industry to promote our common cause than others ? If so , what might another personal application to England do on this head , could we find a person among us , of public spirit , who could forego the mortification of a beggar , etc . ? Mr. Edwards happened in England at a most unfavorable juncture , or we should have expected far better success . If you imagine anything considerable can be done , we shall strive hard to obtain some person for this purpose ; if not , permit me to solicit your interest , where you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest proofs of your regard for the infant college , and retain a grateful sense of your unsought favors . I shall take pleasure in communicating any intelligence in my power , whenever you please to lay your commands . My present situation is such as will furnish me with a general acquaintance with the state of the Baptist society in America , especially as I have travelled through the greatest part , and hold correspondence with some in almost all the prov inces . The ship by which this comes is bound directly back to Providence ; and being owned by a zealous friend of the college , any books , or other things , should there be anything to send from any of our friends , would not only come directly , but free from the expense which might otherwise attend them . The jealous eye with which other denominations of Christians behold this infant seminary leaves us without hope of any assistance from any but Baptists ; and I think if we could but unite , and the whole body lend a helping hand , we should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender plant to a degree of maturity which might greatly subserve the cause of religion , especially in our society . Craving your indulgence for giving you this interruption , and sincerely wishing you every felicity in this and a future world , I remain , dear sir , Your unworthy brother and servant in the gospel , /z/ PROVIDENCE , May 19 , 1772. /z/ On the 5th ult . I received your letter , as I judged from the contents , for it had neither your name nor any date to it . The contents gave me very great pleasure on various accounts , as a testimony of your regard for me , the college , and the cause of religion in general , and especially for the zeal you discover in promoting the Baptist interests . The list of names you sent me shall be laid before the Faculty next September , and without doubt they will receive the honors of the college . We shall also be obliged to you for your proposed favor of sending us some names every year , and such , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a letter to Rev. Isaac Backus , from Rev. Benjamin Wallin , of London , in which he intimated we had conferred degrees on some on your side of the water who would not do us honor . I shall therefore rely on you to pay particular regard to the literary qualifications of those whom you rec ommend , in order that our enemies may not have it in their power to re proach us on this head . I thank you for the hint given me concerning the number of our ministers and churches in Britain , and your offer of send ing me a short account of them , which I have not seen . If there should be more than one on hand , it would gratify some of our friends if I could supply them . The present of the volume of poems will be very accepta ble . Please to give my cordial love to the author , of whom I shall be mindful amongst others who deserve the honors of the college . I hope you will be happy in seeing him not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may assure yourself that I will contribute all in my power to assist in " rousing the sluggards , " etc . If the Presbyte rians have let go the faith , I hope it is to promote the primitive ordinances of the gospel under the direction of a wise Providence . I think this has been and now is the case in New England ; for many of the good peo ple are following Christ into the water , who before quieted their con sciences by the example of the fathers now with God ; but they can not find /z/ the same reason when they view the clergy of the present age . In short , if you hear of a work of God s Spirit among the Presbyterians of New Eng land , you will soon hear that a Baptist minister is applied to to baptize them . God has been and is still doing marvellous things , in the outpour ing of his Spirit on some of our churches ; especially in Boston , Dighton , Rhehoboth , Swanzey , in the Bay Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Charles Thompson , one of the first class that graduated at this college . I am told that near three hundred have been baptized in these places since last September . Mr. William Rogers , a member also of the same class , about twenty-one years of age , has been called to the ministry , and is preaching in Philadelphia , where God ap pears to own his labors to admiration . He is a pious , warm Christian , and a very popular preacher in that city . All these things encourage me to believe that God regards this college with a favorable eye ; especially as I have reason to hope that he has called by grace some who are now in college , since they came here , while others appear to be hopefully anxious about their salvation . I shall make free to draw on you again the 1st of June , by Mr. Edwards s instruction , and continue to do so yearly until you forbid me . What think you of an application to England , by some suitable person , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Edwards made but a partial application ; or would a well-concerted scheme of a lottery 1 to raise 1000 or 2000 sterling meet with encouragement by the sale of tickets in England ? Some method must be adopted , unless some generous , able benefactors should arise to assist us . I shall write frequently and long ; and if you will do the same to me , you will greatly oblige , Yours , etc. , /z/ 1 Suggested perhaps by Mr. Manning s familiarity with the history of the Col lege of New Jersey , the funds of which institution had been increased by lot teries which the legislatures of Connecticut , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey had granted for this purpose . Harvard and Yale Colleges , it may be added , were also aided by lotteries , the former even as recently as the year 1808 . To show how common were lotteries in Rhode Island at this time , it may be stated , that , in the space of twenty-seven years , from 1752 to 1779 , no less than fifty-four were granted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schoolhouses , bridges , streets , wharves , etc. , as we find by looking over the " Co lonial llecords . " For a very interesting account of lotteries in behalf of the Rev. Dr. Hopkins s church in Newport , the reader is referred to Prof. Park s Memoir of the Life and Character of Dr. Hopkins , pp. 113 , 114. /z/ From the following notice , which was published in the Providence Gazette , it appears that President Manning still retained charge of the Latin school , it being without doubt the same which he commenced at Warren eight years previous to this date . Thus , in addition to his labors as pastor of the church and President of the college , he was engaged in teaching lads , directly or otherwise , the elements of knowledge , and in furnishing them , as also the college students , with school books , " at the lowest rate . " Whereas several gentlemen have requested me to take and educate thensons , this may inform them , and others disposed to put their children under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , and set up in the college edifice ; where proper attention shall be given , by a master duly qualified , and those found to be the most effectual methods to obtain a competent knowledge of grammar , steadily pursued . At the same time , spelling , reading , and speaking English with propriety , will be particularly attended to . Any who choose their sons should board in commons , may be accommodated at the same rate with the students , six shillings per week being the price . And I flatter myself that such attention will be paid to their learning and morals as will entirely satisfy all who may send their children . All books for the school , as well as the classical authors read in college , may be had , at the lowest rate , of the subscriber . /z/ PROVIDENCE , July 10 , 1772. 1 Where the Latin school was kept previous to this date we can not positively state ; it is , however , more than probable that it was in one of the chambers of the brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lias already been stated , was occupied by the oilicers and students of the college . This schoolhouse , as appears from Staples s Annals of Providence , was built during the year 17G8 , partly by the town , and partly by subscription . By this compound arrangement the town owned the lower story , while the upper story was owned by the subscribers , among whom the friends and guardians of the college were largely represented . As we have remarked in a previous chapter , this school , commenced by Manning at Warren in 17G4 , was for a long time connected with the college or university . In 1810 the corporation erected a brick building for its accommodation , at an expense of fifteen hundred dollars . /z/ The following letter , addressed to Mr. Ryland , under date of Nov. 12 , 1772 , gives an account of the greatest do nation the library had at that time received ; namely , the works of Dr. Gill the distinguished commentator , and fiftytwo folio volumes of the Fathers , presented through Dr. Gill s executors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Manning s salary as President of the col lege was a little less than G8 sterling , or about three hundred and forty dollars . His salary as pastor of the church , according to Morgan Edwards , was 50 . Whether this was 50 sterling or lawful money we can not tell ; probably the latter . This would make the sum total of compensation for all his services about five hundred dol lars. /z/ I have not received an answer to mine of May 19th , 1772 , yet am not willing to let this opportunity pass without a line . The Faculty conferred the degree of A.M. , at our last Commencement , on your son , the Rev. John Ryland , Jun. ; but through my hurry , and absence from home since Commencement , I have not got his diploma written , and must therefore omit sending it until my next . Those other gentlemen you mentioned did not receive their degrees ; the Faculty chose to know whether they have been consulted personally , and wish to receive the honors of our college ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What sug gested this reflection , in part , was a paragraph in a letter from Mr. Wallin of London to Mr. Backus , which I saw , in which he seemed to insinuate that we had been too lavish of our honors . If these gentlemen would ac cept diplomas from us , we should give them with pleasure ; but we do not choose to give them to those who would not thank us for them , as I think has been the case with some even on your side of the water . With this I send you a catalogue of those who have received the hon ors of the college from the first . Our last Commencement , I believe , ac quired us considerable reputation amongst the literati in New England ; and had we not to combat with the inveterate enmity of the New England clergy , it would have added to the number of our scholars ; but they take /z/ unwearied pains to prevent any from coming if possible , and do not stick at the method of carrying their points ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last month I returned from a journey through the western provinces , as far as Philadelphia . I found religion at an ebb in those churches in general , as is the case through the most of New England . Virginia is still in a flame , and hundreds are hopefully turning to God . I attended the Association at New York , and we had a very comfortable season . I here with send you an Association letter . I should be glad to know in what sense you give the five guineas which I have been directed to call upon you for annually . The reason is this : I have always rendered an account of it to the corporation as a part of my salary from the college , which is 67 13s. 4d. sterling , annu ally , and some of the members have found fault with me for so doing , alleging that , as my salary is inadequate , I ought to consider it as a free gift , or so much over the above sum ; but this I would by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donation , according to which I shall be governed , and therefore I pray you to resolve me in this matter . By the last ship we received the works of the great and good Dr. Gill , with fifty-two folio volumes of the Fathers , etc. , the gift of Messrs . George Keith and John Gill , the Doctor s executors . This is by far the greatest donation our little library has yet had ; but I hope their generous example will be followed by others on your side of the Atlantic . Do you think it would be worth while for an American Indian , as we are generally deemed , to visit England , on the errand of collecting some more money for our college ? Eor we really need it . I have been mentioned , if my place in the interim could be supplied , for this purpose , provided the prospect promised anything worth while . But the inattention of the Baptists to their own interests disheartens me greatly . I have written tAvo letters to Dr. Stennett since I have had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man with my nonsense , and that my letters have been mislaid or intercepted . Pray , have you heard of the Doctor s being addressed by Dr. Chauncey , of Boston , with a design to alienate him from the cause of the New England Baptists , by sending him reproachful accounts of them ? I was told by one of our brethren this was suspected to be the case , from some extraordinary steps taken by that society . If that should be the case I should be glad to know ; and if you are intimate with the Doctor , you may probably know /z/ through him . A minister of reputation gave me this hint but a few days past , or I would not have mentioned it , supposing them incapable of so low an artifice . I am told another l of my first class is to preach on trial next Lord s Day , which will make three of that class in the ministry . With great respect , I am , sir , yours to serve , /z/ NORTHAMPTON , Feb. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your notice and consideration . If they are of any service to you , or to the cause of religion and to your college of learning , I shall be glad . I have , in the midst of the cares of a family of about sixty persons , thrown out some thoughts concerning matters before us ; and as you know I bear you a hearty good-will , I am not in any pain how you may re ceive and relish them . If you are that man of sense and honor I con ceive you to be , you will like my blunt friendship better than drivelling flattery and nauseous palaver . ( Verba sit nenia ; for it is not in Dr. Sam . Johnson s Dictionary . ) I have filled a whole sheet of post-demy paper , so that you have rough and enough . The pamphlets and sheets which accompany this are a present to yourself , unless you think it worth while to put them in your college library , or in the fire , just as you please . If you like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall soon hear from you . I am to you , and to the interests of religion and learning under your care , A hearty and zealous friend , /z/ 1 . In January , 1772 , 1 sent a box of twenty - five books to the Rev. Mor gan Edwards , at Philadelphia , by the favor and care of Mr. Daniel Roberdean , merchant , who was then in London , and abode at my old lodgings , Mrs. Stephens s , No. 11 , in Great St. Hellen s ; and was about to return /z/ to America . In a letter to Mr. Edwards I desired him to present some of those books to Rhode Island College , but have heard nothing from him , nor have you mentioned one word about the books . 2 . Mr. Wallin had no right to reproach your college as being too lavish of its honors , unless he meant himself , and himself only . 3 . For me to ask any of those gentlemen I nominated in my letter , whether he would please to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor and delicacy of conferring it . Its coming unsought , yea unthought of , constitutes its chief excellence and acceptableness to men of fine feelings . For my own part , I would not have given you a single farthing , or so much as a thanks , for a feather , if I had it not in my power with the utmost truth to say , " I neither sought it , nor bought it , nor thought for a moment about it " ( Dr. Gill s saying on having his diploma from Scotland ) . 4 . By your withholding these honors from the men I so well knew to deserve them , and not one would have refused them , you have done your college damage in its temporal interests . My design was to serve you by attaching men of grace , learning , property , and influence to you . But if you do not choose it in my way , it shall be let alone ; for I assure you I never will ask one man whilst I live to accept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have learning sufficient , who would snap at your honors for the sake of some low ends and purposes ; but their characters as divines , or their capacity or will to serve you , is nothing . In truth , I keep no such company . I form no connection with them , nor will I whilst I live . On the other hand , the Rev. Augustus Toplady is the first divine of the Established Church , or indeed of any church in England or in Europe . He is a man of fortune , of high genius , and learning . He is my intimate friend ; and let me tell you , as a secret , of a mark of his regard for me . He put it to my choice , in case of his death before me , which part of his library I would have , the English , or the Latin and learned part . I chose the latter , and it is accordingly fixed . But I hope I shall never have the pain to accept them . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is so tempered and moderated by grace , and a noble and generous disposition , as renders him one of the boldest champions for the sublime truths of the gospel in the world . We have no writer amongst all our divines that comes near to him in energy and grandeur of thought , rich and daring imagination , masculine judg ment , and glowing colors of style . lie is about twenty-nine or thirty years old , but has been educated , from sixteen years of age , in all the grand /z/ essentials of the gospel . He had his classical education at Westminster School , and his academical at the University of Dublin ; owing to an es tate falling to his mother in Ireland , and she being obliged to go over and possess it , she took her only . son , at sixteen , with her . Dr. Thos . Leland was his tutor . But he had the good sense and piety to go to the Baptist meeting on Lord s Days to hear an able preacher , now dead , his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to England , he had the boldness and wisdom to sit under the stated ministry of Dr. Gill . He is a generous friend to Dissenters , especially to us poor Baptists . He commenced A.B . at Dublin . He scorns all honors , unless conferred like grace from heaven , " unthought of , unimplored . " My other friends are of the same complexion ; therefore I will never ask one of them to accept of a feather from your college . Mr. Isaac Wood man , of Sutton in Leicestershire , is a prince in his spirit and conduct . He is the father of our Midland Association , and a wise counsellor to us all . He has such a degree of modesty that he will not wear the feather you sent him , and wishes not to have it known on this side of the water . But what then ? Has he done you any damage or dishonor ? No . All that know him will revere him as a man of wisdom , benevolence , and learning in the Greek language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a man of substance , and has a fine library ; he has no children ; and you will have half , if not the whole , for your college when he dies . Will this hurt you ? Perhaps some money into the bargain . And thus I should have attached others to your interests ; but you would not let me , in your wisdom . Just as if you knew men here better than I do , who have lived forty years amongst them . As to the five guineas I pay every year , t is for yourself and nobody else . T is because I like your character , spirit , and principles . If you die , and another succeed you whom I should not approve , I will stop my hand . As to raising money by a lottery , I dislike it from the bottom of my heart . T is a scheme dishonorable to the supreme Head of all worlds and of the true church . We have our fill of these cursed gambling lot teries in London every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the devil s children have them all to themselves . Let us not touch or taste . I sent two books to the Rev. Mr. Stillman , at Boston , last summer , by Mr. Story , of Boston . One of the books is a present to the library of your college . It is entitled " An Easy Introduction to Sir Isaac Newton s Philosophy . " It was written by one of the clearest and most condescend- /z/ ing- good-natured philosophers in the world for the use of my school , Mr. James Ferguson , Fellow of the Royal Society . T is adapted to your school-boys and junior students , to prepare them for larger treatises on the same subjects . I should be glad to find it meet with the approbation of your learned Professor of Philosophy . Agreeably to Byland s suggestion , the college the fol lowing year conferred on the Rev. Augustus Toplady the honorary degree of A.M. Mr. Toplacly s works have been published in six octavo volumes , with an account of his life . To the Christian public he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleft for me , " and " Deathless spirit , now arise , " regarded by many as two of the finest hymns in the English language . /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 13 , 1772. /z/ As I have sent two or three letters since receiving one from you , I should not now write , as I have nothing of importance to communicate , had not the Rev. Isaac Backus , of Middleborough , requested me , on the follow ing account : He has been up to Ashficld not long since , and found that the Congregational clergy there , as well as elsewhere , have been very busy in collecting all the scandalous reports they can hear of ; and as they think , from some circumstances , sending them to Dr. Chaunccy , of Boston , in order to transmit the same to you , to prevent you from interesting your self in their cause . I confess this is a suggestion which would seem to flow from a bad heart , destitute of charity , to a person who is acquainted only with the fair side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them in New England , that they should conceive such a design is far from being a thing incredible . Now if this is the case , I have author ity from Mr. Backus , a man of unblemished reputation , to inform you that , so far as he could judge , from being on the spot and viewing the lands , etc. , wrested from those poor Baptists , he verily thought their com plaints were lighter than their grievances , and that their sufferings have been extremely great . And as Mr. Backus is appointed by the body of the Baptists in New England to collect materials for their history , he /z/ prays und doubts not but you will , through my hands , favor him with in telligence respecting this matter , by the first opportunity , that he may have it in his power to undeceive you if they have sent you these accounts . The state of the college is much the same as when I wrote last , as to numbers , and still wants powerful friends to patronize and endow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executors , by the last ship have sent us a set of the Doctor s works , and fifty-two volumes of the Fathers , etc. , which is the greatest donation our little library has yet had . I. have visited the western provinces this fall , and find there but dead times in religion , except in Virginia , where God still continues to do won ders amongst the people ; though , as of old , by instruments to the eye of human reason very weak ; But God clothes them with power . I attended the Philadelphia Association , held in New York this year , and was very agreeably entertained with the company of a number of my fellow-servants , who seem zealous to promote the Redeemer s kingdom . One of them , Mr. David Jones , has been the last summer visiting and preaching to the western tribes of Indians between the Ohio and Mississippi ; and , like an apostle amongst the Gentiles , was to set out on the first of this month , at his own charges , to pay his interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says they give car to the gospel , and importuned him to come again . He thinks there is a great prospect of many turning to God amongst them ; and who knows but they may ? I believe it is the first instance of the Baptists going among them for that purpose . The Asso ciation was highly pleased with the accounts he gave , and recommended it to the churches to set on foot a collection for him ; but I fear he must exhaust his own little pittance , notwithstanding what they will do ; for public spirit is a virtue rarely found in this country amongst good people . But lest I weary your patience , I subscribe myself , sir , Your friend and servant , /z/ THORP ( or SUTTON ) , near LEICESTER , Feb. 20 , 1773. /z/ By the favor of Mr. Ryland I have seen the New York Association let ter , and have had some account also of yours to him . I am glad Christ s interest under our denomination has such a respectable footing in your parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst glad t is /z/ otherwise elsewhere . Amongst other things at the Association , the re spectful notice taken of Mr. Edwards gives me pleasure . As I am a Avell-wisher to the prosperity of the college , I would , if I could , advise to anything for its furtherance . If you were to come over , I fear your compass or scope for soliciting visits would be very narrow . There is no reasonable hope of success where congregations are unable to support the interest at home , and where there may be a prejudice against literature : a common but not universal case amongst us . I think it would be in vain to attempt it , unless you have encouragement from London , Bristol , and a few more of our opulent congregations . But , whether you come or not , I have long thought that a good printed narrative of the state of the college sent hither , to be disbursed by its friends , would be of service . I doubt not some fruit would spring from such seed scattered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to let us know that our denomination in the Island , and especially the college , is loyal and obedient , disapproving the opposition made to Government in your neighborhood , if public reports of such opposition made , be indeed true . I am for liberty , regularly main tained . Should any such narrative be sent , or brought by yourself , it is to be hoped the list of those you have honored with degrees will not be put into every hand , or at least that those who particularly desire it may have their names omitted . I esteem the honors of the college , and am obliged to the Faculty for putting my name amongst your worthies ; pray please to present my grateful compliments ; but I must not own the title . " Pis an honor I can not support . For your sakes , therefore , as well as for my own , I must decline it . I ought to say , indeed , in favor of my friends , who ever recommended me to your regards , they verily believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it might have been so had I prosecuted my begin nings ; but an inveterate headache , of above thirty years standing , has dis abled me from making much addition to what I set out with when I left Bristol . I am a hearty friend to your cause . My silence has not been from carelessness or ingratitude , and much less from contempt . I desired Mr. Ryland to make my excuse . I am not able to show the regards I wish to discover ; howbeit , I have friendly designs . But the honor you have done me would , if known , us it is not yet in my neighborhood , block up my way to serve you , which I have much at heart to do . I congratulate you upon your correspondence with and interest in Mr. Ryland . He is , I may say from long acquaintance with him , a worthy /z/ man , and a warm friend of the cause which he espouses . I do not know that you could have one more zealous in your affairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honorable and important institu tion over which you preside may have its worthy ends answered in the furtherance of knowledge , virtue , and true religion , and yourself be greatly helped and blessed with all needful assistance in the good work of form ing the minds of youth , I rest , esteemed and dear sir , Yours , affectionately , /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 26 , 1773. /z/ Yours of Feb. 20th , 1773 , came to hand last week , in company with several others , agreeable letters from friends in England , to whom I write by this opportunity . I am heartily glad to hear your favorable disposi tion towards the college , and oould heartily concur with you in your wishes for greater abilities to serve its interests ; though we have for our encouragement the commendation of the poor widow r s contribution . I should think it a prodigy if all you English Baptists Avere friends to lit erature , while the case is so far otherwise in America . But I think your good , zealous people are mistaken in striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean in making it an handmaid to religion . I am sorry you are so scrupulous in point of confessing the honor we meant to confer on you , though you must be a better judge of the expedi ency of this , in your situation , than I can possibly be . But the infant state of literature in this new world , and the usages of the college here , lead us to conclude , from your known character , that you need not be so diffident of your abilities as to decline the feather , as our common friend Mr. Ryland calls it . The history of the rise , present state , etc , of the college , will be done in some manner , and sent to England next spring , unless Providence should prevent it ; but I wish it could be done by an abler hand , or that I had more leisure than my present circumstances will afford for it . I know how to sympathize with you in your inveterate complaint ( of the headache ) ; for , while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly prize Mr. Ryland s friendship , because I have found him a friend indeed . I revere . his character , and place the highest confidence in. /z/ him . The very small number of friends and the great number of enemies the college has , requires the greater exertion of the few friends of which it can boast , in its favor . I hope to sec it on a more respectable footing , should I live to an advanced age ; and if not , I hope posterity will reap great advantages from it . With the most hearty wishes for your highest welfare , I am , Your friend and servant in the gospel , /z/ N. B. I hope those who know the little Colony of Rhode Island , and especially the Baptist society in it , will find that , though firm in the cause of constitutional liberty , we are as loyal subjects as any of which his Majesty King George can boast . I wish I could tell you more agree able news of the state of religion among us , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of bequeathment , which we make use of this way . At Newport I find one of which I had no knowledge before . /z/ Concerning Mr. Woodman , and his suggestion in regard to a narrative of the college , Mr. Ryland , under date of Feb. 9 , 1773 , thus writes to Manning : " My good father in the ministry , and counsellor , Mr. Isaac Woodman , is earnestly desirous ( and with him I concur ) to hear from you . A clear narration of the rise , progress , and present state of the college at Rhode Island , with an account of the methods of education in the languages , sci ences , and divinity ; the exercises of the students , and the character of those who have distinguished themselves by their diligence , improvement , and piety , this we think to reprint and disperse through all England amongst our best and richest friends of all denominations , in order to so licit subscriptions arid donations . Had you done this already , and sent about twenty honors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved for your coming over and making your appearance and personal applica tions this next summer . But for want of these two preliminaries , you have prevented yourself from coming with a good prospect of success for this year . If you will take our advice , and put it in our power to serve you by conciliating men s esteem and affection to your person and col lege , perhaps we can pave the way for you by next May come twelve month , 1774 ; and may do Rhode Island some service . " /z/ The following playful letter to his intimate friend , the Rev. Hezekiah Smith , shows that Dr. Manning could be merry , as well as serious . Indeed , he was noted above most men for his genial companionship and rare social qualities . PROVIDENCE , May 5 , 1773. /z/ This is to give you the reason why I did not visit you at Haverhill , and invite you to come to Providence . I set out from Providence , intending to spend a week at Boston and Haverhill . We ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , and proposed to set out for Haverhill on Monday ; but that and several succeeding days proving rainy , and Mrs. Manning being very poorly , to our very great dis appointment , mortification , etc. , we were obliged to return to Providence without going further . Now , therefore , as I am tied to college , pray take Mrs. Smith , and the heir apparent , 1 and the neAV chaise , and come and take your station for a week or two on the hill of Providence , where I will insure you excellent good water , the best my house affords , and our good company . Pray , what more would you have ? If anything in my power to render the visit still more agreeable , depend on it , you shaVt be wanting it . I have made a tour into the hither parts of Connecticut this vacation , and preached fifteen times in fourteen days ; seven of them in Presbyterian meeting-houses . What do you think of that ? See what it is to be cath olic like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of Mars like an old veteran that scorns to let his sword rust . Good success to you , if you must draw . I have received a packet from England , and our good friend Rev. John Ryland is angry enough because we did not give degrees to the gentlemen he recommended , and says that we have lost by it greatly . How happens it that not one scholar , through your influence , comes from you to our college I ? fear you don t exert yourself . We have no late news from the westward . Friends here are generally well , and very de sirous to see and hear Mr. Smith , as are your good friends at New London . Mrs. Manning joins in love to you and Mrs. Smith , as , also , to all our good friends at Haverhill , with , dear sir , Your unworthy brother , /z/ i Their infant son , born March 12 , 1772. /z/ Dr. Manning now begins a correspondence with the Rev. Benjamin Wallin , a prominent Baptist minister of London , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious writer of some note . " The Christian Life Described , " " Discourses on various subjects , " " Parable of the Prodigal Son , " " Evangelical Hymns and Songs , " and various other works by him are to be found upon the shelves of the college library , a gift from the author . Un der date of May 18 , 1773 , Manning thus writes : /z/ From Mr. Philip Freeman , of Boston , I received your agreeable pres ent , on the third inst. , and having perused with much satisfaction the several pieces , especially the Tribulation , I am rejoiced to find that it is not " another gospel/ Had I capacity , to which I make no preten sions , to examine Mr. Wallin s productions with the eye of a critic , I feel no disposition , be assured , to do it . I import annually a few books from London , principally for the youth under my care , and should have sent for some of your publications ; but as Mr. Backus has them by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing to interfere in any way with him . I should be glad to know whether you designed the books as a present to me personally , or to the college library , that I may return you thanks in a proper manner . In cither case I am greatly obliged , and heartily thank you therefor . The executors of Dr. Gill have followed the laudable example of Dr. Stennett , and made us a present of his works , which we deem a most val uable donation . These acts encourage us to hope for similar favors from our friends in Europe . Should any benevolent person be disposed to make a useful donation to our library and at a loss to know what books to choose , allow me to suggest the works of good Mr. Bunyan , than which none would be more acceptable . Mr. Edwards has been your substitute for the gentlemen as desired . Through Messrs . Stillman and Backus I learn that the Lord has visited you sorely in the loss of your only daughter . But you need not be told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sons or daugh ters . I doubt not but you find already a strong attachment to this earth broken , and that God leads by the right way . The discipline of the rod is often necessary , at least to such perverse hearts as mine . /z/ Mr. Backus informs me that he has lately written to you , thus remov ing the necessity of my giving you a recital of affairs amongst us , or of detaining you longer than to crave your indulgence for obtruding upon you this letter , which assures you , dear sir , of the unfeigned affection of your unseen but very much obliged Friend and servant , /z/ P. S. This day received letters from several of the western provinces . Tind that religion is at a low ebb in general there , as , alas , it is too gener ally amongst us . If business would permit , should rejoice to see a line from Mr. Wallin , by our fall ships . Mr. Wallin s reply is so excellent in spirit , that no apol ogy need be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 30 , 1773. /z/ Your respectful lines by Mr. Keith very much obliged me ; nor am I less indebted to your candor in perusing my endeavors , being sensible that they will not bear the eye of a critic . The disadvantages under which I was at length brought into a service , conscientiously declined in the very early part of my life , in consequence of which I deprived myself of an in tended more liberal education , might plead some excuse ; and were you to know by what solicitation and management I was prevailed on to repeat my visits to the press , you would rather pity than blame me , and cover my numerous defects with a mantle of love . I thought it a venture to possess one of your character with such feeble and imperfect attempts , they are at best only fit for children in Chris tianity , how , then , could I think of proposing them to the most infant seminary of learning ? Indeed , sir , they were intended only as an in stance of respect to yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express . It would have impeached your last , had not the ingenibus discourses of my much esteemed brother , the Rev. Dr. Stennett , been uni versally admired among you . As to the works of that great man , the late Dr. Gill , who was truly a father , they may justly be accounted a con siderable acquisition . I know not , upon the whole , an author more judi cious and consistent . The compass of his writing is astonishing , from /z/ the labors of which he now rests until the Chief Shepherd comes , when it will appear that our endeavors for his name shall not be in vain . But seeing you intimate that it may not be unacceptable , I presume , though with some reluctance , to send all I can collect of my publications , which together make ten little volumes , and possibly five entire pieces , and five of sermons , addresses , etc . Also the ordination of Rev. A. Booth , who sends a volume of the sermons of his predecessor , the late Mr. Wil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " etc . These will not be the less welcome for being accompanied by all the works of Mr. Bunyan , agree ably to your suggestion . These I present , with my most respectful com pliments , to every member of the college , including their worthy President the Rev. Mr. James Manning . Have you , sir , any stated form of bequeathment ? If not , permit me to move for a concise account of your institution , with a direction how to describe you in a will . Such a paper , neatly printed and disposed , may be useful . Be not sparing of copies to your friends . The difference in point of expense between one or two thousand is but trifling . As to my own works , most of them have been out of print for some years . They are chiefly practical , and all very plain . The hymns , more especially , need an apology . They are no other than artless compositions , in which the substance of occasional discourses was drawn up in a suit able form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time , they were sung with peculiar satisfaction , the people being unac quainted with the author ; but at length many of them were stolen and mangled , which induced me , at the instance of some , to print them , and so obviate any apprehension of a conceit that they were deserving of pub lic notice . It is my study , both in preaching and in writing , to lead to those inexhaustible treasures of wisdom and comfort , the Holy Scriptures ; hence the tone of my naked lines . I must observe further , that in order to make up the set , I was obliged to put in a volume containing my sermon on the experience of the saints , which was bound up in another . You will therefore excuse a duplicate of them . It is long since I have heard from my very worthy and agreeable corre spondent the Rev. Mr. Backus . He usually much entertains me . I have often rejoiced at his accounts of the success of the gospel in your world , and am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather low . May the Lord of Jacob revisit it . Two things are threatening with us , the growth of Anti-Trinitarians , in a variety of forms , for they can not agree ; nor can I forbear to say that I think a dereliction of , or indifference to the /z/ divine Sonship of our glorious Redeemer , has greatly contributed to the insolence of men against that foundation of the gospel . The other is a popular ignorance of the authority of Christ , in particular church fellow ship , which some are bold enough to put on the footing of prudence and convenience among the disciples of Jesus . The one strikes at the doc trine , the other at the discipline of the gospel . But Zion is insured against the gates of hell . I am now in the eve of my ministry and life ; childless , and in a manner destitute of natural relation , having lost an excellent wife , two sons , and three daughters . It is good to be weaned from an undue attachment to the present state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father has been very gracious in helping me , I trust , to receive not only good at his hand , but also evil . He has given me a name and a place in his house better than that of sons or of daughters , and some spiritual children who are exceeding affectionate and dutiful . May your valuable life be long spared , and all your instructions suc ceed to the advantage of mankind , and especially to the spread of the truth and the prosperity of Jerusalem . I remain , reverend and dear sir , Your obliged and truly affectionate brother , /z/ PROVIDENCE , May 20th , 1773. /z/ Yours of Feb. 9th , 1773 , came safely to hand , by the Charlotte , Capt . Jno . Rogers , about the 20th of April , containing your agreeable present of pieces , letters , etc. , for all of which I scarce need tell you I heartily thank you . You need not for the future hesitate about sending anything to me in that way , or writing with the utmost plainness to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he were master of it . To con vince you that I am entirely suited with your plain dealing , I have embraced the earliest opportunity of returning an answer . Your friendship to the interests of the college and religion here is very cordially accepted by many besides myself ; and though you thought we slighted your friendship , I can assure you it was not so meant ; I shall be glad to gratify you , and testify our respect for any of your friends , on every occasion . But I come to particulars . /z/ The books ordered here from Mr. Edwards have not come ; neither have I heard of them , except by your letter , though I saw Mr. Edwards at Philadelphia last October . He must surely have forgotten it entirely . I have seen Mr. Backus since I received yours , and he thinks I mis took Mr. Wallin s meaning , and that he intended only himself . If so , I am sorry I mentioned anything of the matter . Indeed , Mr. Wallin , in his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I entirely agree with you respecting academical honors , and the mode of conferring them on gentlemen of taste ; and as you are fully satisfied that the gentlemen mentioned would cordially accept them , you may be assured we shall take proper care of that matter next Commencement , and forward the diplomas as soon as possible . If we have been tardy , I know you will forgive us . An unforgiving friend is not worth having . Such I do not deem my very good friend Mr. Ryland . I am heartily sorry that the college should sustain damage , through what we meant only for precau tion , and hope , if so , that it will be only temporary . We beg you not to remit an iota of your zeal in attaching gentlemen of grace and learning , property and influence , to the college . For amongst all our good friends in Britain , we consider your opportunities in this way , together with your zeal , as placing you foremost . The character of the Rev. Mr. Toplady , which you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall think the college highly honored in his accepting a feather , and indeed in the least expression of his friendship . I am sorry to hear that pious Mr. Woodman is so exceedingly modest as not to choose to wear his feather ; but am glad to hear such a worthy character of him , and that he is so well disposed towards the college as to think of providing for it . May the Lord possess many others with the same spirit ! I hope you may have it in your power to put many more in the way of leaving us some love tokens , when they are better employed than in enjoying terrestrial goods . This is what I have hoped for , though hitherto I have not seen cause to expect much from it soon . I am much obliged to you for the annual contribution of five guineas . I have made free to draw a bill for them in favor of Mr. Geo . Keith , of London , hoping that the Lord may enable me to conduct worthy the gos pel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of lotteries coincides with mine ; but some of our friends urged me to mention the subject , as they could not see a prospect of sup plies in any other way . Besides , I believe there have not been such in- /z/ iquitous methods used in this matter , with us , as in the State lotteries at home . They have been used to promote good designs . The book from Mr. Stillman we have received , though lately , as Mr. Story did not do his errand to Mr. Stillman faithfully . I have written to Mr. Edwards respecting the books in his hands , and expect an answer soon . Perhaps you may meet this in London . If so you need not mention the hint relative to Dr. Chauncey ; for I believe he has not yet forwarded anything of that nature . To give you a full detail of facts and instances of the ill-will of persons to the college 1 would require " centum ora etferrea vox , " as sung the poet . Dr. Stiles , of Newport , gave as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the Faculty , the offense he should give his brethren should he accept it . The manner of obtaining the charter , has , by the clergy of the Congregational society , been represented as highly iniquitous . ( But the particulars of this affair you shall have as soon as the college history can be completed and sent to you , together with other particulars which you request . ) Those gentlemen of that denomination who have spoken favorably of the institution have been reprimanded , as I have been cred ibly informed , and that by a convention , for showing us so much counte nance as to attend the Commencement . I was lately told by a worthy minister of that order in Connecticut , that one of the same order in this town , a sour man , had done the college amazing damage by representing us as bigots , and our sole design to be that of proselyting to the Baptist sentiments ; and that if they sent their children here they never could get into any employment in that Government ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scholars to whom he taught grammar , though he chose it . The same zeal has been used in the neighboring provinces , both by him and others ; and both parents and tutors have repeatedly told me that ev erything except violence has been used , and almost that in some instan ces , to prevent them from sending their children here . Some of them have boasted that they have prevented persons from coming who de signed it ; and few scholars come but say every obstacle has been laid in their way to prevent them . The characters of the teachers , their abilities , and the character of the place even , have been aspersed to the highest de- i Jfr . By Ian d , in a letter to Manning , under date of Feb. 9 , 1778 , thus writes : " I wish you would give me a full detail of facts and instances of the ill-will of men to your seminary . I would make use of them for its benefit and advantage , without hurtiu ? YOU in the least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire you to recite a small part of our ill-treatment . They know that the low state of the college fund requires considerable tuition money to support the teachers , and that that depends on the number of scholars . If , therefore , they can prevent them from coming , they know they distress us . But , notwithstanding what I have said of our enemies , there are many valuable men in that society in these parts , some of whom are friendly to the college ; but through their connections , or want of ability , few of them have it in their power to express their friendship . You may expect a particular account of our mode of education , and of the students , their characters , proficiency , piety , etc. , when we send you an account of the rise , progress , and present state of the college , which I intend to draw up as soon as I can , and forward it by the first opportunity . Our number of scholars is thirty , and amongst them are many pious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of well-behaved boys . I have a Latin school under my care , taught by one of our graduates , of about twenty boys . Amongst those who have left ITS are three eminent Baptist ministers , their age considered , and another just entered on the work , who , I am told , promises as fair as any of the others ; one attoniey-at-law , the most eminent at the bar of any in this colony , etc. , etc . I thank you for the list of ministers of the Church of England , and shall be glad to see that of the Calvinist Baptist ministers . " What treatise upon fluxions do you deem the best ? The state of reli religion is generally at a low ebb amongst us . May the Lord revive it ! " Would your English people be scared at an American Indian ? I remain , dear sir , your unworthy friend and brother in the gospel , /z/ No date . Probably August , 1773. 1 , The Calvinistical Baptist ministers in England and Wales are about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forgot to ask Mr. " Wallin for some more . Be so good as to mention it to him . 2 . I can not yet procure a complete list of the Independent ministers and churches , You know there are about thirty-two in London , and ve have twelve or fourteen in Northampton . /z/ 3 . I suppose you know that it was Dr. Stennett that procured an order from Government to put a stop to the oppression of the Baptists near Boston . I have not a perfect idea of that affair . 4 . Two young men , of good parts and sound knowledge of the learned languages , and men of eloquence and piety , are lately come into the min istry from Mr. Evan s academy in Bristol ; namely , Mr. Biggs , just going to be ordained over the Baptist church at Wantage , in Berkshire , and Mr. Dtinscombe , at Coat in Oxfordshire , whose ordination is to be at the same time . You will do well to mark them down as men of uncommon merit , worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner you send over a clear , short , printed account of your college , in its rise and present state , the better . I beg you would pay due and equal attention to our leading men , in presenting each with a copy , that no jealousy or pique against you may arise . You know our chief ministers . We have about thirty or forty that can read Greek . Let not one be forgot . If you know not all of them , I will inform you , or take the trouble of giving them a copy in your name . 6 . As to your visit to old England , I shall be glad to see you , and will do you all the service I can ; but I wish you to attach some more of our ministers to your interest by your pretty baubles first , and also let your account of the college come six months before you . 7 . As to your worthy Mathematical Professor , I wish him all possible success ; but I must not presume to assist or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The students at our Cambridge use chiefly an abridgment of Sanderson s Algebra , an octavo , price six shillings ; and then we have such a number of books on fluxions , so good that t is hard to say which is the best . There are four of great note ; namely , Maclaurin , Ditton , Thomas Simpson , and Emerson last of all , who is now liv ing . He has published a noble course of mathematical learning , in about ten or twelve octavo volumes . He is an amazing genius in the north of England . His Mechanics , quarto , fourteen shillings , and Astronomy , octavo , six shillings , I have in my study . But the lovely humane philos opher , and my intimate friend , is James Ferguson , F. R. S. He has just now assisted me to complete my optical cards , which are engraving on copper plates . You will , I hope , approve of them , as the easiest introduc tion to optics ever seen in the world .

CHARLESTON , Nov. 5th , 1773. /z/ I have hardly time to say , yours of the 6th Sept. , ult , came to hand two days ago . I am now preparing for a journey into Georgia , very high up , in order to assist my good Brother Pelot in constituting a Baptist church . The Lord has greatly owned the labors of our young Botfford ; many are converted , baptized , and are now waiting for the enjoyment of church privileges . This intelligence , I know , will be agreeable to you ; more so than the account you gave of my sad boy was to me . I am sorry John has conducted so as to give you so much trouble , and to forfeit the place he had under the management of Mrs. Manning . Had I been ap prised of his unworthy conduct sooner , perhaps I should have remanded him back to Carolina ; for I am not in such affluent circumstances as to throw away money in the education of one who has no view to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pains you have taken with him , and that you have made trial of the discipline of the rod . Let me entreat you unweariedly to exert your best endeavors for his advantage . Who knows but God may give him a turn 1 I should be sorry he should return a worthless blockhead . When I return from my Georgia route , which will take me near a month , I shall use my utmost endeavors to remit you some more guineas . I have enough due me if I could collect it ; but cash was never so scarce in Carolina as at present . This is an unfavorable circumstance , both for you and for me . I should be glad to see an account of your late Commencement in print . Pray , how goes on the great man of Haverhill ? I have heard nothing from him for a great while past ; and I hear almost as little about Mr. Stillman , or our affairs in Boston . How is Mr. Davis s place supplied ? Has that church any minister ? /z/ Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have received but one letter from him for the space of twelve months past , although I have sharply reproved him for his neglect , over and over again . " With kind love to Mrs. Manning , I remain , Yours , with much esteem , /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 25 , 1773. /z/ Yours by Capt . Shand I received last week . I am obliged to you for the number of Calvinist Baptist ministers in England and Wales , and for information where I may procure a complete list of Independent ministers . I did not know before that it was Dr. Stennett who procured the repeal of the Ashficld law against the Baptists . I rejoice at the addition of Messrs . Biggs and Dunscombe to the number of laboi-ers in the vineyard of our Lord . I shall remember and do honor to such worthy characters . I expect we shall be able to send over a printed account of the college the next spring , together with diplomas to those in England who were graduated the last fall . The reason of our being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their last meeting , ordered us to revise the form of our diplomas , and send it to England to be engraved in copper plate , and procure a quantity of good parchment , as we had none here fit to send abroad . Should you happen in London on the receipt of this , I should be glad to have you inspect the draught and design , and prescribe the best form of the plate , hands , etc . I shall pay duo attention to the literary gentlemen you mentioned , when the account of the college is sent over , and am obliged to you for your proffered kindness in distributing them . This I shall expect . I know not whether I shall ever have the pleasure of seeing your face in the flesh ; should my life be spared , though , it would be very agreeable . However , we shall omit nothing which is judged agreeable or necessary to pave the way for some future personal solicitation in favor of our col lege in England , should it be thought expedient . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your optical card . I doubt not I shall approve of it when favored with a sight . In company with yours I received a letter from that venerable man , Rev. Isaac Woodman , together with another testimony of his good-will /z/ towards us . He writes like an experienced , modest father . This letter I must answer , though I am greatly paralyzed with a crowd of business , and can not do it as I would be glad to do . Also Rev. Benjamin Wallin , of London , sent me an agreeable letter , accompanied with all he has published , in ten volumes , neatly bound and gilt , with the most valuable works of John Bunyan , in six volumes , the Reign of Grace , by " William Booth and Wilson s Sermons , all for the college library . These I esteem valuable presents . Enclosed I send you the Minutes of the Association at Philadelphia , and that called the Warren Association , in New England . The last vacation I spent in riding three hundred and fifty miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Baptist churches and societies in New England ; many of which I never had visited before . Was cordially received , and importuned to repeat my visit as soon as might be . In general found religion to wear a promising aspect ; but in many places they met with a great interruption from the Establishment in New England . I wonder how men by human laws can establish a re ligion , and then have the effrontery to call it Christ s kingdom ! I should have sent to you before this for a number of your books , but understood you had sent some of them to Mr. Edwards , directed to me , which I have not seen . With my best wishes for your welfare , I am , sir , Your unworthy brother in the gospel , /z/ P. S. I have seen Rev. Augustus Toplady s Treatise on Predestina tion , with his letter to Rev. Jno . Wesley , and deem them masterly per formances , answering well the character you gave him . /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 25th , 1773 . REVEREND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Shand , together with the box of books , came safe to hand last week ; for which I return you many thanks , as well in the name of the corporation of our college as in my own . I have not had leisure to peruse many of the pieces , since their arrival , but from my prepossession in favor of the author , and from what I have read of his works , I am confident they will be highly agreeable ; so that you might have spared everything said by way of apology for them on that account . /z/ I arn , however , greatly obliged to you for the information you give con cerning your entering the ministry , your age , situation in the world and in the church of God . etc. , etc . Your present of the venerable Bunyan s works were not the less welcome for being accompanied with the agree able present from the Rev. Abraham Booth , of his Reign of Grace , and of Mr. Wilson s Sermons . I must trouble him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a printed account of the rise and present state of the college , in which we shall give an account of the man ner of donations to the college by wills ; but lest that should come too late , I here send the name by which it is known in law , and bv which it is to hold donations , until some more distinguished benefactor shall give it a new one , for which the corporation have liberty in the charter . " Item . I give to the the Trustees and Fellows of the College or Uni versity in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Planta tions , in New England in America , the sum of . " The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts , last year or the year before , prescribed a form of bequeathment to them , in which they say : " To be raised and paid by , and out of my ready money , plate , goods , and personal effects , which , by law , I may or can charge with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my lands , tenements , or hereditaments , and to be applied towards/ 5 etc . The particular design must be expressed , or it must be left to them to dispose of as they shall think proper . I suppose the statute of Mortmane , or that of 9th of George II. , made this precaution necessary . But as our friends in Great Britain will be always able to advise with those who are skilled in these matters , they will doubtless put it out of the power of any to defeat their benevolent intentions , after they are gone to the eternal world . Pardon my being so particular on this point : the loss of sundry donations to the society above mentioned , published in their extracts , suggested the thought . When our account of the college comes , we shall not be sparing in numbers to be distributed , as our friends judge proper . I wonder that Mr. Backus is behindhand with you , as he is not com monly tardy in this way . He is an excellent man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an eminent instrument in the hando of God to spread the truth in this country , as well by his publi cations as by his preaching . He has lately published an appeal to the public in favor of the Baptist society in New England ; and lie is now collecting materials for the history of the Baptists . I will forward Mr. Edwards s list by the first safe conveyance. /z/ Your information of the low state of religion amongst us is but loo true ! May the Lord in mercy visit us . I travelled this fall about three hundred and fifty miles , and visited many of the Baptist churches . In several places there were , I thought , evident marks of the power of God attending gospel means . While on that journey I baptized four persons . I am sorry to hear of the decline of vital godliness in old England , and of the prevalence of Anti-Trinitarianism , or , if you please , infidelity . I be lieve no arguments will effectually refute that , in men of corrupt minds , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I need not solicit you to help with your prayers . I am glad to hear you express that happy degree of resignation to the will of God in your bereaved , afflicted state . Oh that blessed word ! " Our light afflictions , " etc . May God grant you an experience of its full import , make your last days your best , and late , very late , call you home from earthly labors to mansions of glory . This is the sincere prayer of Your most unworthy brother in the gospel , /z/ We close this chapter with a letter to the Rev. Abra ham Booth , of London , proposing an " exchange of some letters . " Mr. Booth was an eminent Baptist minister in his day , and an author of no little celebrity .

On each side of the aisle benches extended north and south to the Avails of the house , and there were benches in the gallery , which was entered by narrow stairs from a door on the south side of the house They did not approve of singing , and never practised it in public worship . When more than one elder was present , and the first had exhausted him self , he would say , * There is time and space left if any one has further to offer . In that case another and another would offer what he had to say ; so there was no set time for closing the meeting The house could not contain a large congregation , nor did the number present seem to re quire a larger house , as they were not crowded though many of them came in from the neighboring towns , on horseback , with women behind them on pillions . " Under the pastoral care of Dr. Manning the church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere long it became necessary to erect a new house of wor ship . With a view to the accommodation of the college , it was determined to build it in such a style of elegance , and of such dimensions , as should surpass any edifice of the kind connected with the Baptist denomination in the colonies . In looking over the records of the society , we find that , at a meeting held at the house of Mr. Daniel Cahoon , on Friday evening , Feb. 11 , 1774 , it was /z/ " Resolved , That we will all heartily unite as one man , in all lawful ways and means , to promote the good of this society ; and particularly attend to and revive the affair of building a meeting-house for the public worship of Almighty God , and also for holding Commencements in . " In accordance with this resolve , the society , with una nimity and promptness , entered upon the prosecution of their labors . A committee of two persons , Messrs . Joseph Brown and Jonathan Hammond , were immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view the dif ferent churches there , and to make a memorandum of their several dimensions and forms of architecture . " The old house and lot were sold at public auction , and the resent spacious lot , bounded by Thomas , Benefit , President , and North Main Streets , was purchased by Mr. John Angell . In this latter transaction very important service appears to have been rendered by Mr. William Russell . On the 25th of April , 1774 , at a meeting of the society , of which Dr. Manning was moderator , and Benjamin Stelle clerk , it was resolved 1 . That a petition be presented to the honorable General Assembly , praying that a charter , containing certain privileges and immunities , may be granted to the Baptist society in Providence . 2 . That the Rev. James Manning , Ephraim Wheaton , Nicholas Brown , David Howell , and Benjamin Thurber be a committee to draft a plan of a charter , and present the same to the society for approbation as soon as may be . 3 . That Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new meeting-house for said society . 4 . That Messrs . John Jenckes , Daniel Cahoon , Ephraim Wheaton , Nathaniel Wheaton , Daniel Tillinghast , Joseph Brown , William Russell , Edward Thurber , Nicholas Brown , Christopher Sheldon , and Benjamin Thurber , they or the major part of them , be a standing committee to as sist and advise with Mr. John Brown in locating and carrying into execu tion the building of the new meeting-house. /z/ Thus , while a large committee of eleven was chosen for assistance and advice , the carrying on of the building and the execution of the plans was wisely left to a committee of one . There was hence a unity of purpose , and a suc cess in the final results , which a large and divided com mittee could never have attained . In this matter our fathers have left on record an example which societies of the present day may do well to imitate . It is pleasing to notice , in this record , the unlimited confidence reposed in the abilities and discretion of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial and peril , the large reward offered by the British Government for the apprehension of the author of or leader in the destruction of the Gaspee , two years previous , might have seriously interfered with the plans of the society . In order to defray the additional expense of purchasing a lot and of building a house sufficiently large to accommo date the college , recourse was had to a lottery . This , as wo have already remarked in a previous chapter , was in accordance with the universal practice of religious societies , in Ilhode Island and elsewhere , at this period . The lot tery was divided into six classes , the time and place of drawing which were notified from time to time in the Providence Gazette . Eleven thousand nine hundred and seventy tickets were sold , at prices ranging from two and one half to five dollars each . The sum proposed to be raised by this scheme was two thousand pounds lawful money , or about seven thousand dollars . The managers appointed by the General Assembly , were Nicholas Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thurber , Nathaniel Wheaton , Daniel Tillinghast , William Holroyd , James Arnold , and Nicholas Power . In their announcement of June 25 , 1774 , they ask for the " cheerful /z/ assistance and encouragement of the public , especially when it is considered that this is the first time the Bap tist society have solicited their assistance in this way , which they can assure them would not now have been the case had they not purchased as much more land , and de signed a house as much larger than the society required for their own use ( purposely to accommodate public Com mencements ) , as will amount to the full sum proposed to be raised by this lottery . " On Monday , Aug. 29 , was the " raising " of the new meeting-house , clue notice of which had been given in the papers . A large crowd assembled , and the occasion seems to have been made a general holiday throughout the town . During the following year the house was so far com pleted that it was occupied by the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 28 , 1775 , when Pres ident Manning preached the dedication discourse , from Gen. xxviii. 17 , " And he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! This is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven . " On Tuesday , June 6 , the raising of the steeple , which occupied nearly four days , was finished . The plan of this most elegant piece of archi tecture was taken from the middle figure in the thirtieth plate of Gibbs s " Designs of Buildings and Ornaments , " representing the steeple of St. Martin s in the Fields , one of the finest churches in London . 1 It measures one hundred and eight feet from the top of the tower , and one hundred and eighty-five feet from the ground to the top of the vane . The total height of the steeple is one hundred and ninetysix feet . The house itself is eighty feet square . The roof and galleries are supported by twelve fluted pillars , of the 1 See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 195. /z/ Doric order . The weight of the original bell was two thousand five hundred and fifteen pounds , and upon it was the following motto : " For freedom of conscience the town was first planted ; Persuasion , not force , was used by the people ; This church was the eldest , and has not recanted , Enjoying , and granting , bell , temple , and steeple . " 1 Fronting three of the four streets that surround the house is a door , and fronting Benefit Street are two doors . Thus on Commencement days , and on other public occa sions , it can be easily and readily vacated . Mr. Joseph Brown , a member of the church , was the principal archi tect , and Mr. James Sumner superintended the building . The entire expense of the edifice and lot was upwards of twenty-five thousand dollars . When we consider the value and scarcity of money in those days , the perils and dangers of an impending war with the mother country , and also the fact that Providence was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was commenced , a population of only four thousand three hundred and twenty-one , ac cording to the official numeration of the inhabitants , we are amazed at the genius which could conceive , and the energy , enterprise , and skill which could successfully com plete so great an undertaking . Even at the present day , the venerable structure , with its tall , graceful spire , and its spacious enclosure , shaded by stately elms , constitutes one of the chief attractions of the city . In the beginning and progress of this enterprise , we have an illustration of the remarkable influence which Manning must have exerted over the people of his care . i Dissenters in Great Britain were not allowed to have steeples or bells to their churches . To this prohibition reference is undoubtedly bad in this inscription . /z/ Returning now to our correspondence , we find under date of May 25 , 1774 , a brief letter addressed to the Rev. Benjamin Wallin : /z/ Yours of February , now before me , was very acceptable , as also the two pamphlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope the sep aration in Dr. Gill s church , although attended with some circumstances in themselves disagreeable , may eventually prove to the furtherance of the gospel .

The college is in much the same state as when I wrote last .

With great respect , I am , sir , Yours , etc. , /z/ We find no further meniton by Dr. Manning of his " Anecdotes " or " Narrative " of the college . His ill health at this time , the cares and anxieties of a pastor in seasons of revival , and the breaking out of the Revolutionary War , prevented the final completion of his literary under taking . It is to be regretted that his manuscript papers have not been more carefully preserved . 1 Doubtless there /z/ was among them at his death a sketch of the college , which , if not completed , would at least have thrown light upon much that pertains to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held for the last time in Mr. Snow s meeting-house .

" " The company of cadets , " says the Chronicle , " in uniforms , made an elegant and truly military appearance ; and both in the procession and in the manoeuvres which they performed on the college green , procured universal appro bation , and convinced the spectators that Americans are no less capable of military discipline than Europeans . " Among the graduates on this occasion was Mr. Barna bas Binney , who received the valedictory honors of the class . He was born in Boston , Mass . In early youth he discovered a ready and prolific genius , which gave promise of usefulness in the clerical profession . But the liberality of his ideas , says his biographer , rendered it incapable for him to attach himself to any particular sect , and hence he could never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professed teacher of religion . He therefore perfected himself in the various branches of medicine , and finally established himself as a physician in the city of Philadelphia . Here he died , in the month of June , 1787 . His son , the Hon. Horace Binney , is now the Nes tor of the Pennsylvania bar , and ranks among the most distinguished lawyers and jurists of the day . The vale dictory oration of Mr. Binney , which was immediately published , 1 was universally regarded as a splendid produc- /z/ tion . After the usual addresses , it discussed fully the poli tics of that eventful period , and was listened to with the most profound attention . The merits of this production were greatly enhanced in the delivery by the gracefulness of the orator , and the uncommon elegance of his manners . Judge Dorrance , of Providence , was a member of this class . Immediately after graduating , he was appointed a tutor , and for many years during the latter part of his life he was one of the Trustees of the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection , was a brother of the Hon.

Mr. Ward , we observe , delivered an oration for the Mas ter s degree , but the other candidates for this honor took no part in the public exercises . PROVIDENCE , May 30 , 1774 . SIR : This is to let you know that Messrs . Ward and Arnold , your classmates , spent this evening with me to determine their Commence ment exercises , and they desired me to ask you what you propose to do for Commencement , when you expect to be at Providence to prepare , etc. , etc .

" This oppression he felt called upon to resist to the extent of his ability . To his intelligent and active exertions in behalf of religious liberty and equality , we of the present day and generation are greatly indebted for what we now enjoy as our birthright . To set forth in detail the efforts of Manning arid his contemporaries in this direction , would require more space than can be allotted to our present work . For full in formation on the points involved in this controversy , the reader is referred to Backus s Church History of New England , and especially to Prof. Hovey s Memoir of the Life and Times of Backus . One effort of Manning /z/ demands special mention . During the present year , which was a year of marked importance in the history of the country , the spirit of resistance to the unjust claims of England had greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at length determined to unite the separate colonies in defence of their common rights . For this purpose a congress of delegates met in Philadel phia , on the 5th of September , 1774 . To this meeting it was resolved to send Mr. Backus , the agent of the Bap tist churches , to see if something could not be done to secure rights and liberties from the government at home , as well as the government abroad . Accordingly , at the anniversary of the Warren Association , held the week after Commencement , the following certificate was given : To the honorable Delegates of the several Colonies in North America , met in a general Congress at Philadelphia : HONORABLE GENTLEMEN : As the Anti-pedobaptist churches in New England are most heartily concerned for the preservation and de fence of the rights and privileges of this country , and are deeply affected by the encroachments upon the same which have lately been made by the British Parliament , and are willing to unite with our dear countrymen , vigorously to pursue every prudent measure for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a distinct denomination of Protestants , we conceive that we have an equal claim to charter-rights with the rest of our fellowsubjects ; and yet have long been denied the free and full enjoyment of those rights , as to the support of religious worship . Therefore we , the elders and brethren of twenty Baptist churches , met in Association at Medfield , twenty miles from Boston , Sept. 14 , 1774 , have unanimously chosen and sent unto you the reverend and beloved Mr. Isaac Backus , as our agent , to lay our case , in these respects , before you , or otherwise to use all the prudent means he can for our relief . JOHN GANG , Moderator . HEZEKIAH SMITH , Clerk . The idea of sending a representative to this congress /z/ originated with Dr. Manning , Hczekiah Smith , John Gano , and others , who proposed it to Mr. Backus , at the college Commencement . Mr. Backus , having thus been duly ap pointed by the Warren Association , set out for Philadel phia on the 26th of September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here mentioned to show what travelling facilities were in those days , and what sacrifices were sometimes made by those ministers who attended from a distance the meetings of the college and of the associations . Upon his arrival in Philadelphia he immediately conferred with President Manning , and with the Philadelphia Baptist Association , then holding its sessions in that city . In the evening of Oct. 14 , says Backus , " there met at Carpenter s Hall , 1 Thomas Gushing , Samuel Adams , John Adams , and Robert Treat Paine , Esqrs. , delegates from Massachusetts ; and there were also present James Kinzie of New Jersey , Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward of Rhode Island , Joseph Galloway and Thomas Miflin , Esqrs. , of Pennsylvania , and other members of Congress . Mr. Rhodes , Mayor of the city of Philadelphia , Israel and James Pemberton , and Joseph Fox , Esqrs. , of the Quakers , and other gentlemen ; also Elders Manning , Gano , Jones , Rogers , Edwards , etc. , were present . The conference was opened by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the memorial which we had drawn up . " 1 " On the morning of the 5th of September , 1774 , the old Congress , as it is now familiarly known in our history , commenced its sessions , in Carpenter s Hall in Philadelphia . The place but ill corresponded with the real magnitude of the occasion . No tapestry bedecked its walls , no images of sages and heroes of other days looked down upon the scene . Yet , to one who could read the fu ture , it would have presented a simple grandeur , such as we may row look for in vain within the majestic halls of he Capitol , and amidst the imposing forms oi the Constitution . " Prof. GammeWs Life of Governor Ward . /z/ This memorial , which maybe found in Hovey s Memoir , after an eloquent plea in behalf of both civil and religious freedom , recounts in brief the various acts of oppression which the Baptists had suffered in the province of Massa chusetts Bay , commencing with the charter obtained at the " happy restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it we can not now determine . It was probably the joint production of several hands . The introductory plea and the closing remarks may very properly be attributed to his skilful pen . A copy was afterwards delivered to each of the delegates , together with Mr. Backus s " Appeal to the Public . " 1 The result of the conference was not at all sat isfactory , John Adams remarking that we might as well expect a change in the solar system as to expect that they would give up their Establishment ; or , as he himself gives the account , 2 " they might as well turn the heavenly bodies out of their annual and diurnal courses , as the people of Massachusetts at the present day from their meeting-house and Sunday laws . " This effort of Manning and his asso ciates was nevertheless the means indirectly of accomplish ing great good . It opened the minds of the people gen erally to a knowledge of their true position and principles , and prepared the way for the astonishing increase of the Baptists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Doubtless it was one of the impor- 1 The following is the title of this pamphlet , which Backus had prepared and published the previous year : " An Appeal to the Public for Religious Liberty , against the oppressors of the present day . Brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another . Gal . v. 13 . Boston : Printed by John Boyle , in Marlborough Street , 1773. " pp. 62 . A copy of this rare pamphlet is in the library of the University . 8 See Works of John Adams , Vol . II . p. 399. 3 In 1764 , when the college was founded , the Baptists in all America numbered only sixty churches , with five thousand members or communicants . The lapse of a century finds them , with a single exception , the largest denomination of evaii- /z/ tant agencies which slowly and silently effected a change in the public sentiment of Massachusetts herself , until , in 1833 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state were separated in the old Commonwealth , and soulliberty , as maintained by the Baptists of every age , was finally and perfectly secured . How this conference of the Baptists with the members of Congress was regarded by their opponents , may be seen from an extract from a letter of President Manning , dated Dec. 2 , 1774 , which we quote from Ilovey s Memoir of Backus . The writer states that the following assertions in reference to said conference were made by the Rev. Dr. Ezra Stiles ; namely : " That the Baptists had made an application to the Congress against the Massachusetts Bay ; that the delegates of that province expected only a private interview with some of the Baptists ; but instead of that , when they came they found a house full , etc. ; that they were attacked and treated in the most rude and abusive manner ; that the Baptists pre tended they were oppressed , but , after all their endeavors , they could only complain of a poor fourpence ; that they were ashamed of their errand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two impudent fellows , who , with Israel Pemberton , abused them in a most scandalous manner ; that all the delegates present were surprised at and ashamed of them , and thought they complained without the least foundation/ etc . Then Dr. Stiles added : " When we have the power in our own hands , ice will remember them . " gelical Christians in the United States , having 588 associations , 12,648 churches , and 1,037,576 communicants ; also 35 colleges or universities , upwards of 100 academies , 13 theological schools , and 26 weekly , monthly , semi-monthly , and quarterly periodicals . If to this we add 71,767 Baptists in Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Canada , and the West India Islands , and 499,941 in the United States who practise immersion , but are not included among the regular Baptists , we have a total of 1,609,284 members , being an increase during the past century of more than a million and a half .

Brown , of Phhiladelpia , and a paper on the " Growth of the Baptist Denomination in this Country during the last half Century , " read by the Rev.

JOSIAH READ , committee ANDREW LAW , L in behalf of the JAMES FULTON , J Senior Class . COLLEGE IN PROVIDENCE , June 8 , 1775 . To this communication the President and Professor thus reply : To THE COMMITTEE OF THE SENIOR CLASS : GENTLEMEN : Your dutiful and reasonable petition has been duly attended to ; and permit us to assure you , that it gives us no small satis faction that the present members of this institution , and particularly the respectable Senior Class , are so sensibly affected with the distresses of our country in its present glorious struggles for liberty . We rejoice that you are so ready to sacrifice that applause to which your abilities would en title you at a public Commencement ; and though by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give proof of your abilities in pleading the righteous cause of liberty , for which your predecessors in this institution have been justly celebrated , yet you have hereby given us a convincing proof of your inviolable attachment to the true interests of /z/ your country . Be assured that we shall most heartily concur in this , and every other measure which has been , or may be , adopted by the grand American Congress , as well as the Legislature of this colony , in order to obtain the most complete redress of all our grievances ; and deem it the greatest honor to which a noble and generous mind can aspire , to con tribute in any degree towards a restoration and reestablishment in our country of all those liberties and privileges , both civil and religious , which the Almighty Father of the universe originally granted to every individ ual of the human race , and which all ought to enjoy till by law forfeited ; which reason claims , which the right of soil , obtained of the natives by free purchase , settles upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been recognized by Great Britain , and guaranteed to us by the faith of the English nation .

And though the din of arms and the horrors of a civil war should in vade our hitherto peaceful habitations , yet even these are preferable to a mean and base submission to arbitrary power and lawless rapine .

In accordance with the decisions of the college author ities thus announced , and for the reasons assigned , there was no public Commencement , although the graduating class consisted of ten , a larger number than any hereto-/z/ fore . The battles of Lexington and of Bunker Hill had electrified the public mind , and turned away its attention from the literary performances of the stage to the sterner duties of the field and the camp . A prominent member of this class was Pardon Bowen , who afterwards became one of the most distinguished physicians of Providence . He was an active member of the Rhode Island Medical Society , and for seven years was its presiding officer . Prof. Goddard , in Thatcher s Lives of Eminent Physicians , has paid a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also was Robert Rogers , who was elected to the fel lowship in 1788 , and who is said to have attended nearly every Commencement until his death , in 1835 . For sev eral years he taught a classical school in Newport , which became one of the nurseries of the college . In this class also was Andrew Law , a clergyman who , in 1820 , received the degree of LL.D . from another college . The meeting of the corporation this year was rendered memorable by the election of John Brown as treasurer , the duties of which office he discharged with great ability and accept ance for a period of twenty-two years . The next year Commencement was held as usual , and , for the first time , in the new Baptist meeting-house . Nine young gentlemen graduated and received their diplomas , among whom was Daniel Gano , eldest brother of Dr. Stephen Gano , Mr. Manning s successor in the pastoral office . This was the last public Commencement held during the war . On Saturday , Dec. 7 , following , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men-of-war , anchored in Newport harbor , landed a body of troops , and took possession of the place . Providence was hence all in confusion . Troops were massed throughout the town , martial law was proclaimed , college studies were inter- /z/ rupted , and the students were dismissed to their respect ive homes , as appears from the following notification of the President , published in the Providence Gazette : This is to inform all the students that their attendance on college or ders is hereby dispensed with , until the end of the next spring vacation ; and that they are at liberty to return home , or prosecute their studies elsewhere , as they think proper ; and that those who pay as particular attention to their studies as these confused times will admit , shall then be considered in the same light and standing as if they had given the usual attendance here .

A letter to his friend the Rev.

Since I wrote you last I have seen both glorious and gloomy days . The winter before last it pleased God to pour out his Spirit upon the people of this town in a most glorious manner . I believe about two hundred persons were converted within the space of a few months . I baptized more than half that number in less than a year . But the fatal 19th of April , the day of the Lexington battle , like an electric stroke put a stop to the progress of the work , as well in other places as here . Oh horrid war ! How contrary to the spirit of Jesus ! May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the horrid roar of artillery , and the hostile flames , destroying your neighbors habitations . These I have re peatedly seen and heard , sitting in my house and lying in my bed . I desire to bless God , these scenes of carnage always appeared peculiarly shocking to me , and I feel no disposition to destroy or injure my fellowmen . May the Lord turn the hearts of all to himself ! and then I know war " will instantly cease . The scene of action , in a hostile way , has been at the distance of more than two hundred miles from me this campaign , and I could wish it had been more than ten thousand , if it must be at all . You will not think strange that the colleges have suffered greatly by this tremendous convulsion ; though I believe we have not suffered more than our neighbors . Our number is about thirty ; but the high price of every thing amongst us , I fear , will drive some of the students away . For more than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some places in Connecticut . But there are pleasing prospects opening in several places around us ; I think there are some favorable symptoms in my congregation . May the Lord increase these . There have been seven Baptist ministers ordained in New England since last April , and about that number of churches constituted within about a year . These are encouraging circumstances amidst our troubles . My dear Brother Gano 1 has suffered greatly by the war , and where he now is with his distressed , numerous family , I can not learn , as I have never had a line from him since ho was obliged to quit New York . 1 Rev. John Gano . He served as chaplain during the war , and by Ms patriotic counsels and earnest prayers did verynuch to encourage the officers and pri vates of the American army . After the occupation of New York by the British , he retired with his family to a farm within live miles of Warwick , near the New Jersey line . Mr. Manning visited his family in May , 1779 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See Chapter VI. ) /z/ There was a glorious revival of religion , last winter , at Hopewell in the Jerseys . Ninety were baptized and added to that church in seven months . I have heard nothing of the state of religion from the southward for a long time ; but I fear that politics and war have not promoted it . If they have , they have fared better than New England . Mr. Mackaness informs me that there is a glorious revival in many parts of England , especially in the Establishment . I heartily rejoice to hear the news . May the kingdom of the Redeemer come throughout the world ! The gentlemen you recommended to me as worthy of the honors of the college were all graduated ; but as the communication was shut up their diplomas were never written ; and as I have but short notice of this opportunity , and as there is no parchment in the country , I could not forward them now . But I hope it may not be long before these obstruc tions may be removed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many crowns of rejoicing in the day of Christ Jesus . If possible , let me have a line from you . If not , grant me an interest in your prayers at our Father s throne , that I may be kept in the day of temptation , and be enabled to fulfil the ministry which I have received . With great respect , and many obligations , I remain , dear sir , Your unworthy brother in the gospel , /z/ The religious awakening to which Dr. Manning here re fers is more particularly described in a letter to the Rev. Benjamin Wallin , dated Nov. 12 , 1776 : /z/ It* is long since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you , or an op portunity of writing to you , in consequence of the perilous times in which we live . But I hope , though Great Britain and America are at war , that the saints of God do not mean to wage war against each other , or suffer their love and affection towards each other in the least to abate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective contending countries . I do not think it the business of the ministers of Christ to meddle much with politics , as they are concerned to promote a kingdom not of this world . You will not , therefore , expect anything from me on /z/ this subject , except so far as the cause of the Redeemer appears to be af fected by the alarming aspect of public affairs . In the beginning of the winter of 1774 , it pleased the Lord in a most remarkable manner to revive his work in the town of Providence , and more especially among the people of my charge . Such a time I never before saw . Numbers were pricked to the heart . Our public assemblies by night and by day were crowded , and the auditors seemed to hear as for the life of their souls . It was frequently an hour before I could get from the pulpit to the door , on account of the numbers thronging to have an opportunity of stating the condition of their minds , some exulting in the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewailing their awful , ruined state , and asking , " What must I do to be saved ? " My dear sir , never until now did I so effectually feel the insufficiency of instruments to afford f , hc poor sinner the least help . How glorious now to view the all-sufficient Saviour ! There I would stand pointing to him , and saying , " Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world . " This was all I could do . Never before did I experience such happy hours in the pulpit . Day and night my dear people resorted to my house to open to me the state of their souls , insomuch that it was with difficulty I could at any time attend to secular business ; . and I think I may say with truth , that I had as little inclination as leisure for it , fur ther than the absolute demands of duty required . And what added peculiarly to my happiness was , that the Lord visited the college as remarkably as the congregation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find nearly all the students assembled , and joining in prayer and praise to God . Instead of my lectures on logic and philosophy , they would request me to speak to them of the things concerning the kingdom of God . But your experience in the service of the dear Redeemer will enable you to form a more adequate idea of the concomitant circumstances of such a work of grace than I can here com municate . In a word , the mountains seemed to melt at the presence of the Lord ; the pride and haughtiness of man were laid low ; and the Lord alone was exalted . In the space of about six months , I baptized more than one hundred persons . 1 Many were also added to the other churches of the town , who , I believe , were first added to the Lord . Thus the glo rious work continued , and rather increased , until the fatal 19th of April , 1 Among those who became religious at this time was Mrs. Manning , whom her husband baptized iu the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , which , like an electiic shock , filled every mind with horror and compassion . When one would have thought this would have promoted seriousness amongst us , it , strange to toll , operated the very reverse ; for since the fatal day languor and abate ment of zeal for God seem greatly to have obtained , and instances of conversion to Christ are rare . Yet I hope our affairs are now somewhat improving . I have often labored to investigate the cause of the almost universal decline of vital godliness amongst us since the commencement of this unhappy war , but can find no other than that war is in its nature a hardening judgment . I have heard of and know many places where the Lord by his Spirit appeared to be at work when hostilities com menced , and in every instance the work immediately abated . In one in stance only were they made the means of any considerable awakening . Yet , blessed be God ! the dews of divine grace have distilled gloriously in many places , and reformations arc commencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grace that Christ s kingdom may so come in both countries , yea , in all the world , that war may cease from the ends of the earth . I expect Mr. Thomas Mackaness , merchant in partnership with Mr. Thornton , will hand you this . He has been a great sufferer by hav ing been taken on his voyage to Quebec , in consequence of which he lost vessel and cargo . He can give further information concerning me , if you desire . With sincere regards , I am , dear sir , Your friend and unworthy brother , /z/ The following reply , the last letter from Wallin ever received by Manning , shows that war had not alienated all our English friends . This fact is delightfully- evident in the correspondence of a later period . MAZE POND , SOUTHWAEK , Aug. 30 , 1777. /z/ I embrace the opportunity of acknowledging your very acceptable fa vor , which came to hand in January last . Oh the wonders of Omnipotent love ! Peace on earth and good-will to men , dispensed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corrupt before God , and filled with violence ! It is the Lord s doings , and marvellous in our /z/ eyes . Your striking account of the heavenly visitation on the church and college over which you preside filled me with gratitude and joy , as it did my people , and indeed many others , ministers and respectable individuals , from whom I could not conceal the glad tidings . They proved as cold waters to a thirsty soul . Dear sir , if you would have such good news a secret , you must not trust a man with it who wishes to spread abroad the salvation of God , that all who love it may have continual occasion to glo rify his name . Many thanksgivings redounded to the King of all grace upon a rehearsal of this glorious display of his mercy , an evidence this of a genuine love among the saints whose lot is cast in the respective con tending countries , originally united , now waging war , to the grief of all who wish well to Great Britian . What stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfeigned great joy in each other s prosperity ! It would be pleasing to return a similar account from the mother coun try , but the state of religion is not so delightful and promising . Indeed , many preachers go forth , and the number of hearers increases , but it is not so strictly in the way of the Lord as I could wish . It seems to me vain glorious , and in some respects tending to confusion , of which God is not the author . Among the Episcopalians who have any idea of gospel truth ( though I think for the most part they are rather superficial ) , their way is to open a chapel , as they style it , and , having drawn an audience , they are fixed at a custom-rate for their seats . On this plan many , and some of them sumptuous buildings have been erected , to which , by report , great numbers resort . I would hope by this means some may be led into a saving knowledge of Christ , and so far I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending and the effect of this carnal contrivance and vague kind of social religion to the accommodation of man and the neglect of all gospel order . A becoming zeal for this is now a matter of reproach with many among us , insomuch that the enlightened , who wish to be conformed to the positive institutions of the Redeemer , are under great discourage ments , and few join the regular churches of any denomination ; so that a godly discipline in particular communion is in a manner out-of-doors . The consequence of all this will , I fear , be a still greater declension from real and practical piety . The Baptists more especially are obnoxious to these popular gentlemen , of which a specimen has lately transpired in an abusive pamphlet , by a warm-spirited young clergyman . Irritated by some altercations on a late baptizing in the parish of his vicarage , he has fallen foul on me for my little address to the churches of the Congrega- /z/ tional order , the first edition of which you have in a volume of mine . This piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , being anony mous , was by many ascribed to a person of the Independent persuasion before the author was discovered . This man holds me up to the public as a masterpiece of bigotry , and an enemy to all Pedobaptist communion , and at the same time pretends to much candor . This newly-adopted mode has already emboldened some froward men to set up for themselves , under the color of Protestant dissenters ; and , among the rest , lately , one Mr. Dawson , a Sabbatarian Baptist , not long since in New England . Alas ! these men make a trade of religion ! It likewise favors party divisions in church , too frequent , and which now for the most part end in grievous and shameful separations , to the prejudice of broth erly love ; it being the taste of the day to follow new societies and teach ers . This is a melancholy case ; for we know by the disciples at Corinth that in this carnal spirit there is little regard to the power and grace of God in the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in general steady , and our church state gradually advances . Of late we have been favored with some re markable instances of conversion ; among others , last month I baptized four young persons of one family , brothers and sisters in the flesh , the children of a deacon lately deceased , who was the second person that passed under my hands . This was in the year 1741 . Their grandfather and grandmother were also valuable members of the church some years after I succeeded my honored father in the pastoral charge . The Lord will not fail , but may exceed the terms of his promise . His grace is not bound . You will not wonder at the joy of the brethren on this singular occasion . I fear the Papists take advantage of our civil and religious confusion . According to some there are alarming symptoms of their increase in our nation and cities . Indeed , unknown and disorderly societies but too much favor their design , while the political sentiments of many Protes tants are a hinderance , at least , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . May he pour out the Spirit from on high on both countries , and graciously restore our public tranquillity on an honorable and permanent foundation ; and may you , dear sir , enjoy many happy hours in the closet and in the pulpit , and again be employed in a field white for harvest , as in the year 1775 . As for me , my age and infirmities promise little further capacity for usefulness . Infinite are the obligations upon me for the grace by which I have been sustained thirty-seven years in the arduous work of the minis- /z/ try . Our great Divine Master doth riot cast off his old servants ; yet the prayers of my brethren may subserve to a finish with joy ; a request , I am persuaded , you will not deny me . Having the honor of a place in your library , it seemed decent to present a copy of another attempt since my last . Parents , you know , sir , oft show their vanity in dressing up their children . Excuse the uniform of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind reception with that of its preceding companions . If any hints concerning parables in general , or that in particular which is the subject in hand , prove per tinent and useful , the author flatters himself that some other pen may improve them to public advantage . For an increase of the church s prosperity and a period to the national trouble , we unite in our prayers to the Most High , with which I conclude . Dear sir , Your very obliged and affectionate Brother , /z/ P. S. The copy on The Prodigal presented to the college with my most respectful compliments to the venerable members , if it be needful to mention so trifling a matter to them , was bound in readiness soon after the publication . My notice of this opportunity was short , which it is hoped will apologize for the mourning dress of those directed to you and the other gentlemen , on whose candor in perusing them I rely . If by any means you can inform me of the arrival of these , it will be acceptable . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in expectation of soon receiving a digested and authentic account of your college , which , I hope , will survive the civil commotions , and prove a flourishing seminary of learning under your direction . If this design is carried into execution , I hope to be presented with some copies the first opportunity . The following letter , addressed to Miss A. Howard , in Scarboro , England , illustrates the peculiar tact and deli cacy of Dr. Manning in his efforts to alleviate the dis tressed , and to give sympathy and counsel to the bereaved and unfortunate . In a footnote he remarks that the letter actually sent to Miss Howard was greatly altered and en larged from this , which seems to be the first copy . Capt . /z/ Bell , it appears , was taken with his vessel , by some of our cruisers , and brought into Providence , where he died . He was engaged to be married to the lady in question , who , as will be observed , was an entire stranger to Manning . PROVIDENCE , NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will excuse the forwardness of a stranger in addressing a line to you , when I inform you of the amiable character given you by my dear unfortunate friend , Mr. Thomas Mackaness ; as also from the sym pathetic feelings of my heart under the distress which the news of the unexpected and truly lamentable death of the dear Capt . Bell must occa sion , especially considering the endearing relation which , I am informed , he soon expected to stand in to you . Horrid war ! What havoc dost thou make ! To glut thy rage , must the youthful , amiable , virtuous , and what exceeds all these , must the singularly pious Bell fall a victim to thy relentless stroke ! Must the hearts of tender parents bleed ? Must more than half of all your happiness on earth perish ? Must the dear bereaved church at Hull be bathed in tears ? Must the tender orphans , his peculiar care , bewail the loss of their kindest benefactor , under thy unnatural domain ? But why do I open afresh the wounds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , doubtless , have oft portrayed the bliss of the intended conjugal relation , and recounted the joys of such a virtuous connection , which , by a stroke , is now all blasted , and you sit solitary as one forsaken , and , in the plaintive strain of the sweet singer of Israel , cry , Lover and friend hast thou removed from me , and mine acquaintance into darkness . " I shall no more see good in the land of the living . " But stop , my friend ! Why these unavailing sighs 1 For whom do you thus lament ? Is it for him who was so fully ripe for heaven , that earth was no longer for him a fit habitation , for him whose heart and conversation were so in heaven , that the Redeemer chose to receive him to that society where , unmolested , he might sing those songs of praise , and give full scope to that ardor of spirit , which he had here so oft attempted , and so uniformly felt ? True , the loss to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gain . And could you wish to disengage him from that blessed employment , from that glorious society for which you long , and where you hope to bear a part in those anthems of praise to God and the Lamb forever ? /z/ Can you desire that he , disengaged from every earthly clog , should again , for many painful years , groan under the weight of a body of death , and see the object of his highest love through faith s dim medium , as we do now , and mourn his absence from our Father s house , and all this to gratify and assist you through this painful journey home to glory ? No , madam ; both reason and religion forbid this selfish passion ; and , pain ful as the thought of separation is , I know your generous soul can t wish it . You only mourn that you arc left behind , and that our degenerate world has lost his bright example . But remember that he has left you in better hands , that the swift-revolving years will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only he but Jesus waits to welcome trav ellers home . Instead of pensive sadness , then , cheer up , and , as the poet sung , let us go singing on . It will render the journey less painful ; and perhaps more than half the way is passed . Remember that now your at tachment to heaven is stronger than ever . There your best friend , your kindred dwell , there God your Saviour reigns . May he grant you his divine presence to support you under the sore affliction , and abundantly sanctify his hand to you , that you may be more and more prepared for glory . Had I great interest at a throne of grace , you should not want a share of it ; for I think if joining in your sorrow and mingling a friendly tear will alleviate your grief , I have borne a part for you . Since the ship was taken and brought in here , I have often thought I should have been peculiarly happy had it been the will of Heaven to have spared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British friends lament . But here I find my want of submission to the will of God ; for I am only happy when from the heart I can say to God , Thy will be done . Probably I shall never see your face in the flesh ; but should this hap piness be denied me , I hope to see you where there shall be no more sor row nor sighing ; where God shall wipe away every tear from our eyes ; where we shall see , not only the dear man whom we lament , but all the saints on earth , with those uncalled as yet , with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , with the apostles and prophets , and the general assembly of those whose names are written in heaven , with Jesus , the mediator , at their head , and God the Judge of all . Oh ! what a glorious day when we shall rise to this exalted station ! My dear friend , let us , then , walk worthy of such a calling ; that whether we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Lord . And here , I recollect , we may have an interview ; /z/ I mean at the throne of grace . Wishing you the highest possible happi ness , 1 subscribe myself , madam , Your friend and servant , /z/ The folio wing letter to the Rev. John Berridge , of Lon don , shows Dr. Manning in the light of a controversialist . How skilfully he could handle the weapons of polemic warfare , will best be learned from its perusal . The pun gency of its wit , the force of its argument , and the excel lence of its style and spirit , amply compensate for its unusual length . PROVIDENCE , NEW ENGLAND , Nov. 19 , 1776. /z/ Lately , through the kindness of my friend Mr. Thos . Mackaness , of London , I had the perusal of the " Christian World Unmasked . Pray , Come and Peep . By John Berridge , A.M. , etc. " 8vo . Lond. 1773 . I accepted the invitation , and found the book in general corresponded well to the titlepage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I peeped again , but could not discover the least gleam of light , and therefore con cluded the mask was in the way ; when , lo ! I turned to my New Testa ment , and found that light which is concealed by a veil while AVO search the Old for New Testament ordinances . Ay , Baptist , Baptist ; I thought you was a water-fowl when you referred to the pages . Well , be it so ; if he can be an instrument to pick open your eyes a little wider , I hope you will have no objection to him on that account . You say , " I would hate no man , and do condemn no man for thinking differently in this matter . " Now if you mean to place the emphasis on thinking , I think I shall not fare well for saying differently . However , as you have made very free with the Grazier , I hope I may with the Doctor , upon the same principle , without offence . You say that you have no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formerly . Both the ordinances are of God s appointment , etc . Till now , I find you produc ing plain Scripture warrant for the glorious doctrines you advance . And must we onlj rely upon the Doctor s bare word for the truth of this last /z/ assertion ? What shall I say , then , to that voice I hear from Heaven , " Tlds is my beloved Son , hear ye him , " and that , too , in the presence of Moses and Elias ? Pray , Doctor , have me excused till you point me to the page where this great prophet authorizes you to say this . I have carefully examined the dispensatory , but can find no such prescription between the lids of it . You ask why Christian children may not be re ceived into the church s fold by baptism , as were the Jewish by circum cision . Answer : The former was by God s special appointment , but not the latter . Surely , then , wide is the difference in their case . To say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a truly Christian Protes tant doctor ; for if it is necessary , totidem verbis , for the Scripture to forbid everything practised under the name of Christianity , which is , notwith standing , contrary to the true genius of the gospel , it would require a Bible ten times as large as Dr. Gill s Exposition of it . And then what should we field-preachers and the recruiting sergeants of the country do ? But pray , Doctor , is baptism a moral precept , or an institution purely positive ? If the latter , why need we wreck and torture our brains to find a reason for either mode or subjects , time or place , or anything further than what the New Testament simply informs us concerning it , as there is the only place where we should look for it 1 Or why need we be dis tressed how little children should be brought to Christ , while he has not seen fit to teach us the way in which it should be done ? In the next paragraph , you say that children dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that is , no mortal can tell . But I think I will undertake to tell what it is when the Doctor gives me a sat isfactory account how baptismal water , through the grace of Christ , does wash away the guilt of original or birth-sin ( so that dying before they can discern between good and evil , etc. , they will be saved ) , consistent with the whole tenor of the rest of this performance , where the merits of Christ , applied by the Spirit of God , alone cleanses from sin ; especially at the top of page 223 , where the Doctor asserts that right to pardon , and a claim to eternal life , are wholly treasured up in Christ , and only are at tained through faith in him ; I say , when the Doctor gives a solution of this Gordian knot , I will undertake the other part promised . Will the Doctor assert that infants , who are not capable of discerning between good and evil , are capable of believing in a gospel sense ? If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a right to pardon , or any claim to eternal life , which are blessings treasured up in Christ ? I can not see how this diffi culty can be solved , without recourse to believing by proxy , which I /z/ think the Doctor will not recur to , lest the Grassier should learn the trick , and get the curate to believe , in his stead , that he might follow more agreeable business and yet be safe , and after all vanquish the Doctor with his own weapon . But if there is so much efficacy in baptism , it is a pity everybody should not partake of it . And pray , can anybody administer it that pleases ? or must he be a clergyman ? If so , alas ! what shall our poor American church-people do ? For since the King s naughty minis ters undertook to enslave the colonies , the rebel congresses , conventions , committees , etc. , have forbid the clergy to pray for the King , and they are so sulky that they will neither preach , pray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor infants who may happen to die all perish through their obstinacy , the wickedness of the congresses , and the King s ministers 1 If this be the case , I hope the Doctor s patriotism will furnish the minority with a new argument , to urge at the next sitting of Parliament the repeal of the laws ; and which must be very forcible , for I do not believe that ad ministration ever intended to kill our souls . I know pious Lord Dartmouth will turn about ; for it is storied in America that he was very squeam ish when they determined to kill only their bodies . I was glad , however . to find , with the Grazier , you was not " forgetting Jesus Christ to help out some defects , " in which you put the grace of Christ together with " bap tismal water , " especially as a man of a plain understanding might con clude the former quite sufficient of itself ; though the Doctor seems to have given baptismal water the preference , agreeable to the Grazier s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the shot himself , and leaving Jesus to discharge the rest of the reckoning . But how will this comport with the sentiment advanced in page 17G : " It matters not at all whether the work be ritual or moral , while we seek to be saved by it , If we seek at all to be saved by any Avork of our own , we fall from grace . * Pray , Doctor , is not baptism as much a work as circumcision ? On page 224 you quote God s declaration to Abraham , long before Jesus l Perhaps Dr. Manning is too sweeping in his remarks touching the loyalty of the Episcopal clergy . It is certain , however , that there was ample foundation for such remarks . In the chapter of Staples s Annuls devoted to ecclesiastical history , we find that the liev . John Graves , who was the rector of the Episcopal church in Providence until July , 1776 , declined to officiate after that period , because he could not be permitted to read the usual and ordinary prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ordination vows to offer . The church was in consequence closed , most of the time , during the war of the Revolution . For a clear account of the relations of the Church of England to the American Colonies , see Thornton s " Pulpit of the American Revolution . " /z/ was given , " That an uncircumcised child shall be cut off from his peo ple ; he hath broken my covenant " ( Gen. xvii. 16 ) , and say the covenant here spoken of is not the Sinai covenant , but the covenant of grace . Circumcision was the outward sign of this covenant to Abraham , as bap tism is to us . The outward rite is different , but the covenant the same . This I compared with pp. 33 , 144 , where I find it thus written : " If you desire benefit from the covenant of grace , you must be baptized , and if you seek advantage from the covenant of works , you must be circumcised . A rite of initiation is appointed to both the covenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double rite . " " In a covenant of works a man must work for life by his own will and power , " etc . " The tenor of this covenant is , do and live , transgress and die , " etc. u In the covenant of grace all things are purchased for us , and bestowed upon us generously and freely . These two covenants are called the old and the new ; no more are noticed in Scripture ; and a suitable law respecting both is mentioned , the law of works and the law of faith ( Rom. iii . 27 ) . All other laws are cobwebs of a human brain , such as the law of sincere obedience , the law of love , " etc . And pray why not the law of infantbaptism ? Now if the covenant made with Abraham was the covenant of grace , and circumcision was the sign of it , why are we told that if we desire benefit from the covenant of works we must be circumcised ? It can not be because these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Doctor says their rites are different , unless the covenant of grace in Abraham s days is a covenant of works in ours ; for there are but two covenants , the old and the new , noticed in the Scrip tures . But I will leave you to compare these passages yourself , without further insisting upon their inconsistency , and come to the dernier resort : " That no harm can possibly arise from baptizing an infant . " Stop , Doctor , stop ; these expressions are very strong , I fear much too strong . For did not the Doctor say , page 222 , " That much people , who are strangers to the work of regeneration , suppose the new birth is only their baptism , and that every one is born again who is baptized 1 " And is it strange they should think so when they hear thanks returned to God on its perform ance , that it is so by the doctors appointed to that service ? Surely , to lead such multitudes into error in such an important article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harmless thing , especially if we believe our Saviour s account of it ( John iii . 3 ) . Besides , it makes great doctors con tradict themselves when they write or talk about the covenants . If I was /z/ one of those doctors , I should think this was some harm . But , most of all , it is invading the kingly office of the great Redeemer ; for I can see no reason why the merits of saints may not bo mingled with the merits of Christ to save the Christian , as the laws or ordinances of men with those of Christ to rule and govern it . Shall we , like Uzzah , not trust the Lord wholly with his ark , but must have a meddling finger ? I forbear to recite the following part of your sentence . I must mention one more evil which arises from baptizing infants , which is this : The practice constrains those servants of God who practise it often to wrest and explain away the plain , obvious sense of Scripture to vindicate it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mars its glory , and encour ages the opposers of the glorious doctrines of grace in rejecting the pure gospel of Jesus Christ . This has often grieved my heart , and in no case more than in reading your book , where the glorious Redeemer is exalted in his office , nature and grace , and the pride of man stained , until you get hampered , as I think , with infant-baptism , which neither we nor our fathers are able to prove was ever the mind of Christ . Upon this prin ciple I concluded to address to you a line ; not under the notion of a disp - tation , but in a friendly way to hint at what I thought mistakes in your performance . You may probably esteem me rigid , from this specimen , and greatly at tached to externals ; but I think otherwise of myself . I think I love the followers of the Lamb , under whatever denomination they pass amongst men . I esteem them my brethren , and feel disposed to make all proper allowances for the prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that I myself also am in the body , and peculiarly need the candor of my Christian friends . I hope , therefore , that the benevo lence of my intentions will apologize for the rudeness of my manner . I shall always rejoice to hear that dear Mr. Berridge is alive for God , is held as a star in the right hand of Jesus , and is honored with many seals of his ministry , even though he should continue to think and practise very different from myself relative to the mode and subjects of baptism ; though I sincerely pray that you may be set entirely right in this matter .

I am , reverend and dear sir , Your friend and servant in the gospel , /z/ On Wednesday , Sept. 3 , 1777 , the members of the cor poration , as appears from the records , met in the new Baptist meeting-house , and conferred degrees upon seven members of the Senior Class , who had been examined the day previous , in accordance with the following , which we take from the Providence Gazette . There was no Com mencement : As the term of vacation in the college is now expired , the students are hereby informed , that , in the present state of public affairs , the prosecu tion of studies here is utterly impracticable , especially while this continues a garrisoned town . It is therefore recommended to them to prosecute their studies elsewhere for the present , to the best advantage in their power . The Senior Class are desired to meet at the college , to pass their examination , and receive their degrees at the usual time , being the 2d day of September next , unless the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , /z/ PROVIDENCE , May 16 , 1777 . There was no further meeting of the corporation held until May 5 , 1780 , when an attempt was made to revive the instruction of the college . The years following the breaking up of the college were seasons of great distress . Many families left the town , unable to obtain a subsistence . The records of the church show that members of influence and property , some of them warm personal friends of Manning , were really ob jects of commiseration . It was the delight of the pastor , in this hour of trial , when members of his flock were scat tered by the war , and the influences of literature seemed /z/ paralyzed , to aid the needy , and to throw the sunshine of Christian sympathy around the path of the afflicted . His knowledge of the world , his courtly manners , his Christian meekness , combined with his extraordinary energy of char acter , enabled him to move at ease in every class of soci ety , and thus to promote the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus related by How T land , in his brief memoir of Dr. Manning , published in the year 1815 in the Rhode Island Literary Repos itory : " He enjoyed the confidence of the general commanding in this depart ment , and in one instance in particular had all the benevolent feelings of his heart gratified , even at the last moment , after earnest entreaty , by ob taining from General Sullivan an order of reprieve for three men of the regular army who were sentenced to death by that inexorable tribunal , a court-martial . The moment he obtained the order revoking the sentence , he mounted his horse at the General s door , and , by pushing him to his utmost speed , arrived at the place of execution at the instant the last act had begun which was to precipitate them into eternity . With a voice which none could disobey , he commanded the execution to stay , and de livered the General s order to the officer of the guard . The joy of the attending crowd seemed greater than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life from the last verge of death , they did not for a moment feel that it was a reality . " In the same memoir Mr. Howland thus relates the his tory of an important civil function which was confided to Dr. Manning , and by him most skilfully discharged : " The repeated calls of the militia , while the enemy remained in this State ( Rhode Island ) , operated with peculiar severity . In some districts the ground could not be planted , and in others the harvest was not reaped in season ; the usual abundance of the earth fell short , and lie who had the best means of supply frequently had to divide his store with a suffering neighbor . In addition to this , laws existed in several States prohibiting the transport of provisions beyond the State boundary . The /z/ plea for these restrictions was that there was danger of the enemy being supplied ; but the real cause was to retain the provisions for the purpose of furnishing their State s quota of troops , as the war was generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual States . These restrictions came with double weight on the citizens of Rhode Island , as a great part of the State was in the possession of the enemy , and the remainder was filled with those who had fled from the islands and the coasts for safety . These restrictions and pi ohibitions were variously modified ; but under all their variations , which referred chiefly to the mode of executing the law , the grievance was the same . The Governor and council of war of Rhode Island , wishing to give their language of remon strance a power of impression which paper could not be made to convey , commissioned Doctor Manning to repair to Connecticut , and represent , personally , to the government of that State our peculiar situation , and to confer with and propose to them a different mode of procedure . The Doctor in this embassy obtained all that he desired ; the restrictions were removed , and , in addition to this , on his representation of the circum stances of the refugees from the islands , contributions , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parishes in the interior of Connecticut , and forwarded for their relief . " In this connection we can not refrain from quoting an other anecdote of Manning , as an illustration of his readi ness to use every opportunity to benefit the souls of his fellow-men . We find it in Stone s Life and Recollections of Howland . In May , 1780 , occurred " the dark day , " so often referred to by the chroniclers of that period . 1 At noon all ordinary business was suspended . Fowls sought their roosts , cattle retired as at night , and men stood ap palled at the dread appearances . " I went , " says Howland , " into the street , where many persons were assembled , and among others Dr. Manning . A powerful man , but profligate , advanced up to the President , and said , How 1 For an account of the " Dark Day , " by Prof. Williams , see Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , Vol . I. Sec also Holmes s Life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , sir ? what does it mean ? The President , with great solemnity of manner , replied , I consider it , sir , as a prelude to that great and important day when the final consummation of all things is to take place . " A letter which we find addressed to his friend and for mer pupil the Rev. Thomas Ustick , now in Ashford , Con necticut , shows that the college was uppermost in all his thoughts and plans , even though the fortunes of . war had suspended its public exercises : PROVIDENCE , Nov. 17 , 1778. /z/ I am told that Mr. Kelly has entirely quitted Pomfret , to their great disappointment . There was a large gathering of people attended , and the prospect was encouraging of great good to be done there .

I am very sorry that I did not think to mention something of this to the Association ; but I have written and am about writing to all our ministers capable of teach ing Latin , to immediately engage in the business . I hope , from present appearances , that college orders may be again revived next spring . I think you ought at least to visit Pomfret , and help them under their pres ent disappointment , as I understand you do not preach statedly at Ashford , and that you are nearly convinced that it will not be best for you to settle at that place .

SIR : Having ever been impressed with a just sense of the honor con ferred upon me in my appointment to the place of Professor of Philoso phy in Ehode Island College , it becomes me , with much freedom and sin cerity , to acknowledge it . I have ever admired the liberal and catholic plan of this college , and esteemed it worthy of the State that gave it birth and patronage , which has induced me for many years assiduously and cheerfully to contribute towards establishing it on a footing , with respect to credit and finances , which might entitle it to more able teachers . That our young seminary had well-nigh attained this state of maturity , all circumstances conspired to afford us the most nattering prospect , before the commencement of the present war . Although experimental philosophy was the direct object of my pro fession , yet other branches of learning were devolved upon me .

For nearly two years Narragansett Bay and all the island towns , at least one fourth of the State , had been in possession of the en emy . External trade was almost entirely suspended , and the people were unable to procure any adequate supply of the necessaries of life . Nearly every able-bodied man was in service , either in the State militia or the Continen tal army , arid even the negroes and Indian slaves were enlisted as soldiers . The price of labor and of all articles of merchandise was fixed by legislative decree . The taxes /z/ imposed by the State were enormous ; amounting this year to 495,000 , and in the year following to four times this sum . Paper money , which had greatly depreciated in value , was made a legal tender in the payment of debts ; and so easily was it counterfeited , that not even the Sec retary of State could distinguish the genuine from the spurious . In addition to all this , the national cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low ebb , the ablest members having left it , and the prospect of independence and peace was overcast with shadows and doubts . It was in reference perhaps to this alarming state of the currency of the country , and in the hope of aiding by coun sel or otherwise his distressed-fellow townsmen , that Dr. Manning set out on a journey to Philadelphia , visiting on the way his relatives in New York and New Jersey . In company with his wife he left Providence on the 29th of April , returning on the 29th of September . He was thus absent just five months , having passed through the States of Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania . The following diary or journal was kept by him as they travelled from day to day .

He preached /z/ in meeting-houses of different denominations , in private dwellings , and even in stores and places of business , as the reader will observe . /z/ Set out from Providence Thursday , 29th of April , at six o clock P.

On June 4th a report prevailed in Woodbridge that the British army at Charleston were totally defeated , with the loss of fourteen hun dred killed and wounded , and seven hundred taken . Repeated reports somewhat similiar , though not making their loss so great , have been con stantly brought from the South ; but no official account confirming it has yet come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great frost in these parts . The crops incomparably fine , but some fields near the river struck with the red rust , though but little hurt . Rye harvest begun , and wheat will be here this week . tended with good effects , if we may judge from the little information respecting him here given . 1 Rev. William Van Horn . He was born in 1746 ; educated at Dr. Samuels Jones s Academy at Penuepek ; ordained as pastor over the Baptist church at Southampton , Pa. ; honored with the degree of Master of Arts from the Rhode Island College 1774 ; and during the Revolutionary war was an efficient and honored chaplain . He died in 1807 in the sixty-first year of his age . 3 Reports then must have quite equalled if not excelled the telegraphic news of the present day . The simple facts as recorded in history are as follows : The British in 1779 made a second invasion of South Carolina under General Prevost , and were eventually repulsed . On the llth of May , Prevost with nine hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south side of the river . During the forenoon Count Pulaski with his legion attacked the British advanced guard , and was repulsed with great slaughter . Prevost now advanced to the American lines , but in the night , after summoning the city to surrender , withdrew to James Island , fearing the approach of Gen. Lincoln with an army of four thousand men . On the 20th of June the British were attacked by about twelve hundred of Lincoln s men , and the assailants were repulsed .

Spent the time agreeably in viewing the form , its products , harvest , etc. , and in conversation .

Put up at Mr. William Goforth s , and my horse across the way , in Second Street , between Kace and Vine Streets . Visited Samuel Davis , but he was out of town ; also Mr. Rogers . Called at Mr. Watkins s , then at Mr. Westeot s 5 from thence to Dr. Rush s , 2 who treated me politely ; from thence called on Messrs . Shields three hundred killed , wounded , and missing on each side . Three days afterwrds the British evacuated the island . ( See Lossing s Field-Cook , etc. ) 1 Rev. Dr. Samuel Jones , one of Manning s intimate friends . He was three years his senior , having been born in the year 1735 . Of the church of Pennepek , afterwards called Lower Dublin , he was the honored and esteemed pastor up wards of fifty-one years . He was also an educator of youth , and in this latter capacity was greatly distinguished , being especially judicious and considerate to such young men under his care as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning , in 1791 , he was named by many of the Trustees and Fellows of the col lege as his successor in the presidency . ( See letters of Stillman and Howell at the close of our last chapter . ) He , it will be remembered , was one of the com mittee to remodel the college charter . Dr. Jones was one of the most useful members of the Philadelphia Association . " Here , " says Sprague in his Annals , " he is appointed to frame a system of dis cipline , and there to compile a book of hymns , and then to draw up a map rep resenting the various associations ; one year he holds the office of moderator , and the next writes the circular letter to the churches , and the next performs some other important public service ; indeed , it is impossible to look through the minutes without perceiving that he was always one of the master spirits of the body . Few men could manage more adroitly than he a difficult and in volved case ; and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would bring light out of the thickest darkness , and order out of the wildest con fusion . " In 1807 he preached the century sermon of the Association , which was published . He died Feb. 7 , 1814 , in the eightieth year of his age . Dr. Jones was a ready writer and a fluent speaker . In his person he is de scribed as a large and firmly built man , six feet or more in height , and every way well proportioned . His face was the very image of intelligence and good nature ; which , with the air of dignity that pervaded all his movements , ren dered his appearance uncommonly attractive . He possessed an ample fortune , which he used with signal grace and hospitality . /z/ and Moulders . Called at Mr. Hart s lodging , but he not within , which was also the case at Mr. Robert S. Jones s . The evening of July 2 , Mr. Joseph Hart , of the Executive Council , spent at my lodgings . Saturday , July 3 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ han dled pretty severely , under the signature of Leonidas. 1 Breakfasted at Dr. Rush s , and received two hundred dollars , Dr. Finley s draft on him . Spent the forenoon chiefly in writing to Providence , by Mr. Ellery , who sets off this afternoon . Went to the State House . Met Mr. Collins , and tiuguished for his learning and piety , as well as for his great professional skill . He was educated at the College of New Jersey , graduating in 1760 , two years before Manning . i The financial embarrassments of the country were exceedingly great at this period , in consequence of the rapid depreciation of the paper currency , of which Congress had emitted , on the 1st of September , 1799 , one hundred and sixty mil lions . A spirit of discontent , of speculation and of fraud was everywhere mani fest . The honest and patriotic were impoverished , while rogues and Tories grew rich . " As an illustration of the perils and difficulties of this crisis , we print the following handbill , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similar bills were posted in other cities . /z/ " The depreciation of our money , and the high price to which everything is got , is one and the same thing . We ask not who introduced the evil , how it arose , or who encouraged it . In the midst of money we are in poverty , and exposed to want in the land of plenty . You that have money , and you that have none , down with your prices , or down with yourselves ; for , by the ever-living and eternal God , we will bring every article down to what it was last Christmas , or we will down with those who oppose it . " We have turned out against the enemy , and we wish not to be eaten up by monopolizers and forestallers. /z/ " It gives me very sincere pleasure , " writes Washington to his friend Reed , now President of Pennsylvania , " that the Assembly is so well disposed to sec ond your endeavors in bringing those murderers of our cause , the monopolizers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much to be lamented that each State , long ere this , has not hunted them down as pests of society , and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America . I would to God that some one of the more atrocious in each State was hung in gibbets upon a gallows five times as high as the one prepared for Haman . No punishment , in my opinion , is too severe for the man who can build his greatness upon his country s ruin . " When Washington wrote in this way , what , says Hildreth , was to be expected of the inconsiderate multitude ? /z/ inquired , without much satisfaction , what was on foot in Congress rela tive to the money . Dined at Mr. Redwood s with Mr. Ellery , and re turned to my lodgings , where were Messrs . Shields and Conolly , who spent the afternoon with us . Lord s Day , July 4 . Preached twice with some freedom ; the morn ing congregation thin ; more in the afternoon . Both church and society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my tarrying a considerable time , which did not suit my affairs . In the evening visited one of the members of the church near her end . Appeared to be in a happy frame of mind . Attended a religious society composed of Baptists , Presbyteri ans , and Church people . They appeared very serious , and somewhat en gaged in religion . Found Gen. Spencer x at my lodgings , now a member of Congress . It being the Fourth of July , the anniversary of Independence , the chaplains of Congress preached suitable to the occasion , and Congress attended . High mass was celebrated and Te Deum sung at the Romish chapel . The gentlemen of the town were invited by billets from the French minister to attend . I suppose these causes rendered the Baptist meeting thinner than otherwise . The lowering of prices by the committee is considered by the town as a violent measure and only a temporary re lief , but think it will share the fate of former State bills . 2 The suburbs of this city greatly destroyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged . A fine rain on the night of the 4th of July . Some more apples in these parts than in the Jerseys , though but few . Monday , 5th . Brcak- 1 Joseph Spencer . He was born in Connecticut , in 1714 . He was a major in the colonial army in 1756 , and was one of the iirst eight brigadiers appointed by the Continental Congress in 1775 . He was appointed a major-general in 1776 , and in 1777 was in command of the American forces on Rhode Island . After his resignation he was elected a delegate to Congress from his native State . He died in East Haddam. in January , 1789 , aged seventy-five . 2 A short time after this ( Oct. 4 ) , a riot took place in Philadelphia in consequence of this attempt of : i committee to regulate the prices of flour , rum , sugar , molasses , coffee , salt , etc . Kobert Morris and other leading merchants refused to conform to the regulation . Wilson , Clymer , Mifflin , and their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defenders of the Tories . Soon afterwards ( Oct. 20 ) , a convention of the five Eastern States was held at Hartford , at which a plan was elaborated , which Congress adopted , regulating prices on the basis of twenty paper dollars for one of specie . Dr. Manning s visit to Philadel phia doubtless had reference to some measures of relief of this kind from the op pressive laws of Rhode Island and other States , passed by recommendation of Congress , which made paper money a legal tender . /z/ fasted at Mr. Shields s , where a committee from the church met and impor tuned me to tarry with them some time , or come again and make them a longer visit . I gave them hopes of the latter after the four Sabbaths of this month . Went to Mr. David Bowers , and thence to Mr. Moulders ; then to hear the oration at the Dutch church .

This morning Mr. Stelle called on us on his way to Philadelphia , and informed us that accounts are received of the burning of New Haven by the British , and that they are destroying all in their way in that quarter . 2 Preached to-day at the Baptist meeting . Tarried the 14th and 15th . Still much i On the 7th of May , 1778 , six or seven hundred British troops left Philadelphia for the purpose of destroying vessels which were lying in Barnes s and Crosswick s Creeks at Bordentown .

Ever since Sunday the wind fresh at the northeast , cloudy and very cold ; at its first rising a boat was upset in this ferry Sunday morning , and two young ladies were drowned . /z/ Thursday , Sept. 16 . Went down to West Point by water in Lieut . Hubbel s boat . The French Ambassador s secretaries in company . One of them spoke English ; a most accomplished gentleman , and the handsomest Frenchman I ever saw . The other was agreeable , as were their attend ant gentleman , but could not converse much in English . We had an agreeable passage , and were greatly entertained by the highlands through which we passed . Those huge , vast mountains , with their cloudy tops , approach near together as the river narrows . At about eleven o clock we reached Gen. Washington s quarters , a beautiful , level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those precipices . His Excellency , the Ambassador , with a number of the generals , were gone to reconnoitre the fort . There I met Dr. Cochrane , Surgeon General of the army , who seemed very glad to find me in camp . After examining a correct map of this fort , shown us by one of the General s aids , and taking a drink , we sailed over to the Point , which is fitted by nature to form an exceeding strong port . Up to the top of the Point is a great ascent , and there a plain on which stands Fort Arnold , at the last part of the Point . A very strong fortress , with excellent bomb-proofs , and bastions below to defend the great chain stretched across just after the river turns west . The op posite shore is also strongly fortified to defend the chain , from what is called the island , and all the heights also on the east side of the river , to prevent their landing and bombarding the fort . These works , viewed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by Gen. McDugal , who commands this fortress . Fort Putnam stands on a great em inence at half a mile distance west from this , and commands Fort Arnold . This is the strongest work ever raised in English America , and is utterly , from its situation , inaccessible but on the northern side , where all the force of art is exerted to strengthen it by walls without walls , the outer most of which is laid with lime and stone , with bomb-proofs , etc. , etc . This is also defended by all the commanding heights . The approach of an army by land is next to impossible from the west side of the river , as there are but few ways , and those almost impassable , and all strongly defended . The troops were encamped on both sides pf the river on the most conve nient grounds . I dined at Gen. Greene s quarters with his family , Mr. Olney , Col. Morris , Major Littlefield , and Col. Webb , as the General had not returned . Soon after , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little chat . Shortly afterward , his Excellency , the French Ambassador , and Baron Steuben , with their retinues , returned , to all of whom I was in troduced by Gen. Greene . The Ambassador is a good-looking , ruddy- /z/ complexioned man as I ever saw for a Frenchman . His family are extremely polite . 1 Having viewed the works , we returned up the river , had a good time , and arrived at New Windsor after sunset , and at Newborough in the evening . Friday , Sept. 17 . The morning was foggy , which prevented our set ting out early . Crossed the river with an easy time , and set out from the Continental Ferry between ten and eleven o clock . Passing Fishkill , took the D anbury road , stopped at a private house to oat , and then reached Col. Luddington s , twenty-two miles ; then reached Esquire Patterson s , four miles , at Fredericksburg . The road good fifteen miles , and then exceeding bad , over rocks and mountains .

The ruins of the town are affecting , marked with the traces of British inhumanity . 2 This town was considerbly large , and prettily situated between the mountains , with a good soil . Apples are plenty here . Some few were to be seen at the river , and a gradual increase . The Indian corn excellent on this side of the river , and the pastures good . Very difficult . to get good entertainment . At two o clock set out through Bethel , to which is a good road three miles . Then we ascend the shocking mountains which reach to Reading , five miles , Bitt s Tavern . This is a pretty village on a hill . From thence we reached North Fairfield , five miles , to Esquire Wakeman s , a private house . Had good entertainment . Sabbath morning , 19th .

He associated with the first men of his times , and on terms of equality . Few persons of his day could be called his superiors , save in the externals of worldly prosperity . 2 On the 26th of April , 1777 , about two thousand British troops , commanded by Gov . William Tyron , reached the village of Danbury between one and two o clock in the afternoon , for the purpose of destroying the military stores in that town . They left the next morning , after committing various excesses , burning the new meeting-house , nineteen dwellings , twenty-two stores and barns , and an immense amount of stores and provisions for the American army . 3 Rev.

She arrived in the evening ; is kindly treated by the family , who are plain , goodliving farmers . I took a walk to the southward of the road , and vieAved a most beautiful , level country , suited to wheat , and the inhabitants very good livers ; their buildings very good , and their crops excellent . Spent the evening at Esquire Brother s , a likely , agreeable man . Tuesday , Sept. 21 . Set out at nine o clock , through Stratford , five miles .

Twenty names at most are put in by each voter for general officers , out of which the twelve highest are chosen by the assembly for the spring choice . After gratifying my curiosity here , returned to Mr. Sherman s , dined , and set out for New Haven , ten miles , where we ar rived in the evening . The road bad most of the way .

M. , at the College Hall , to transact business of the highest importance to the institution , which will then come before them . It is not doubted but that every gentleman who has the welfare of the seminary at heart will attend if possible . STEPHEN HOPKINS , Chancellor . JAMES MANNING , President . /z/ PROVIDENCE , April 28 , 1780 . At the meeting of the corporation , held agreeably to the foregoing advertisement , there were present , of the Fellows , the President , Hon. Jabez Bowen , Dr. Thomas Eyres , and David Howell ; of the Trustees , Chancellor Hopkins , Henry Ward , Nicholas Brown , Joseph Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Brown , John Jenckes , and John Brown . The object of the meeting appears to have been the re vival of college instruction , with a view to the commence ment of the exercises , which , since Dec. 1776 , had been suspended . President Manning presented a proposal , stat ing on what terms he would instruct such youth as might apply to him for this purpose . The proposal received the approval of the corporation , and he was accordingly , in the language of the record , " ordered to begin . " In con consideration of the times , and the great scarcity of money , his salary , which had formerly been 100 , was fixed at 60 , or $300 . Few persons , like Manning , would have had the courage and perseverance to revive and carry on the instruction of the college , amid the uncertainties of the war , the general poverty and distress that filled the land , and the despondency and gloom into which the nation , at this period , was plunged . In this instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an enterprise /z/ which , eighteen years before , his friends at Philadelphia had intrusted to his hands . " President Manning , " says Backus , " now engaged again in the work of education . But further interruptions were in store for him . On the 25th of June , 1780 , while he was preaching at the church , it being Sunday , the col lege edifice was a second time seized , by the order of the council of war , for a hospital for the French troops , who held it until May 27th , 1782 . " The next meeting of the corporation was held on the 4th of September , 1782 , and was fully attended . Among the clergymen present from Massachusetts , we notice the familiar names of Backus , Stillman , and Smith . The following young gentlemen , who , amid all the embarrass ments of the college , had prosecuted and completed their course of studies tinder President Manning , were ex amined , and duly admitted to the degree of Bachelor in the Arts ; namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Jones , William McClellan , Samuel Snow , and Levi Wheaton . Of this number , Green and Snow had served with credit in the army . Wheaton , who died in 1851 , was made a trustee during the Presidency of Dr. Maxcy . In 1815 he was appointed Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine . He was distinguished , says one who knew him well , for his learning and skill as a physician , and for his taste and varied acquirements in literature . At this meeting of the corporation , says the chronicler , " the deplorable situation of the seminary was particu larly taken into consideration ; whereupon it was resolved that the edifice , which had been long occupied as a bar rack and a hospital by the American and French troops , should be directly repaired ; and ample provision was /z/ made for the immediate instruction of youth in all the branches of polite and useful literature . " It was also Resolved , " That Joseph Brown , Henry Ward , William Russell , and Ebenezer Thompson , Esq. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental Con gress , stating the account of the rents due and the dam ages done to the college edifice during its occupancy by the American forces and the troops of his most Christian Majesty ; that they report the same to the Chancellor and President ; and that on their approbation of it , they sign the said petition , in behalf of this Corporation , and forward it , together with the former petition , which was prepared some time since by the Hon. Jonathan Arnold , Esq . ; and the delegates in Congress for the State of Rhode Island are requested to use their influence to get the same granted . " The week following , the Warren Association convened for the first time in Providence . Fifteen years had now elapsed since its organization at Warren , and notwithstand ing the efforts of Manning and others , the parent church of the denomination had , during this period , withheld its cooperation as a body , and refused to join the Association . The opposition of many of its members to singing in pub lic worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hands , were the principal reasons , doubtless , why they did not , at an earlier day , cooperate with the neigh boring churches , in united efforts for the public good . From the minutes of this meeting we copy the following extracts , as an illustration of the efforts made by our fathers for the education of the youth of the " rising gen eration " : " As the instruction and morals of the rising generation are objects of very great importance , Voted , That a spelling-book , containing a good /z/ English grammar and the Baptist catechism , be published ; and Elder Foster is desired to prepare said book for the press , in conjunction with President Manning , Elders Backus , Stillman , and Skillman , to be pre sented at our next annual meeting for examination ; and in the interim , for the encouragement of this undertaking , it is recommended to the churches to raise by subscription what moneys they can , and send the same to the Association next year . " " The Association , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college in Providence , of the low state of the funds of said college , and the urgent necessity of increasing them in order to support suitable instructors therein , and from an idea of the great importance of good education , have taken into consideration , as the most probable method to accomplish this valuable end , the recommendation of a sub scription throughout all the Baptist societies on this continent , as well as to all the friends of literature of every denomination , on the following conditions : " We , the subscribers , promise and engage to pay the several sums af fixed to our names , to , to be by him paid to John Brown , Esq. , of Providence , treasurer of the corporation , or his successor in said office , or order ; to be placed at interest , and the interest only to be applied for the above purpose . N. B. The several churches arc desired to insert in the above blank the name of the most suitable person in the society for this service .

This will come to hand too late to announce to you the good news concerning the fate of five per cent . This was forwarded before I reached here ; but my letter may serve to congratulate you on the impor tant event . You will not think strange that I have been at home twelve days and have never attempted to write until now , when I inform you that eight days before I reached here I was seized with a severe fever , with which I travelled , though in great distress , near two hundred miles , and of which I have been ever since confined . Though it has in a measure left me , yet I am still very weak . /z/ On my arrival , I sent and delivered your letters and those of Dr. Ar nold , desiring Mrs. Ho well , by Jeremiah , to come and see me , as I could not go to her , which she would have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lands of Jeremiah Dexter , and those of his brother s heirs . The town is full of officers , and she is crowded with them as well as others . The family , however , are all well . I found my family well , and am told that the town is healthy in general . I am exceeding sorry that the committee appointed to prepare and forward the papers relative to the college , have not yet done this . Joseph Brown tells me he has done everything in his power , but Mr. Ward has still disappointed them , by one means or other . When it will be accomplished , I know not . The edifice has been cleaned , and is now undergoing repairs . It is tenable for students . A steward has moved in , Mr. Foster . A tutor is also en gaged , one Mr. Eobbins , of Wethersfield , who is daily expected . The number of students is very small as yet . I still retain the idea of travel ling and soliciting donations for the college ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall get to supply my place in the in terim , I know not yet . I am unable to attend even to my own business . The active executor of my father-in-law s estate , Dr. Dayton , could not collect any money for Dicky , son of Richard , who came with me , before I came away , but expected to get some before you return . I have desired him to have it in readiness by the middle of December , and left at my mamma s , and informed him that I expect you to bring it . I wish you to come that way and take it if there ; if not , please to call on the Doctor at town for it and bring it , and I will cheerfully make good any expense it may cause you . Dr. Randal is now here , and informs me that he has written Dr. Ar nold by this conveyance fully upon all matters relative to the family , etc . Mrs. Manning joins in cordial respects to you and the Doctor , with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. I expect Sister Woodruffe will be in your city before this reaches you . I should esteem it a particular favor if you and the Doctor would call to see her as you have opportunity . The following letter , addressed to his friend the Rev. Benjamin Wallin , of London , of whose death he had not /z/ been informed , presents at this time a striking view of the religious condition of the New England during the war : NEW JERSEY , May 23 , 1783. /z/ I feel happy that an intercourse is again opened between the two coun tries , after an eight years interruption by a most calamitous war , and that I can again address a letter to my much esteemed friend and father in the ministry , with hopes of its reaching hirn before his dismission from the field of labor . Three years ago the past winter , I received a letter from you , accompanied with a small box of books , a very agreeable pres ent , for which you have my most cordial thanks . It came safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your poetical composition directed to me , which were lost by the way . The rest were delivered as directed . Your view of the parable of the prodigal son is to me the most satisfac tory that I have met with . It has been perused by many here with great pleasure . I have never written to England since the opportunity in 1776 by Mackaness and Shakspear . By yours to me , as mentioned above , I find it was received , and am happy that the short sketch given of the revival at Providence , and of the country round , furnished an agreeable enter tainment for my English brethren and friends . But days of tribulation have succeeded those happy ones . The calamities of the war fell heavy upon us . First a dispersion of our church and congregation upon the coining of the King s army , which is in sight of my house . This was immediately followed by the evils attendant on a garrison , as we became a frontier . The dreadful effects of this upon the morals of the inhabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what of all things was the most distressing to me , was the lukewarmness of almost all professors of religion , and the total apostasy of many . The contagion became gen eral . The places of worship were almost abandoned . Alarm upon alarm destroyed all tranquillity , and every day and night threatened us with that desolating devastation which spread with such rapidity along our coasts . The college was quite broken up , and the edifice was occupied by a rude and wasting soldiery , first for barracks , and then for a hospital , until they threatened its almost total demolition . But language would fail to paint in proper colors the horrors of these days . About this time one John Murray , alias Murphy , supposed to be /z/ a fugitive from justice in Great Britain , with great address undertook to propagate the doctrine of universal salvation , as held by a Mr. Relly , in his book on Union , of which Murray was a mere retailer . In this work he was too successful in the towns and counties through New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the decline of the morals of the people , and to unsettle the minds of profes sors . Soon after this , two women , who pretended to a participation of Deity , set up new kinds of superstition . One of them pretended to be Jesus Christ in the form of a woman . In her preaching and praying she considered herself as the Mediator . The other pretended to pardon sins , and to be at the head of a new dispensation , of which the form of wor ship is dancing , turning round on one foot , pretending to speak in un known tongues , etc. , etc . She interdicted all intercourse between the sexes , so that separations between man and wife became common , among those who would attain to a state of absolute perfection . The fruits of this ex parte religion you will easily conjecture . She , with her attendants , came to America from Liverpool , or its vicinity , about the commence ment of the war . But what will astonish you most of all is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pernicious ways . Yet notwithstanding these discouraging circumstances , a glorious reform ation has progressed , during the past three or four years , in many parts of New England , and about two thousand persons have in consequence re ceived believer s baptism , and several Baptist churches have been consti tuted . The good effects of this work are yet visible . Several places have been visited during the past year , and in these the good work of grace still continues . Dear Mr. Thurston , of Newport , and his people , have had a blessed shower , between thirty and foity of their number having lately been baptized . The attendance on public worship with us at Providence has of late inspired me with hopes of better times . The college is again revived ; but our exhausted state will enable us to make only a partial repair of the edifice , and that by borrowing money . " We have been so happy as to preserve our little fund amidst the wreck of public credit , but the present exhausted state of the treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace will , we hope , remedy this inconvenience ere it be of long continuance . The pros pect of students grows more encouraging , though at present the number is small . I write this from New Jersey , whither I have come via New York , for /z/ the first time in seven years . Last Lord s Day I preached here , and ex pect to preach for two Sabbaths to come . The Baptist meeting-house is still occupied for a hospital , and greatly out of repair . The people seem much disposed to hear the word , although attendance at church has long been out of vogue among them . Rev. Messrs . Miller and Stelle , of the Scotch Plains and Piscataway churches , two eminent Baptist ministers , died nearly two years ago . Their people have not yet found Elishas to take their places . Political contentions have proved exceedingly mis chievous in many of our churches . A spirit of toleration , however , is vastly more prevalent among the Pedobaptists since the war . To this out friend Mr. Backus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . I fear I shall not have time to write by this opportunity to any of my English brethren except yourself . Please to present my best respects to all inquiring friends ; for I will presume that I have some who will inquire for me . Let me be favored with a letter by the first opportunity . With sentiments of the highest respect , I am , etc. , /z/ In 1783 the public exercises of Commencement were re sumed , on which occasion the Rev. Dr. Stillman preached an animating sermon from Luke xv . 32 : " It was meet that we should make merry and be glad ; for this thy brother was dead and is alive again , and was lost and is found . " An account of this Commencement , and of the proceedings of the subsequent meeting of the corporation , may best be learned from a letter to Mr. Howell . It will be observed that Manning again alludes to his purpose to proceed to England to solicit funds for the college . In reference to this matter we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporation held on the 27th of January , 1783 : - " President Manning laid before them a memorial setting forth the smallness of the college funds , and the necessity of augmenting them to preserve the institution from dissolution , and offered his services to travel abroad to solicit donations for augmenting them as per memorial on file ; which being duly considered by the members present , it was agreed to /z/ recommend to the President to proceed to solicit donations , as soon as a proper person can be found to superintend the college in his absence ; and that the secretary make out for him proper credentials , sealed with the college seal and signed by the secretary . " The following is the " memorial , " to which reference is here made : To the Honorable the Chancellor and the Members of the College in Providence , convened by special request on Wednesday , the 25th of December , 1782 : GENTLEMEN : The present low state of the funds of the college , and the consequent embarrassment of this corporation in conducting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notoriety to need eluci dation . Any plan , therefore , which renders an augmentation of them probable , I presume must meet your warmest approbation . The only one which I can conceive can at present be adopted is , to appoint some person , whom you shall judge qualified , to solicit benefactions of whom and wheresoever he shall think proper , for the sole purpose of endow ing the college or making suitable provision for tuition therein , withal assuring the donors that the corporation have pledged their faith that the interest only of the net proceeds of the money so collected shall be appropriated , and that the principal shall be reserved as a perpetual fund . Looking around amongst the friends of the college , I can find no one who will undertake this arduous service unless I do it myself ; and though , at my time of life , encumbered as I am with the cares of a family , the congrega tion , and the college , together with the mortifications which must unavoida bly attend the execution , I find it exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment to the interests of the college has induced me , for the want of a more suitable person , in the face of every difficulty to offer my services , on the following conditions : That the corporation shall , while on this service , discharge me from all duty in the college ; that they furnish me with a proper authorization , and , out of the mon eys I shall collect , pay me the sum of one hundred pounds lawful money per annum , besides defraying all my necessary expenses ; that they allow me the use of the college estate J as when at home , and leave it to 1 The house occupied by President Manning , and by his successors Maxcy and Messer , and for a while by Way land , was built at the time of the erection of /z/ my judgment in what places and how long to pursue this object . And should any difficulty arise concerning taking the moneys out of the gov ernments where collected , it shall be left to my judgment how to dispose of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above propositions be acceded to , as soon as I can adjust my private concerns I engage , by divine permission , to begin and faith fully pursue the business as long as there is , in my opinion , a prospect of success . If it should be said that the state of war in which we are in volved , the desolations of many parts of the country , the weight of taxes , scarcity of money , and drought of the last summer , all militate against this proposal , I freely grant the great force of all these arguments ; but in my opinion matters are come to a point , and the question is not whether there have not been and may probably hereafter be more favor able times to collect money , but whether the college can be continued with any degree of reputation without some speedy exertions . I confess I think it can not , and therefore necessity impels this measure . Besides , the Baptist Associations , held the last fall in this town and in the city of Philadelphia , lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue ; but withal concluded that the only method to succeed would be for me to follow them by a personal application . And I con ceive the only time to obtain their money is when the people are willing to part with it , whatever difficulty they may find in obtaining it . These proposals , however , are cheerfully submitted to your better judgment , by , gentlemen , Your humble servant , /z/ This plan of President Manning , which was never car ried into effect , owing doubtless to the difficulty in finding a suitable person to take his place in the college and in the church , is another of the many proofs of his ardent desire to promote the interests of " religion and sound learning , " and of his willingness to make sacrifices in be half of the institution over which he presided . But to the letter : University Hall . It stood where now is the old college pump , directly in front of Harming Hall . /z/ PROVIDENCE , Sept. 13 , 1783 . To THE HONORABLE DAVID HOWELL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 17th ult. ; by some means it has had a long passage . Am much obliged for the intelli gence you communicate . I with you hope our happy Constitution may be preserved entire , and that place-men and pensioners may figure small under it , whatever raised hopes may have been entertained by candidates . I wish to know the event of the examination you mentioned , which was so full of expectation on the part of the examined . I am glad to hear that you are so happy in your colleague . I shall not be wanting in seconding your wishes with respect to your son . He does not make a rapid progress in language , but does much better than heretofore . He performed very well the last public speaking . Our public Commencement met the highest approbation of a most nu merous assembly , amongst whom were the high Consul of France , the Count dal Verme of Milan , and several English and Dutch merchants , who were very liberal in their encomiums on the performers and perform ances . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , to equal if not exceed any we have ever had . And I am happy to inform you that it seems to have inspired its friends with new life . Mr. John Brown requested the corporation to ascertain the sum necessary to procure a complete philosophical apparatus and libmry , and offered to advance , forthwith , one half the sum , provided the corporation would advance , or find ways and means to advance , the other half . It was found impracticable to ascertain this exactly . He then offered to equal any sum they could raise . A subscription was immediately set on foot , and pur sued by Mr. Smith in the town the succeeding days , which amounted to better than 340 ; and will , with Mr. John Brown s , equal , if not exceed , 700 lawful money . A catalogue of the library and apparatus is ordered to be made out immediately . If you can assist us , by procuring from your friends any large catalogues of books , or can yourself furnish one both of the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sistance , as soon as possible . Governor Hopkins , Joseph Brown , Doc tors Waterhouse and Drowne , Mr. Stillman and myself are appointed to this service ; and we mean to have them prepared as soon as practicable . Messrs . Stillman and Waterhouse , with the President , are appointed to draft an address and petition to the King of France for his patronage of the college , and a donation similar to that offered to Yale College , and /z/ forward it to you to use your influence with the Minister of France to get his sanction of it , and to point out the proper way of access to his most Christian Majesty , as soon as may be . And while it is preparing I am to request you to feel the pulse of the Minister relative to it , and advise us accordingly . - This matter is ordered to be kept a secret , and by the cor poration , lest we should be interrupted . President Wheelock , on this business for Dartmouth College , writes that he is likely to succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. William Van Horn should solicit benefactions to the southward of Pennsylvania , the President in the Middle States , Kev . Benjamin Foster through New England , and Rev. William Rogers go on the business to Europe . Mr. Foster I have since seen . Ho informs mo that he can not accept his appointment . Mr. Rog ers has also intimated as much to me , in consequence of the ill state of his wife s health , and I am again in the question for this service . The great objection to this is , to have the college provided for in the interim . All agree , if you should return at the beginning of winter , and will un dertake , that the objection will be removed ; and I wish a line from you on this subject as soon as possible , as it is thought necessary to proceed to Europe this fall .. In short , we arc.detcrmined to make every possible ex ertion to make the college respectable if possible . Dr. Drowne is chosen Fellow in the room of Dr. Babcock ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen in the room of Governor Cook . 1 Dr. Benjamin Waterhousc was chosen a Fellow of the college in 1782 . This gentleman , says Prof. Goddard , whose brief sketch of him we in the main quote , distinguished in the medical history of our country as " the American Jenner , " was born in Newport , 11 . I. His father , originally a Presbyterian , embraced the religious opinions of the Society of Friends , after he had reached mature life ; and to those opinions he remained sincerely attached till his death , at an ad vanced age . His sou , to borrow his own language , " was born and educated in the principles of liberal Quakerism . " He never , however , adopted the pecu liarities of that quiet and useful sect , nor was he accustomed to unite with them in their religious worship .

Asher Robbins , quoted by Prof. Goddard , as an illustration of the dignity and grace with which Dr. Manning was years . This was among the earliest medical schools established in America . In 1784 Dr. Waterhouse was elected Professor of Natural History in Rhode Island College , and while occupying this chair be delivered , in the State House in Providence , the first course of lectures upon that science ever delivered in the United States . The benevolent and intrepid agency of Dr. Waterhouse in intro ducing vaccination into this country , is too well known to the public to need more than a passing allusion . He died at an advanced age , in the year 1846. /z/ accustomed to preside at the annual Commencements . " I recollect , " he says , " that at one of our Commencements , a French gentleman of distinction ( I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by Dr. Waterhouse , and was , I think , introduced and presented by him . They conversed together in Latin , either as , being learned men , they chose to converse in a learned language , or as the Frenchman being less perfect in English and the Doctor in French , they found it more easy to converse in Latin . Struck with the natural dignity and grace , the Frenchman whispered to the Doctor , Natalia prcesidere ( born to pre side ) . I heard this from Dr. Waterhouse himself the next day . " In looking over the records , we find that at a special meeting of the corporation , held on the 7th of January , 1784 , the address to which Manning in his letter to Howell refers , " drawn up by the Rev. Samuel Stillman and Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse , was read and approved . " It was also at this meeting voted , " That the Chancel lor , the President , Hon. Jabez Bowen , and Dr. Solomon Drowne , be a committee to draft a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Christian Majesty . " The following is the address , which we copy from an original document now on file among the archives of the University . The penmanship of the document , it may be added , is remarkably clear and handsome , and the signa tures to it are genuine . Some slight verbal alterations rendered it necessary to prepare another , and hence this is retained . A first draft , also , in the handwriting apparently of Dr. Stillman , is on file . SIRE : The Rhode Island College , studious of promoting literature , and of disseminating that kind of knowledge which tendeth to impress /z/ the minds of youth under their direction with such sentiments of benevo lence as are circumscribed in no less bounds than the whole bulk of man kind , look up to your Majesty , not only as a friend and promoter of such knowledge , but also , like many of your illustrious ancestors , a patron of those arts which polish humanity and exalt our natures . With these sentiments we regard the monarch of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having a professor of the French language and history in this our infant seminary , a thing we ardently desire , but are unable to accomplish . Ignorant of the French language , and separated as we were by more than mere distance of countries , we too readily imbibed the prejudices of the English , prejudices which we have renounced since we have had a nearer view of the brave army of France , who actually inhabited this col lege edifice ; since which time our youth seek with avidity whatever can give them information respecting the character , genius , and influence of a people they have such reason to admire , a nation so eminently distinguished for polished humanity . To satisfy this laudable thirst of knowledge , nothing was wanting but to encourage and diffuse the French language ; and that not merely as the principal means of rendering an intercourse with our brethren of France more easy and beneficial , but also for spreading far and wide the history of the so celebrated race of kings , statesmen , philosophers , poets , and benefactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be held by us in so lasting and so dear a remembrance , so there is no name we are more desirous of repeating as the founder of the French language and history in this country than your Majesty s , and that too as much from gratitude to your Majesty as profit to ourselves . From the scarcity of French books , our youth can at present only draw their information from English writers , and not from the more pure source , the French themselves . Our wish has therefore been to procure a proper collection of the best French authors , and to establish a profes sorship of the French language and history in the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ; but such have been the obstructions to learn ing during the war , and the course of education so impeded , that the edifice erected for the reception of the studious youth was granted by the governors of the college as a hospital for the troops . These , together with the calamities of the country , render it impossible for us to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , your Majesty as a monarch endowed with quali- /z/ tics that add lustre to a crown , ever ready to patronize what is good and useful , we presume to solicit your Majesty s assistance ; firmly believing that whatever tends to make men wiser , better , and happier will meet with your royal assistance and encouragement . May the common Father of the universe bless our endeavors , and make your Majesty the happy instrument of raising to us the literary genius of France in ages past as from the dead . May sacred and unerring wisdom ever be your guide , adorn you with every virtue , and crown you with every blessing , that future ages may commemorate the happiness of your reign with grateful admiration . Signed by order and in behalf of the corporation , STEPHEN HOPKINS , Chancellor . JAMES MANNING , President . PROVIDENCE , STATE OP RHODE ISLAND , Jan. 9 , 1784 . This address was eventually put into the hands of Thomas Jefferson by the Rhode Island Delegates to Con gress , the matter having been intrusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give the re sult of the application , by publishing the following letter , which we find in the second volume of Jefferson s Works . PARIS , July 22 , 1787 . To THE DELEGATES OF RHODE ISLAND : GENTLEMEN : I was honored in the month of January last with a letter from the honorable the delegates of Rhode Island in Congress , en closing a letter from the corporation of Rhode Island College to his most Christian Majesty , and some other papers . I was then in the hurry of preparation for a journey into the south of France , and therefore unable at that moment to make the inquiries which the object of the letter ren dered necessary . As soon as I returned , which was in the last month , I turned my attention to that object , which was the establishment of a pro fessorship of the French language in the college , and the obtaining a col lection of the best French authors , with the aid of the King . That neither the college nor myself might be compromitted uselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who were able to inform me what would be the success of the application . I was assured , so as to leave no doubt , that it would not be complied with ; that there had never been an instance /z/ of the King s granting such a demand in a foreign country , and that they would be cautious of setting the precedent ; that , in this moment , too , they were embarrassed with the difficult operation of putting down all es tablishments of their own which could possibly be dispensed with , in order to bring their expenditures down to the level of their receipts . Upon such information I was satisfied that it was most prudent not to deliver the letter , and spare to both parties the disagreeableness of giving and re ceiving a denial . The King did give to two colleges in America copies of the works printing in the public press . But were this to be obtained for the College of Khode Island , it would extend only to a volume or two of Buffon s work still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two other works in the press which are of no consequence . I did not think this an object for the college worth being pressed . I bog the favor of you , gentlemen , to assure the corporation that no endeavors of mine should have been spared could they have effected their wish , and that they have been faithfully used in making the preliminary inquiries which are necessary , and which ended in an assurance that nothing could be done . These papers having been transmitted to me through your dele gation , will , I hope , be an apology for my availing myself of the same channel for communicating the result . I have the honor to be , with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect , gentlemen , Your most obedient and most humble servant , /z/ The most important business transacted at the annual meeting of the corporation in 1783 , was the confirming and ratifying of a new digest of the college laws , which had been carefully made by President Manning . A few extracts from this digest may serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , as also the spirit of the times : 1 . No student shall be admitted into this college until he shall have written out a correct copy of the laws of the college , or have otherwise obtained them , and had them signed by the President and one or more of the tutors , as the evidence of his admission ; which copy he shall keep by him during his residence in college . /z/ 2 . Both before and after noon , and before nine o cloek in the evening , the tutors in their turn shall duly visit the rooms of the students to observe whether they be within and pursuing their studies ; and shall punish all those who are absent without liberty or necessity . 3 . The President and tutors , according to their judgments , shall teach and instruct the several classes in the learned languages , and in the lib eral arts and sciences , together with the vernacular tongue . The following are the classes appointed for the first year , namely : In Latin , Virgil , Cicero s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Greek , the New Testament , Lucian s Dialogues , and Xenophon s Cyropeedia . For the second year , in Latin , Cicero dc Oratorc , and Caesar s Commentaries ; in Greek , Homer s Iliad , and Longinus on the Sublime , together with Lowth s Vernacular Grammar , Rhetoric , Ward s Oratory , Sheridan s Lectures on Elocution , Guthrie s Geography , Kaimes s El ements of Criticism , Watts and Duncan s Logic . For the third year , Hutchinson s Moral Philosophy , Doddridge s Lectures , Fenning s Arith metic , Hammond s Algebra , Stone s Euclid , Martin s Trigonometry , Love s Surveying , Wilson s Navigation , Martin s Philosophia Britannica , and Ferguson s Astronomy , with Martin on the Globes . In the last year , Locke on the Understanding , Kennedy s Chronology , and Bolingbroke on History ; and the Languages , Arts , and Sciences studied in the fore going years to be accurately reviewed . 4 . Two of the students , in rotation , shall , every evening , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the members of the college shall meet every Wednesday afternoon in the hall , at the ringing of the bell at two o clock , to pronounce before the President and tutors pieces well committed to memory , that they may receive such corrections in their manner as shall be judged necessary . 1 i In reference to this custom , which was continued down to a very late period , with some modifications , the Hon. Tristam Burges , in his Address before the Federal Adelphi , thus speaks : " You all remember the elevated advanced stage where the speaker took his stand , when , under the supervision of the whole au thority , surrounded by the entire collegiate assembly , awed by the continued and pervading spirit of the hour and the occasion , he gave utterance to his own , so soon as the last echo of the voice of devotion had ceased to whisper in the ear of the listening audience . It was not to all the assembled Greeks , it was not at the Olympic Games that he spoke ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning or Maxcy , has never since that time , with more anx iety prepared himself for any other , or gone through it with more fear and trembling . " /z/ 5 . It is not permitted any one , in the hours of study , to speak to another , except in Latin , either in the college or college yard . 6 . The Senior Class , when required , shall read a chapter out of the Greek Testament into English , before morning prayers ; the President or tutors calling on whom they think proper of the class to perform this duty . 7 . Every student shall attend public worship every first day of the week , where he , his parents , or his guardians shall think proper , provided that any who do not attend with any officer of instruction produce vouchers , when demanded , of his steady and orderly attendance . N. B. Such as regularly and statedly observe the seventh day as a Sabbath , are exempted from this law , and are only required to abstain from secular employments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter of this college , which enacts that Chris tians of every denomination shall , without the least molestation in the peculiarities of their religious principles , enjoy free liberty , etc. , it is ordered , that if any student of this college shall deny the being of a God , the existence of virtue and vice , or that the books of the Old and New Testaments are of divine authority , or suggest any scruples of this nature , or circulate books of such pernicious tendency , or frequent the company of those who are known to favor such fatal errors , or harass and disquiet the minds of his fellow-students respecting any of the pecu liarities of their Christian faith , by ridicule , sneers , scoffing , infidel sug gestions , or in any other way , and shall continue obstinate therein after the first and second admonition , he shall be expelled from the college . Young gentlemen of the Hebrew nation are to be exempt from this law , so far as it relates to the New Testament and its authenticity . 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , is permitted to wear his hat within the college Avails ; nor when speaking to , or spoken to by , or is in company with an officer of instruction , unless he be permitted by them to put it on . 10 . The times of vacation shall be from September 6 to October 20 , from December 24 to January 24 , and from the first Monday in May three weeks . 1 1 . And whereas the statutes are few and general , there must necessarily be lodged with the President and tutors a discretional or parental author ity ; therefore , where no statute is particulary and expressly provided for a case that may occur , they are to exercise this discretionary authority according to the known customs of similar institutions , and the plain gen- /z/ cral rules of the moral law . And in general the penalties are to be of the more humane kind , such as are at once expressive of compassion for the offender and of indignation at the offence , such as are adapted to work upon the nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs of good order and submission to government . As a distinguished writer well remarks , the character of institutions , and alike of nations , is best known from their laws . We should be glad , therefore , did space allow , to present further extracts from this interesting digest . In the last paragraph , as above quoted , President Manning may be supposed to have embodied his ideas in respect to college government and discipline , which , says his pu pil and successor , Dr. Maxcy , " was mild and peaceful ; conducted by that persuasive authority , which secures obedience while it conciliates esteem . " The old stock , so to speak , of students , having now be come exhausted , there were no more public Commence ments until the year 1786 , at which time the Freshman Class of 1782 were prepared to graduate . The progress of events during this period can best be learned from Man ning s correspondence , which we present in chronological order . From the following letter to Mr. Kane , it appears that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had made a bequest to the college . How large this bequest was we can not readily determine , as no men tion of it is to be found in the records of the corporation . /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 8 , 1783 . SIR : I sympathize with you in the loss of your late venerable and pious pastor , the Rev. Mr. Wallin . I hope the church may find some Elisha to take his mantle , who , under the great Head of the church , may build you up . I am pleased to find that in his last will and testament he /z/ remembered the college . Mr. Mullett showed me the letter from you to him on the subject of discharging or receipting the papers . Mr. John Brown , our treasurer , who is empowered by the Trustees and Fel lows to conduct all the money-matters of the corporation , has settled with Mr. Mullett , as you will see by his receipt , attested by the Chancellor and President . You may rely upon receiving his receipt at an early day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is again lifting up its head . The damages it has sustained , and the low state of its funds , call aloud for the assistance of its friends who are able to establish it . It has not yet received a name , for want of some distinguished benefactor . Such a person we should be glad to find amongst our friends in England unto whom God in his providence has given wealth and influence . We arc making an effort to do something here in America , but the burdens of the war leave us but a gloomy prospect . The corporation have subscribed near seven hundred pounds lawful money , six shillings to a dollar , towards augmenting our little library and furnishing an apparatus , besides advanc ing near one half of this sum out of their own pockets for the repairs of the edifice . Every testimony of regard for it will be most thankfully re ceived and acknowledged by the corporation , and especially by him who has the honor to be , sir , Your humble servant , /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of receiving a line from you , but I congratulate you on the return of peace and the opening again of a communication between England and America . I shall not at present trouble you with my reasoning on this surprising revolution , but shall only say that I am convinced that it is of God . To recount the distress ing trials through which we have passed during the war , would but open again the wounds and cause them to bleed afresh . I suppose Mr. Ryland has no less affection for his American brethren than hithcrtofore , and therefore take the liberty of addressing a line to him with the same free dom as before . The state of religion throughout America has been on the decline for several vears , and the most destructive errors have prevailed , excepting /z/ a revival three or four years since in New England , and some favorable appearances of late . I should have exceptcd , however , the frontier parts of the country , for the wilderness has blossomed like the rose , and the Baptist principles have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly six years , and the edifice devoted to the uses of the army . It is again revived , and twelve students now belong to it . More are ex pected . The edifice received great damage , but has been partially re paired , at the private expense of the corporation , who have also subscribed near 700 lawful money to augment our little library and procure an apparatus . The catalogues are making out , and when ready will be for warded to England to give our friends , with you , an opportunity of testi fying afresh their attachment . We are making application also through this continent to get what endowments we can for the college , but our exhausted state promises little favorable . The college has the reputation of contributing not a little to the interests of religion , not to say civil lib erty . This has interested the Baptist society in general to look with a more favorable eye upon literature . But the burden of taxes , with their losses through the war , furnish them with arguments to withhold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you find no gentleman of fortune among you who wishes to rear a lasting monument to his honor in America ? If you can , direct his attention to the Hill of Providence , in the State of Rhode Island , whereon an elegant edifice is already erected , which waits for a name from some distinguished benefactor . The corporation are determined to do this honor to its great est benefactor . Should some English gentleman deign to become such , it may serve to cement that union which I wish ever to see cultivated be tween the two countries , notwithstanding our independence . I promise myself your interest in finding such an one , if in your power . I must refer you to a letter to Dr. Stcnnett of this date for a more particular account of the state of affairs amongst us , as I have not time now to be particular . I should be happy to receive one of your old-fashioned long letters by the return of this vessel or the first which may come . It is prob able there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the trade from Providence is again opened directly to London . I should have written in the spring , but was absent when the vessel sailed . Our dear friend Mr. Wallin is released from the field of labor , as I learn by my letter from Dr. Stcnnett , who has done me the honor to begin a correspondence , and requested me to continue it . With this request I shall with pleasure comply . Please to present my Christian salutation to /z/ your Avorthy family , especially to your son , Mr. John Ryland , Jr. , from whom a letter would be most acceptable to him who wishes you the high est felicity , and is with every sentiment of esteem , dear sir , Your unworthy brother and servant in the gospel , /z/ The Rev. Dr. Stennett , to whom Manning here refers , thus writes under date of May 14 , 1783 : /z/ It is a long time since I had the pleasure of hearing from you . Among other evils that have been suffered from the late unhappy and unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been laid upon epistolary correspondence is no inconsiderable one . But this evil is now removed , and you will give me leave to congratulate you on the event . We won t at present enter into the various political reason ings concerning this extraordinary revolution . God is no doubt bringing about his great purposes , and it is to be hoped that even during the late perilous times the temple of the Lord has been building with you as well as with us . This letter my friend Mr. Mullctt , 1 brother-in-law to Mr. Caleb Evans of Bristol , puts into your hands . He is a very worthy , sociable man , goes over upon very considerable affairs of a mercantile kind , and will be capable of giving you a variety of information . My brevity now , there- 1 Thomas Mullett , Esq. , a merchant of the first respectability . He was a na tive of Taunton , England , and died at Clapham , Nov. 14 , 1814 , in the sixtyninth year of his age . He possessed , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm friend to civil and religious liberty . The following anecdote is related of him in Evans s Life of Richards : " Thomas Mullett , Esq. , was soon after the American war at Mount Vernon , the seat of General Washington . Besides other flattering marks of attention , Washington , when alone with him in his library , asked him if he had seen any individual in that country who was competent to the task of writing a history of the late unhappy contest . Mr. M. replied , with his usual presence of mind , I know of one , and one only , competent to the task . The General eagerly asked , Who , sir , can that individual be ? Mr. M. remarked , Caesar wrote his own commentaries ! The General bowed , and replied , Cresar wrote his own commentaries ; but , sir , I know the atrocities committed on both sides have been so great and many that they can not be faithfully recorded , and had better be buried in oblivion .

Be so good as to remember me affectionately to all our Christian friends , the ministers in particular , Mr. Backus , etc. , etc . We have had many changes in our congregation by death ; but I hope religion in our denomination is not on the decline . Of good Mr. Wallin s death you have no doubt heard . His place is not yet supplied . My health has of late been but indifferent , but through the goodness of God it is now better . I am just publishing a volume of discourses on domestic duties , one of which either Mr. Mullett , or Mr. Stillman who , I take it , is still at Boston will put into your hands . You will excuse my hurrying manner at present , and be assured that I am , very dear sir , Your affectionate friend and brother , /z/ Manning s reply is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with special care . It is of itself a his tory of the times during the American war : PROVIDENCE , Nov. - 8th , 1783. /z/ Yours of May 14th was lately handed me by Thomas Mullett , Esq. , whom I find to justify , and more , the excellent character you gave him ; though we have had but a small share of his agreeable company , owing to his attention to his widely-extended mercantile concerns . I most heartily rejoice to have a free communication again opened between Eng land and America ; for this I have earnestly wished ever since its first interruption . May heaven forbid its ever being again shut ! But I feel peculiarly happy in the honor you have done me in the renewal of our correspondence . I congratulate you on the restoration of your health , and hope you may be long continued , a rich blessing to the church of God . The flourishing state of our society with you is pleasing . During some of the first years of the war , God was pleased to display his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorious manner , and thousands embraced the Baptist principles ; but those halcyon days soon /z/ ended , since which has ensued an amazing apostasy . The delusion of Rellcy , 1 in his book called the Union , etc. , has been propagated with the most astonishing success by John Murray . This doctrine of universal salvation has been licked into various forms by its numerous zealous ad vocates ; and as it so exactly coincides with the carnal mind , has been sucked in by multitudes , among whom are not a few professors of religion , with great avidity . About the same time one Jemima Wilkinson , 2 near this place , who had been educated amongst the Quakers , pretended that she had been dead , reanimated with a celestial spirit , and endowed with an extraordinary , commission from heaven to preach the gospel . She sometimes called herself the Comforter ; and sometimes , when in an audience of great num bers , pointing to herself , said that when Jesus Christ first appeared , he came in the flesh of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman . She has continued to traverse the country and publicly preach ever since , accompanied with a number of disciples who do her homage on their bended knees . Many have been carried away with her delusion , and believe her to be the Saviour . But to close the rear , a number of people , who came from the west of England about the commencement of the war , under the direction of an old woman whom her adherents call the Mother , the Elect Lady , etc. , etc. , pretend that the new dispensation has taken place , and that they are the only and true church . They pretend to absolve the sins of their disciples , and of course require particular con fession to be made to them . Their particular worship consists in dancing , turning round on the heel , jumping , singing , and embracing each other , while they pretend to talk in unknown tongues , work miracles , etc. , etc . They interdict all intercourse between the sexes , declaring the marriage contract void , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits , however , have inadvertently resulted from their chaste em braces . And would you believe it 1 vast numbers of those who once 1 " Doctrine of union between Christ and bis Church . By James Relley. " 8vo .

She exacted from her adherents the most complete submis sion and the most menial services . After her death , which took place in July , 1819 , the colony was broken up . A narrative of her life and character , by David Hudson , was published at Geneva , N. Y. , in 1821 , making a duodecimo volume of two hundred and twenty-eight pages . /z/ appeared serious , well disposed-persons , have followed their pernicious ways . They are not to be reasoned with ; alleging that they know they are right , and they will rave like madmen when opposed , ealling this the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand attack the truth of the gospel , growing infidelity on the other lends all its aid totally to subvert and destroy it , whilst the professed friends of it seem too generally overwhelmed and in a deep sleep . This , you say , is a dismal picture , but not more so than true . Yet there are those who stand fast in the truth , and some late revivals encourage us to hope for better days . One thing , however , is favorable , a spirit of toleration more universally prevails throughout New England , and the doctrines of religious as well as civil liberty are better understood by the people at large , against any infractions of which they are determined to guard . It was a glorious time of revival in our church when the war first commenced , but when the town became a garrison , on account of the vi cinity of the royal army on Rhode Island , the apprehensions of an attack , and the daily alarms to which we were subjected , induced numbers of fam ilies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for safety bat subsistence . This scattered our church and congregation abroad , which has never been collected since , near fifty of our members not having yet returned . These things , with the disinclination of many to attend public worship from the example of the army , have greatly reduced us . It has been a season of heavy trials with great numbers of our churches , several of which have been almost totally dispersed . After all , when I view the last eight years , and reflect on the amazing anxiety and distress through which we have waded , and the astonishing goodness of God in preserving so many of us to see the return of peace , I am lost in wonder ; especially when I consider the ingratitude of our hearts towards our glorious Bene factor . Thousands and thousands of families , once living in affluence , have , by the war , been reduced to beggary . Sometimes famine , and several times pestilence , as well as the sword , threatened to combine for our destruction . But language fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know by experience what it is to live in the midst of war . In the fore part of December , 1776 , the royal army landed on Khode Island , and took possession of the same . This brought their camp in plain view from the college with the naked eye ; upon which the country flew to arms and marched for Providence . There , unprovided with bar racks , they marched into the college and dispersed the students , about /z/ forty in number . After this the college continued to be occupied for a barrack and a hospital alternately until June , 1782 , when it was left in a most ruinous situation . The corporation advanced out of their own pockets near one thousand dollars for the most necessary repairs , and or dered the course of education to recommence ; but under these circumstan ces the number of students was small , as the former number had mostly completed their education at other colleges , or turned their attention to other objects . Last September , five young gentlemen , who had studied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college at a public Commencement . Their performances met such a universal approbation of a numerous audience , as inspired the corporation with fresh zeal to promote the institution . Mr. John Brown , the treasurer of the college , offered to give a sum equal to what all the other members would sub scribe , towards procuring an addition to our little library , and a philosoph ical apparatus . By this means we obtained subscriptions for near 700 lawful money , six shillings to the dollar , and the catalogues are being made out . This we propose to follow with an application to Europe , as well as throughout America , for further benefactions . We have nomina ted persons to this service , but we fear few if any of them will engage in the work , on account of the difficulty of leaving home , and the fears of not meeting a cordial reception in Great Britain . But I rejoice to find , from late accounts , that our friends remain friends to the college , and wish to know the state of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give , all of which we greatly need . I have the satisfaction to find that it has , under all its disadvantages , been instrumental in greatly promoting Baptist principles , and the spread of civil and religious liberty throughout New England . Our number of students is twelve , and more arc expected soon ; but the great objections Avhich operate against us are the want of an apparatus and library , and the want of professors . Of these advantages the old colleges amongst us can boast . Our library consists of about five hundred volumes , most of which are both very an cient and very useless , as well as very ragged and unsightly . 1 Our prospects to remedy this , in America , arc at present very unpromising .

The society at large never before appeared so disposed to assist if it were but in their power ; but , generally speaking , the Baptists here are the poor of this world . Several pious youth , who promise fair for the ministry , having picked up some grammar learning , have applied to me to know whether any way can open for their assistance in getting an education . This has led me to think of a plan to assist such , and I have sketched out the following : That the llev . Messrs . Samuel Stillman , Gardner Thurston , Isaac Backus , John Gano , Hezekiah Smith , with the President , be a standing commit tee of the corporation , and in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be filled up from time to time by themselves , who , or the major part of them , shall examine and approve of such as shall be candidates to receive the assistance which may be proffered to worthy characters in that way , and to say in what proportions it shall be dealt out to them . It will be easy to procure a vote of the corporation to invest this committee with all necessary powers to discharge this trust ; and I have fixed upon men whose doctrinal and practical principles , as well as their character in this country , will entitle them to the highest confidence of benefactors to this fund . I was long since convinced that a plan of this kind would be vastly serviceable , and proposed it to some of my friends , whose only objection against it was its interference with endowing the college , which was an object of the greatest importance ; but I am of opinion that many would be induced to give for this purpose who would not on any other consid eration . Should a donation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , in this way I have suggested , by some gentleman out of the corporation , I am convinced that it would immediately take , and that something considerable could soon be raised , which would be of standing benefit to our churches , and more widely disseminate the knowledge of truth . 1 Such has been the feeling , through New England , in favor of 1 The system of scholarships , inaugurated by President Sears , is based upon the same general principles which Manning here develops ; with this difference , however , that the scholarships are not of necessity Baptist in their character , or confined exclusively to students who have or who may have in view the Chris tian ministry . These points are left for the respective founders of scholarships to determine . The majority of them , it may however be added , serve in carry- /z/ a college education , that our pious illiterate ministers are greatly circum scribed in their sphere of usefulness , of which many of them are sufficiently sensible , and heartily wish their successors may be enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opened for the labors of Baptist ministers throughout our vast , extended frontiers , and many new churches have been lately constituted in that howling wilderness ; and indeed the labors of our society seem there generally preferred . I fear I have already trespassed upon your patience ; but you wished for various information ; and you must consider this letter contains the sub stance of a ten years correspondence . I shall be happy to have your assistance and patronage of the college , and your opinions on the subjects proposed by the first opportunity . I had forgot to mention that , amidst the wreck of public credit , we have been so fortunate as to preserve , undiminished , our little fund , though as yet , from the exhausted state of the treasury , which has operated greatly to my personal disadvantage , we ing into effect precisely these views of President Manning . At the meeting of the Warren Association held in the year 1791 , the Rev. Dr. Stillman presented a plan , which , he stated , he had received from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of assisting such young men of the Baptist denom ination as may appear to be suitably qualified for the ministry , with a collegiate education . " Who this friend was we can not positively state , but we have no doubt whatever in regard to the source whence the plan itself originated . After a second reading it was unanimously adopted by the Association , and a board of trustees , consisting of twelve , was chosen . This board was styled , " Trustees of the Baptist Education Fund . It was required that " so many of the Baptist Fellows of Rhode Island College who are members of churches shall be trustees of this fund , : the remaining number to be chosen by ballot from and by the Warren Association . Of the college Fellows on the board , were Dr. Stillman of Boston , Dr. Smith of Haverhill , Ilev . William Williams of Wrentham , Dr. Maxcy , President of the College , and Robert Rogers , Esq. , of Newport . Those elected by the Association , were Dr. Backus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Newton , Rev. Noah Alden of Belliiigham , Ilev . Thomas Green of Cambridge , Rev. George Robinson of Bridgewater , and Ilev . Isaiah Parker of Harvard . In February , 1794 , the society thus commenced was duly incorporated by the Legislature of Massachusetts . In 181G a separate organization was formed , which , in 1823 , was incorporated under the name of " The Baptist Education Society of the Warren Association . " At this time the funds , now amounting to S3GOO , were equally divided between this society and the Boston Association , which had been formed in the year 1811 . Hence the origin and present funds of the society now known as the Rhode Island Baptist Education Society . /z/ have not been able to command any interest .

In a religious view I am certain it should not operate to produce any discord among the subjects of that Prince whose kingdom is not of this world . As far as my ac quaintance extends , I am convinced that , on our part , the former attach ment still continues ; and I am sure I have as little reason to doubt it on yours . Mr. Mullett was kind enough to put into my hands your volume on do mestic duties , and I heartily thank you for the pleasure which the peru sal of it gave me . I wish there were more of them in this country . They are greatly needed , and I think would sell . Before the Avar , for supply ing the college and my friends , I kept a small assortment of books , which I yearly imported from London . I still mean to do the same , and have thought of getting a number of our Baptist authors for the supply of our society in different parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffi cient attention paid to our own writings by our own people . Should you think proper to send any of your works for that purpose , on the same terms which booksellers with you have them , I shall exert myself to sell them , and directly remit you the money . I have mentioned my letter to you to Dr. Llewelyn , to whom , if you please , you may show it , and also to Mr. Ryland , and any other friend who may , in your opinion , be dis posed to serve the college , or wish for the information which it contains . By every opportunity I shall be happy to receive letters from Dr. Stennett . With sentiments of esteem , I am , dear sir , Your brother in Christ , /z/ The distinguished scholar to whom the following let ter is addressed died on the 7th of August , three months previous to its date .

It is certain that his feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book of Morgan Ed wards , his name appears as the largest subscriber on the /z/ list .

It contains his book-mark , and states the time of his death . /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 8 , 1783 . SIR : By Thomas Mullett , Esq. , for whose agreeable acquaintance I am indebted to an introductory line from Dr. Stennett , I had the pleas ure of hearing that you are yet alive , and , though in a declining state of health , are still protracting your usefulness in the cause of the Redeemer and the best interests of mankind . Your known zeal in promoting the Baptist society for a series of years , your ability to serve it , and the de sire you expressed , in his hearing , of knowing the state of the college at Providence , have encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give that information and to solicit your patronage of an institution which has already , in the minds of unbiased judges , greatly disseminated the knowledge of civil and religious liberty through this country , and added respectability to the Baptist profession . Bleeding with the wounds of war , it now solicits the relief which the benevolent and opulent alone can afford . From its first establishment until the commencement of the late unnat ural war , it gradually increased in the number of students , which at that time was about forty . It then began to attract the attention of the public , and bid fair to have been greatly augmented in numbers , as many were then preparing with a design to complete their education here . This town becoming a frontier , in the year 1776 , the troops took possession of the edifice , to which purpose it continued to be appropriated until June , 1782 . Great waste and destruction , you will naturally conclude , were made upon it by men whose profession has destruction for its object . To repair the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as also to fit up some rooms for the accommodation of students who are likely to enter soon . The number of these is now twelve , and more are soon ex pected . In short , we want nothing but a proper endowment to enable us to furnish a suitable library and apparatus , and properly support able /z/ instructors , to render the college very respectable ; the grand objection against it is the want of these things , of which they can boast at other col leges . Those inimical to our profession are exceeding vigliant to prevent its growth , from an idea of its importance to the Baptist cause . Hitherto a very great part of our society in this country have been by no means friendly to it ; but many have altered their opinion , and would assist if they could ; but , reduced by the war and the weight of taxes , at present they can only wish it well . Cambridge college was so fortunate as to at tract the attention of a Hollis , New Haven of a Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given their names to these seats of learn ing . We should think ourselves no less happy in the patronage of a Llewelyn . Llewelyn College appears well when written , and sounds no less agreeably when spoken . Nor do I know a name which it would please me better to hear extolled on our public anniversaries as the founder of the institution . The charter , one of which I beg leave to present to you , empowers the corporation to give the college a name in honor of its most distinguished benefactor , which they are resolved to do . I know your philanthropy and principles of liberty would not suffer you to object that we are now become independent of the British empire . You too well know that necessity , dire necessity impelled to this measure a people whose feelings revolted at the idea upon any other ground . Besides , sub jects of the Prince of peace can not approve of strong local attachments . It is the ardent wish of the human mind to establish a permanent fame . As this appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful whether he feels a stronger , or one that ceases to influence him later . And what can more effectually gratify this predominant affection , than the grateful recollection of the latest posterity that we have laid foundations for improving the human intellect , disseminating useful knowledge , and prop agating the gospel of peace over almost half the globe ? If we con sider the rapid progress of religion , letters , government , and arts in this new world , where on earth can a theatre be erected , from which the hu man character can be exhibited to better advantage ( in largely contribut ing to the progress of religion , society , and manners ) than in America ? But you , sir , need only consider that patronizing this college will directly contribute to the propagation of the gospel of Christ in its simplicity to bestow upon it your friendship . Of the prospects of this I have given some hints to Dr. Stennett , in a letter of this date , to which I refer you , as I have desired him to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the college , particularly requesting him to show it to Dr. u MANNING AND CHAP . VII . Llewelyn . Therein I have mentioned the state of our library , apparatus , fund , etc . The whole interest of the latter does not amount to more , if so much as , 60 sterling per annum . We propose to forward our cata logue as soon as it is ready , and invite our friends to lend us their assist ance in purchasing the books . Should your views be different from mine in reference to the premises , I beg your forgiveness for troubling you on this subject through my zeal for . ae college ; but should you think favorably of the proposal , you will do a singular favor to a grateful corporation , the Baptist society in America , and I doubt not to remote posterity , but to none more than to him who , with every sentiment of esteem , has the honor to subscribe himself , sir , Your friend and servant in the gospel of Christ , /z/ The Warren Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his correspondence alludes , prepared an address to their " friends and countrymen , " which presents a faithful picture of the times at the close of the war , and exhibits in a pleasing light the views and prospects of the Baptist denomination . We can not resist the temptation to introduce here the closing paragraphs . They have special reference to the college , and show how intimate , formerly , were the relations which it sustained to the churches : " Permit us to add a word concerning education , and we shall have done . In Genesis xvii . God made a covenant with Abraham , which con stituted a church in his household , who had a large grant of choice lands that in due time they were to take possession of by destroying the heathen inhabitants ; and as long as that state continued , they were to make a visible difference in commerce and government , as well as worship , be tween the circumcised and all other people in the world . In the same church the priests were to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the sentence of the law was in capital cases ; and the judges were to carry the same into execution ( Deut. xvii. 8-12 ) . When Christ came lie fulfilled the law , and abolished those distinctions among men ; and constituted his church upon a better covenant estab- /z/ lishcd upon better promises . His word calls said covenant with Abraham the covenant of circumcision ( Acts vii . 8 ) , but in after ages deceitful men took away that name , and called it the covenant of grace ; into which they essayed to bring children before they believed , or could choose for themselves . And all colleges and superior places of learning were en tirely under the command of such men for many centuries ; by which means , natural affection , the force of education , temporal interest , and self-righteousness , all conspired together to bind people in that way ; wherein the orthodox have claimed a right to treat all others as others have not a right to treat them . But a college is now erected at Provi dence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had without any sectarian or party tests . Other colleges have been erected and much of their expense borne by governments ; but this has been done entirely by personal generosity ; and some men of influence have tried to crush it ; therefore it calls loudly , to all lovers of knowledge and liberty , to contribute their mite towards its necessary support .

GRANGE ROAD , SOUTHWARK , May 1 , 1784. /z/ I have long wished for an opportunity of introducing myself to you , and to several other brethren on your side of the Atlantic . And as God in his wisdom has now put an end to the late bloody and unrighteous war , and opened a free communication between this country and America , I take the liberty , by the hands of your neighbor Mr. Chase ( who speaks in the highest terms of you , Messrs . Stillman Gano , etc. ) , of soliciting such a Christian correspondence as your wisdom may suggest , and your large connections and many avocations may permit . To describe myself is a work less proper than what I wish to be em ployed in ; but as it is probable my name has never reached your ears , it may not be altogether improper to hint that I was born at Tiverton , in Devonshire , about forty miles from Plymouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister . I was called by grace , I trust , when about sixteen years of age , became a student at Bristol under the Rev. Messrs . Hugh and Caleb Evans when I was between seventeen and eighteen , and continued there between three and four years . After the death of Dr. Gill , I was invited thence to town as a probationer amongst his people , and with them have been comfortably settled as pastor for more than eleven years . The church now consists of about three hun dred members , many of whom arc very lively , affectionate , and evangeli cal . The declaration of their faith and practice , which they made at their admission , is at the close of the three volumes of sermons and tracts ac- /z/ companying this , your acceptance of which will do me an honor , if you consider them as a small token of the great affection I bear you as a faithful and honored servant of our illustrious Master . Whatever scepticism attacks my mind , of this I am certain , that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . " This has frequently turned to me for a testimony of my having passed from death unto life . Nor did I least of all experience this in the year 1780 , when Mr. Wallin ( who left earth for heaven in the beginning of the year 1783 ) received a letter from Boston containing an account of a great revival through New England , and in which it was said Mr. Winchester was very instrumental . I sent this account to Mr. Evans , of Bristol , and he printed an extract from it in the following Western Association letter . It afforded a joy amongst many churches better felt than described . Some of us thought with pleasure on Isa. lix. 19 . But , alas ! the next account we hear is that this useful man has wofully changed his sentiments . Lord , what is man ! A sermon of Mr. Wallin s , called the " Outcasts Com forted , " on Isa . Ixvi. 5 , has been reprinted here , with an appendix said to be written by one Clarke , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dissertation on the altar of brass called Ariel , etc . My heart has been grieved for the good man , and I have wept in secret places on his account . Is it true that *Mr . Morgan Edwards , to whom I intend writing soon , has printed a book in vindication of him ? I believe all our Baptist ministers in town , except two , and most of our brethren in the country , were on the side of the Americans in the late dispute . But sorry , very sorry were we to hear that the college was a hospital , and the meeting-houses were forsaken and occupied for civil or martial purposes . We wept when the thirsty plains drank the blood of your departed heroes , and the shout of a king was amongst us when your well-fought battles were crowned with victory . And to this hour we believe that the independence of America will for a while secure the liberty of this country ; but that if the continent had been reduced , Britain would not long have been free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dated 1779 . It came with Mr. Backus s History , Since then many important things must have happened , and it may be there is much good news to be con veyed to us respecting our sister churches in the wilderness . Glad should I be to hear of the success of the gospel and of the prosperity of the college . When shall the priests of Zion be clothed with salvation , and her saints shout aloud for joy ? O Lord , let " thy kingdom come , " let it /z/ spread through all the world , and particularly let it come in my heart , and in the heart of thy honored servant for whom these lines are de signed . If I am not mistaken , the Baptist interest in this country is more flourishing than the Presbyterian or Independent . In most of our churches there is a cordial attachment to the truth as it is in Jesus , attended with a greater liberality towards others who differ from us than was formerly expressed . May a Christian contention for the truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconverted men may have reason again to say , " See how these Christians love ! " This afternoon I have been employed in packing books as follows : Gill s Sermons and Tracts , 3 vols. , blue boards , for yourself ; do. , in sheets , for that much respected man , Mr. Stillman , of Boston ; a dozen of Watts s Hymns and Psalms , and half a dozen Bibles and as many Testaments , to be disposed of as you think best . Gill should have been bound neatly ; but as Mr. Chase is likely to sail Monday morning- , it can not be done . Will you do me the favor of making this apology to Mr. Stillman if I have not time to write him , as I fear I shall not , for it is Saturday evening , nine o clock , now , and it was past eight before I began this hasty scrawl . With the above I have sent three prints , one of the Rev. Dr. Gill , an other of the late Rev. Hugh Evans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not time to get them glazed and packed . The first two deserve a respectful place in the college , and the last courts no situ ation but a place of solitude under your hospitable roof . I shall be much obliged to you to circulate the proposals which relate to Saurin and Claude , and to notice the advertisement of Gill s books which I have sent . If any of your friends want any of them , I can procure them at bookseller s price , considerably cheaper than the printed list . It will rejoice me to be of any service to them , and more especially if they arc poor ministers . I have not time to read this over now , as a person has been waiting for it while I write . Excuse my haste . Remember me respectfully , if you please , to Mr. Howell , your assistant . Pray for me , write me the first op portunity , and be assured I think it a great felicity to have any good reason to subscribe myself , Your affectionate brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-three years of age . /z/ To this letter Manning replies : - PROVIDENCE , Aug. 3 , 1784. /z/ I have now before me your most acceptable favor of May 1 , for which I return you many thanks , as well as for the package and its agreeable contents . I felicitated myself on a large and free correspondence with Christian friends in England on the return of peace , and accordingly wrote to Mr. Wallin , from New York , at the first dawn of it , but soon after received information that he had rested from his labors . By the first ves sel from the State this was followed by letters to Drs . Stennctt and Lle welyn and Mr. Ilyland ; but these , I conjecture from your letter , never reached them , since they contained such information as I judged would be wished for by our brethren on your side of the water , and such as in your letter you request . Nothing could be more agreeable than the cor respondence you propose , which I shall endeavor to keep up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first information of your name , etc. , as Mr. Wallin had favored me with the sermon and charge delivered at your settlement . But the interruption of all inter course by means of the war , left me in a great measure ignorant of the state of our churches and ministers in England , until Dr. Stennett s letter , last fall , by Mr. Mullett , and a short acquaintance with Capt . Thomas Mesnard last May in New York , who gave me such a pleasing idea of Mr. Eippon , that I requested him to present my Christian salutation , and inform him that a letter would be highly pleasing to your unknown friend . Your letter , it appears , was then written in consequence of Mr. Chase s recommendation , to whom I am obliged for his favorable opinion . As soon as the package of books and the prints came safe to hand , Mr. Stillman s were sent forward , together with his letter , and I shall distribute the Bibles , Testaments , Psalms and Hymns as I think will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Gill s , Saurin s , and Claude s works I have circulated ; but the impoverished state of the country , and the disinclination to reading books on religious subjects , presage but a small sale at present . Some , however , will , I expect , be wanted , for which I shall expect your kindly proffered services . I most heartily re joice at your success in the ministry , and the happy state of the church of which you are pastor . May the Lord continue to strengthen you for his service , and honor you with many more seals of your ministry . You speak the language of my heart towards brethren in your country when /z/ you express your affectionate regard for us . I conceive this results from the very nature of the religion of Jesus . Often has this prompted me to plan a voyage to Europe ; but such have hitherto been , and most proba bly will continue to be , my embarrassments , that I shall be denied this privilege ; but I hope to meet the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above when our labors on earth are finished , prints of Dr. Gill and Rev. Hugh Evans shall have a respectful place : the college , and as I daresay Mr. Rippon loves good company , he will excuse me for placing his there also . Not that I am unwilling to furnish it and its agreeable original , with the best accomodations my house can afford , for this I should esteem a peculiar favor ; but as I promise mysel your future patronage of the college , I know of no place so suitable as that . The apostasy of Mr. Winchester has been for a lamentation am us . Self-exaltation was the rock on which he split . Though he had from the first been remarkable for instability of character , he inflicted a grievous wound on the cause , especially in Philadelphia ; but I think he is now at the end of his tether . His interest is declining , which will most probably prove a deadly wound . I saw him last May , and from his ap pearance think he has nearly run his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his preaching , and by a letter last week from the Rev. Thomas Ustick , who now supplies the pulpit in Philadelphia , I learn that Win chester and his friends have lost the case in their suit for the meeting-house and the property of the church . It really appeared that God owned his labors in the revival in New England . Perhaps for attempting to take the glory to himself , He has laid him aside as an improper instrument for his work , who justly challenges the whole of it as his own . Erom common fame , and from what I myself saw , I really think this to be the case . Mr. Morgan Edwards has not printed in vindication of his principles , but he read me a manuscript more than a year since on that subject , which he did not own , though charged then with being the author . He did not deny it ; whereby he was entreated not to add the printing of this to the long list of imprudent things which had already so greatly grieved his friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but I thought the use of it was duty . Enclosed I send you the minutes of the Eastern Association since the year 1779 ; and as I flatter myself that my letters must have reached Dr. Stennett , etc. , before this , I refer you to the information which they contain , observing in general that at the commencement of the war the glo- /z/ rious revival in which the college and the town of Providence , as well as many places adjacent , had so largely shared ( during the continuance of which , in the course of a year , I baptized more than a hundred persons ) , began to decline ; and except the visitation you refer to in your letter , the state of religion , saving in the frontier parts , has been on the decline until about the close of the war , since which public worship is better attended , and many souls have of late been hopefully converted . On a visit to New York and the Jerseys , the last spring , I found the people anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where I was called to preach . By a letter the last week I find the work increases , es pecially under the ministry of Mr. Wilson , a young minister resident at Bordentown in AYcst Jersey , and my Brother Gano in New York . As Mr. Backus is here , I prevailed on him to give a sketch of the reformation between two and three hundred miles cast of us , of which he has had some direct and late accounts . This , for your satisfaction , I also enclose . Lord s Day sennight I conversed with a person from there , who professed to be a subject of the work . He gave a most remarkable account of the display of God s power and grace amongst them . In general our churches appear to stand steadfast in the doctrines of grace ; and indeed the Bap tist churches are almost left alone in defending them against Arminians and Universalists , as our brethren of other denominations who are sound appear much discouraged . I believe I may say with truth , that the Bap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious denomination ; but in general we arc the poor of the world . God grant that we may be rich in faith . I rejoice to hear that our Baptist brethren in England sympathized with us in our deep affliction . Our blood indeed was wantonly shed , of this I have been a deeply interested spectator , but I trust God meant it for good . I think I can say that I never in one instance doubted the justice of our cause , and I desire to bless God that I never thirsted for the blood of those who were shedding ours . But I wish to banish from my mind those scenes of horror . Brotherly kindness prevails more amongst the several denominations throughout New England than heretofore , and of course the prejudices against the Baptists are greatly abated . Nothing is more common than the most cordial invitations into the pulpits of the Pedobaptists when I travel through the country . I rejoice to hear that the same spirit prevails with you .

Asher Bobbins , LL.D . He was born in Connecticut , and was gradua ted at Yale College in the year 1782 . Soon after completing his collegiate course , he was elected a tutor under Manning , which office he held for eight years . While thus occupied in quickening the diligence of his pupils , and in imbuing their minds with a genuine relish for the varied forms of classical beauty , he sought every opportunity to cultivate his own taste for the classics , and indeed for every species of elegant learning . After resigning his tutorship , he studied law under the Hon. William Channing , of Newport , at that time the Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of the law , where he resided during the remainder of his life . From 1825 to 1839 he was an honored and useful member of the United States Senate . He seldom engaged in the debates of that body , but on no occasion , says Prof. Godclard , did he address the senate without leaving on the minds of all who heard him a decided impression of his high intellectual powers and accomplishments , of his ability as a statesman , and his acquisitions as a scholar . He died at Newport , in 1845 , having lived , " by reason of his strength , " fourscore years and more . Mr. Bobbins was the first librarian of Brown University , as we learn from a letter respecting its early history in which he thus writes : " At the reorganixation of the college , in the autumn of 1782 , 1 was appointed to the office of tutor , and took charge of the library as librarian .

They assured us that God was working wonders through a great extent of that newly-settled coun try , that gospel laborers were much wanted there , and that in the re vivals great numbers embraced the Baptist principles . The most SOITOAVful accounts we received were from several places in the Massachusetts and Connecticut States , where Pcdobaptists are again taxing our people , and seizing their persons and property , to compel them to support their worship .

Last week I attended the Association at Elder Hinds s , Middleborough .

The Association recommended the pay ing not the least attention to their ecclesiastical laws , and resolved that they were determined to maintain their claims of equal liberty , etc. , and would recommend to the churches to support the sufferers . I am sur prised that they are not ashamed to hold up their heads , in this enlight ened age , in such a shameful cause . But perhaps God means it for good . /z/ " We had several ministering brethren from New Hampshire and the northeastern parts of Massachusetts , who refreshed us much with good tidings from that quarter . Many have there been turned to the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of it generally adopt believ er s baptism . There are great calls for gospel ministers in that quarter .

I believe the rest of your friends are well as usual . With sentiments of esteem and respect to Mrs. Ustick and friends , I am , etc. , /z/ The Rev. Elhanan Winchester , to whom reference is made in the preceding correspondence , had been a Bap tist clergyman of great repute in New England . He was born in Brookline , Mass. , on the 30th of September , 1751 . At the age of nineteen he became pious , and united with the church in his native town . Soon afterwards he com menced the public work of the ministry . Subsequently experiencing a change in some of his views of religion , he visited Canterbury , Ct. , where he was baptized by Elder Ebenezer Lyon , and received as a member of the Baptist church . In the spring of 1771 he removed to Rehoboth , Mass. , where he remained one year . He afterwards /z/ preached in various parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eloquence , and ap parent zeal , excited great interest , and multitudes flocked to hear him . Unusual success attended his ministry , and his name became celebrated in all the churches . In the year 1781 he removed to Philadelphia , where he advocated the doctrine of universal restoration , and was excluded in consequence from the fellowship of the Baptist denom ination. 1 He preached for several years to his adherents 1 An account of this affair may be found in a little pamphlet entitled " An Ad dress from the Baptist Church in Philadelphia , to their Sister Churches of the same Denomination , throughout the Confederate States of North America . Drawn up by a Committee of the Church appointed for said purpose . " 18mo . Philadelphia : Printed by Robert Aitken , 1781. pp. 16 . A few extracts from this rare pamphlet may fitly appear in this connection . u In the beginning of October , 1780 , Mr. Elhanan Winchester , a native of Mas sachusetts Bay , New England , came as a messenger from the Warren Association to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members having , previous to this , repeatedly heard him preach , not the least suspicion existed but that he continued an advocate for that faith which we look upon as the faith once de livered to the saints . Accordingly , at a meeting for business the 9th of said month , it was agreed to use our best endeavors to prevail on him to stay , and preach for us a limited time . In two or three days after this , the Eev . Oliver Hart arrived in town from South Carolina ; we were , therefore , from many considerations , prevented doing anything decisive , until the 23d , when , at an assembly both of the church and congregation , it was , by the majority then pres ent , deemed most consistent with the resolution of the 9th ( a deviation therefrom carrying with it an appearance of injustice ) to give Mr. Winchester an invitation to tarry with us during the space of one year . Being waited upon , and made acquainted with the circumstances attending the choice , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous therein ; but , nevertheless , consented to supply our pulpit for six months , at least , and longer if everything should prove agreeable . " Popular applause , the idol which too many worship , was soon discovered to be an object zealously sought for and courted by Mr. Winchester . To accom plish this , persons w r ere every week hastily admitted to baptism , upon the slight est examination ; though we really believe that among the number are several sincere Christians , who , during this season of trial , have not been ashamed openly to discountenance his errors . Various innovations , contrary to our es tablished discipline , were introduced through his means . The church undertook /z/ in Philadelphia , among whom his biographer includes the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Rush , and Dr. John Redman , first President of the College of Physicians in Philadel phia . In 1787 he removed to London . He published many religious and controversial works , the most important of which are , Dialogues on Universal Restoration ; Lectures on the Prophecies , 2 vols. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defence of Revelation ; Oration on the Discov- a reform . In some respects success attended us ; in others , an obstinate adher ence marked his character . " The principal foundation of the greatest uneasiness we shall now proceed to consider . Early in the winter it was whispered to a few , that Mr. Winchester , notwithstanding his artful endeavors to conceal the same in his public discours es , held the doctrine of a linal restoration of bad men and angels from hell ; that the whole of Adam s progeny , yea , the devils themselves , at certain different pe riods , would be delivered from their torment , and made completely happy ; in other words , that he peremptorily denied the endless duration or perpetuity of future punishment . The method taken by him , at first , to propagate this wicked tenet , was by creeping into houses , and leading captive persons of weak capac ities , wherein he met with too much encouragement . Alarmed at this authen ticated report , he was at different times privately conversed with on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not presume to contradict it fully , and yet his confession was by no means satisfactory . Upon these occasions he would frequently intimate his intention of going away , provided the smallest division took place on his account ; while at the same juncture , as opportunity served , he failed not to use arguments in order to gain proselytes . " The result of all this , the Address goes on to add , was the introduction of the whole matter at a church meeting held on the 5th of March , 1781 . Much debat ing ensued ; the members became divided into two distinct parties , and finally a protest against the doctrine of universal restoration , as a dangerous heresy , was signed by sixty-seven of the most substantial and influential members of the church . This number was afterwards increased to eighty-six . Upon a motion made to wait on Mr. Winchester , and inform him that he could not , with pro priety , be allowed to preach for them any longer , the protestors found them selves in a small minority , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and younger members of the church , " being rather the most numer ous . " The church at this time numbered about one hundred and seventy . The protestors , however , conscious of having truth and justice on their side , viewed themselves as fully authorized to act independently of the new party . They ac cordingly appointed a committee of two to wait on Mr. Winchester at his lodg ings . This committee , failing to find him at Lome , addressed him a letter , which /z/ ery of America , with an Appendix ; Eeigning Abomina tions ; various sermons , etc . Mr. Winchester died on the 18th of April , 1797 , aged forty-six years . He appears to have been a man of sincere piety , notwithstanding the change in his theological opinions . His biography , by the Rev. Edwin M. Stone , of Providence , was published by Brewster of Boston , in 1836 . The book , which contains an excellent portrait of Winchester , is now extremely rare . From the following letter it appears that the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in consequence of the war , promised better than at any former period of its existence : /z/ PROVIDENCE , July 3 , 1784. /z/ By some means I mislaid your last to me in which you mention some buddings of a spiritual nature amongst you . I rejoice to hear it . Hope he returned at once , unopened . Ou Thursday evening , March the 8th , his friends broke into the meeting-house , and took forcible possession thereof , Mr. Winches ter preaching notwithstanding the confusion . On the ensuing Sabbath he ad ministered the Lord s Supper . A council of ministers was now called , and com mittees representing the two parties were appointed to meet them , with a view to an amicable adjustment of the difficulties . Failing in this , the members of the New Party , so called , were , by advice of the council , formally excluded from the church . Subsequently Mr. Winchester was , by the action of the Philadelphia and Warren Associations , formally excluded from the fellowship of the Baptist denomination . The Address , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 14 , 1781 , and signed by Samuel Miles , William Rogers , Thomas Shields , and John M Kirn . The suit for the possession of the house and property was , as we have already seen , finally decided in favor of the Protestors , as they were then called . We have devoted more space than could be well spared to this matter , because of its importance , and also because it is frequently alluded to in Manning s corres pondence . Indeed , Manning was himself prominent in the affair . Mr. Ustick , Winchester s immediate successor , was received by the church on his recom mendation ; and he was a member of a committee appointed by the Philadelphia Association , in 1781 , to investigate and report to said body the proceedings of the church in reference to Winchester and his doctrines . /z/ it may gloriously increase .

Your friends , as far as I could hear , are in usual health . The Plains are destitute of a minister . They intend to try for Sammy Jones . Mr. Eunyon is settled at Piscataway , where are some appearances of a revival . The general meeting was crowded , ten or eleven , ministers present , and amongst them Mr. Hart , who , I think , will settle at Hopcwell . Cranberry is visited with a revival , as are some other places in some small degree , especially under the ministry of Mr. Wilson , of Bordcntown . Mr. Gano s meeting-house is completely repaired and his congregation very full . Things look rather promising in New York , though the people are poor after their exile . I never enjoyed more freedom in preaching in any journey in my life , nor was I ever more attended to . The college consists of twenty- three stu dents , nine being added since the vacation . More than a dozen arc ex pected to enter in the fall . We have a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy , son of Jeremiah . Mr. Wilkinson 1 i William Wilkinson , who was graduated in 1783 . He immediately took charge of the college Latin school , which charge he retained until 1792 . He was eminently successful as a teacher , and fitted for college many of its distinguished alumni . In 1785 he was appointed , librarian of the college . As the history of the Latin school forms a part of our college history , we may be pardoned for in troducing here an advertisement from the Providence Gazette , by which it ap pears that the connection which had existed between the school and the college was for a time dissolved : " William Wilkinson informs the public , that , by the advice of the school committee , he proposes removing his school from the college edifice , on Monday next , to the brick schoolhouse ; and , sensible of the many advantages resulting from a proper method of instruction in the English language , he has , by the committee s approbation , associated with him Mr. Asa Learned , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employ them in the several branches of the Greek , Latin , and English languages taught grammati cally , arithmetic , and writing , may depend on the utmost attention being paid to their children .

" In tracing further the history of this Latin or grammar school , we find in the records of the corporation , under date of Sept. 4 , 1794 , the following : " Voted , That the President use his influence and endeavor to establish a grammar school iu this town , as an appendage to this college , to be under the immediate visita- /z/ is a good master . The school is nearly up to twenty . All the rooms in the two lower stories are now full , and Ave must go directly to finishing the two upper ones , at least the third , if we can possibly devise ways and means ; which I expect will be very difficult . I think the advice you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless fare , as well on the subject of advancement with us as at Jersey College . The institution promises better now than at any period of its existence . Had we about one or two thousand pounds more to provide for a suitable tuition , I should rejoice . Secure of your interest in sending us scholars , I shall say nothing on that head , but as the bearer , Capt . Thivell , is waiting , must conclude with best wishes to you , lady , and all friends . Yours , as ever , /z/ P. S. Miss Joey Brown , daughter of Nicholas , is fast declining . Her disorder is thought to be the consumption . President Manning now begins a correspondence with the Kev . Dr. Caleb Evans , President of the Baptist acad emy in Bristol . His father was the Rev. Hugh Evans , one of the most distinguished Baptist ministers of his day . Dr. Evans proved to be a warm friend of the college , and was the means of securing valuable books for the library . He died on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of his age . He published a collection of hymns , and numerous sermons and addresses , the greater part of which are to be found in the library .

" tion of the President , and the general inspection of the town s school committee , and that the President also procure a suitable master for such school . " This resolution was doubtless carried into effect . Fifteen years afterwards , as we have already stated in a previous chapter ( see page 198 ) , the corporation erected a brick building for the accommodation of the school , at an expense of fifteen hundred dollars . This building , which has since been enlarged , is the one now occupied as the " University Grammar School . " /z/ PROVIDENCE , Sept. 13 , 1784. /z/ I have long wished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am happy that one has at length offered , by answering your request in a late letter to my friend and brother Rev. Samuel Stillman , of Boston . Enclosed is the catalogue of all the books now belonging to the college . Nearly one half of them have their bindings much broken , as they were old when presented . Besides the enclosed we have ordered out from London this fall about fourteen hundred volumes , a catalogue of which we sent to Dr. Stennett , requesting his advice to the merchants , Messrs . Champion and Dickinson , in the purchase of them , hoping that he may point out whore they can be had second-hand , etc . Of this you may obtain a sight by applying to the Doctor . Together with that we sent a catalogue of books which we are not able to purchase , but which we should be glad to receive by way of donation , should any of our friends be so disposed . " Were I not oppressed with cares , and at present destitute of assistance , I would send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make out a copy of these catalogues before the ship sails , they shall accompany this . The above-mentioned fourteen hundred volumes are a donation from our treasurer , John Brown , Esq. , of Providence . The amount of two hundred pounds sterling was also ordered to be expended in the purchase of a necessary philosophical apparatus , in addition to what we already have , consisting chiefly of a telescope , an air-pump and its apparatus , globes , and a thermometer . The money for this order was subscribed by other members of the corporation last fall . A list of these articles was also forwarded to Dr. Stennett . Your kind attention to the interests of the college , and the proffer of your services , were sensibly felt by the corporation at their annual meeting this present month ; and it is in obedience to their commands , imposed by the following vote , that I now write : " Voted , That the Rev. Messrs . President Manning and Samuel Stillman be a committee to write to the Rev. Hugh Evans of Bristol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue of books belonging to the college , and endeavor to procure such donations in books , apparatus , and money as maybe obtained from thence ; and also consult Dr. Stennett on the expediency of sending a person to England to solicit donations for the college . " At the commencement of the war the college was in a growing state . The number of students was about forty , and there was a good Latin school in the edifice . In 1776 it was delivered up , or rather taken pos- /z/ session of by the troops as a barrack and hospital , and continued to be occupied by the militia , Continental and French troops , and seamen , until June , 1782 . During this period the house sustained great damages , for which we have received no compensation yet , nor have we much prospect of it in future . This has thrown a heavy burden on the corpo ration , and greatly embarrassed them in making the necessary repairs , especially as our fund is small . This we have made many efforts to augment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so little purpose that our whole fund produces but about sixty pounds sterling per annum . The distressed and exhausted state of the country by war , leaves us little room soon to hope for much from this quarter , especially as money is become so scarce that our people in the country , although possessed of property , can not command sufficient to pay their taxes . We are unwil ling however to relinquish our design , as it is evident that the institution has already greatly contributed to the perpetuity of our denomination , and begins again to attract the public attention . The number of students already in college , and of those we expect in the course of the fall , is up wards of thirty . In teaching I have the assistance of one tutor . A small Latin school is kept up in the college . Any services you can render in endowing it will be most acceptable to the corporation . Last week I attended our Association at Middleborough , and though several of the remote churches did not send messengers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreeable inter view . Were the minutes printed I would enclose them . In several places there is a happy revival of religion , especially in the eastern parts of Massachusetts , and I am not without encouragement under my poor min istry . The doctrine of religious , as well as civil liberty , is in general better understood in New England than before the Revolution notwith standing in places the persons and property of several of our friends have been seized on for ministerial rates . I think it not improbable that the rapid increase of our society will provoke some of our neighbors to give us much trouble ; but it affords encouragement that the whole body are determined to maintain their rights and support the burden which may first fall upon individuals . Possibly the knowledge of this resolution en tered into at our last annual meeting may deter our oppressors . If not , may the great Head of the ckurch furnish us with grace to suffer like Christians . I have often heard of your Education Society , and of its great utility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected friend /z/ and your brother-in-law , Thomas Mullet , Esq. , gave me the best account of it which I have yet received ; still , if it be not too troublesome I should be glad to receive further information respecting it , and I will engage to repay it in any information you wish for in my power to give . In a letter to Dr. Stennett , last fall , I gave a pretty full account of the state of religion and some other matters in this new world ; it was in answer to his request in a letter by Mr. Mullett . If this letter reached him , it is not improbable that you have seen it , as I requested him to commu nicate the contents to those of our friends who might wish to hear from us . On the opening again of the communication between both countries , it was pleasing to find our brethren in England , at least a great number df them , so much interested in our welfare . How strong a proof this of the reality of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gen uine fruit of a gracious principle ! The same temper is manifested here towards our brethren in England . There is the same joy expressed on hearing that Christ s kingdom is advancing witli you which appeared be fore the war . And why should it not be so , since his kingdom is but one 1 Dependence or independence therefore should make no difference amongst his subjects , who consist of the elect out of different people , nations , and languages . The privilege of a correspondence with Mr. Evans I shall highly prize , if not too troublesome to him ; and he may depend on punctuality on the part of his unworthy friend and brother , /z/ To this letter Dr. Evans replies : BRISTOL , ENGLAND , Jan. 26 , 1785. /z/ As the extensive connections in which my brother is engaged on your wide-extended continent render it advisable for him once more to traverse the mighty waters , and to pay a visit to his American friends , in which number you hold a distinguished place , I gladly embrace the opportunity of accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13th of September last , which I received in due course in November . I shall be truly happy to do anything in my power to promote the prosperity of the infant college over which you so worthily preside , and shall omit no opportunity that offers of testifying my regards to it . Charity , you know , the old proverb says , should begin at home , but I think it should not end there , but flow on without control to the utmost limits of possibility . I /z/ had so little time with Dr. Stennett when I was in London that we had no opportunity of entering upon the affairs of your college as I wished to have done , nor could I have a sight of the catalogue of the books lately purchased . I shall nevertheless pursue the design of obtaining for you such of our duplicates as may be worthy your acceptance , without strictly adhering to what you already have , because you may easily exchange , as you observe , such as may prove superfluous . But this can not be accom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no meeting till that time . As to a person s coming over here to solicit benefactions , I rather fear it would not at present be advisable ; but should Dr. Stennett think otherwise , and a proper person should come , especially if it were either yourself or Dr. Stillman , I would readily use my utmost efforts to pro mote his success . Our friends in general are well enough affected to America , but many of them have very little idea of the utility of academi cal institutions , though it is evident the prejudices arc wearing away . I am sorry to see , as well by the account Mr. Mullctt gives me as by your letter , that religion is at so low an ebb amongst you , though I doubt not the time will come when it will again run and be glorified . There have been on your continent , in years past , many enemies against revivals , and your set time to favor Zion will , I doubt not , yet come again . Your church is , however , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some others . Blessed be God , we have cause ; for thankfulness here . One of our churches in this city lately baptized twenty , and probably before this letter leaves this place I shall have the pleasure of receiving something more than an equal number to the solemn rite . And yet still vc have much cause to complain of lukewarmness and formality . Dr. Stennett s Dis courses on Domestic Duties you have probably seen , and probably Mr. Booth s treatise on Baptism , the most elaborate and decisive perform ance upon that subject that has ever yet been published , or probably ever will be . I enclose you one of our last associational letters , and a sermon lately published by one of our ministers on Walking by Eaith , which I beg your acceptance of , as also a fifth volume of Saurin to complete the set which Mr. Mullett tells me he presented to your college , and which he had of me for his own use on the voyage . Amongst the books you may expect in the fall are the Polyglott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dictionary , and many others equally valuable . I shall wish your direction how to send them . I will , my dear sir , detain you no longer than to express my warmest wishes for the increasing pros perity of the church and college over which you preside , the revival of the /z/ interests of literature and true religion through the American continent and the whole world , and recommend my brother to your continued friendship . I remain , Yours , affectionately , in the endearing bonds of gospel love , /z/ In his correspondence with Evans , Dr. Manning , it will be observed , speaks of being " oppressed with cares . " The number and variety of his cares may be inferred from the following amusing extract from a letter written by Dr. Waterhouse , which we find quoted in the memoir by Prof. Goddard : " I never shall forget what Dr. Manning , in great good humor , told me were among his * trying experi ences . He told me that his salary was only eighty pounds per annum , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the college ; heard two classes re cite every day ; listened to complaints , foreign and domes tic , from undergraduates and their parents , of both sexes , and answered them , now antl then by letter ; waited gener ally on all transient visitors into college , etc . Nor was this all . I made , said Dr. Manning , ray own garden , and took care of it ; repaired my dilapidated walls ; went nearly every day to market ; preached twice a week , and sometimes oftener ; attended , by solicitation , the funeral of every baby that died in Providence ; visited the sick of my own society , and not unfrequently the sick of other societies ; made numerous parochial visits , the poorest people exacting the longest , and , in case of any seeming neglect , finding fault the most . " Amid all these perplex ing cares , which allowed him but scanty time for premed itating his sermons , we have the testimony of Dr. Waterhouse for adding that " the honorable and worthy man never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ It is with pleasure that I reflect on a restoration of intercourse between Great Britain and America , after so long an interruption by so destructive a war .

Shall be glad to hear of their obtaining your approbation . You will much oblige me by transmitting the enclosed parcel to Mr. Stillman ; and you will increase the obligation by favoring me with a few lines your first opportunity . Taking it for granted that Dr. Stennett will give you some account of the state of religion amongst us in the country , I have nothing to add but my ardent prayers that a kind Providence may bless your confeder ated provinces with peace and prosperity , and that the great Head of the church may cause pure and undented religion to flourish in all your academies , your churches , and through all your extensive country .

My present hurry has permitted me to examine but little more than the title pages , but from my predilection for the author of the Reign of Grace , I am persuaded any publication of his will be highly accepta ble . My next shall inform you of my opinion of the publications on perusal . In the mean time I beg you to accept my hearty thanks for the donation . By the ship Hope , belonging to this town , and by the bearer , Dr. Solomon Drowne , who goes as a passenger in her , I embrace the opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of yours .

The restoration of public tranquillity and a free intercourse between the two countries , after so long an interruption , is matter of thanksgiving to God . Few , perhaps , in either country , more sincerely regretted this interruption than your unworthy friend ; to which no consideration could ever reconcile him except that of making a part of the plan of His ad ministration who is infinite in wisdom . Conciliatory measures , I doubt not , will render both countries reciprocally useful . I have transmitted the letter and parcel to Mr. Stillman by a safe hand . I have not yet been so happy as to receive a line from Dr. Stennett , which I am daily expecting , with the wished-for information . Enclosed I send you a copy of our last Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of a number of our churches . Since that time I have received authentic accounts of a most glorious work of God , in what is called the State of Vermont , formerly the Hampshire grants , on the west side of Connecticut river . It extends over well-neigh half the peopled part of that territory , and appears increasing . The eastern part of Massachusetts continues still to be remarkably visited in the same way , and the prospect brightens at New York and in many parts of the Western Suites . Some drops have also fallen on Providence , Newport , and Swanzey , with several other places . My attention , however , is so much called for at the college , that I can not visit , as I wish to do , and rejoice together with them . A long letter to Dr. Stennett , last fall , which you have probably seen , gave some general accounts of the state of religion amongst us since the commencement of the war . I shall not therefore repeat what I then wrote , only observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Dispensation , but others the Shaking Quakers , have , notwithstanding their boasted immortality , lately died ; one of whom was , as they termed her , the elect lady . The adherents , I am told , to that fanatical system , are falling off and renouncing it . Their folly in deed has been made abundantly manifest . It is the general opinion of . serious people that these shakings presage something glorious to the church of God . May the Lord grant an accomplishment of their wishes . The mournful news of Mr. Wallin s death reached us more than a /z/ year ago . When he died a truly great man in our Israel tell ; but I doubt not it was his gain . Your ardent wishes for our national prosperity , but more especially for that of the churches of Christ in this new world , are peculiarly acceptable . Permit me to repay them by wishes as ardent for Great Britain and Ire land , those lands of our forefathers nativity , and for the advancement of the glorious kingdom of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world . A line from Mr. Booth will always be very acceptable to his sincere friend and unworthy brother , /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 12 , 1784. /z/ I beg leave to embrace this opportunity to confess my fault in not for warding your diploma before now . By some unaccountable neglect it was mislaid till a few days since . You will forgive the execution , as the writing is but indifferent , nor could we at that time procure it done otherwise . It is , however , a small testimony of our regard for the merit of Mr. Ryland , and as such we beg you to accept it . The long and agreeable correspondence I was honored with by your father ( to whom I have written since the war ) leads me to wish for the continuance of it . But if his advanced age or engagements forbid it , I wish for it from his son , and , as I am told , successor in the school at Northampton . I heartily wish you success in the important employment of educating youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen days of sorrow during the late calamitous war , but blessed be God that I have lived to see a period to it , and a free inter course again opened between us and Great Britain . Some agreeable letters have already reached me from several friends in England , more of which I hope for soon ; also more particular accounts of the state of re ligion in general and your society in particular . I long to read some of those old-fashioned letters from Rev. John Ryland in this way . They will however be very acceptable from his son . The college is reviving . Thirty students have already entered , and more are expected . We have in part repaired the damages of the house , /z/ which were very great , by the wanton waste of the soldiery . I have the assistance of one tutor . We need more help , but the low state of our funds will not support another , and the scarcity of cash at present in this country forbids our hopes of augmenting our little stock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit during the war , as to preserve our little fund undiminished . In the eastern part of Massachusetts and in the State of Vermont there is a most glorious work of God , which has continued for some time and still increases . Please to present my best regards to your honored father , and believe me , with every sentiment of esteem , dear sir , Your unworthy brother , /z/ PROVIDENCE , Nov. 12 , 1784. /z/ This will be handed you by my friend , Dr. Solomon Drowne , of Provi dence , a son of the college , a gentleman of great modesty , who visits your city with views of further medical improvement . I beg leave to recom mend him to you as a man of good character , and a Fellow of the college . Through him you may receive what information you wish respecting the college , etc . Together with this you will receive the diploma I men tioned in my last . We beg you to accept it as a testimony of our respect for the character and merit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was done in a hurry , and by a young hand . The Lord s work still goes on gloriously in the eastern parts of Massa chusetts and Vermont . By recent advice from these parts we are assured that whole congregations , almost , of Congregationalists , embrace the Bap tist principles ; and in one instance their minister was baptized with his people . Several useful ministers are raised up amongst them lately in that wilderness . This looks somewhat like the coming of our Redeemer s kingdom . With me you say amen ! Come , Lord Jesus , come quickly . In great haste , I am , dear sir , Your unworthy brother and fellow-believer in Jesus , /z/ Mr. Drowne , whom Manning here introduces to Dr. Rip pon , graduated from the college in the year 1773 . Upon his /z/ return from Europe , he practised medicine in Providence for a while , then removed to Ohio , thence to Pennsylvania , and finally settled in the town of Foster , R. I. , where he passed the remainder of his days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his taste for botany and for elegant letters . In 1811 he was appointed Professor of Materia Medica and Botany in Brown University , and for two or three seasons he delivered lectures to a class of medical students . He also lectured on botany to the un dergraduates of the University , and to a private class of citizens . He died in 1834 , at the advanced age of eighty-one years . A fine portrait of him is among the collection of portraits in Rhode Island Hall . Mr. Drowne was a Fel low of the University from 1783 until his death , a period of more than fifty-one years . PROVIDENCE , Dec. 23 , 1784 . To THE HONORABLE DAVID HOWELL , MEMBER or CONGRESS IN PHILADELPHIA : SIR : Before you receive this , you will doubtless be advised of the melancholy situation of our common friend , Mr. Joseph Brown , who , upwards of four weeks since , received a violent shock of an apoplexy and numb palsy combined , which for some time caused his physicians and friends to despair of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the use of his limbs and his speech , it forbids , in a great measure , our indulg ing a hope of his restoration to former usefulness . Joey , daughter of Nicholas Brown , still survives , but is in the last stage of her disorder . Mrs. Thurston , wife of the elder , died of the small pox last Friday . He and his family have it by inoculation , and are in a hopeful way to recover . I left Newport last Monday morning . Your family are in usual health , for aught I have heard to the contrary since my return . Mr. Wilkinson speaks favorably of Jeremiah s proficiency in and attention to Greek . I have nothing new to advise you respecting the college . Our number is above thirty . We have heard that you very soon adjourned to Phila delphia , after your meeting at Trenton . I suppose you find better living /z/ and more diversion in the city ; to which , if members of Congress are not entitled , I beg leave to know who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and attentive to the public business , conducting it to the great honor and advantage of the United States . What think you of an application to Congress for the rents and dam ages of the college 1 Will it do this session or not ? I fear it will become an old story , and that we , in the issue , shall lose the whole , if we defer it longer . What we ask is not only just , but greatly wanted at present . I beg you to feel round amongst the members , and form a judgment of the probability of success in case of an application . Should things appear promising , I will forward the papers , and indeed will come myself , Deo vo/ente , in the spring , if you think it can be of any use . You remember I mentioned to you the case of our farm in the Jerseys , and our thoughts of selling it for public securities . What is your opinion ? Will Congress , this session , provide for paying the interest on final-settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? From the face of things at present with you , is it your opinion that public securities will appreciate soon ? If so , which species of them are the most likely to do so ? If Congress takes up this subject , how long do you expect it will be first ? I wish a resolution of these queries when your leisure will per mit . Are you likely to open a land-office soon , to dispose of any of the Western territory ? What concessions have the Indians made to the commissioners sent out to treat witli them ? Will they sell any part of their lands to the States ? or do they oppose our extending our settle ments ? What will be the terms , if Congress opens an office , on which they will dispose of their lands 1 It is the ardent wish here that some thing may speedily be done with our new acquisitions towards raising our public credit , and alleviating the burdens of taxation , under which the people at present groan . And if the way is paved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , as money daily grows scarcer . This must affect the price of them greatly , at a future distant period , unless some expedient can be hit on to replenish the States with that useful arti cle . Will not Congress establish a mint for the Union ? I think this measure would be attended Avith advantage . While we neglect it , do we not , apparently , betray a diffidence or distrust of the continuance of our in dependence 1 A national coin would serve to strengthen the sinews of gov ernment , in my opinion , and might be managed so as to secure a medium in the country , I should think , which is certainly a great national object . But I shall begin to smile at my scribbling politics , and I shall provoke /z/ your risibilities no further ; concluding by inquiring how you found friends in the Jerseys , requesting a line from you at your first leisure , and , joined with Mrs. Manning , presenting my best compliments . With sentiments of esteem , I am , respectfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1785. /z/ Unwilling to saddle you with postage to the amount of three or four shillings , as I had no other medium of conveyance , I have now before me yours of Dec. 24 , and January , to which I have given you no an swer . I presume , from not mentioning in your last the indisposition of your family , that your children are recovered . This , at least , I hope is the case . In addition to the procedure of the Pedobaptists , mentioned in my last , I now have to inform you that some time in this winter they took three of Mr. Thomas Green s people for minister s rates , and put them into Cambridge jail . You recollect that he lives in that town . Our friends have prosecuted them , and the trial comes on there the 9th inst . Perhaps a degree of this opposition to the truth of the gospel is necessary to engage a suitable attention to its importance . It is no argument in favor of the disposition of those who make it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those against whom it is made . Some revivals in various parts of New England are encouraging amidst these trials . Providence in a small degree is blessed with some quickenings amongst Christians , and a few instances of late awakenings . I hope you may yet rejoice on this account in Pennsylvania . The state of the college is as promising as we could reasonably expect . Our number is thirty-one , and more are expected to enter this spring . Mr. John Brown is about finishing the third story , which we expect to want in the course of this year , if those whom we expect should come . I be lieve our students are as orderly , industrious , and as good scholars as at any one period of the institution . One tutor is all the assistance which I have at present , Mr. Bobbins , from Connecticut , who gives good satisfac tion . Probably I shall be able to answer your request relative to Mr. Brown this spring before I visit the Jerseys , which I expect to do in May , without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ time had resolved on an application to Congress for reparation of the damage done the college during its appropriation to public uses through the war , and have resolved to send me on that errand . In this I shall want every assistance from the friends of the institution , by letters to the members , etc . If your acquaintance with any of them will enable you to aid me , I know I am sure of that aid . Mr. Joseph Brown s indisposition is indeed a very heavy stroke to us . The college and the church particularly feel it . There is little probabil ity of his ever being restored to his former usefulness , though he again goes a little abroad . I have attended to your request in respect to the minutes you enclosed . I am sorry to hear of the acrimony among you respecting the officers of government . I think it very imprudent in the Presbyterians , as well as injurious , to wish to engross these to themselves . But that profession has been of old impeached of a propensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I partly believe it . As I am thoroughly conscious of my want of qualifications for the grade you mention , so I do not wish it . It is perhaps , at best , but an empty sound , and rendered , in too many instances , still more so by the char acters of those on whom it has been bestowed , for a place in whose cata logue I have no ambition . 1 I thank you , however , for your kind atten tion . You have my hearty thanks for your expressions of friendship to the college . You reason rightly with the Baptists respecting this matter , who , one would think , have sufficient proofs of the propriety of it , from the struggles amongst themselves . But we are , and ever have been , in these respects , a wrong-headed people . I am happy to have a better opinion of their hearts . I hope Mr. Rogers s lecturing maybe of use , and that you may both labor with great success , and , as father Aldcn says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a school must greatly interfere with your discharge of the duty of a pastor , but I hope this may not be without its good effect to counterbalance that loss , since there appears to be a needs be for it . In your letter to Mr. Pitman you mentioned Win chester , in possession of his fifth wife and a red coat . Please , in your 1 President Manning here refers , doubtless , to the honorary degree of Doctor in Divinity , which the University of Pennsylvania , as appears from their trien nial catalogue , conferred upon him during the present year . Our readers will not fail to observe , that while Manning seems to have been indifferent in regard to his own honors and emoluments , he was careful in conferring the honors of Rhode Island College upon the worthy who desired them . /z/ next , to give us the particulars of that eccentric genius , his adherents , success , etc. , etc . Mrs. Manning has been restored to her health for some time , except a cold , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of winter , as ripe for heaven , by every evidence which could be wished for , as almost any person I ever saw . Many have dropped off this winter in this town and Newport by chronic complaints , but at pres ent good health is more prevalent . With best respects to Mrs. Us tick and friends , in which Mrs. Manning joins , and with sentiments of esteem , I am , as ever , Yours , etc. , /z/ PROVIDENCE , March 21 , 1785 . To THE HONORABLE DAVID HOWELL , /z/ g IR : And the snow three and four feet deep ! what do you think of that ? How do you think Mrs. Ho well fares this inclement , protracted winter ? not to mention the cows , old Sorrel , etc. , in regard to hay . But I beg pardon for calling your attention from that higher region where you are conversant , in settling the nation , to these sublunary things . To be serious , we have not only had a hard winter , but the spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talk here much of removing to the tem perate climate of Kentucky to avoid this snow and frost , which throw us into a torpid state so great a part of the year . I saw your papa and fam ily at meeting yesterday ; all well . Your friends in general are well . I have enclosed Mr. Carter s paper of the 12th instant , containing the law made at the last session of the General Assembly in relation to the import , in Mr. Van . Horn s letter , which I authorize you to open that you may see it , provided you have not yet received it . But I beg you to reendorse it and direct it to Mr. Van Horn , to be left at Mr. Ustick s . The college remains in statu quo. item , the church , congregation , politics of the town , etc. , for aught I know . I thank you for the newspapers you sent me . I think the address to the York Assembly labored . Will it compass their ends ? It is diverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose each other for their latent zeal for the Kirk , and exhibiting to the world the naked truth . If , by their quarrel , an old proverb should be verified , it might afford matter of rejoicing to many . But they are mem bers of the militant church , and so I leave them to box it out . I told you /z/ in my last that the corporation had resolved to send me forward in the spring to Congress , as you desired . But as you did not give much en couragement of success from the application , I beg leave to inquire what you think of the probability of our procuring a grant of some part of the Western territory , instead of a grant of money , as I perceive , by vour letter to Mr. Brown , you expect a land-office to be opened in the spring 1 This would not augment the public debt , and would in time be productive for the college . Rather than get nothing , I should be glad to accept of this . This , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested for your con consideration , on which I should be glad of your opinion , in your next , that I may take the sense of the corporation on this subject before I set out . Pray , how go final-settlement notes and other continental securities in New York at present ? You need not have been quite so short in your last , for I make a point of writing whenever I can find anything to say ; and would you wish , after reading this , to have me write again and say nothing ? If so , I can spill ink and spoil paper as fast as most of my neighbors . Pray , what is likely to be the result of the wranglings of the Dutch and the Emperor ? " Will there be a general war , and if so will it reach us ? You stand on the watchtower , and can tell us , we presume , what may be depended on . Now there is a claim entered for a very long letter , by next post , by , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of London , to whom , it seems , Dr. Manning had shown kind attentions while a captive at Providence during the war , he thus writes : PROVIDENCE , July 10 , 1785. /z/ Yours of April 27 , 1785 , with the box of books , containing five vol umes quarto of Witsncr s Works , in Latin , came safe by the hand of Mr. Fry . When they arrived I was absent at New York , or I should have embraced an earlier opportunity of presenting my thanks to Mr. Mackaness for the donation , and the kind attention which you have been pleased to pay to me . Your letter last winter , by your son-in-law , came safe to hand , but I had not the pleasure of seeing him . I took the ear- /z/ liest opportunity of forwarding you a letter , by the care of our common friend Deacon Mason , of Boston , in hopes it might have reached Mr. Harvey s hands before he sailed . I am sorry you did not receive it . A visit from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed expected . Messrs . Jos . Rogers and Geo . Benson are well . The former is mourning the loss of a dear and amiable wife . He feels that the hand of God has touched him . He could sympathize with you in calling to remembrance the tender and afflictive scenes through which you have passed . I am glad to find that you think , however stormy the path , that you have been led the right way towards the city of habitation . I sincerely wish your afflictions maybe sanctified , so as to work for you " a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory . " I hope you may be so happy as to settle your children to your mind ; but I should not think they had fixed upon the most agreeable place . Yet contentment and in industry will , anywhere , answer the purposes of this life , which is , at best , but a short passage to a long eternity . The kind mention which you say you have heard made of me by your honorable friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are few men on earth of whose approbation I should be more am bitious . The little services , if they may be termed services , in my power to render you when here a captive , gave me , I am confident , a much higher degree of pleasure than they could possibly afford you . That " it is more blessed to give than to receive " I have found to bo true as often as God has given me a heart to make the experiment , and I hope he will give me more of that disposition . " Whether I shall ever be gratified in my wishes to see the place of your nativity or not , I have yet to learn . At several different times I thought the point nearly decided ; but I am yet on the Hill at Providence , overwhelmed with cares . And though I think my services of little importance to the church and college , my breth ren and masters , it seems , think my presence here of some importance to both . I have the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church and college , again collected , beyond what they have been since the war until lately . I have little to say of my success in the ministry . Yester day I baptized three . The season was solemn . The audience is both large and attentive , and I hope among them are some inquiring souls . One of the members of college has lately , I hope , been brought to know the Lord . Our number of students is about thirty-five , with a prospect of increase . But as we are destitute of an adequate fund , this does but increase my labors , as I am confined to constant teaching . /z/ The Lord is gracious to many parts of this land , in of late pouring out his Spirit upon the people . Mr. Gano has a rich blessing in New York . The eastern part of New Jersey is also visited . In Vermont there is a day of God s power , and so also in several of the interior parts of New England . May that glorious kingdom come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the King of Zion , and I partly believe I shall live to see the accomplishment of at least some of the glorious things spoken of the city of God . By recent accounts from Kentucky , five hundred miles down the Ohio below Fort Pitt , I learn that God has done and is still doing wonders in that wilderness . Seven or eight Baptist churches are here settled , and a number of faithful but very unlettered ministers are engaged in the har vest . To spread the knowledge of the Redeemer ( who came preaching in the wilderness of Judea ) in the wilderness , has long been with me a desirable object . And with this view I have conceived a design , if pos sible , of furnishing their untutored minds with books . My plan is to establish a library for the Baptist Association ( to be established there this year ) of such books as are best adapted to their situation , to qualify their ministers more thoroughly for their ministerial work , and to assist those young men of promising abilities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . With this view I am about to make col lections of books in America , and I recommend the same no my corres pondents in England , and request them to send them forward to the Rev. Thomas Ustick , minister of the Baptist church at Philadelphia , with a line to him informing him of the donors and the design . He will take charge of the same , till they can be safely forwarded to Kentucky , for the uses mentioned . Any services you can render in so good a cause will be kindly accepted . They are almost wholly , I am told , destitute of all kinds of books . I propose there shall be a book kept by the associa tion , in which shall be entered the donors names , and what they contrib uted . You have my best wishes , in which Mrs. Manning joins . Your unworthy friend , /z/ P. S. Should I not have the pleasure to see you , please to present my Christian salutation to Mr. Thornton when you return . /z/ PROVIDENCE , July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January came to hand last month while I was in New York , the perusal of which gave me great pleasure , especially that paragraph which mentions the additions to the churches in Bristol . May you be so happy as to see the good work increase . Things , in ref erence to religion , remain much as when I wrote last , except a greater attention paid to public worship . Lord s Day before last I baptized three persons . In several parts of New England the Lord is evidently at work . In Vermont there is a glorious shower of divine influence , as also in the city of New York and the eastern part of the Jerseys . My Brother Gano is greatly blessed , upwards of forty having of late been added to his church , among whom are two of his sons and one of his daughters . When I heard last from there the work was increasing . I had the pleasure of a short interview with Mr. Mullett in New York , and he twice or three times gave us the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he passed to and from Boston . He was kind enough to engage to trans mit my letters safely to England . Your kind proffers of service to my self or Mr. Stillman in soliciting for the college , should either of us be sent , are very acceptable , but we have yet had no advice on that subject from Dr. Stennett . Your account of the ideas of the Baptists with you , respecting literary institutions , are very similar to those of the American Baptists . We shall gladly receive the books you mention , and any oth ers which you can spare , or procure for us . As there is no direct com munication between Bristol and Providence , shall wish you to send them via New York , to the care of my brother-in-law , John Stites , merchant , at the corner of Queen and Chapel Streets in that city , with a line advis ing him where to send them . I shall inform him of this advice to you , and request him to forward them immediately to me . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly esteem them . I wish every family were possessed of the book . Mr. Booth s treatise on Bap tism , and his tract on Church Communion , he was kind enough to present to me last year . Upon reading , I recommended it in almost the same words in which you mention it ; alleging that I thought it would super sede the necessity of any future publications on the subject . I wish it could be circulated throughout this continent , and am determined to use my endeavors for that purpose . I shall write him on this subject by this /z/ opportunity . The Association Letters , the sermon on Walking by Faith , and the fifth volume of Saurin s Sermons , all came safe to hand , for which I beg leave to present to you my hearty thanks , and wish , in my turn , it were in my power to afford you equal pleasure by transmitting some valua ble American publications , but this is a barren soil . The embarrassments of trade , especially in the New England States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnation of business , which must continue till new channels are opened , or the restrictions on the American trade are taken off in the ports of Britain and France . Our merchants at present sink money by all the trade they drive . This renders it next to impossible to make remittances to Britain , as bills are eight percent , above par . Were it otherwise I should try to send over for some books on my own account ; especially for some of the publications of our ministers , in order to circulate them in this country ; and for the Encyclopaedia Britannica , a book we expected in our catalogue , but it did not come . From the accounts we have had of it I presume it must be a work of the great est utility . The college continues to increase gradually in the number of students , which at present is thirty-seven , one of whom , I have reason to believe , has been recently converted . I have long wished for an account of your Education Society , the foundation , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies pursued , manner of teaching , time re quired in completing the course , etc. , etc. , but I fear I should be trouble some to ask it of you . Some information on these subjects I received from my dear friend Mr. Mullett , but he referred me to Mr. Evans , and , if I rightly recollect , mentioned a book published from whence I could draw this information . If giving this information should be troublesome , I do not wish it , as from your situation you can not surely be in want of employment . One thing more I wish to mention , which is , that the new settlement of Kentucky , five hundred miles down the Ohio river below Fort Pitt , was first settled by Baptists . It now contains more than thirty thousand souls . There are seven Baptist churches and eight ministers , who propose forming an association this year . They inform me that they are extremely destitute of books , and the ministers are illiterate , but wish for the means of information . I have proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some useful books for the benefit of the association , that the ministers and those who are candidates for the ministry may have the use of it ; and of it may I say the foundation of a seat of educa tion . To this end I have written to my friends in different parts to 1784-1785 . BROWN UNIVERSITY . 3 " &gt;7 collect what books they can , and send them to the care of Rev. Thomas Ustick , minister of the Baptist church in Philadelphia , to be ready to be sent forward by the first good conveyance . Could your ministering brethren in England be induced to send their works , they would compose an excellent library for this purpose . I find by a publication of a Pres byterian , under the title of a History of Kentucky , that his denomination mean to monopolize and gain an establishment there in a literary way . We have in contemplation the putting in for a share . I have paid some attention to this subject , and don t mean to lose sight of it . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most acceptable . Chanty should not , indeed , end at home . " With sentiments of esteem , etc. , /z/ P. S. It is proposed to have a book in the intended library , contain ing the names of the donors , and the donations made by them , that pos terity may know what attention the present generation paid to the dissem inating useful knowledge in the wilderness . Whether the design succeeds or not , I shall have the satisfaction of attempting to do good ; and if I am not greatly deceived , a little laid out in this way will turn to good account . I mean to send them , if possible , soon , a person of our denomination to open a seminary amongst them ; and , indeed , wore I not confined to the college , should spend , God willing , the next winter there myself . Bibles and religious books which arc printed to be distributed gratis amongst the poor , would be well bestowed there , for the people are religiously disposed . The fullest confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to his care will be forwarded to them . He is a man of principle . As the term of human life is so short , and the sphere of our activity so contracted , it behooves us to exert ourselves to fill it up , to the utmost , with acts of public utility , especially in promoting the interests of the Redeemer . Dr. Manning , as all his writings show , considered piety as the first and indispensable requisite in a minister . No degree of genius or of mental cultivation was allowed by him to compensate for the want of a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit , and moved to undertake the care of souls by the constraining love of Christ . He believed , never- /z/ theless , in an educated ministry . How earnestly he la bored to secure this for the churches more especially of his own denomination , the College of Rhode Island and the Warren Association are perpetual witnesses . In these letters to Thomas Mackaness and Dr. Evans we have an illustration of his philanthropic efforts to enlighten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rising generation in that then remote wilderness ; and this , too , when " overwhelmed , " as he expresses it , with his own cares and duties . For a fuller development of his plans with reference to Kentucky , the reader is referred to a letter addressed to the Rev. Dr. Rippon , and dated July 22 . Three years later we find Manning , according to Benedict , corresponding with the Baptists in Virginia , and encouraging them , through their established organizations , to found a seminary of learning for the special benefit of their rapidly-increasing numbers in that section of the country . During the year 1784 Dr. Manning , it appears , addressed a letter to the Hon. Granville Sharp , LL.D. , of London , a zealous member of the Established Church , but liberal to Protestant Dissenters of all classes , and noted for his opposition to the American war . He was also distin guished for his opposition to negro slavery , and for the zeal with which he engaged in various patriotic and phil anthropic movements . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college library , with a set of the works of his grandfather , Dr. John Sharp , Archbishop of York . He subsequently sent other valuable presents to the library . The following letter was written in re ply to Manning : /z/ OLD JEWRY , LONDON , 21st - Feb. , 1785. /z/ On the 22d ult . I received your obliging letter of the 12th October , 1784 , by the hands of Mr. Drowne , who seems highly worthy of the ex cellent character you gave me of him . My best thanks are due to you for the satisfactory intelligence of the safe arrival of the books which I sent for the library of the college in Providence , and also for your full and explicit account of that very use ful institution . Some additions have been made , I believe , to my tracts on Congrega tional Courts since I sent the copies of them by Mr. Watson ; and there fore I have now sent another copy for the college library , and one for yourself ; though indeed the tract is still incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had leisure to revise and correct the index that has been made for it by a person whom I employed for that purpose some time ago . Two of the additional tracts relate to the laying out of settlements on un cultivated lands , a subject of very important consideration to America ; for if care is not taken in these early timcsi before land becomes scarce , to reserve a due proportion of cottage-land , and common-land around every town , as well as around new settlements , for the accommodation of poor industrious families , and also small portions of land for the main tenance of schools and other public establishments , it will be very difficult , a few years hence , to procure land for such purposes . A well-regulated agrarian law would also be exceedingly beneficial to America to prevent monopolies of land ; for when large tracts of land are engrossed in a few hands , it necessarily occasions not only internal weakness , and an inability to defend a country against foreign invaders , but it also inevitably reduces to slavery the industrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overgrown landholders ; for this is the very foundation of the detestable aristocratical oppression and monarchial despotism in Russia , Poland , Bohemia , Germany , France , and all other countries under the unmerciful dominion of the two beasts of tyranny , which are now preparing themselves for a speedy retribution of the divine vengeance ! A mediocrity in the proportion of landed possessions in the hands of freeholders , together with an ample provision of cottage-lands for the la boring poor , and common-lands for all other housekeepers , will certainly be most beneficial for every community ; and such mediocrity of landed /z/ possessions may be gradually obtained , without injury to the rights of the present possessors , by restraining inheritances to an equal distribu tion in gavel-kind amongst all the sons of landholders ; or , if the first born is to be allowed a preference , it should be only to the amount of a certain limited number of acres ( as many as shall be deemed a reasonable competence for an independent gentleman ) , and the overplus to be divided amongst the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competence of landed inheritance , unless the remainder of the land be otherwise legally disposed of , by the will and testament of the late pos sessor . The inheritances of heiresses should also be subject to the same limita tions ; so that if the husband has the legal competence of land already in his own right , the mother s estate should be reserved for the eldest son ; but to be held by the latter , when of age , no longer than during his father s life ; with an option , however , to give up either his father s or mother s inheritance to the younger children . By this means the over grown possessions would be soon reduced to reasonable competences , and the number of substantial , independent landholders would be greatly increased , for the general security of the country , wherever such regula tions shall take place . This would set bounds to the insatiable thirst of realizing , which prompts some thrifty men to " lay house to house and field to field ; " for they would be compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more beneficial mode of employing their superfluous wealth , and the most avaricious of them would undoubtedly be induced to em ploy it in trade , which would greatly promote the extension of commerce , and consequently the welfare of the whole community . I have enclosed a copy of a letter which I wrote to a friend of the Abbe de Mably , to show tha t the defects which he observed in some of the American con stitutions would be effectually remedied by the ancient system of Frankpledge ( as described in my last work ) , which was manifestly the polity of the commonwealth of Israel whilst under the theocracy ; for the same arrangement of the people into exact numerical divisions of tithings , hundreds , and thousands , were then ordained as a part of their political constitutions , though it was even at that time too frequently neglected ; whereby the people fell into confusion and anarchy , and " every man did what seemed right in his own eyes . " But this was not occasioned by any defect in the constitution itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of no other method but this , if duly maintained by annual renewal , whereby liberty , equal right , and national security can be so effectually supported . /z/ Probably what I have written concerning the popular right of electing bishops ( see tract No. 5 ) may seem superfluous , as well to yourself as to some other learned professors of divinity , who have not been educated in an Episcopal Church ; nevertheless , it is a subject worthy your consid eration , especially as it will be found that the most important objections that have usually been made by Protestant Dissenters to the order of bishops , would be effectually removed by the restoration of popular right in the election of them ; and that all danger of tumults in such elections would be obviated by electing two of the most eminent presbyters , of un impeachable morality and virtue , whose appointment to the dignity should be decided by lot , after solemn prayer by the whole congregation , according to the apostolic example related in Acts i. 15-26 . I remain , . with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedient , humble servant , /z/ To this letter Manning replies : PROVIDENCE , STATE OP RHODE ISLAND , July 26 , 1785. /z/ In May last , just before I left Providence for New York and Philadel phia , I received by the ship London your most acceptable letters of Feb. 21 , 22 , as also the copy of your letter to a friend of the Abbe de Mably , dated Dec. 30 , 1784 , and your letter of March 4 , 1785 , together with the two copies of your last work on Congregational Courts . As the Hope had a long passage , I received the letters and books by the London first , but the duplicates by the Hope came safe . I have complied and shall comply literally with your desire of making them public . Your letter re lating to ecclesiastical matters , after perusal , I communicated to my min istering brethren of the Episcopal Church in my vicinity , who took a copy of it . I then took it to New York and communicated it to some of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rector , who desired lib erty to copy it , which I granted him , withal requesting him to communi cate it to his brethren . He proposed doing so , and laying it before the convention of the Episcopal clergy of Virginia and New York inclusive , to meet in September next at the city of Philadelphia . Two weeks since , I received from General Knox , via Boston , Archbishop Sharp s Sermons and Works , in seven volumes , with two volumes of Sharp on Congrega tional Courts . The General informed me that by some accident they had /z/ been wet . This had marred the beauty of the binding , but had not in jured the print . No letter accompanied them , but I presume they were designed for the library , where I shall place them . The kind attention of Mr. Sharp to this college has laid me and the friends of it under great obligations , which I beg leave most heartily to acknowledge , by returning him , as well in behalf of the college as myself , our united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s works , whenever they may arrive . Your treatise on Frank-pledge , with that on Congrega tional Courts , I handed to the Hon. Messrs . Howell and Ellery , mem bers of Congress for this State ; but they had fixed upon the plan of lay ing out the back lands before my arrival . As I was pleased with your ideas on that subject , I strongly recommended to them an examination , and an adoption of your plan where it would be an improvement upon theirs . I mean by this opportunity to furnish you with their publication on this subject , if I can procure it . I thank you for the interest you feel in the welfare and future happiness of America , and for your generous and benevolent exertions to promote the same . These exertions I doubt not Avill meet a due reward from the supreme Judge and Rewarder of merit . Your publications are highly approved by the gentlemen of my acquaintance . To point out an inadequate mode of defending the rights without laying a foundation for subverting the liberties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desideratum of government , and I have yet seen noth ing which promises fairer to accomplish this than your scheme , a part of which , at least , I expect will be adopted by the United States . I concur with you in sentiment exactly concerning the importance of a mediocrity in the proportion of landed possessions in the hands of free holders . It is the real strength of a nation , and most agreeable to the dictates of reason and the rights of man . In New England a system was adopted when the country was first settled , which remains in full vigor to this day ; so that it is hard to find many here in the extremes of poverty or wealth . It was this spirit which , in the last war , captivated British armies , or repelled them from their borders , as it is calculated to dis seminate knowledge and the love of liberty throughout the whole commu nity . Many if not most of the States have enacted laws by which the es tates of those who die intestate shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female , or at most give the oldest son but two shares . In consequence of this many people make no other will , but appoint executors to execute that which the law has made for them . This is a guard against the danger arising from overgrown estates , as /z/ many who devise them by will or otherwise conform , nearly , to what the law points out as equitble . This renders an agrarian law in a measure unnecessary . For your friendship and assistance afforded Mr. Drowne , I thank you , and shall be happy , in my turn , to testify my readiness to repay the kind ness . I have the pleasure to inform you that the college at Providence daily increases in reputation and number of students . Some valuable though small additions have been lately made to our library , which con sists now of upwards of two thousand volumes . The prospects from this country of augmenting our funds , so as to establish an adequate number of professors , from the decay of trade and the scarcity of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous benefactors may yet arise and obviate this difficulty . I have the pleasure to inform you that there is an evident alteration for the better in the morals of the people throughout this country . Religion too begins again to raise her drooping head ; and what affords me peculiar satisfaction is , that a spirit of moderation prevails beyond what has been known since the first settlement of New England . The various denomi nations of Christians are cultivating a spirit of brotherly love by an un reserved intercourse with each other . Among the many mischievous con sequences resulting from the late war , we are happy to find that the prevalence of a spirit of toleration , and a more general knowledge of the doctrine of religious liberty , in some measure counterbalance them . That you may long live to promote the great interests of mankind by your shining abilities and indefatigable labors , and have the happiness to sec the good effects of them on society , and at last be admitted to receive an ample reward of all your labors in the regions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your sincere friend and very humble servant , /z/ PROVIDENCE , July 22 , 1785. /z/ Yours of Dec. 24 , 1784 , came to hand last month , together with the pamphlet occasioned by the death of that eminent man , Dr. Gifford , for which please accept my best thanks . That of Feb. 23 , 1785 , came by the Hope , together with the acceptable presents of Deacon Shepherd and Rev. /z/ John Ryland , for which , in the name of the college , please to present them my most cordial thanks . This should have been done by the cor poration , had a meeting of that body been held since . I am greatly pleased , as well as instructed , by both those valuable works , though my attention has been of late so much taken up in other ways that I can command but little time for reading . With you I regret your want of timely information of the catalogue of books sent for the college ; and I make no doubt of your being both able and willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had I been then as well acquainted with your character as I have been since , I should have addressed you on that subject . " We did then , as we thought , the best we could do ; but my expectations were disappointed , I confess , in the price of the books . Should we ever be so fortunate as to have more money to lay out in that way , which I sec but little prospect of , we shall take the Hbcrty to solicit Mr. Rippon s assistance . I am pleased to hear that Dr. Gill s Exposition is to be completed . Many of them arc now wanted ; but the difficulty of making remittances from New England , and the inconceivable scarcity of cash , have almost put an end to business . New channels of trade will probably soon open , but not , I fear , before many of our mercantile people are ruined . I rejoice to hear that the cause of religion is on the advance in your churches , and that our denomination increases in some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of con siderable additions to two of our churches in the city . And though stupidity greatly prevails in general , we still have some agreeable revivals in different parts on this continent . The wilderness of Vermont still continues to blossom as the rose . New York and the east ern part of New Jersey are blessed with a joyful harvest . My Brother Gano appears to be the principal instrument whom God honors in that city , so lately filled with violence . Three of his own children are in the number of converts ; and if I augur rightly , one of his sons , a doctor , 1 i The Rev. Stephen Gano , M.D. He was born in the city of New York , Dec. 25 , 1762 , being the third son of the Rev. John Gano . At the age of thirteen he was placed under the care of his maternal uncle , Dr. Stites , to be educated for the medical profession . Having made honorable proficiency in his studies , he received an appointment as surgeon in the army , and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . His mother , who had been the principal agent in procuring for him the appointment , having buckled on his regimentals , said to him as they parted , concealing her tears , " My son , may God preserve your life and your patriotism ; the one may be sacrificed iu retaking and pre- /z/ must preach Christ to others . Upwards of forty have been lately added , and the work , by late information , is on the increase . Grace reigns also in several places in New England . Some drops have , in mercy , fallen on Providence . Three I baptized Lord s Day sennight . Public worship is better attended than since the war , in our meeting . I should be happy to receive a letter from Mr. Rippon on spiritual things , but business , at proper times , calls for our attention . I thank you for your kind attention to Mr. Drowne , as he is modest to an excess . And since you can not com mand , or at least make use of the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substituting in their place those of a ship ? I would engage that you should have the fervent prayers of many of your American friends for a safe and speedy passage , and a most kindly welcome to these western shores ; and ivithal I have prepared you a lodging , which ( as a minister once said of his bed ) , if homely , is a sincere one . I am confident no house in your capital would please me better than Mr. Rippon s , should I ever be permitted to visit your country ; nor should any be preferred to it as a home ; but I almost give over the expectations of seeing my English serving the home of your childhood ; but let me never hear that you have for feited the birthright of a freeman . " He continued in the service two years , and then retired to settle as a physician in Tappan , now Orangetown , New York . Soon after his conversion he was impressed with the idea that it was his duty to preach the gospel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , his father and President Manning participating in the exercises of the occasion . This was on the 2d of August , 1786 . He at once engaged in mis sionary labors on the Hudson , and wherever he went his preaching awakened a deep interest . He was successively pastor of the Baptist church at Ilillsdale and at Hudson . In 1792 he received an invitation to become the pastor of the Baptist church in Providence , which invitation he accepted . Some members of the society , it is understood , at first objected to his being the pastor of a church whose relations with the college were so intimate , on the ground that he had never himself received a collegiate education . These objections , however , were soon removed , and the most cordial and friendly relations were established be tween himself and his people . Here he continued during the remainder of his useful life . He died on the 18th of August , 1828 , in the sixty - seventh year of his age , greatly beloved and respected throughout the entire community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city bells , and the children who were assembled in the several schools were dismissed , out of respect to his memory . His funeral was attended by an immense concourse of people , and a sermon appropriate to the occasion was preached by the Kev . Dr. Sharp , of Boston . During his pastorate of thirty-eight years Dr. Gano was permitted to witness /z/ brethren till I meet them above , the prospect of which often gives me pleasure . There I hope to see and converse with the whole family at home , without the aid or necessity of pen and ink . In the mean time I feel my obligations to diligence in the business of my holy calling , that I may be found ready . The college still increases , though gradually . Our number is thirtyseven ; one of whom , I hope , has been called by grace . Last week we buried our venerable chancellor , Stephen Hopkins , Esq. , LL.D , for many years Governor of the Colony , and one of those distinguished worthies who composed the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country has reared . At the first meeting of the corporation he was chosen chancellor , and continued in the office till his death . In him the college has lost a most valuable member and officer , and I myself a particular friend . Mr. Van Horn has obtained something for the college by his so licitations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey , in which business he is still employed . I carried in May last an application to Congress , by a memo rial , etc. , for compensation for the rents and damages done the college by many signal manifestations of the divine power and presence . In one year he baptized one hundred and forty-seven converts , swelling the number of church communicants to six hundred and forty-eight . As an evidence of his general usefulness , it may be mentioned , that for nineteen consecutive years he pre sided as moderator at the meetings of the Warren Association . " Be had , " says the Rev. Dr. Jackson , " a line , commanding figure , being more than six feet in stature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonorous , and altogether agreeable . His manner was perfectly artless and unstudied . He had great command of language , and could speak with fluency and appropriateness , with little or no premeditation . His discourses were eminently experimental . " Dr. Gano was married on the 25th of October , 1782 , to Cornelia , daughter of Capt . Josiah Vavasor , of the city of New York . By her he had two sons and two daughters . On the 4th of August , 1789 , he was a second time married to Polly , daughter of Col. Tallmadge , of New York . By this marriage there were also four children , three daughters and one son . His third wife was Mary , daughter of Hon. Joseph Brown , by whom he had one daughter , Mrs. Eliza B. Rogers . In 1801 he was married to Mrs. Joanna Latting , of Ilillsdale , N. Y. , who survived him many years . Of his six daughters , four have married clergy men ; namely , the Rev. John Ilolroyd , the Rev. Peter Ludlow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson . Dr. Gano was an honored and useful member of the Masonic fraternity , having been initiated in Mount Vernon Lodge , Prov idence , on the 10th of July , 1801 . Twenty-five years afterwards ( Jan. 5 , 1826 ) , he , in company with the late Right Rev. Bishop Griswold , took the Knight Tem plar s degree in the Providence Encampment . /z/ the troops during the war , but have as yet got nothing done . The papers were read and a committee appointed while I was there , before whom we had a hearing , and their promise of a speedy report ; but I fear little is to be expected from that quarter . In the new settlement of Kentucky , five hundred miles down the Ohio below Fort Pitt , I am credibly informed that there are upwards of thirty thousand inhabitants , amongst whom are seven Baptist churches and eight ministers ; that the people incline much to be of our denomination ; that the ministers are not only very illiterate , but that there is not a person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that they have a desire to enjoy the means of education , more es pecially as the Presbyterians , though greatly inferior in numbers , and later on the ground , appear to be maneuvering to avail themselves of advantages from being first in promoting literature in that quarter . I conjectured this from reading a pamphlet , written by one of that society , giving an account of the first settlement of that country . Accordingly I wrote my thoughts on the subject to our Western ministers , withal re questing them to possess themselves of the best information they could get before the next Association at Philadelphia to be held in October , that some thing might be done to encourage them . Since then I am informed that they propose establishing an association there this year . With a view to assist them , I have proposed the raising of a small library , of such books as may be more immediately serviceable to the ministers , and those who arc candidates for the ministry , and am using my endeavors to procure what books I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the con tributions will be small , I greatly wish for the assistance of our English friends . The proposal is to forward the books to the Rev. Thomas Ustick , Baptist minister in Philadelphia , to be forwarded by the first good opportunity ; that a book shall be kept in which the names of the contributors shall be enrolled , with an account of their donations , that posterity may know what exertions were made , and by whom , to propa gate knowledge and religion in that wilderness . I mean to have this library under such regulations as that it may form the basis of a literary institution there . Those of our ministers who are able , by contributing their works , would greatly assist in laying this foundation ; and I doubt not that posterity will rise up and call them blessed . If you think well of this proposal , I doubt not but you will be willing to lend your influence to carry it into effect . I mean not only to propose , but , accord ing to my ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as /z/ possible , an academy amongst them , in which I have some prospect of succeeding . As I shall not write on this subject to any but Mr. Evans and yourself , I would thank you to mention it where and to whom you think proper . Those Bibles and religious books printed by societies to be distributed among the poor , would be well bestowed there at present . I shall be happy on all occasions and by every opportunity to receive a line from Mr. Eippon . With sentiments of esteem , I am yours , in Jesus , /z/ Dr. Manning s brief eulogium upon his " particular friend " Governor Hopkins , the first chancellor of the college , was well deserved . This great and good man closed his long , honorable , and useful life on the loth of July , 1785 , in the seventy-ninth year of his age . " From the vigor of his understanding , and the intuitive energy of his mind , he had established , " says his biographer , " a character not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the walks of literature . Possessing a commanding genius , his constant and assiduous application in the pur suit of knowledge eminently distinguished him in the first class of literati . A leading and active promoter of literary and scientific intelligence , he attached himself in early youth to the study of books and men , and continued to be a constant and improving reader , a close and careful observer , until the period of his death . Holding all abridgments and abridgers in very low estimation , it is cited , in exemplification of his habitual deep research , and the indefatigability with which he penetrated the recesses , instead of skimming the surface of things , that instead of depending upon summaries and concentrated authorities , he perseveringly perused the whole of the great collection of ancient and modern history , compiled about half a cen tury ago , by some distinguished scholars in Europe ; and /z/ that he also read through all of Thurloe s and other pon derous collections of state papers . " Governor Hopkins professed the principles of the society of Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant . He was a . firm believer in the Christian religion , but not big oted in his belief , treating all societies of religious people with respect . As we have before stated , he was a warm friend of the college , and Libored zealously to promote its interests . The following brief letter from the Rev. Dr. Evans , conveys the pleasing intelligence that the books , to which allusion has already been made , had been voted to the college by the Bristol Education Society : BRISTOL , Sept. 5 , 1785. /z/ I take this opportunity , by my worthy young friend Mr. Waldo , of in forming you that at our late annual meeting of the Education Society here , Aug. 24 , I obtained a vote in favor of your college , respecting the many valuable books we have to dispose of , and am empowered to send such as I may approve of . I shall take an early opportunity of doing this , and when received shall hope for the favor of a line from you . I have also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my worthy colleage , the Eev . James Newton , a gentleman whose sound learning and amiable character will do more honor to the title than the title will do to him . He is totally ignorant of this application , nor should I have made it but that it hurt me to think so worthy a man should appear to be neg lected , whilst Mr. Hall and myself , who are connected with him in the academy , and esteem it sufficient honor to be his equals , are , each of us graduated . And by a late regulation our names will all appear very con spicuously in our Museum . I write this in haste , and remain , with every wish friendship can dic tate for the happiness of you and all your extensive connections , dear sir , your affectionate Friend and brother , /z/ This donation consisting of Walton s Biblio Sacra Polyglotta with CastelPs Lexicon , in 8 vols. folio ; Bayle s Dictionary , 5 vols. folio ; Chambers Cyclopaedia , 2 vols. folio ; several Fathers of the church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received early the following year . Such evidences of kind feeling on the part of those with whom this country had so recently been at war , must have been highly gratifying at the time , as they most certainly are even at the present day . This society was founded in the year 1780 , in aid of the Baptist Academy at Bristol , " to the end that dissenting con gregations , especially of the Baptist denomination , in any part of the British dominions , may be more effectually supplied with a succession of able and evangelical minis ters .

It is imagined that your intimacy and interest with the committee ap pointed to report on our petition , will enable you , before the report is /z/ made , to discover what will be the tenor of it .

These I have to dispose of at 1 16s . The subscription price was 4 10s. , or 15s. each volume . Also some few sets of the Doctor s tracts , collected together and printed in three volumes qiiarto , with memoirs of his life , at 1 16s. , or 12s. each volume . Also his Cause of God and Truth , and his Exposition of Solomon s Song , at 12s. each volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament . As I wish to promote the sale of the Doc tor s works in America , on that account I have charged them at a low price , when the discount proposed is considered . A line directed for me to be left at Mr. Ash s , bookseller , No. 15 Little Tower Street , will be con veyed to me . I am , reverend sir , with all due respect , Your humble servant , /z/ PROVIDENCE , July 9 , 1784 . SIR : Yours of March 13 reached me the last month . I had be fore heard of the death of Mr. George Keith , and sympathize with you and the family in the loss . I had no knowledge of a balance due to him till I received your letter , as I had many years ago given orders to a friend of mine , whom I have not since seen , to pay the balance , if any remained due . By this conveyance goes a letter from Mr. Backus to Mr. Henry Kane , executor to Mr. Wallin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my account , as he had money in Mr. Wallin s hands . If you will please call on him he will doubtless discharge the debt . Of this please to advise me by the first opportunity . I shall be extremely sorry if the edition of Dr. Gill s Bible in quarto can not be completed , as I had sold my former set , in full confidence that I should soon be able to replace mine from this edition . Others here wish to purchase , but they also wish to have the work complete . They especially wish for his Exposition of the Prophets . Would it not be better for your family to complete the /z/ work , than to lose in a great measure the sale of what is already done , and deprive the world of such a valuable treasure ? I have on hand some of all the rest of his works you mention ; besides , at present it is ex tremely difficult to make remittances to England , as the mercantile affairs of the country have been so long and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inattention , in general , to reading books on religious subjects , the natural consequence , perhaps , of such a kind of war as that in which we have been involved . This , it is to be hoped , will soon alter for the better , when I shall watch every opportunity of making Dr. Gill s works as much known as possible . This I have hitherto ever had in view , and it was no inconsiderable motive in parting with his Exposition , above mentioned . I was lately desired to inquire whether those editions com plete could be obtained in England , by a gentleman who wishes to pur chase them . The state of religion amongst our denomination in America appears rather on the gaining hand , as there arc revivals in many of the churches . The college , too , although greatly injured by the war , prom ises soon to regain its former state . The government of it , through the smallncss of its funds and the great repairs necessary , find themselves amazingly embarrassed , and consequently wish for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . I am , sir , Your friend and servant , /z/ LONDON , Oct. 14 , 1784 . SIR : I received yours in the month of August last . Have applied to Mr. Kane , Mr. Walliu s executor , who informs me that he has no money in hand for Mr. Backus . Mr. Backus sent seventy copies of his History of the Baptists , which never came to the late Mr. Wallin . Mr. Kane intends to acquaint Mr. Backus of his disappointment . I am much obliged to you , sir , for the great regard and kind intentions expressed in your letter of promoting the sale of Dr. Gill s works among your friends . I have now the pleasure to inform you that the quarto edition of the Old Testament will be completed . It is now in the press , and will be finished with all convenient speed . What was contained in my former letter is now set aside , not having any of the Old Testament to sell at the price therein mentioned . What I have will now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of the folio edition at ten guineas , and also a set of the Prophets at two guineas . I shall be glad to hear that religion is in a flourishing state among you , that the churches of Christ /z/ are increasing , , and that yon , sir , may again see that seminary of learning over which you have the honor to preside retrieve its former state , and be attended with all the success and usefulness desirable . I am , sir , with great esteem , Your obliged , humble servant , /z/ PROVIDENCE , July 24 , 1785. /z/ Yours of Oct. 14 , 1784 , came to hand in May , since which I have had no opportunity of sending you an answer . Soon after the reception of it I saw Mr. Backus , who had received the information you mention respect ing his books , but informed me that he expected still to obtain them , by getting information of the captain who carried them ; but should he be disappointed in his expectations , he had sent a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net proceeds of which he had ordered " you paid , so that I expect , by or before the arrival of this , your money will be ready for you . He engaged to write you that you might know on whom to call . I am sorry for the disappointment , but hope your money is safe . I am rejoiced to hear that the Doctor s Old Testament is to be completed , and you may be assured that what little influence I pos sess shall be employed in the sale of his works . But such at present is the scarcity of money , and difficulty of making remittances to Great Britain , by the high price of bills , that business is almost entirely stag nated . We hope , however , for better times . I thank you for your kind expressions of regard for the college with which I am connected . Great indeed have been the damages which it sustained by the war , for which hitherto we have received no compensation ; nor are our prospects of it in future very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to nourish , and the number of students increases as fast as might be rea sonably expected . Religion too begins amongst us to hold up its head . In several parts there are great revivals , some account of which I nave mentioned to Mr. Rippon in a letter of this date . Should my expectations of discharging that balance , through Mr. Backus , be again disappointed , upon advice from you I will take measures which will prove effectual to accomplish it . With sentiments of esteem , I am , sir , Your humble servant , /z/ LONDON , March 28 , 1786. /z/ A letter of yours , dated July 24 , 1785 , was not received by me until about the middle of December . I should be glad when favored with another letter from you , to be informed by whom it was conveyed to me , as no name was mentioned to whom I might apply for the small sum you expected to be paid me by some person in London . I am surprised to find Mr. Backus has not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baptists . Last summer a Mr. Thomas saw a sheet of his History brought into a house where he was , wrapped around a pound of cheese or butter . Mr. Thomas went immediately and purchased all the paper relating to that History the cheese-monger had ; since which I am informed he has received the second volume , and now makes complete sets . Whether this is done for his own emolument , or whether he intends it for Mr. Backus s advantage , I can not tell . Honor and justice seem to decide it in favor of Mr. Backus . But as I have no acquaintance with Mr. Thomas , I can say no further about it . I am sorry to inform you that the printer who had engaged to finish the Exposition has failed and left London . There is now no hope of its being completed . The six volumes of the Old Testament , reaching as far as the 132d Psalm , may now be had at 1 16s. , which I think was men tioned to you in a former letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall allow you twenty per cent , for your trouble . I remain , sir , with all due respect , Your humble servant , /z/ On the back of this letter Mr. Manning has written " answered .

MANNING is now to be exhibited in a new charac ter and in new relations . Hitherto , says Prof. Goddard , we have seen him ministering at the altar , or dispensing /z/ the oracles of wisdom amid the shades of the academy . We are now to note his career as a patriot statesman . The articles of confederation adopted by the United States in 1781 , proved , as is well known , utterly inade quate to the purposes of government . Commercial em barrassments multiplied ; the public credit was impaired ; and the great interests of the nation , nay even the whole political fabric , was threatened with destruction . At this crisis of depression and alarm , Dr. Manning was , by a unanimous resolution of the General Assembly , appointed , at its March session in 1786 , to represent Rhode Island in the Congress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is thus told by the Hon. Asher Bobbins , in a letter to Prof. Goddard , which we find in his memoir of Manning . " Though he had other merits and ample for this appointment of del egate , I have no doubt the dignity and grace for which he was so remark able smoothed the way to it . It took place in this wise : There was a vacancy in the delegation , and the General Assembly , who were to fill it , were sitting in Providence . No one in particular had been proposed or talked of . One afternoon Dr. Manning went to the State House , to look in upon the Assembly and sec what was doing . His motive was curi osity merely . On bis appearance there , he was introduced on the floor , and accommodated with a seat . Shortly after , Commodore Hopkins , who was then a member , rose and nominated President Manning as a delegate to Congress , and thereupon he was appointed , and , according to my recollection , unanimously . I recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of his brother , Governor Hopkins , where I shortly after met with him ) that the idea never entered his head till he saw the President enter and take his seat on the floor of the Assembly ; and that the thought immediately struck him that he would make a very fit member for that august body , the Continental Congress . " Congress under the old confederation sat , as you know , in conclave ; no report of their debates was published . How far Mr. Manning mingled in them , therefore , I can not say . I recollect his speaking of one in /z/ which he participated ( the subject I have forgotten ) , on account of a per sonal controversy to which it gave rise between him and a fiery young man , a delegate from Georgia , by the name , as I think , of Houston . This young man in his speech had reflected upon New England and her people . Mr. Manning repelled the attack , and , by way of offset , drew a picture of Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in his passion he threatened personal violence . The next day he appeared in Congress with a sword by his side . This produced , at once , a sensa tion in that body , the symptoms of which were so alarming that he thought proper to withdraw , take off his sword , and send it home by his servant . In the course of the day he took an opportunity to meet with Mr. Manning , and to make him an apology . " He must have given himself much to business then , as he seemed to be master of all the important questions which had been debated , and could give the arguments , pro and con , offered by the different speakers . " The famous Dr. Johnson of Connecticut was a member at the same time , with whom Mr. Manning became intimate , and of whom he always spoke with admiration . The Doctor once paid him the compliment of holding the pen of a ready writer , which Mr. Manning very highly val ued as coming from such a man . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee , of which both were members , and which re port the Doctor professed to be much pleased with . " Dr. Manning at first pleaded his connection with the college as a sufficient reason for declining his appoint ment ; but many of the corporation were gentlemen of high political standing , who , regarding the interests of the institution as involved in the character and reputation of the State and the course of public measures , advised him to take his seat , and designate a suitable person to preside in his absence . Accordingly , at a special meeting of the Trustees and Fellows held at his house , March 13 , his request for absence was granted , and the Rev. Perez Fobes , LL.D. , pastor of the Congregational church and society in Raynham , Mass. , was appointed to take charge of the institution from June 1 to Sept. 1 , as Vice Pres- /z/ ident . Mr. Fobes was a graduate of Harvard College , in the class of 17 G2 . He accepted the appointment , and discharged the duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be added , he was ap pointed Professor of Natural Philosophy , which position he occupied twelve years , coming in from Raynham once or twice a week , during portions of the year , to deliver lectures . In 1795 he was elected one of the Fellows of the college . The following letter to his friend the Rev. Dr. Rippon , gives the reasons more especially which induced Dr. Manning to accept this appointment , and also his views in regard to entering the political arena . The interests of the college , it will be observed , in this as in all other matters , were uppermost in his mind . PROVIDENCE , April 7 , 1786. /z/ Yours of June 22 , 1785 , came to hand too late to comply with your re quest relative to Mr. Dunscombe , as it did not reach me till November . He is on my list for the honors of the college next Commencement . Of Mr. Booth s merit I am fully conscious ; but what apology shall I make to him for not informing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferred on him before the late war , and that he stands on our printed catalogue graduated in 1774 ? Some difficulties respecting making out diplomas for him and for a number of gentlemen in England delayed it till the late confusion commenced , which totally deranged the affairs of the college , and effaced the memory of it till of late , especially as our secre tary had omitted entering the graduations on the records . This but lately came to my knowledge . The multiplicity of cares which divide my at tention and engross all my time , together with the above , is the best ex cuse I can make . By Dr. Gordon I now send him this feather , as a token of our respect for his great merit . This , with a letter to him , and letters and diplomas to several other gentlemen graduated before the war , I take the liberty to enclose to you , and beg of you to forward them the first good conveyance . During the late war we have been so tremblingly alive , that /z/ we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this at least they may be assured , that they were not treated designedly with neglect . Pray , don t be alarmed should you hear that I am in Congress . The motive of my accepting this most unexpected , unsolicited , but unanimous appointment of the State to that office , was the recovery of a considerable sum due to the college , for the use taken of the edifice , and the damage done to it by the public in the late war . It was thought by those most acquainted with the state of our application to that honorable body , that my presence would facilitate that grant ; more especially as none of the persons likely to be elected would greatly interest themselves in that business . My appointment is only from our late session till next No vember , when I mean to relinquish the office , as in general I always con sidered politics out of my province . Accordingly I have interdicted my name being mentioned in the next nominating . Both the college and the congregation are , I hope , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out for a minister . I ever declined the pastoral care of the church as quite incompatible with my engagements to the col lege , though I have preached , administered ordinances , visited the sick , attended funerals , etc. , for the last fifteen years , without assistance . Con vinced that I can not hold that place with advantage to them and hold the Presidency of the college , I have strongly recommended to them to obtain if possible a minister , and they are now looking out for one . But there is little probability of their finding the man soon on this continent . A man of letters , politeness , strict piety and orthodoxy , of popular talents , pos sessed of a good share of human prudence , and no bigot , in a word , a truly Christian orator is the man they want . Should any of our English brethren of this description incline to visit America , I wish him to take Providence in his way . And should he like the people , and the people him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is large and composed of some of the most wealthy men and first characters in the State . Pray , have you no Mr. Eippons , Booths , Evanses , etc. , to spare from your side of the water ? I should for one be very happy to see them on our American shores . The number of students in college is about fifty , and our prospects would be flattering were it not for the scarcity *of money in this country , which embarrasses all kinds of business . A fund to educate pious youth of our denomination is what I have long wished for , but have not yet been able to accomplish . Several hopeful youth for want of this are de nied an education , who promised fair to have been ornaments to the min- /z/ istiy . The state of religion , except in Boston , Newport , and in Vermont , is not very flourishing . With sentiments of esteem , I am , sir , Your assured friend and humble servant , /z/ P. S. Some drops of mercy have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Drowne requested me to mention to you that the gentlemen who appraised the loss he sustained by the bad package of the medicines he received from Mr. Pine , are noted apothecaries , and men to be trusted . Such , indeed , I esteem them ; and have every reason to think the Doctor took the utmost pains to render the loss as small as pos sible . In justice I think myself bound to say this . The letter herewith enclosed from Mr. Nathaniel Dummer is from one of my particular friends . His wife is a member of our church , and truly an excellent woman . He applied to me to get the information through some of my friends in England . He feared to intrust it to a person in whom I could not place the highest confidence , as he feared he might not get the best information . If it would be compatible with your business to procure the information requested , soon , and transmit it to me directed to New York , and inform me what the expense is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it may cost you , over and above thanking you for your kindness . As the information of Gov . Dummer is thought worthy to be relied on , since he came to America after he was grown up , it is thought highly probable that my friend is the next heir to the estate . Should the information coincide with his wishes , he means imme diately to embark for England to attend to the business . Pray , let me hear by every good opportunity of your welfare . With every wish which the sincerest friendship can dictate for your temporal and eternal felicity , I subscribe myself , Your very unworthy fellow-servant in the gospel of Christ , /z/ " A man of letters , politeness , strict piety and orthodoxy , of popular talents , possessed of a good share of human prudence , and no bigot ; in a word , a truly Christian ora tor , " such is Dr. Manning s brief and expressive de scription of a minister to succeed in the pastorate of the Baptist church at Providence . How unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher and pas tor ! In reference to Manning s appointment to Congress and the consequent vacancy in the church , Mr. Nicholas Brown thus writes to the Rev. Hezekiah Smith , under date of April 2 , 1786 : " You will perhaps think it strange to hear of Mr. Manning s going to Congress , but I reserve giving a full account of this matter , hoping this may have some influence in inducing you to come at the time proposed , when you will hear all . I will only say here , that as the college increases , Mr. Manning urges , and with reason , that he can not possibly attend to the duties of both President and pastor , and that the church has suffered for the want of time on his part to visit , etc . He has therefore recom mended to the church and society to look up a suitable person as his suc cessor , and as the college funds arc not of themselves , in their present state , sufficient for his support , he goes to Congress to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the war The committee before men tioned are not only to obtain supplies in his absence , but to look up a suitable person to take charge of the church as a pastor . You know he must be a man of learning , and prudently popular . The society will en gage such an one a genteel living , etc . Your advice , my dear friend , if nothing more , is absolutely necessary at this juncture . No one , let me add , will be more acceptable , on all accounts , than yourself , as a candidate for this important place . " The following letter to the Rev. Dr. Evans is very sim ilar to the one to Dr. Rippon , and bears the same date . We give it , however , as a part of Manning s correspond ence , omitting a portion to avoid needless repetition . PROVIDENCE , April 7 , 1786. /z/ Some time in November last I received your most acceptable favor of Sept. 5 , forwarded by Mr. Waldo . I am happy to hear that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , empowered you to send such valuable books as they have to dispose of to our college . As you intended sending them by an early opportunity , and as I have heard noth ing on the subject since , I fear they may have fallen into bad hands , or /z/ have been lost at sea . This induces me to write now that you may know they have not arrived . If spared to see another annual meeting of the corporation , at which only we have ever conferred degrees , we shall remember your worthy colleague , the Rev. James Newton , and confer on him the degree of Master in the Arts . Your recommendation of any gentleman for the honors of the col lege will always meet with particular attention . The college consists of upwards of fifty members , and would flourish greatly were it not for the scarcity of money in this country , which ex ceeds description . This scarcity peculiarly affects us . The appropriation of the edifice to public uses during the war was productive of great dam age to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rents , the corporation sent me last year to Congress , with the state of our accounts and claims and sufficient vouchers . We obtained a hearing before a committee ap pointed to report on the subject of the petition , and obtained a favorable report , but lost it before Congress when the report was acted upon . Our late Professor Howell was then a member , and had great influence ; but as he had effectually opposed some continental measures , he thinks the question was lost by that means , together with the small number of the states on the floor . By the articles of the confederation , he is not again eligible for three years ; nor could we find any man , probably , to be chosen , who would deeply interest himself for the college . This induced me , at his earnest importunity , together with his giving the greatest en couragement that a grant might be obtained , to accept the unanimous appointment of our Legislature , at- their late session , as their first delegate in Congress till next November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had considered politics out of my province , and on that ac count had declined a former nomination to that office . The interests of the college lay near my heart , and the necessities of it call aloud for the exertions of all its friends . I thought proper to give you these hints , lest upon hearing of my being in Congress you might think I meant to as sume the political character ; than which , in general , nothing is more remote from my intentions , notwithstanding the great importunity of many of the Legislature for me to continue in the office . I hope the col lege and congregation will be well provided for during my absence , and I do not doubt it from the arrangements made . The state of religion in this country at present is low ; yet our churches in Boston and Newport the last winter and this spring are mercifully vis- /z/ ited , and some drops of mercy have , I trust , fallen upon Providence . With every wish for your happiness , I remain , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISLAND , April 7 , 1786. /z/ Your most acceptable favor of the 25th of March , 1785 , never reached me until November last . I heartily thank you for your translation of Dr. Abadie . I esteem it a masterly performance , and wish it to have a general spread through this country , which , in imitation of the old coun try , is rejecting the ancient gospel . Dr. Chauncey s book in favor of universal salvation , printed in London , has made many proselytes amongst the New England Congregationalists . Mere nominal Christian ministers now begin to show on whose side they are . I am convinced , however , that these trying times are necessary , and will eventually subserve the interests of the Redeemer . False friends are more dangerous to religion than avowed enemies . After a cursory reading of your " Pedobaptism Examined " last spring , I loaned it to my Brother Gano at New York , who at that time had great need of it , and I have never been able to get it since . I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a second edition , without any correc tions except such as the judicious author may see fit to make . It is out of my power to comply with your request to criticize it . Some hints when at New York led me to suspect on whom you animadverted in the note you mention . It grieves me that such fine abilities should be pros tituted in the support of error . Hope he may return to a better way of thinking . You need not fear any discoveries to your disadvantage . I thank you for your attention to my friend Dr. Drowne , Having gained his object in France , he returned last summer , and is now well , and retains a high sense of the favors received in your family . I hope the amiable and worthy Dr. Stennett is recovered , and will yet be spared to do much service to the cause of the Redeemer , in addition to the important service he has already rendered . I rejoice to hear that his son is such a worthy character . I wish he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having served his generation according to the will of God , shall sleep with his fathers . /z/ It is pleasing to hear that the cause of God gains ground in England , and especially in our denomination . Sorry am I to hear of the dissolu tion of two Baptist churches in London . Dr. Gibbons was an intimate acquaintance of rity old President Davies , and through that channel I be came acquainted with his character . I esteemed him a worthy , good man . Some more of Mr. Backus s first volume , he tells me , are found in London . Your letter , accompanying a copy of Dr. Abadie , I forwarded immedi ately to Mr. Stillman , who received it . Our Baptist churches in Boston and Newport have through the winter , and still have , a gracious visit . Considerable additions have been made to them , and the good work continues . I have also good tidings of the same kind from Virginia . Some scattering drops I hope have fallen upon Providence , but the number of late conversions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advising you that the college con ferred on you the degree of Master in the Arts in 1774 1 Directly after Commencement I was called away to the Southern States , and on my re turn the Lord was pleased to pour out his Spirit on the people of my charge in a glorious manner , which engaged both my time and my atten tion till that fatal 19th of April following , when hostilities commenced at Lexington , which cut off all intercourse between the two countries , and so deranged the affairs of the college that it is but lately that I recollected that diplomas had never been sent to you and several other gentlemen graduated upon the recommendation of Mr. Riley , of Northampton . If these excuses , with more somewhat similar , are not sufficient , and I seem really to doubt myself , I must take the blame of neglect on myself , and make the best apology I can by complying with my duty at this late hour . As a testimony of our respect for your merit , be pleased to accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse the omission of giving you timely advice . To one not a resident in America it is hard to conceive into what confusion the war threw us , from which it will not be easy to recover soon . The college , however , is in a more prosperous state than ever , and promises fair to hold a rank amongst literary institu tions in this new world ; but the scarcity of cash greatly embarrasses the college at present , as it is extremely difficult for people of property to raise money to educate their children . I shall be glad to have a letter from Mr. Booth by every opportunity . With every wish for your temporal and eternal felicity which the sincerest friendship can dictate , I remain , dear sir , Yours , in Christ , /z/ The following letter is addressed to the Rev. Dr. Wil liam Gordon , who , it will be remembered , came from Eng land in 1770 , with a letter of introduction to Manning from the Rev. Dr. Stennett ( page 123 ) . He settled in Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica Plain , Roxbury , on the 6th of July , 1772 . When the Revolution commenced , he took a very active part against his native country , and was ap pointed chaplain to the Provincial Congress . He preached .1 Thanksgiving discourse , Dec. 15 , 1774 , which is pub lished in Thornton s " Pulpit of the American Revolu tion . " In 1786 he returned to England , and two years afterwards published , in four octavo volumes , " The His tory of the Rise , Progress , and Establishment of the In dependence of the United States of America , " a candid and impartial work , says Alibone , of which there have been several editions . He died at Ipswich , Oct. 19 , 1807 , aged seventy-seven . Manning it seems cultivated an inti macy with him . In this letter he speaks of a donation of books which Gordon made to the college library . Among them we notice Caryl s Exposition , with Practical Obser vations upon the book of Job , a work in two huge folios , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb playfully says , " What any man can write , surely I may read . " PROVIDENCE , April 13 , 1786. /z/ Yours of the 21st and 27th ult. were long in coming to hand , and the reasons of my delaying to answer them were that I mistook one week in the time set for your sailing , and my having a number of letters to write and several diplomas to get ready to send to some gentlemen in England . All these I have enclosed to Rev. John Rippon , successor to Dr. Gill , who will take care to forward them as directed . I must beg the favor of you to see Mr. Rippon , and deliver them with your own hand . /z/ It was my intention to have seen you myself and brought Mrs. Man ning down , who was exceedingly desirous of it , that we might have had the opportunity of a parting kiss ; but , unfortunately , my horse is dis ordered , and unable to perform the journey . Though denied the pleas ure of one more interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God will favor us with one infinitely more agreeable in a better world . You have my unworthy prayers for your own and your family s safety while on the ocean , and my sincere desires for your and their prosperity in your native country , from whence I shall ever rejoice to receive letters from , you and return the favor . I have been informed that you have been greatly abused in the Boston newspapers . You know that is a talent our neighbors there possess . They arc ingenious to provoke . I am sorry your success in subscriptions is small here ; but such is the scarcity of money that many who wished to be possessors , and amongst the rest your humble servant , were necessitated to forego it .

Fourteen years afterwards ( April 16 , 1800 ) , through the exertions mainly of Mr. John Brown , Congress passed an act entitled , " An Act for the Relief of the Corporation of Rhode Island College .

JAMES MANNING , President . /z/ NEW YORK , 17th May , 1786. /z/ Yours of the 27th ult. came safe to hand , for which I thank you , and should have answered it before* had not my hands been full . Mrs. Man ning informed me of the application to you to be my successor in the meeting at Providence . I should be happy in your society , and should Providence order your lot there , I shall while there contribute my best endeavors to render your life happy , and useful to the people ; but I think it best to interfere as little as may be with their determinations in settling a minister , as I conceive it might lessen my influence in his favor , after his settlement , should they have it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , that I was any means of it . Not that I hereby mean to excuse myself from doing my personal duty in that case , which I hope would be a pleasure . Should you accept of their invitation , your piety , I trust , would more than compensate the defect of politeness , a high degree of which I can not deem primarily essential in a gospel preacher , any more than distinguished rusticity . Habits of easiness in access , and gentle , unaffected manners , are most pleasing in that character . I hope you may have the pleasure to find that your labors at Provi dence are followed with a blessing . The Lord is doing wonders in this city and its vicinity , but especially in the Jerseys , at the Plains , Moun tains , Piscataway , and Cranberry . I attend the June meeting . Mr. Runyan , on Saturday , baptized twelve ; the Sabbatarian minister three . /z/ Great power appeared to attend the preaching . Multitudes appeared deeply affected , aud during the meeting several professed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never seen at Piscataway before . I am told the Thursday following twelve were baptized at Quibbletown , and Lord s Day thirteen at the Plains . There appears a considerable turn in the minds of the people throughout that quarter . Mr. Wilson flames out and is remarkably blessed , and goes on preaching , ex horting , and baptizing from place to place with surprising success . The Lord indeed is doing great things in the land . Of your mother I can give no information , but presume she is living , otherwise Mr. Guthrie or your brother Jeremiah would have told me of her death . My situation here is indeed very awkward , without a col league , without money , and in doubt what to resolve on . Our public affairs wear a cloudy aspect . I hope it is that the interposition of Heaven may be seen in extricating us from difficulty . His former unmerited favor to this guilty land encourages me to hope for it though it should almost be against hope . The savages have begun their barbarous depredations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of that lawless banditti which forms the van of those settlements . It is expected that , on investigation , this will be found true . Many of the innocent must doubt less be involved in ruin in consequence of it . The wretched , deranged finances of the Federal Government , will allow us , if disposed , to afford these people but feeble aid . I am treated with respect by Congress and the heads of departments . The present Congress possess great integrity , and a good share of abili ties ; but for want of more States on the floor the public and important business is from day to day neglected . We are , h6wever , in daily ex pectation of a fuller delegation . If personal matters could be so adjusted that I were not disquieted , I should be very happy in my situation here ; for I commonly preach once or twice on Lord s Days , either in town , on Long or Staten Island , or in the Jerseys . Please to present my best respects to Mrs. Smith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unvarying friend , /z/ Dr. Manning s colleague was Brig. - Gen . Nathan Mil ler , of Warren . To him he thus writes , giving a graphic /z/ description of bis own embarrassed condition for want of funds , and urging him in the present crisis of affairs to take his seat as a delegate , and by his presence and influ ence aid in preventing an impending dissolution of the Federal Government . That Manning fully comprehended the great questions which agitated this Congress of 1786 , and which finally led to a more perfect union of the States , is evident from his correspondence , and from the great interest which he felt and the efforts which he made to secure the adoption of the Constitution of the United States . NEW YORK , 7th of June , 1786. /z/ I think if for a moment you would figure to yourself my situation , alone here for more than a month , reduced to the very last guinea and a trifle of change ( which is the case ) ; my lodging , washing , barber s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not paid ; without the favor of a single line from you ad vising me whether you mean to come or not , or sending forward the one hundred dollars on hand , which you proposed doing from the election if you was not likely to follow me soon , I say if you would but realize my situation , you could not but pity me from your heart . I wrote you long since . I begged an answer from you , one way or another , that I might know what measures to take . But as I am now situated , I can neither stay nor go , except to the new City Hall , if my creditors exact it ; and strangers have no more compassion on me than the State that ap pointed me . I must interest you to forward that sum of one hundred dollars , if no more can be had , by the first opportunity , with a line advis ing me of your real intentions . Matters highly interesting to this Confed eracy , and indeed I think the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Congress , and there are not States suffi cient to transact the necessary business , as we now have barely nine States on the floor . Our affairs are come very much to a point , and if the States continue to neglect keeping up their delegations in Congress , the Federal Government must ipse facto dissolve . I have written the Governor on these subjects , and desired his answer , whether we should keep up our delegation or not . I shall wait till a reasonable time for an answer from you , and quit if I do not receive it . Send me by the post or packets . /z/ Frank your letters by the post . I shall impatiently wait the event , and with sentiments of esteem , I have the honor to be , sir , Your humble servant , /z/ NEW YORK , 12th of June , 1786 . SIR : Yours of 27th ult. came to hand two days ago . Am mortified exceedingly that you have not come forward , nor sent on the money on hand ; for I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not paid . My situation without a colleague , without money , and without any in structions or favorable prospects from government is painful . Rhode Isl and has not many more strides to make to complete her disgrace , and ruin too ; but that is not all . She is likely to hold a distinguished rank amongst the contributors to the ruin of the Federal Government . Never probably was a full delegation of the States more necessary than now , for you may rest assured that in the opinion of every member of Congress , and in the Several departments , things are come to a crisis with the Federal Govern ment . You say you think the present House do not want a Congress ; they may , it is more than probable , very soon see the accomplishment of their wishes ; for without a speedy reform in the policy of the States , the Federal Government must be no more .

With sentiments of esteem , I have the honor to be , sir , Your humble servant , /z/ The following letter from the Rev. Dr. Gordon will be found especially interesting , in view of the author s posi tion as a defender of America on English soil : STOKE NEWINGTON , ENGLAND , Sept. 13 , 1786. /z/ I have appropriated a few of my busy moments to your friendship , on which I set a high value . You will have heard of our safe arrival . The /z/ passage was , blessed be God , good upon the whole , and though longer by a week or two than we could have wished , yet not lengthy . We were in London within six ; weeks , lacking two days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day . Many of our friends and acquaintance , and some of our relations , had been removed ; but we had the pleasure of finding as many still living as we could reasonably expect . I took care to deliver the parcel for Mr. Kippon safely , of which you will probably have received an account before this ai rives . It would have been great pleasure to us to have seen you and Mrs. Man ning before our departure ; but that having been prevented , I trust with you that the grace and mercy of God will favor us with an interview infinitely more agreeable in a better world . I am exceedingly busy upon my History , and when I have finished it shall not be unmindful of your college library . The abuse in the public papers hindered the subscriptions very much . I hope , however , they will be made up in Britain . The beginning of next month I mean to have the proposals circulating ; but am apprehensive that the book will not go to the press so early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely cau tions how I word myself , in speaking of individuals in Britain , lest I should be prosecuted for libelling ; and prudence will require my advising with some gentleman learned in the law , that I may avoid falling into the clutches of the malevolent . You would wonder at the coolness with which I have been treated by several , even of my brethren in the ministry , for the part I took while in America ; this , however , has not made me re pent of engaging on the side of liberty . The Rev. Mr. Martin , of your persuasion , at the Westminster end of the town , was a most bitter enemy to the Americans , and would have rejoiced to have had the promoters and encouragers of the Revolution , whether in civil or sacred orders , hanged as rebels . But Heaven has disappointed and mortified them . They however spit out their venom at times . We are at present with Mrs. Gordon s brother , who is exceedingly friendly . Where we shall settle is wholly uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will direct in much mercy . - Should like to be in the neigh borhood of London , for the benefit of corresponding with my American friends , and doing them any particular service . Such a situation would place me also in the midst of my relations and British acquaintance . These matters , however , must all be submitted to infinite wisdom ; and I desire not to be at my own disposal and direction . /z/ " We have been favored with good health since our arrival . I am con cerned that your State should be so overseen as to make paper money , etc . Such policy will never make you prosper , and instead of preserving will drive away property and plenty from you . The Americans must make all kinds of property secure , or confusion will follow . I am most hearty in wishing them virtuous and honorable , and am therefore pained when anything takes place that is prejudicial to their public character . Mrs. Gordon joins in best regards to self and Mrs. Manning . Remem ber me to Mr. Nicholas Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from you by the first opportunity . Direct to Mr. Field s , Apothe cary , Newgate Street . I remain , Your sincere and affectionate friend , /z/ This year the public exercises of Commencement were resumed . Fifteen young men took their Bachelor s de gree , and among them Nicholas Brown , Jr. , afterwards the distinguished benefactor of the college . He was at this time but seventeen years of age , having entered the Fresh man Class in 1782 , when the college again began to live . Mr. Brown commenced his benefactions in February , 1792 , by presenting to the Trustees and Fellows of the college the sum of five hundred dollars , to be expended in the purchase of law books for the library . This he did , in the language of the letter announcing the donation , " under a deep impression of the generous intentions of my honored father , deceased , towards the college in this town , as well as from my own personal feelings towards the institution , in which I received my education , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular the knowl edge of the laws of our country , under the influence whereof not only our property but our lives and dearest privileges are protected . " In 1804 he presented to the corporation the sum of five thousand dollars , as a founda tion for a professorship of oratory and belles-lettres . It /z/ was on this occasion , in consideration of this donation , and of others that had been received from him and his kindred , that the name of the institution was changed , in accord ance with a provision in its charter , from Rhode Island College to Brown University . In 1822 he erected at his own expense the second college building , which he pre sented to the corporation , in a letter bearing date Jan. 13 , 1823 . At his suggestion it was named " Hope College , " in honor of his only surviving sister , Mrs. Hope Ives . In 1835 he erected the third building , which he also pre sented to the corporation , with a request that it might be named " Manning Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished instructor and revered friend , President Manning . Mr. Brown died Sept. 27 , 1841 , at the age of seventy-two . A discourse commemorative of his charac ter and life was delivered by President Wayland , in the University chapel , which discourse was afterwards pub lished . The entire sum of his recorded benefactions and bequests to the University amounts to one hundred and sixty thousand dollars , assigning to the donations of land and buildings the valuation which was put upon them at the time they were made . " Many years , " says Prof. Gammell , " have now elapsed since he descended to the tomb , but the monuments of his wise and pious benefactions are all around us , in the University with which his name is associated ; in the But ler Hospital for the Insane , and the Providence Athena3iim , to whose founding he so largely contributed ; and in the churches , and colleges , and institutions of philanthropy over the whole land , to which he so often lent his liberal and most timely aid . So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections of men , these enduring /z/ memorials will proclaim his character , and speak his eulogy . Hi sanctissimi testes , hi maximi laudatores . " A few years before his death , at the annual meeting of the corporation in 1835 , Mr. Brown was formally requested to sit for his likeness , which was taken , at full length , by Harding , one of the most celebrated American artists . It now graces the collection 1 of portraits in Rhode Island 1 This collection , to which we have frequently alluded , now comprises twentysix portraits , many of them painted from life . The following list of them may be of interest , perhaps , to some of our readers : /z/ // Alexander , of Newport , in the year 1770. // E. J. Rogers , from an original portrait by Rembrandt Peale. // marble bust of Wayland , executed by Ball , of Boston , is in the college library . // // // /z/ // // // // // // Providence , and for fifty-five years a Fellow of the University . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary with the King . // // // // // Island and of America . // /z/ Hall . The visitor will gaze upon it with renewed interest as successive years roll on . It is greatly to be regretted that the portraits of his worthy sire and ancestors can not be placed by its side . Returning now to our narrative , we learn from the fol lowing extract from a letter addressed by Mr. Nicholas Brown , senior , to the Rev. Dr. Smith , dated Nov. 9 , 1786 , that Dr. Manning resumed his accustomed duties at the college in the beginning of November of that year . The extract is introduced as an illustration , in part , of the dif ficulties with which the college had to contend , owing to the scarcity of money and the confused state of the times . " Mr. Manning arrived here early in this month , so that we have been destitute of a supply for the pulpit only two or three Sabbaths . The cor poration were put to the necessity of beginning college exercises with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scholars had arrived , Mr. Bobbins having been detained at New London , waiting for a passage , until after Mr. Manning left . The worst of all is that we are still desti tute of a steward , several having applied for the place who were not // Island . // sided at Newport . // // // tle of Antietam. 14 . Major-General AMBROSE E. BTJRNSIDE . A full-length portrait , painted from life , by E. Leutze , of New York . The collection , as will be observed , includes men of all ranks and professions , aud affords a happy illustration of the tie that binds together the varied interests of college and State . Most of the portraits have been obtained within the past five years , through the exertions of the Hon. J. R. Bartlett , Secretary of State , to whom the grateful thanks of the public are justly due for his generous and philanthropic labors . An enterprise so auspiciously commenced will , we trust , be carried on from year to year . Many portraits are still wanting to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several having been applied to who have declined . The want of some officer of college to attend the place of the institution , will , I fear , be a disadvantage . But the badness of the pay heretofore , and the scarcity of money , the paper currency , and the confused state of law and justice , both in your State and in our own , where the scholars come from , arc real difficulties . The fact , too , that the students are obliged to board out , instead of boarding in commons , has greatly in creased the expenses . Yet , I believe , if due attention is paid by the offi cers , we shall have many students in , at least by next Commencement . " /z/ PROVIDENCE , Jan. 18 , 1787. /z/ Yours of the 15th ult. came to hand a few days ago . Am happy to hear of your welfare , but am sorry to hear of Mrs. Smith s indisposition . Hope it has proved of short duration . About a month ago I was seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined me about a fortnight , and threatened my life . Through divine favor I am happily recovered , and we all enjoy usual health . The town is generally healthy . Mr. Nicholas Brown has lost his new-born son . Mr. Jonathan Jenckes is married to the widow Bowers , who lived across the way . No late intelli gence from the westward . Trade amongst us is very declining . Brown and Benson , by a seizure at Surinam , have lost about four thousand dol lars , and Jenckes , Winsor , and Co. about the same sum by the like means in Virginia . The paper money of this State has run down to six for one , notwithstanding which the Legislature continue it as a tender , and mean to do so , and to pay off all the State debts with it , be it as bad as it may . At the last session I petitioned them to pay my advances , and the re mainder of my salary as delegate , amounting to upwards of four hun dred dollars . This they offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Besides , they have ordered all the import orders brought in and exchanged at the treasury for paper at par , so that I must lose five sixths of my salary so paid to me . A more infamous set of men under the character of a legislature , never , I believe , disgraced the annals of the world . And there is no prospect of a change for the better . Of all the arrear ages of tuition for the last year , and the quarter advanced in this , I have not received ten pounds . I was taken sick the day after the second great snow , with no provisions in the cellar except one hundred-weight of cheese , two barrels of cider , and some potatoes ; with not a load of wood /z/ at my door ; nor could I command a single dollar to supply these wants . The kindness of my neighbors , however , kept me from suffering . But when a man has hardly earned money , to be reduced to this abject state of dependence requires the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for you in the situation which you mention , but it is a very trying time , and few of our ministering brethren are exempt from those trials . Nor would it probably be easy for you to better yourself . I have serious thought of removing to the farm at the Jerseys , and undertake digging for my support . Should things wear the same unfavorable aspect next year , I believe I shall make the experiment , if my life is spared . The college consists of about the same number as it did before Com mencement , but the delinquency of the students in paying their bills must , if not altered , break up the college , as the affairs can not be sup ported , especially as all assistance from our fund is cut off , if indeed it is not totally annihilated , which I greatly fear from the temper of the times . I completed your business at New York , I believe , agreeably to your wishes , and have your securities and papers all by mo ready for your commands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain convey ance . You mention an agreeable journey last October , but don t tell me where . I think with you that there is something godlike in preaching to the poor , who can not recompense us ; but it is our misfortune to be so generally of that number that we can only contemplate it . I supply the pulpit when able , but have had no application from the church , as such , to do it . Religion is extremely low with us , and confusion in State mat ters seems to increase . Please to present my best respects to Mrs. Smith and family , with all friends , in which Mrs. M. joins . Sir , yours , etc. , /z/ The language of Dr. Manning , as here applied to the Legislature of Rhode Island , may seem at first unnecessa rily severe . A reference , however , to Gov . Arnold s His tory , and to our biographical sketch of Gen. Varnum , in his forensic effort in the celebrated case of Trevett against Weeden ( page 98 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps was the most trying period of Dr. Manning s life . That he should have had serious thoughts of engaging in agriculture for a support is by no means surprising . /z/ These , however , were but momentary , and soon passe.d away . Few men , with powers distracted by care , and spirits saddened perhaps by a want of the comforts and conveniences of life , have ever labored more perseveringly , diligently , and cheerfully for the welfare of others , and for the public good , than Manning . The Commencement for 1787 seems to have been one of unusual interest , " a large , polite , and crowded assembly of gentlemen and ladies attending upon the exercises , and thus doing honor to the day and themselves by en couraging polite literature , and those useful arts which are the glory of civilized countries . " Among the orations upon this occasion was one by Nathaniel Lambert , on " The Present Appearance of Public Affairs in the United States of America portraying the superior advantages to be enjoyed by this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the States shall harmo niously agree on the great federal measures necessary for the good of the whole , whereon the convention have been some time deliberating at Philadelphia , and recommending in industry , the manufactures of our country , and the disuse of foreign goods ; and soliciting the fair daughters of America to set the patriotic example by banishing from their dress the costly gewgaws and articles of foreign pro duction . " Doubtless the worthy President had something to do with the selection of this topic , and its happy treat ment . The graduates numbered ten ; at the head of whom , on the Triennial , stands the name of Abner Alden , master of the famous school at Rayuhain , Mass. , and author of the " Reader " and " The Spelling-book " which supplied our ancestors in the Old Colony with the " rudiments " half a century ago . Mr. Alden was of the fifth genera- /z/ tion in lineal descent from John Alden , of whom and Priscilla Mullins Longfellow sings . Among them too we no tice Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corporation , and Jonathan Maxcy , President Man ning s successor in office . Mr. Maxcy 2 delivered a poem on the prospects of America , and the valedictory oration. 1 Hon. Samuel Eddy , LL.D. , was born iu Johnston , R. I. , March 31 , 1769 . After his graduation he read lav/ , but he never practised it . In 1798 he was elected by the people of Rhode Island Secretary of State , which office he held for twenty-one years in succession . Resigning the secretaryship , he was elected , for three terms , from 1819 to 1825 , a Representative in Congress- Subse quently he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Rhode Island , which position he occupied for eight years , when ill health compelled him to resign . He died February 3 , 1839 , in the seventieth year of his age . Judge Eddy was justly respected for his uprightness and intelligence , and for the extent and variety of his attainments . He was no debater , says Prof. Goddard , but he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of the Massachusetts Historical Society are enriched with several contributions from his pen . He was thrice married . His last wife was Mrs. Sarah Dwight , widow of Gamaliel Lyman Dwight , and daughter of the Hon. David Howell . She survived him many years , dying recently at an advanced age . 2 Rev. Jonathan Maxcy , D.D. , was born in Attleboro , Mass. , Sept. 2 , 1768 . Immediately upon graduating , at the early age of nineteen , he was appointed tutor in the college , which position he filled with great acceptance four years , or until 1791 , when he was chosen pastor of the Baptist church . In 1792 he assumed the duties of the presidency of the college , having been elected President pro tempore . In 1797 he was formally elected President , as appears from the records of the corporation . " The splendor of his genius , and his brilliant talents as an orator and divine , " says Dr. Blake , " had become widely known ; and under his administration the college acquired a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States/ " His voice , " says the Hon. Tristam Burgess , one of his most devoted and admiring pupils , " seemed not to have reached the deep tone of full age ; but most of all to resemble that of those concerning whom the Saviour of the world said , of such is the kingdom of heaven . The eloquence of Maxcy was mental . You seemed to hear the soul of the man ; and each one of the largest assembly , in the most extended place of worship , received the slightest impulse of his silver voice as if he stood at his very ear . So intensely would he enchain attention , that in the most thronged audience you heard nothing but him and the pulsations of your own heart . His utterance was not more per fect than his whole discourse was instructive and enchanting . " In the year 1802 , Dr. Maxcy , having resigned his office , was appointed Presi-/z/ The fears and forebodings of Dr. Manning in regard to the Confederation proved but too well founded . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found inefficient to promote social order , and all those paramount interests which it is the design of government to foster and protect . Accordingly , in 1787 , a national convention met at Philadelphia , and proposed a union of the States upon a more substantial and popular basis , in order that the blessings of freedom might be preserved . A small number of the States adopted the New Constitu- clent of Union College , Schenectady , N. Y .. as successor of the Rev. Dr. Jona than Edwards , deceased . In reference to this appointment , we find in Forsyth s Memoir of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Proudfit ( pp. 55-59 ) a curious and interesting letter from the llev . J. B. Johnson , then of Albany , and a Trustee of the col lege , objecting to Maxcy on the ground of his being a Baptist , and hence that his influence as such would be unpropitious to the prosperity of the institution , the support of the college being derived chiefly from those who were opposed to the Baptist persuasion , and perhaps had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appeared to the writer to be a violent politician , judging from a Fourth-of-July oration delivered by him , which had been praised as containing some very brilliant expressions and keen sarcasms against the Anti-Federalists . A third and more serious objection , however , was the unsoundness of his theological opinions , of which the follow ing extract from the preface to his sermon on the death of Manning , republished in June , 1796 , was quoted as an illustration : " The only thing essential to Chris tian union is love , or benevolent affection . It is , therefore , with me , a fixed principle to censure no man except for immorality . A diversity of religious opinions , in a state so imperfect , obscure , and sinful as the present , is to be ex pected . An entire coincidence in sentiment , even in important doctrines , is by no means essential to Christian society , or the attainment of eternal felicity . How many are there , who appear to have been subjects of regeneration , who have scarcely an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates of paradise be barred against these because they did not possess the penetrating sagacity of an Edwards or a Hopkins ? Or shall these great theo logical champions engross heaven , and shout hallelujahs from its walls , while a Priestley , a Price , and a Winchester , merely for difference in opinion , though preeminent in virtue , must sink into the regions of darkness and pain ? " Notwithstanding these objections , Dr. Maxcy , as we have already stated , was chosen President of the college . Previous to this event , when only thirtythree years of age , Harvard University had conferred on him the honorary de gree of Doctor in Divinity , such was his celebrity as a scholar and divine . Here /z/ tion , so called , without hesitation , but in most of them it met with great opposition . Especially was this the case in Massachusetts , where the Federalists and Anti-Feder alists , as the friends and enemies of the Constitution were pleased to style themselves , were nearly equal in number . The convention for the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Wednesday , the 9th of January , 1788 . It was composed of nearly four hun dred delegates , representing the talent and patriotism of the ancient commonwealth , as well as the conflicting in terests of opposing parties . The debates were continued for a month , and attracted the most profound attention throughout the country . Upon the fate of the Federal Constitution here , it was supposed , depended the fate of the National Government ; or , as Manning expresses it , at Schenectady he officiated with increasing reputation until 1804 , when he ac cepted the unsolicited appointment of President of South Carolina College , with the fond anticipation of finding a warmer climate more congenial to his physical constitution . Over this latter institution he presided , with almost unprecedented popularity , during the remainder of his life , lie died at Colum bia , S. C. , June 4 , 1820 , aged fifty-two years . In his person Dr. Maxcy was small of stature , but of a fine and well-proportioned figure . His features , says his biographer , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in conversation and public speak ing they were strongly expressive . Grace and dignity were also combined in all his movements . His writings , or " Literary Remains , " edited by the Rev. Dr. Romeo Elton , were published in 1844 , in a handsome octavo volume . Eight years later a selection from his Remains , " consisting of collegiate addresses , was published in London , making a pleasant little duodecimo volume of one hundred and ninety-one pages . This was also edited by Dr. Elton . Dr. Maxcy was married to Susan , daughter of Commodore Ezek Hopkins , of Providence , a name intimately associated with the history of the Revolution . Besides several daughters , they had four sons , all liberally educated ; one of whom , the Hon. Virgil Maxcy , was killed by the explosion of a gun ou board the United States steamship Princeton . No painted canvas or sculptured marble perpetuates the likeness of President Maxcy ; but so long , says Elton , " as genius , hallowed and sublimed by piety , shall command veneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of the first magnitude . " /z/ Massachusetts was considered " the hinge on which the whole must turn . " As an evidence of the deep interest which he felt in this momentous question , we quote from Mr. Rowland s Memoir the following passage : " Dr. Manning was extremely solicitous for ratification . He viewed the situation of the country with all the light of a statesman and a phi losopher , and as a prudent and well-informed citizen he took his mea sures accordingly . He had saved the college funds through the fluctua tions and storms of one revolution , and he now saw them dissipated and lost forever , unless the new form of government should be established . He knew that several clergymen with whom he was connected in the bonds of religious union were members of the convention , and that they were generally opposed to the ratification . He therefore repaired to Bos ton , and attended the debates and proceedings of the convention . His most valued and intimate friend , the Rev. Dr. Stillman , was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and zealous for the adoption ; and in their freqiient intercourse with their friends who were members , they endeavored to remove the objections of such as were in the opposition With the Rev. Isaac Backus , who was a delegate from the town of Middleborough , and considered one of the most powerful men of the Anti-Federal party , they were not able to succeed . The question of ratification was finally carried , by a majority of nineteen ( one hundred and eighty-seven yeas , and one hundred and sixty - eight nays ) , after a full and able discussion . The writer of these sketches well recollects the cordial congratulations with which Dr. Man ning greeted his friends on the decision of this convention , after his return from Boston . " In connection with the facts stated by Howland , we can not forbear to add an incident mentioned by Dr. Waterhouse , which we find quoted by Prof. Goddard . On the last day of the session of the convention , and before the final question was taken , the President , Gov . Hancock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convocation witli thanksgiving and prayer . " Dr. Manning , though taken by surprise , immediately dropped on his knees , and poured /z/ out his heart in a strain of exalted patriotism and fervid devotion , which awakened in the assembly a mingled sen timent of admiration and awe . The impression which he made must have been extraordinary ; for , says Dr. Waterhouse , who dined in a large company , after the adjourn ment , " the praise of the Rev. Dr. Manning was in every mouth . Nothing but the popularity of Dr. Stillman pre vented the rich men of Boston from building a church for Dr. Manning s acceptance . " In the following letter Manning alludes to his attend ance upon the debates of the Massachusetts Convention : /z/ PROVIDENCE , Feb. 11 , 1788 . To THE REV . DK . SMITH : MY DEAR SIR : This morning was handed me your agreeable favor of the 30th ult . I am happy to hear that you and yours enjoy health ; but sorry that with me you have cause to complain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and must be the wish of every good man ; but perhaps we may not always be the most competent judges of our useful ness . God may be doing that by us , which we little think of , that may redound to his glory . One or two , I hope , have lately met with a change amongst us , and there appears a greater degree of attention than for some time past . I continue still to preach to the people as a supply , till Mr. Stanford , from New York , arrives , whom the church and congregation have unanimously chosen their pastor . He is expected as soon as winter breaks . He paid us a visit at the invitation of the committee last Christ mas , and spent two Lord s Days with us to great acceptance . He was to have been with us by the middle of this month , but had a three weeks passage back . Elder Asa Hunt called on me last week on his way from Virginia , where he has been for several months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached , I think , seventy times . He brings refreshing tidings of the work of the Lord there , and of the great increase of our churches . Two most agreeable letters I received from re spectable ministers there , of whom I had not before heard . One of them /z/ mentions that there are about one hundred Baptist churches in that State , averaging each at least one hundred members . Great additions are daily making to them , and they call aloud for ministers of education . I never wanted to visit that country so much as now . The college continues gradually to increase . The expense of boarding in commons , tuition , room-rent , and library and apparatus privileges , granting one fourth of the year for vacations , amounts to just 20 5s. 9d. lawful money ( about sixty-eight dollars ) at present , but I expect the com mons will be lowered as soon as stability in government takes place , a period I now hope not far distant . Wood is about twelve shillings per cord ; and other incidental expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dartmouth . Two of our young men the Commencement before were at Dartmouth , Gov . Bowen s son and Mr. Nicholas Brown s son , who made particular inquiry , and they assure me that the expense of living equally well was greater there than here . I make not a doubt but he would find his account in coming to Providence , and we should be happy to receive him and do well by him . I hoped to have more particulars of your last fall tour . The reason of Brother Gano s leaving New York , is want of an adequate support , which fails through the opposition of a certain Mr. Robbins and his adherents in that church , who wish to govern it in their own way . I felt so deeply interested in the adoption of the new Federal Constitu tion by your State , that I attended the debates in convention more than a fortnight , and expected to have seen you at Boston on that occasion . I considered Massachusetts the hinge on which the whole must turn , and am happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am mortified to find Father Alden among the nays . The good work at New London and its vicinity , I am told , increases , and has spread to Norwich ; and there is a great awakening where Grow used to preach , and in Canada Parish . Please to present my best respects to Mrs. Smith and family and other friends , in which Mrs. Manning joins with , dear sir , Yours , /z/ From this time Dr. Manning held no political office , al though he always took a prominent part in public affairs , and was thoroughly familiar with the discussions and con troversies of the day . The final adoption of the Federal /z/ Constitution by the people of Rhode Island , notwithstand ing the persistent and bitter hostility of its opponents , was a result due in no small measure , doubtless , to his wise counsels and superior influence . We present his corres pondence for the remainder of the year , commencing with a letter from the Rev. Dr. Rippon of London . LONDON , Feb. 14 , 1788. /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which should have been devoted to your service , having passed in company , which unexpect edly has detained me . However , I most sincerely thank you for the short but comprehensive sketch of religious affairs communicated in your last of September , 1787 , and also for your respectful introduction of the Selec tions 1 at the Chelmsford Association . The first edition of three thousand is gone , except about fifty books , and the second edition , I hope , will be quite printed off in April next . In case it meets with the approbation of our American brethren , and there is any probability of its spread , would it be against any rule of your Association to advertise the second edition ? I have mentioned this to one or two brethren on your side of the water . No book printed in any time has had so rapid a sale among the Baptists as this . With this please to accept a pamphlet or two , by which you will see in some measure what we are about in this country . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this city are united together by a political bond . We met about a week since , and drew up a petition to Parliament for the abolition of the slave trade . The meeting was perfectly unanimous . We fear that there will be great op position to the petition , but we hope to prevent the importation of any more slaves , from Africa at least . The petitions to be presented by clerical and political bodies are likely to be numerous and very general . While so many thousands are nobly engaged in this , the cause of humanity , may you succeed in your own peculiar career , distinguished from every other by a " glory that excelleth.

I am glad to hear that you are so happily restored as to be able to preach to the people , but sorry that you have reason to complain of the low state of religion amongst you . I hope you may see better days in Philadel phia . It is a complaining time , in general , among ministers . Perhaps they themselves , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My own difficulties , I know , call for the exercise of Christian forti tude , but I find it easier to talk of than to exercise it . I thank you , how- /z/ ever , for the just remarks contained in your letter . I agree with you that the gospel is an estimable jewel , which we can not too highly prize . May we be properly anointed by the glorious hopes which it is calculated to inspire . Brother Caleb Blood , of Newtown , is the person whom I mentioned to have removed to Vermont . Our Brother Joseph Grafton , of this town and church , is ordained and settled in his place , whose labors appear to be owned amongst that people . He was here last week . Elders Backus , Hunt , and Williams have lately visited us , who are well . I am told that there is a happy revival at Bridgewater , under the ministry of Brother Eobinson . Nothing new respecting the college has occurred since our last . Possibly I may see you this fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Please to make my best respects to Mrs. Ustick and the family , in which Mrs. Manning unites , with , dear sir , Your unworthy brother , /z/ PROVIDENCE , June 10 , 1788. /z/ Yours of the 6th inst. came to hand a few hours since , by Mr. Messer. 1 We have examined and entered the young gentleman into the Sophomore class , though he had not read quite so much as the class . His abilities i Rev. Asa Messer , D.D. , LL.D . He was born in Methuen , Mass. , in the year 1769 . His father was a farmer on the banks of the Merrimac . At the age of thirteen he left the town school in his native place , and went to live in Haverhill , where for nearly a year he was clerk in a wholesale grocery store . Having given up his clerkship , he studied for a short time under the instruction of the Rev. Dr. Hezekiah Smith , and then finished his preparation for college at Windham , New Hampshire . He graduated in 1790 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was baptized , and received into the fellow ship of the church in Providence , of which Dr. Maxcy was then pastor . By this church he was , in 1792 , licensed to preach , and in 1801 he received ordina tion . He was elected a tutor of the college in 1791 , and remained in this office till he was elected , in 1796 , Professor of the Learned Languages . In 1799 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy ; and this station he continued to hold until the resignation of Dr. Maxcy , in 1802 , when he was chosen President . For twenty-four years he presided over the affairs of the college ; diligently and efficiently participating in the duties of instruc tion , and supervising , with no common practical sagacity , its disordered finan ces . In 1826 he resigned the office of President . Possessing , says his biographer , /z/ and proficiency appear very good ; and from your commendation of him we hope the will do well . Am obliged to you for your interest in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s work at Byfield and Rowley . Hope it may become universal . Then Haverhill and Providence will receive a a handsome competence , the fruit in part of his habitual frugality , he was en abled to pass the remainder of his life in the enjoyment of independent leisure . After his retirement from collegiate toils , his fellow-citizens of Providence elected him , for several years , to responsible municipal trusts ; and these trusts he discharged with his characteristic punctuality and uprightness . He died October 11 , 1836 , in the sixty-eighth year of his age . Dr. Messer was married to Deborah Angell , by whom he had four children , a son that died in infancy , and three daughters . The youngest daughter was married to the late Hon. Horace Mann , and the second to Sidney Williams , Esq. , of Taunton , Mass . Mr. Williams now resides on the paternal estate . The eldest daughter was never married . Dr. Messer s " religious opinions , " says Prof. Goddard , " especially for the last twenty years of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . He was a strenuous advocate for the supremacy of the Scriptures , and for their entire sufficiency in matters of faith and practice . As a preacher , he wanted the attractive graces of elocution ; but he never failed to address to the understanding and the conscience the most clear and cogent exhibitions of the great practical truths of the Bible . For what is termed polite literature he had no particular fondness , but he was a good classical scholar , and was well versed in the mathematics and the several branches of natural philosophy . In moral science , also , we have known few better reasoners or more successful teachers . In fine , Dr. Messer was remarkable rather for the vigor than the versatility of his powers ; rather for solid acquirement than for captivating embellishments ; rather for wisdom than for wit ; rather for grave processes of ratiocination than for the airy frolics of fancy . In 1824 he received from Harvard University the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity , having previ ously received the same degree from his ALMA MATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vermont . " " I can not remember , " says the Eev . Dr. E. A. Park , in a recent letter which he furnished for Sprague s Annals of the American Pulpit , " the time when I was not familiar with the countenance of President Messer . Before I entered college I saw him every week , and while I was a member of college I saw him every day ; and no one who has ever seen him can ever forget him . His indi viduality was made unmistakable by his physical frame . This , while it was above the average height , was also in breadth an emblem of the expansiveness of his mental capacity . A long head was vulgarly ascribed to him , but it was breadth that marked his forehead ; there was an expressive breadth in his maxillary bones ; his broad shoulders were a sign of the weight which he was able to bear ; his manner of walking was a noticeable symbol of the reach of /z/ blessing . Am. surprised that mine in answer to yours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not reached you . I have been punctual in writing , and giving you all the information I could . Our wicked State has rejected the Constitution by the town meetings to which the Legisla ture sent it , instead of complying with the recommendation of the Gen eral Convention . Our rulers are deliberately wicked , but the people of some of the towns begin to wake up since South Carolina has adopted the new Constitution , and Massachusetts has so effectually crushed Shayism . My visit to New York was very short and full of business , so that I did not go to visit one of my brothers or sister , though I was at the Plains . My object was to assist Brother Gano off for Kentucky , which took up all my time . I heard from none of your friends . Indeed , I had no opportunity . Mr. Gano with his family left the Plains the first Wednesday in May . Many families of his people , Mr. Van Horn s and Mr. Hart s , are gone also , and more are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The church at New York are with out a supply , and probably will be for a time . Mr. Stanford is still very acceptable to all evangelical hearers . The house is pretty full , but he meets with some trials . Two weeks ago Mr. Alison of Bordcntown paid us a visit , and entered a young gentleman in the Junior Class . The college has more students than ever it had ; consequently my ser vices are greater than ever . Our oldest tutor , Bobbins , has been unable to do any duty since last December , and is gone to Connecticut , five weeks since , from whom we have had no certain accounts . I doubt his ever being well again , or taking his place in college . So you see I must deny myself the pleasure of attending the New Hampshire Association . The state of religion in York is not as promising as in times past . Near his mind ; ho swung his cane far and wide as he walked , and no observer would doubt that he was an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enunciation was forcible , now and then overwhelming , sometimes shrill , but was characterized by a breadth of tone and a prolonged emphasis which added to its momentum , and made an indelible impress on the memory . His pupils , when they had been unfaithful , trembled before his expansive frown , as it portended a rebuke which would well-nigh devour them ; and they felt a dilating of the whole soul when they were greeted with his good and honest and broad smile As a son , brother , husband , father , he was the central object of attraction , and the beams of joy and love uniformly radiated from him over all the inmates of his happy home . " It is exceedingly to be regretted that no portrait or engraving exists to per petuate the likeness of this remarkable man . /z/ Peekskill and higher up it flourishes , and so it does in the Jerseys under the ministry of Brother Wilson .

As the day , says the passing record , was fine , so the concourse of people was prodigious . The procession composed of the corporation and the officers , o f the graduates and the students , of the clergy and other literati , from abroad in greater numbers than ever attended here before began in the usual order at college , about eleven o clock in the morning , and was escorted by the gallant company of artillery commanded by Col. Tillinghast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises on this occasion , we notice , besides the salutatory oration in Latin , an oration in Hebrew on the eloquence of the Scriptures , an oration in French on let ters in general , an oration in Greek on the importance of encouraging genius , a dialogue in blank verse on the sit uation and prospects of America , and a comic dialogue to ridicule false learning . As was the custom at all the ear lier Commencements of the college , the exercises were con tinued through the day , with a recess at noon . The vale dictory oration was pronounced by Amos Maine Atwell , of Providence . Among those who graduated on this oc- /z/ casion , was James Burrill , 1 who for sixteen years was suc cessively elected , amid all the vicissitudes and competi tions of party , to the responsible office of Attorney Gen eral of Rhode Island , and who was afterwards a member of the United States Senate . /z/ PHILADELPHIA , Aug. 18 , 1788. /z/ I am now thinking how long it is since you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other s letters ; and what the reason is , and whose fault ( if a fault ) it is . But as the inquiry hardly deserves a de cision , I let all pass in silence , that I may proceed to inquire after your present state of health . I hope this will find you in a comfortable situa tion ; at least I wish it may . I feel as well and as strong as an old man of sixty-seven years can expect to be . Some years ago I sent you a manuscript ; whether you received it or not I can not say . It was a collection of some historical facts relative to the Baptists . If you have the book , please return it to me as soon as conveniency offers . Herewith I send you a small piece newly published . Your remarks upon it will be interesting to me as an editor , especially if it should pass through another edition . My love and good wishes attend you and yours . /z/ 1 Hon. James Burrill , LL.D. , was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college by William Wilkinson , Esq. , then an eminent classical and mathe matical teacher in that town . He graduated at the early age of sixteen , and after completing his professional studies commenced , at the age of nineteen , the practice of the law in his native town . So rapid was his rise at the bar , that , at the age of twenty-five , he was elected by the people to the office of Attorney General , and this office he continued to hold for about sixteen years , until bod ily infirmity compelled him to retire from the bar . In 1816 he was elected Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island , and a few months afterwards a Senator in Congress . He attended only four sessions of that body , his val uable life having been prematurely terminated by a pulmonary disease , Dec. 25 , 1820 , in the forty-ninth year of . his age . " During his short career in Congress , " says Prof. Goddard , " Mr. Burrill won for himself a very high rank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had belonged a more useful legislator or a more practical statesman .

Our anxieties and emotions at parting with those we have so much reason to love , and especially with a sister en deared to us from her earliest infancy by every quality that can render any character truly respectable and truly amiable , are not to be de scribed . But we cast all our care on that God who careth for all those who trust in him , and has promised not to leave nor forsake them . I enclose you a few Association letters , etc. , which may give you more information than I have leisure to communicate . Dr. Stennett s Sermons on the Parable of the Sower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as giving the best instructions to preachers as well as hearers . I would also recommend to your notice Dr. Priestley s Lectures on His tory , as the best book on that interesting subject I ever met with . If I can I will herewith send it , and beg your acceptance of it for the library of your college . I wish also to acquaint you with the reasons we have to expect soon a capital history of the Baptists , by William Robinson of Cambridge , and if possible , will get some of his letters to me on that sub ject transcribed for that purpose . It gives me no small concern to find your government making so dis graceful a figure amongst the other sister States . Surely , if they knew how foreigners look upon them , they Avould blush . I should , however , have scarcely ventured to say this , if I could not have added that I am happy to find the town of New Providence shines forth as a luminous spot upon this dark mass , and appears the brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to tempt you to renew a correspondence you have at the opulence of his resources , and at his power to command them at pleasure . In the operations of his mind there was no indication of excess , of feebleness , or of confusion . On the contrary , he was always judicious , luminous , and for cible master of an infinite variety of facts and principles , and ever ready in applying them . He seldom wrote , although he was capable of writing well ; and it is sad to think that his fame , as a lawyer and as a statesman , must soon become only a matter of dim traditionary recollection . " /z/ hitherto found so fruitless ? May I not remind you that it is more blessed to give than to receive ? And you have much to give which will be thank fully received , though you may receive little or nothing in return . I shall also be glad to hear of the general state of religion in America , of the progress of civilization , etc. , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the health and usefulness of its worthy President , etc . And you may possibly , now my connections with America are so tender , find me a more punctual , if not a more intelligent correspondent than I have hitherto been . Dr. Priestley s writings in the theological line you are probably no stranger to , and surely he has gone to the ne plus ultra of her esy . Further he can not go and retain the name of Christian , for the sub stance of Christianity he has long since discarded . I am preaching a few sermons on the atonement , in opposition to his strange , unsupported notions . Such doctrines can not long prevail . They have no internal energy . I have heard an excellent character of the son of the late Jonathan Ed wards . Can you give me any anecdotes respecting him ?

I had like to have forgot to say , do you want a good linguist to as sist in the college or grammar school with you , or to send to Kentucky ? A young man of this description left our academy last vacation , who , having few friends here , and a very slender voice , which is a bar to his popularity , seems willing to go abroad could he have any encouragement . He is a good young man , has very tolerable talents as a preacher , and is an excellent mechanical scholar in Latin , Greek , Hebrew , Syriac , and has some knowledge of the first rudiments of the mathematics . He is defi cient in a general course of knowledge and reading , but habituated to dil igence , and very capable of improvement .

I can not bear to think of your leaving Haverhill . I hope God has work for you to do there yet , and is now preparing you for it . I should be sorry should you come to a resolution of taking your son from college . I hope you may yet see a brighter sky , which will encourage you to proceed .

Dr. Jones himself does not expect it will go on , and the money which was put into my hands for that purpose I have returned long since . Thus endetk that lesson . Your son , I think , wants a little more stability ; he seems to fluctuate too much . Upon giving him your letter to me to read , he seemed to con clude he is not likely to come to college any more .

With sentiments of esteem , and love to Mrs. Smith , in which Mrs. Manning joins , I am , etc. , /z/ It seems proper in this chapter , which illustrates more particularly Dr. Manning s political character and life , to give some account of his efforts in behalf of popular edu cation. /z/ The late Samuel Thurber , in a letter addressed to Judge Staples , which we find in his Annals of Providence , says of schools , that , " previous to about the year 1770 , they were but little thought of . There were , " he says , " in my neighborhood , three small schools , with perhaps a dozen scholars in each . Their books were the Bible , spelling book , and primer . One kept by John Foster , Esq. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their fees were seven shillings and sixpence per quarter . One kept by George Taylor , Esq. , for the church scholars . He , it was said , re ceived a small compensation from England . Besides these there were two or three women schools . When one had learned to read , write , and do a sum in the rule of three , he was fit for business . " " The Rev. James Manning , " Mr. Thurber remarks in another place , " did great things in the way of enlightening and informing the people . Schools revived by means of his advice and assistance . Previous to him it was not uncommon to meet with those who could not write their names . " The leading facts pertaining to the history of popular education in Providence are given by Judge Staples . That Manning was prominent in all efforts made in his day for the improvement of society and the public good , is evident from the tenor of his life and correspondence thus far . He was a member of the school committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the last acts of his life was to draw up a report in favor of the establishment of free public schools , which report was pre sented at an adjourned town meeting held in the State House , Monday , Aug. 1 , 1791 , only two days after the author had been followed to the tomb . We shall be par doned if we give an extract from this valuable report , which , although not carried into immediate execution , was /z/ cordially received and adopted at the time , and which , doubtless , paved the way for the introduction , a few years later , of the present free-school system of Providence . It seems that , at the annual town meeting in June , a pe tition had been presented , praying that a sufficient number of schoolmasters be appointed to instruct all the children in town at the public expense ; which petition was referred to the school committee , of which Manning was chairman , with instructions to report thereon at an adjourned meet ing . The report thus begins : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convened next by ad journment , the underwritten members of your school committee , in pursuance of your resolution at your last meeting , report : After the most deliberate and mature consideration of the subject , we are clearly of opinion that the measure proposed by the petitioners is eli gible , for many reasons . 1 . Useful knowledge , generally diffused among the people , is the sur est means of securing the rights of man , of promoting the public pros perity , and perpetuating the liberties of a country . 2 . As civil community is a kind of joint tenancy in respect to the gifts and abilities of individual members thereof , it seems not improper that the disbursements necessary to qualify those individuals for useful ness should be made from common funds . 3 . Our lives and properties , in a free state , are so much in the power of our fellow-citizens , and the reciprocal advantages of daily intercourse are so much dependent on the information and integrity of our neighbors , that no wise man can feel himself indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preservation of morals in the community where he resides . 4 . The most reasonable object of getting wealth , after our own wants are supplied , is to benefit those who need it ; and it may with great pro priety be demanded , in what way can those whose wealth is redundant benefit their neighbors more certainly and permanently than by furnish ing to their children the means of qualifying them to become good and useful citizens , and of acquiring an honest livelihood ? 5 .

The following , from the Rev. Dr. Gordon , will serve to illustrate the author s position and views as the historian of the American war . RINGWOOD , ENGLAND , Feb. 27 , 1789. /z/ I am mistaken or you are indebted to me for an answer to my last letter . You might delay sending it till you heard where I was settled ; and this you will not do by the present means , but the reverse . You will inquire after the situation of Ringwood , and the reason of my being here . You know I have a pleasure in gratifying you ; and therefore turn to your map of England , look for Hampshire , find out Pool , next the church , which is twelve miles off , then Christ s Church , which is ten in the con trary direction , then Southampton , which is twenty , and so calculate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , then make your dot , and you will either hit or be not far from Ringwood in imagination . I should be glad to see you in reality , though I should be astonished at the sight , and wonder what drove you from the land of the whereases , whether the inhabitants are suddenly going from one ex treme to another and becoming all honest , so that they no longer wanted your instruction or example , or are being so confirmed in their mal practices as that you had forsaken them , from a conviction that they were a set of incurables . Now for the other part of the question , " What brought me hither ? Freedom among friends is best , you know ; and therefore , to be plain with you , when I had seen to the delivery and sending off my History to the subscribers in London and the country , I pushed off to this retirement for a few months , that I might at the distance of ninetyseven miles be out of the way of the conversation that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transcribing , and publishing ; and did not wish to have my spirits fatigued more with the queries and observations that either malevolence or curiosity might excite . I judged it as needful to give myself a few months relaxation , as to turn out to grass for a season an old horse worn down by a long , /z/ tedious journey , that so he might recruit and be fit for a little more service . Here we shall remain , if spared , at the country house of Mrs. Gordon s younger brother , till April or May , when I propose giving a look at Lon don for a few days , on our way to Ipswich in Suffolk , seventy miles from the metropolis , eighteen miles from Colchester , and twelve from Harwich . Here we were first settled and lived thirteen years . Our former people and their successors , like their quondam pastor , were the friends of Amer ica , so that we shall agree in politics as well as religion . They have a great affection for us ; and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have reason to believe , have urged my renewing our former relations . Here and in the neighborhood I shall be likely to preach oc casionally , while abilities admit ; but though I have great reason to adore the goodness of God that I am so well in body and mind , now that I am within nine days of sixty , yet I perceive that they are upon the decline . You will think my eyesight good when you read that I write , as you see , whether by day or candlelight . I was in hope that some ministerial settlement with a small congregation , and a salary that might have made our circumstances more easy , would have offered . But the great Head of the chucli has ordered otherwise , not only with wisdom for the gen eral good , but with mercy for our particular benefit . I do not intend to lie by in a state of lazy indolence , but to apply myself to some kind of service that may be useful to the church and the public , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to supply present deficiencies . What that should be I have not yet determined , and delay till I get into a habitation of my own , if an earthly one remains designed for me . But I mean it to be of that nature that will not disgrace a D.D. , the creature of Princeton College Trustees . Much will depend upon the voice of the public , on both sides of the Atlantic . If the numerous part of impartialists will exclaim well done , and call for a second edition of my History , the way will be plain . The profits arising from it will suffice , especially if the heads of American colleges will let me have their orders and their cash for the various books that may be wanted in their seminaries and libraries , which I might be able to supply them with on lower terms than they now have them , by exchanging copies of my work with the booksellers having the copyright of such as are to be furnished . Your friendship will lead you to improve upon this hint ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of the American States , for my past and present attach ment to their freedom and independence , and for the disadvantages the same has subjected me to in my native country . /z/ I had finished writing thus far , and taken a breathing-walk into the garden , when yours of September , 1788 , was brought to Mrs. Gordon in a parcel . Upon opening the last , I had the pleasure of reading that and another from the same continent . To what it has been owing that so much time has elapsed since that day to the present , before the parcel reached me , I know not ; but better late than never , and lonrj-looked-for is come at last . And now for answers to , and comments upon it . Through divine goodness Mrs. Gordon s hand has been so far restored as to be very ser viceable , though not as formerly . The labors I had been called to while printing , and which had near exhausted me by the time I had finished , led one of my intimate friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept up . Relaxation , country air , the severe cold of last winter , and the pleasures of the present spring , have given to them a fresh start ; and I promise myself they will recover their former tone . The produce of America just received from New York and Massachusetts has raised them some degrees above par . When you read the History , I flat ter myself you will pronounce me the friend of the American cause , and that I have pointed out the faults of the United States in divers instances without basting them severely . I can go beyond most of the members of the old superannuated Congress , or even of the new Federal Constitution , and say , I pray daily that the United States of America may be a holy , free , and happy people , which is the way to be lasting . It used to be one of my petitions that good government might be established among them ; but that being answered , I have only to be thankful for it . You will not charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced how faithfully their cruelties in America are related . Your account of Massachusetts merits confirmation , and I hope will obtain it . The infi nitely wise Governor of the universe often makes great evils the parents of lasting and great benefits . But where did you leave your orthodox divin ity , when you went from Providence to New York , that you should ven ture to declare , that if my native country does not smart in your lifetime for her conduct to the East Indians and Africans , not to say Americans , that so you might see it , you should alter your opinions respecting the divine dispensations toward communities of men in this world ? Methinks , Brother Doctor , I have caught you napping . Besides , had the Americans smarted equal to their crimes toward their public and private creditors , the Africans , etc. , when you was provoked to leave off glorying in being an American ? Our common friend Mr. Rippon will give you fuller and better intelli- /z/ gence concerning Winchester than I can do . I wish his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes right about as lie was , to allude to a military phrase . May the college at Providence , and all other colleges where learning , good morals , and Christian piety are encouraged , flourish more and more . And may my friends there continue to enjoy good health . I have desired Mr. Mason to accompany this letter with six sets of my History to you . One is a present to the college ; the other five are for Jabez Bowen , Esq. , Messrs . John Brown and Francis Benson , Mr. Nicholas Brown , Mr. Caleb Greene , and Mr. John Jcnckes . I pray you to present my best respects to these gentlemen , to receive the remaining five pounds from them , and to forward the same to Jonathan Mason , Jr. , Esq. , Boston . If no other way that is more agreeable offers , either of those careful and obliging postriders , Messrs . Mumfords , to whom my respects , I am certain will take a pleasure in serving me by conveying it . It might not perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peregrin ations they could dispose of twenty - five or fifty sets , I might likely supply them at twenty-five shillings sterling per set , delivered at Boston or Prov idence I remain , dear sir , Your very affectionate friend though unworthy brother , /z/ The services of Dr. Manning were still , it would seem , in popular demand at this trying period in the history of Rhode Island as a State . From the records of the day , we learn that " At an adjourned meeting of the town on Thursday ( Aug. 27 , 1789 ) , a committee , that had been appointed on Tuesday for the purpose , re ported a draft of a petition to be presented to the Congress of the United States , setting forth the distressed situation of this State , the probability of our soon joining the Union , and praying that vessels belonging to our citizens may be exempted from foreign tonnage , and goods shipped from this State from foreign duties , for such time and under such regulations and restrictions as Congress in their wisdom shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after having been signed by the moderator and town clerk , the Rev. Dr. Manning and Benjamin Bourn , Esq. , were appointed to proceed to New York and present the same . " /z/ The committee appointed to draft the petition consisted of Dr. Manning , Benjamin Bourn , Thomas Arnold , Nich olas Brown , Theodore Foster , Welcome Arnold , and John Brown . The petition itself , which was probably drafted by Manning , as chairman of the committee , may be found in Staples s Annals of Providence . Dr. Manning , as we have before observed , presided on all Commencement occasions with remarkable dignity and grace . His addresses to the graduating class were espe cially noted for excellent good sense , and were pervaded by a tone of piety and delivered with an eloquence which could hardly fail to produce happy and lasting impressions upon the young men , as they stood before him to receive final words of counsel and love . The only production of this kind that has come down to us , was copied from the original , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author s death . It was delivered at the Commencement held Sept. 2 , 1789 . Among those to whom it was espe cially addressed , we notice the names of Jeremiah Brown Howell , afterwards a member of the United States Senate , and the late James Fenner , for many years the popular and efficient Governor of Rhode Island . Mr. Fenner , it may be added , was the valedictorian of his class . /z/ Having completed your academical course , you now commence mem bers of the great community of the world . Here , while your country offers you a fairer opportunity to display your abilities , and improve to advantage that knowledge which you have acquired , than any age or country ever before presented , it becomes my duty to point you to that line of conduct which will most probably insure your success . The narrow limits prescribed by the occasion will allow me to hint at only a few general observations . The first attention of a youth stepping forward into life should be to /z/ acquire and preserve a good character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ever becoming eminent . For , bad as the world is , it has always paid a voluntary tribute to virtue ; and though some vicious men have arisen to a degree of respectability , it will be found , on a nearer view , that they are indebted for that respectability to some virtu ous traits in their character . To avail yourselves of this supreme advantage , I can not recommend to you a subject more important and interesting than the Christian relig ion ; of whose divine Founder it was a favorite maxim , Seek first the king dom of God and his righteousness , and all other things shall be added unto you . This divine religion creates principles in the heart of its subjects the most operative , and the best adapted to regulate the life and conduct that can possibly be conceived . This at once portrays in the strongest colors , the state , connections , and claims of man ; and disrobes the world of all its imaginary glory , and presents it in its own fugitive , fading colors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unassuming humility which renders a man less vulnerable by the envenomed shafts of malevo lence ; it moulds the heart into a divine benevolence , and is the purest of that exquisite sensibility which deeply interests itself in the fortunes of others , so that it weeps with those who weep t and rejoices with those who rejoice . This divine religion carries forward our thoughts to futurity , contem plates as a reality our dissolution , and that awful approaching judgment in which we must all become a party . It places us in that new eternal world , reaping the fruits of what we have sown in this . In a word , it places us immediately under the eye of God , now the witness of our actions , and soon to be our Judge . How operative this divine principle to check the irregularity of the pas sions , and guard against the force of temptations ! How divine a prompter to the discharge of every obligation we are under to God or man ! Next to this attention to religion , let me earnestly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made for employment . All his internal as well as external powers testify to this great truth . To comply with this great dictate of nature is of the utmost importance ; and youth , of all seasons of life , is the fittest for this culture . That is the period to form and give a proper direction to the habits , on the right con stitution of which depends , almost entirely , the happiness of man . In selecting a profession , consult the strong bias of natural inclination ; /z/ for against this current few if any have made a figure ; and be sure that the object lies within reach of your talents . Should the Christian ministry with any of you become an object , re flect on the absurdity of intruding into it while strangers to experimental religion . See that yourselves have been taught of God before you at tempt to teach godliness to others . To place in the professional chairs of our universities the most illiterate of mankind , would be an absurdity by far less glaring than to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is to expose our holy religion to the scoffs of infidels , and to furnish to their hands the most deadly weapons . I omit to insist on the account such must render in the great , tremendous day ! May that wisdom which is from above direct your steps in your jour ney through life ; and may you , after the discharge of the duties of good citizens , men of science and religion , meet the approbation of the Su preme Judge , and reap the harvest of immortal glory in the world above . With this devout wish , I bid you farewell . The reader will observe how earnestly and forcibly President Manning urges candidates for the ministry to seek first of all the " kingdom of God and his righteous ness . " This was in accordance with his usual custom on all Commencement occasions . On this point we may be allowed to quote from Backus , who , in the Abridgment of his Church History , thus writes : " Dr. Manning was a good instructor in human learning , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars never to presume to enter into the work of the ministry until they were taught of God , and had reason to conclude that they had experienced a saving change of heart . " /z/ PROVIDENCE , Dec. 25 , 1789. /z/ Your most acceptable favor of July 11 , with the package , met me at the Association at Philadelphia the 5th of last month . I thank you for your expressions of kindness towards me , and your wishes for my useful- /z/ ness . Indeed , I can not but consider myself as a very barren tree in my Lord s vineyard . The paragraph respecting Dobson s republishing your Pedobaptism I showed to the Association , and queried with them whether your painful labors and extensive services to the Baptist cause , in that publication , did not entitle you to our assistance on this side of the Atlantic , by aiding in the sale of the book . They agreed they did ; but as Mr. Dobson had circulated proposals , they doubted the propriety of taking the matter up till Dobson had given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams has rallied his forces and attacked you . I am glad , however , to find that you are not panic-struck at the onset . In deed , I think you have taken a ground too strong to be easily dislodged . Wo should be gratified with a sight of his piece . If the Pedobaptists , in general , think it masterly , we doubtless shall soon see it in America . The strength of the advocates of that tenet is to sit still . It is too late in the day for them to avail themselves , in this age of inquiry , of those plau sible colorings which formerly passed very well for solid arguments . At best , if observation has not deceived me , this is the fact with respect to America . Your Essay on the Kingdom of Christ met a most hearty welcome , and its author has my wannest thanks . It was a subject which had employed my thoughts at intervals for several years , and I was almost determined to have committed them to paper , with a design to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of doing it , as the subject has fallen into much abler hands . I am most heartily pleased with it , and think it lays the axe to the root of that wide-spreading tree , infant-baptism and infant church membership . Your portrait of Winchester is so exactly to the life that all his ac quaintance must see the man in it . The Baptist society still increases in the Southern States , especially in Virginia , and I may add the Middle States also , especially New York . Mr. Jonathan Maxcy , our youngest tutor in the college , a youth of genius and no small degree of literature for his age , about twenty-one years old , has lately found Christ , and fol lowed his Lord into the watery grave . There is another youth under serious impressions , and more appearance of attention to divine tilings in the college than for some years past . Our second tutor , Mr. Abel Flint , a young Congregationalist preacher , has turned his attention to the subject of baptism for some weeks past , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told me , some days since , that if that tenet could not be supported from Abraham s covenant , it must fall . If I was as well satisfied of his being a subject of divine grace as I am that Maxcy is , I should think him no small acquisition . May God grant him grace and guide him into all truth ! Our num ber of students lacks but two of seventy . Yours , etc. /z/ BRISTOL , Feb. 22 , 1790. /z/ The literary degree with which the respectable Society over which you preside have thought proper to honor me , I duly received , accompanied with your truly friendly letter , for which I beg you to accept my best thanks . I rely upon you , sir , to make known my acknowledgments to the other members of the college for this mark of distinction and favor , and to assure them that it will always give me peculiar pleasure to pro mote the prosperity of so useful and honorable an institution . I received from King s College , Aberdeen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced here , so that I consider myself under double obligations to take care that I do nothing to discredit the title which has been so honorably conferred upon me by two such respectable bodies . I not only did not seek this honor , but I ought to decline it ; but as it has been so generously decreed me , I think it my duty to receive and improve it as a motive to activity and zeal in the sphere in which Provi dence has placed me . We are clogged here with test laws , and in vain struggling to get rid of them . You know no such shackles . And yet you know what it is to have bad men disappoint the desires of the good , and outnumber them in their best-intentioned projects . Does not the French Revolution astonish you 1 It astonishes and de lights me beyond measure . But our great folks here dislike it exceed ingly . The counsel of the Lord , however , shall stand , and he will do all his pleasure . I am astonished at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a letter of Mr. Booth s upon the subject , I believe to you . Surely you are more narrow than the Papists upon this subject . I congratulate you upon the increase of your college and church , and /z/ the rising state of the Baptist interest . We go on as usual , are well at tended , but have few additions . The love of many waxeth cold . We have great reason to cry mightily to Him with whom is the residue of the Spirit . The young man I wrote to you about is in too bad a state of health to think of a voyage to America . I rejoice you have rooted out , that pest of society , a truly filthy , infamous fellow ; but I know not how to refrain asking , How came you ever to admit him , without the least testimonial to his character 1 But I am obliged abruptly to break off , only begging to be favored with a line whenever opportunity offers , and that you would believe I truly am Your affectionate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1790. /z/ Your letter by favor of Mr. Mullet came safe to hand about a fortnight ago . So far from being wearied by your circumstantial account of the con duct of , I think myself much obliged to you for it . Unhappy man ! I fear he is hardened through the deceitfulness of sin . May the Lord have mercy on him , and give him repentance . I am very much obliged to you for your generous concern on my behalf respecting the sale of the second edition of my Pedobaptism Examined . That the composing of it required much labor , that I laid out no small sum of money in purchasing books , especially on the popish controversy , with a view to the new impression , and that I am much more likely to lose by it than to gain anything , are facts ; but I am of opinion that , after Dr. Dobson had received encouragement to publish proposals for the re printing of it , my brethren in America could not with honor desert him , while he continues his design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that my Essay on the Kingdom of Christ meets with your approbation . The subject is undoubtedly of great im portance , and I sincerely pray that the Lord may bless the pamphlet to the promoting of that spiritual kingdom . The first volume of Mr. Rob inson s History of the Baptists has been in the press for these five or six months , but it is not yet published . That volume , indeed , is to contain a history of baptism , and three more volumes that are to follow , a history of the Baptists . A great extent of reading , much wit , and many curious /z/ anecdotes , may be expected to appear in the work whenever it comes out ; but I have my fears that it will , on the whole , be of no great utility to the real cause of Jesus Christ . The author is now known to have adopted Dr. Priestley s system in general ; but he is justly considered as far infe rior to the Doctor in respect of candor and of integrity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not so the other gentleman . I have often thought that if it had not been for his uncommon share of wit , he would before e now have sunk into universal contempt among serious people ; and he is , indeed , much sunk of late in the estimation of num bers . I have been lately well informed that Dr. Priestley considers him as doing no honor to any cause . This you will observe , however , is inter nos . The beginning of January last I received a letter from Dr. Samuel Jones , of Lower Dublin , respecting the validity of baptism administered by immersion and on a profession of faith , by an itnbaptized that is , Pcdobaptist minister ; on which question he desired my opinion . I have given it , in a very long letter enclosed in one to Dr. Stillman of Boston . I have sent it unsealed , that Dr. Stillman might have an opportunity of perusing it before he sent it off to Dr. Jones . I am very sorry that I was obliged , in opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affirmative of the question ; that is , 1 think such baptism , though irregular , valid . If you should by any means have a sight of that letter , I should he glad to know your thoughts on the argument contained in it . I have expressed my views of the subject with the utmost freedom , and I trust without giving any cause of offence to the Doctor . My respects , if you have opportunity , to Dr. Drowne . I earnestly pray that the Lord may cause his . truth to prosper all around you , as I am glad to hear it does in Virginia . Winchester seems to be losing ground pretty fast ; for some of his principal admirers have turned their backs upon him , and have renounced his notion of universal restitution , of which they were once extremely fond . Shall be glad to hear from you at any time when an opportunity presents . The Lord be with you in all your depart ments of labor and in all your connections . I remain , dear sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SMITH . PROVIDENCE , . .20th April , 1790. /z/ I snatch a moment to inform you that the good work still continues , and I think has been gradually increasing amongst us since you left . Last Lord s Day I baptized two , and a third was prevented by indisposi tion of body . Two profess to have met with a change the last of last week . Several profess to have received comfort , but are not fully satis fied . I believe that there are from fifty to one hundred under serious im pressions ; and they crowd the evening meetings whenever and wherever they are appointed . Numbers come to my house to converse with me about their souls . Many of Dr. H k s people attend the evening meetings , of whom several appear seriously impressed . Some people , you will naturally guess , do not like this , and look rather shy . Poor Mr. Flint has come to a point , and must be a Baptist , notwithstanding the reproaches he has to endure ; but he has not full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the persons under awakening , and attends meetings whenever he can . He has been sick , but is recovered . Mr. Maxcy has been called and licensed , but has been at home some time , much indisposed . He is now very ill with the measles . He preaches to admiration . Several of the students are also down with the measles , and others have had them . Not a few of the students are under serious impressions . Many of the people here are often wishing to see Mr. Smith again ; and , for your encouragement , I can inform you that many profess to have been first awakened by your labors amongst us . No account has yet been received from Dr. Gano , and I expect to go for Jersey the beginning of May . The people really lament and mourn at the thought of being left destitute . What think you of coming and making another visit to Providence the beginning of next month ? I believe this would diffuse a general joy through both church and society . You will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily wish you could come , but I have not had an opportunity of speaking to the committee on the subject . I expect they would embrace this opportunity of writing you if they knew of this opportunity to send to Boston , more especially if they had not sanguine hopes that Dr. Gano would soon be here ; but I really fear some disaster has happened to him . If my wishes could bring you to Providence , you would soon be here . Attleboro is visited , and several other places . Mrs. Manning joins in love to you and lady , with , dear sir , yours , etc. , /z/ On Monday , May 24 , of this year , the final State conven tion on the Federal Constitution was held at Newport . On Thursday the body adjourned , for more ample ac commodations , from the State House to the Second Bap tist Church , where for three days the great debate between the contending parties was continued . At five o clock on Saturday afternoon the final vote was taken . Thirty-four members voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative . Thus a majority of two votes saved the people of Rhode Island from anarchy , and the State from dismemberment . The news reached Providence before midnight , and was announced by the ringing of bells and the booming of can non . The next day the returning delegates were received with a national salute of thirteen guns . Again , says Sta ples in his Annals , " patriotism encroached on piety , as when the vote for calling the convention passed in the preceding January , and the stillness of the Sabbath morn ing was broken by the joyful roar of artillery . " In about two months after this event , on Tuesday , Au gust 17 , President Washington with his suite , accompa nied by Gov . Clinton of New York , Thomas Jefferson , Esq. , Secretary of State , and several members of Congress , made his first visit to Providence . A large procession was formed to escort them from the packet in which they arrived , and the occasion was made a gala-day throughout the town . In the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others took a walk on the college green , to view the illumination of the building by the students , which made a most splendid appearance . " On Thursday , the 19th , the President and his suite were escorted to the college by the students , and by Dr. Man-/z/ ning introduced to the Library and Museum , where in be half of the corporation he thus addressed him : SIR : Though among the last to congratulate you on your advance ment to that dignified and important station to which the unanimous voice of a grateful country has called you , the corporation of Rhode Island College claim to be among the first in warmth of affection for your per son , and in esteem for your public character . In placing you at the head of the United States , regard was had no less to the influence of your ex ample over the morals of the people than to your talents in the adminis tration of government . Happy are we to observe , that similar motives have influenced your conduct in filling the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that superintending Providence which , in the course of events propitious to this country , has called you forth to establish , after having defended , our rights and liberties . Agitated in the hour of doubtful conflict , exulting in your victories , we watched your footsteps with the most anxious solicitude . Our fervent supplications to Heaven , that you might be furnished with that wisdom and prudence necessary to guide us to freedom and independence , have been heard and most graciously answered . For the preservation of this freedom , one great object still demands our peculiar attention , the education of our youth . Your sentiments , sir , on this subject , " that knowledge is in every country the surest public basis of happiness , " and the strongest barrier against the intruding hand of des potism , as they most perfectly accord with those of the most celebrated characters that ever adorned human nature , so they leave no room to ap prehend you will refuse the wreath with which the guardians of literature here would entwine your brow . By restoring your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coun try , Divine Providence has , in a late instance , furnished to millions matter of thanksgiving and praise . That you may long remain on earth , a blessing to mankind , and the support of your country , that you may afterwards receive the rewards of virtue , by having the approbation of God , is our most sincere desire and fervent supplication . This address , which had been formally adopted by the corporation , at a special meeting held in the State House , August 17 , was duly presented to the President , signed /z/ by Jabez Boweii , Chancellor ; James Manning , President ; and David Howell , Secretary . To Manning s address in behalf of the corporation , President Washington thus re plied : To THE CORPORATION or RHODE ISLAND COLLEGE : GENTLEMEN : The circumstances which have until this time prevented you from offering your congratulations on my advancement to the station I hold in the government of the United States , do not diminish the pleas ure I feel in receiving this flattering proof of your affection and esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In repeating thus publicly my sense of the zeal yon displayed for the success of the cause of your country , I only add a single suffrage to the general testimony which all , who were acquainted with you in the most adverse and doubtful moments of our struggle for liberty and indepen dence , have constantly borne in your favor . While I can not remain insensible to the indulgence with which you re gard the influence of my example and the tenor of my conduct , I rejoice in having so favorable an opportunity of felicitating the State of Rhode Isl and on the cooperation I am sure to find in the measures adopted by the guardians of literature in this place , for improving the morals of the rising generation , and inculcating upon their minds principles peculiarly calcu lated for the preservation of our rights and liberties . You may rely on whatever protection I may be able to afford in so important an object as the education of our youth . I will now conclude , gentlemen , by expressing my acknowledgments for the tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a late occasion , and with ardent wishes that Heaven may prosper the literary institution under your care , in giving you the best of its blessings in this world , as well as in the world to come . At the Commencement this year twenty-two young gentlemen took their first degree , being the largest num ber that had ever graduated at one time since the college was founded . Among them was Moses Brown , youngest son of Nicholas Brown , a bright and promising youth , who a few months later , just as he had entered upon his six- /z/ teenth year , was seized with a disorder which suddenly put an end to his life . In this class also graduated the third President of Brown University , Asa Messer , of whom we have given a sketch in the preceding chapter . At the close of the exercises , the degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on George Washington , 1 President of the United States of America . This was the last Commence ment at which Dr. Manning presided . /z/ PROVIDENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ult. is before me . The tide of business which , on my return home , flowed in upon me , prevented my recollecting the case of Mr. Messer . But in my journey to the West I had him constantly in view , but found no opening which I thought worthy his attention . Mr. Eead , from Virginia , has not returned , nor have I had any intelligence from him respecting a chance for teaching ; so that I can not at present give any encouragement from this quarter , as it was the general opinion that it would be imprudent for him , all things considered , to take a place 1 In reference to this we find the following pleasant anecdote in Rippon s Bap tist Register : " In a conversation between several friendly gentlemen ( in London ) some time since , which turned chiefly on the confinement of Lewis the Little , who , like an absolute sovereign , had said to five and twenty millions of people , I will be obey ed , contrasted with the popularity of Washington the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island had conferred the degree of Doctor of Laws on the President of the United States . While it seemed to be the general mind that this distinguished character in the history of man wouid prefer the lau rels of a college to a crown of despotism , one of the company , it is said , quite impromptu , gave vent to the feelings of his heart in the following effusion : When kings are mere sovereigns , or tyrants , or tools , No wonder the people should treat them as fools ; But Washington , therefore , presides with applause . Because he well merits the Doctor of Laws . I ll ne er be a ruler till I m LL . D. , Nor England nor Scotland shall send it to me ; I ll have my diploma from Providence Hall , For Washington had , or I ll have none at all . " /z/ in college , till the present Senior Class are out of the way . We have ap pointed a Mr. Lyndon Arnold to that office for the present , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mcsser should not fall into better business by that time , it would be very agreeable to me to have him for an assistant ; and sooner , should Tutor Maxcy leave us , which he talks of , though I shall reluctantly agree to it . He has with great ersuasion consented to supply the pulpit for six months , and does it to great acceptance . He has many hearers , and his labors appear to be owned . He improves amazingly . The good work still prevails , and the prospect is as promising at present as at any period past . Our dear friend Mr. Jenckes appears almost gone . It is not likely that he will stay with us many weeks . Nicholas Brown is in a very poor way , but yet goes out . I fear his disorder is radical and will prove fatal . Your son s standing shall remain as it has done . The instances of Catholicism amongst the Presbyterians are , their opening their houses of worship to the Baptists , and nocking to hear them , at Brunswick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association of Danbury con sists of thirteen churches , and there are , probably as many more in that quarter which will join them . There has been a great increase of the Bap tists in the western part of Connecticut and in the lower part of York State of late . I suppose Mr. Flint has concluded to commence a preacher among the Congregationalists , and I conclude is about to accept a call to the South Parish in Hartford . Either the cross was too heavy to com mence a Baptist , or he had little reason to expect that he should be called to the work among us , unless he could give better evidence of a change of heart ; or probably something of both had weight in his determination . I have said nothing to him on the subject lately , as I was convinced of the strong bias he had for preaching at all events . I suppose he has been borne down with a torrent of influence from Pedobaptist connections . By a letter from Mr. E. Bobbins I hear that the two churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling may continue and increase . The day appointed for Mr. Baldwin s instalment I attended the ordina tion of Mr. Ebenezer . The letter from the Boston church did not reach me until late in the evening of the preceding Lord s Day , so that it was out of my power either to come or send them word . I hope you had a comfortable season . Our friend Mr. Sutton is settled nearly in the centre of Kentucky , and , I believe , in regard to worldly prospects , is more happy than ever he was , though he has not the charge of a church , /z/ as there are four ordained ciders in that to which he belongs . He has purchased two hundred acres of good land , has enough cleared to raise his bread , which his sons manage , together with carrying on a considera ble share of the hatter s business . This leaves him at leisure to travel , as he has lost his wife ; and among other journeys , he contemplates one to New England , to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best respects to you , lady , and family , with all friends , in which Mrs. Manning joins , I remain , as ever , /z/ Mr. Flint , to whom Manning here refers , was ordained as a pastor of the Second Congregational Church in Hart ford , on Wednesday , April 20 , 1791 . The Rev. Dr. Strong of Hartford made the introductory prayer , the Rev. Dr. Hitchcock of Providence preached the sermon , the Rev. Dr. Goodrich of Durham gave the charge , the Rev. Na than Perkins of Hartford gave the right hand of fellow ship , and the Rev. David Macclure of East Windsor made the concluding prayer . /z/ LONDON , April 1 , 1791. /z/ It being more than twelve months since I wrote you a letter , I have been much disappointed in not having had the pleasure of hearing from you . At the same " time I sent a very long letter to Dr. Samuel Jones , in answer to one I received from . him , relative to the propriety of baptizing such persons as had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister , both of which I enclosed in a packet to Dr. Stillman at Boston ; but , to my great surprise , I have not received a line from America since . The name of the captain ( nor yet of his ship ) by whom the little packet was sent , I do not now recollect , but should be very sorry to learn that the letter never came to hand . It is probable that you have heard , ere now , of the death of Mr. E. Robinson , of Cambridge . He died the last summer , a little before his History of Baptism was finished at the press ; by which book it appears he was a thorough-faced Socinian at the time of his decease . He died in the neighborhood of Birmingham , at the house of a gentleman belonging /z/ to Dr. Priestley s community , after having preached at the Doctor s meeting-house the Lord s Day before ; was buried at the Doctor s burying-ground ( he at least spoke at the grave ) at the expense of the Doctor s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon for him ; a sermon contemptible as to its composition , and detestable as to the sen timents contained in it . Some of the sentiments , in my view , are an in sult , not only on the Scriptures but on common sense , except the latter be debauched by vain philosophy . Mr. Robinson s History of Baptism you may probably have seen before now . It seems to me to be a work of both labor and learning . It contains various particulars , in opposition to infant-sprinkling , that are both new and pertinent ; but there is much extraneous matter ; there are many indications of rank Socinianism ; various detestably fanciful interpretations of passages in the Old Testa ment ; and such marks of enmity against the character of Augustinus as I did not expect . We have very lately lost by death that worthy Baptist minister , Mr. Robert Hall , of Amsby , in Leicestershire . He is , I doubt not , now with God , and his memory is much respected . Socinianism is , I fear , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and several of our young Baptist ministers have , within these two or three years , adopted that pernicious system of error and of blasphemy . But our divine Jesus lives and reigns , to govern the world and to take care of his own cause . I hear but little of Mr. Winchester of late , and have never seen him . I urn inclined to think , however , that his corrupt principles lose rather than gain ground in this metropolis . Hope you will indulge me with a letter as soon as you can after you receive this ; and that , among other things , you will inform me whether my Pedobaptism Examined be yet republished . I have been informed that proposals for publishing by subscription my Essay on the Kingdom of Christ , have appeared at Philadelphia . I was a little surprised to hear of republishing , by subscription , so small a piece , nothing of that kind being issued here . It has been and now is a sickly time among my people . Three of the members of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the present year came in , and another of them is on the verge of the grave , by the envenomed tooth of a devouring cancer . The Lord grant that we may be prepared for his whole will concerning us . Oh for more genuine spiritual-mindedness ! And now , sir , I most affectionately commend you to God , and to the /z/ word of his grace , earnestly praying that peace and prosperity may at tend you and yours and all the churches of Christ . I remain , dear sir , Your unworthy brother in the gospel of Jesus Christ , /z/ Last evening Capt . Mesnard delivered me his letters from New York , and to-morrow the Eagle sails , so that I have but a few minutes for each letter . The Register is taking a prodigious spread through almost all our churches , the country friends themselves ordering from fifteen to one hun dred copies for each church . I feel myself honored in seeing your name among the brethren who encourage the design . I refer now to the adver tisement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have received your painting by Capt . Mesnard , but I must now beseech you to forward it by the veryjirst safe conveyance , informing me at what age it was done . Dr. Evans is beautifully engraved , and so is Providence meeting-house , from a copy in the Massachusetts Magazine for August , 1789 . No part of the Magazine have I seen besides . The account of the Providence church can not , I suspect , be brought into the Eirst Part of the Register , though , on account of its early date , it should be one of the first societies under Article the 8th , where it stands . I would not so soon have advertised its insertion , had I not known it would have afforded great pleasure to many of our English brethren ; though , by the way , some of them are astonished at the STEEPLE ! I was the more unwilling to bring this article forward so early , because I was unac quainted with your opinion of the narrative . It came here to a friend of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the church . Of course you have seen it . No one in the city but myself and the family to whom it was sent know that Stanford had any hand in it ; and his name must be entirely kept out of sight in this country . If I in troduce the account of the church in the Second Part of the Register , with your corrections , I dare not go any further than 1787 , unless you will give the narrative such a finish that the close may introduce your present condition . Mr. Foster informs me that Mr. Maxcy ( named in your for mer letter ) has engaged to supply Providence one year . I beg to be af fectionately remembered to him . I never had any correspondence with Mr. ; am sorry to find he did not behave well at Providence . /z/ The happiness of the American churches lies near my heart . I aee my brethren have too much neglected them . There is not public spirit enough in this country ; but I have hinted by this conveyance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American brethren particularly . I am sure when we have larger accounts of Kentucky , well authenticated , the design you proposed a few months since can naturally be brought for ward ; and I have laid some foundation already for its success . This I have mentioned to no American but yourself . I find Mr. Wesley s people are aiming to have a new college in Amer ica ( vide Dr. Coke s Missions ) . I wish I had a good drawing or engrav ing of your college edifice , and a history of the college . I have the printed charter ; wish for a proof of the old seal , with the explanations thereof . Would you favor me with the history 1 ? Dr. Evans has offered an account of the Bristol Academy . If you are too busy , could not Dr. Drowne draw it up 1 I wish I could see Mr. Maxcy s handwriting . I have a copy of Eobinson s History of Baptism for your acceptance . Hope to send it next month , with an article ordered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian love to your good lady . I remain , affectionately and truly , yours , /z/ p. g. i d are no t dictate , but if the Register meets the approbation of the American brethren , perhaps each Association would say what num ber they would certainly take , and appoint the clerk , or some other brother , to convey materials for me to Boston , Philadelphia , or New York , from time to time . In December of this year , Dr. Manning addressed a letter to the Rev. William . Richards , LL . D. , of Lynn , England , to which Mr. Richards thus replies . The letter , it may be added , did not reach Providence until nearly four months after Manning had passed from the scenes of his earthly labors . LYNN , IN NORFOLK , OLD ENGLAND , June 6 , 1791. /z/ Embracing an opportunity which has suddenly and unexpectedly pre sented itself , of sending to America a packet by a private hand , I can do little more than just to acknowledge the receipt of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made its way here about the middle of last month , via Liverpool and Birmingham . I sincerely thank you , sir , for this favor ; and I rejoice exceedingly in the prospect which your letter exhibits of the growing greatness and the increasing felicity . and prosper ity of America . I have long been partial to that country , and at a very early period of my life ( sixteen or seventeen years ago ) was on the point of removing from Britain thither . The war deterred me then , and for some years after , from accomplishing my purpose ; and having been set tled in this place some years when the peace took place , I found it rather inconvenient then to quit the country . Should I live a few years longer , it is still probable that I shall remove , but it is most likely that that re moval will be to Wales and not to America . I am and have always been very much attached to my dear native country ; but I should like it much better were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a branch of the corrupt British empire . As to the issue of my late controversy with Mr. Carter , my last piece , The History of Antichrist , brought it to its conclusion . I have never seen my opponent since , but he has repeatedly sent me his friendly compli ments , and invited me to call upon him whenever I should pass through his neighborhood , but it has not suited me to pay him a visit yet . Our Independent brethren have treated their poor Baptist neighbors somewhat more civilly since this controversy took place than they were wont to do . In these counties of Norfolk and Suffolk they are a very powerful body . That party , sir , as I suppose you know , originated here , and have con tinued here ever since , as numerous and respectable as in any part of Britain . Their ministers are in general men of considerable abilities and learning , while the Baptist ministers , on the contrary , are possessed of but a moderate share of either . The former seemed conscious of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter with the most manifest contempt . In short , sir , I am the first of the Particular Baptists , and even of the Baptist denomination , who has had the temerity to accept a challenge from or to enter the lists with a Norfolk or Suffolk Indepen dent . I hope the adventure was not altogether useless to the Baptist cause . The Independents have never since discovered the least disposi tion to oppose us again in print ; and it is the general opinion that it will be long before they will attempt to provoke the Baptists into another paper war . Many of them were convinced , during the debate , that the Pedobaptist scheme was not tenable , and they of course joined us ; and not one was known to be confirmed , in the mean time , in that scheme . /z/ Since the conclusion of this dispute , I have been called , by the unani mous voice of the Welsh Baptists , to engage in another of a similar na ture with the Presbyterians and Independents of the Principality , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who were likewise strongly supported by the Whitefieldites , a very numer ous body in that country . The person intrusted by them with the direc tion of this war is a Mr , Benjamin Evans , a very popular minister in Cardiganshire , very dexterous and very obstinate in debate , and a perfect adept in the sophist and the quibbler s trade . He has already published three pieces , and I am now about beginning my third piece in reply . What will be the issue of this war must be left for time to determine . My op ponent , by the vigor and violence of his exertions , and frequent rallyings and renewals of the combat , seems to think that he has a great deal at stake . He , too , and his brethren , took it for granted that he was greatly superior to any that the Baptists could call out to oppose them in the Welsh language . God grant that the truth may not , in this hard strug gle , be anywise dishonored by its very unworthy advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some very pleasing and happy effects , and that the Baptist interest is likely to be considerably benefited by it . I sent a copy of my first Welsh tract to your good Brother Dr. Samuel Jones , and had you known the language I should have been very happy to have presented you with another , and submitted it to your examination . I deem these much superior to my English pieces . They cost me much more thought , and I bestowed much more pains upon them every way . Some suppose that the piece I have now on hand will be the last of this controversy , but that seems to me rather doubtful . I almost think that some things I shall advance this time will provoke some kind of a reply . Nor am I at all anxious about that matter , so long as our countrymen continue to give us a patient and attentive hearing . I am willing to give my labor , and my Welsh brethren seem at present as willing to be at the expense of printing what I write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wales . Some churches there are the largest we have in Britain . That of Lanjloffan , in Pembrokeshire , which is the largest of all , consists of between eight hundred and nine hundred members . The great increase of the Welsh Baptists is seemingly what provoked their Pedobaptist brethren to commence this quarrel with them . I hope they will not in the end have any cause to triumph over us. /z/ I have had some thoughts of writing the Life of Roger Williams . Could you , sir , tell me where he was born , or add any materials towards his history , over and above what Mr. Backus s history contains " ? I have some of his works which Mr. Backus never saw . He is with me , in sev eral respects , a favorite character . I am sorry to hear of the smallness of your fund , and of your pecuni ary difficulties at the college . I wish the British Baptists would take your case under consideration , and afford you some effectual aid . They ought to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be an easy matter to per suade them to it , unless some of the Londoners , and other opulent Bap tists , were to take it up . I thought your library was more considerable , and am sorry to find it is not . The Bristol Library is now a very capital one by the addition of the collections of Drs . GifFord and Llewelyn , and especially the latter , which was a very excellent one . I wish some others in this country would bequeath their collections to your college . I have myself near fif teen hundred volumes , some of them of value . But a man in my situa tion , in very moderate circumstances , and with a very small salary from the congregation , and having withal an aged mother to provide for , a man in such a situation , I say , must make no resolution in matters of this kind . Perhaps my circumstances when I die may not admit of my dis posing of my books as I might have wished . Therefore please to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must take my leave . May every blessing attend you , is the earnest wish and prayer of Your sincere , affectionate , and faithful friend , brother and servant , /z/ P. S. Is there any truth , sir , in the reports , which our public papers daily circulate in this country , of very dreadful ravages committed by the natives among your people about Kentucky and other back-settlements ? I suspect it is only a contrivance of our Government for the purpose of checking the progress of emigration , and to persuade the good people of Britain that there is not so blessed a country anywhere as their own . Our papers are in like manner stuffed with falsehoods relating to the state of things in France , and the proceedings of the National Assembly . These tricks will not always serve their purpose . I received a letter lately from Mr. Curtis , son-in-law to the late Mr. Robinson . The second volume of Mr. Robinson s long-expected work is now in the press . It is not intended to print any more than seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I suppose it will soon become scarce . It was the author s design to have called it the First Volume of the His tory of the Baptists ; but as he did not live to complete his plan , or to finish any more than this volume of it , it is , by the advice of Dr. Abra ham Rees , to be entitled Ecclesiastical Researches . I am sorry to learn that there are still near four hundred copies of the History of Baptism unsold . Dear sir , pray pardon the intolerable length and blunders of this scrawl . When I began , I little thought I should scribble half so much , nor indeed did I expect that the opportunity would permit me to do so , as I thought the messenger could not stay . Excuse me this time . Mr. Richards 1 was a native of South Wales . At the age of twelve he had been at school only one year . From this time till the twenty-fourth year of his age , when he entered the academy at Bristol , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vigorous and per severing . He remained at the academy in Bristol two years . After preaching for a short time as an assistant to Dr. John Ash , of Pershore , he accepted an invitation from the Baptist Church at Lynn to become their pastor , and entered upon his public ministry in that town July 7 , 1776 , where he continued to reside more than half of the time as pastor of the church till his death , which oc curred in 1818 , in the sixty-ninth year of his age . Mr. Richards seems to have been a man of considera ble learning , particularly in English and Welsh history , and in the Welsh language and literature . His writings are his torical , political , and controversial . 2 His most important work is The History of Lynn , in 2 vols. 8vo . Dr. Evans says of it : " It is not only well written , the style perspic- i See Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Rev. William Richards , LL.D. , by John Evans , LL.D. , of Islington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his writings , comprising nearly the whole , see under his name in the catalogue of the college library . /z/ nous and manly , but it is replete with information as well as entertainment . " His review of Noble s Memoirs of the Protectoral House of Cromwell is characterized by Lowndes 1 as " severe , but at the same time just . " " His Dictionary of Welsh and English , " says Dr. Evans , " a work of minute and wearisome labor , is in high repute . " Mr. Richards was of the General Baptist denomination , and a strong advocate of religious liberty . It was his love of the liberal character of the college which induced him to bestow upon it his library , as appears from the follow ing passage in his Memoirs : " Mr. Richards had corresponded with Dr. James Manning , once President of the Baptist college in Rhode Island . From this gentleman he learned the liberal constitution of that respectable seminary , and for some years previous to his death meant to bequeath to it his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , whether it was still conducted on the same liberal footing , in which case he should cherish the same generous intentions towards it . " This inquiry was answered by Dr. Messer , then Presi dent of the college , in a letter from which we extract a single passage : " Though the charter requires that the President shall forever be a Bap tist , it allows neither him , in his official character , nor any other officer of instruction , to inculcate any sectarian doctrine . It forbids all relig ious tests ; and it requires that all denominations of Christians , behav ing alike , shall be treated alike . This charter is congenial with the whole of the civil government established here by the venerable Roger " Williams , who allowed no religious tests , and no preeminence of one denomination over another ; and none has ever been allowed unto this day . This charter is also congenial with the present spirit of this State and of this town . " /z/ Gratified with this letter , Mr. Richards , in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , and which he hints in his letter to Dr. Manning , bequeathed his books , consisting of about thirteen hundred volumes , to Brown University . This was the most important donation that the library had as yet received . It is a singular fact , that his will was made on the very day on which the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him by the college . Mr. Rich ards had received no intimation that the honor was in tended for him , nor did he live to hear that it had been bestowed . The library which he thus bequeathed is in many re spects valuable . It contains a considerable number of Welsh books , a large collection of works illustrating the history and antiquities of England and Wales , besides two or three hundred bound volumes of pamphlets , some of them very ancient , rare , and curious . The collection is particularly valuable for its treatises on civil and reli gious liberty . The original manuscript catalogue of Mr. Richards s library has recently come into our possession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Evans , in his account of Brown University , appended to his Life of Richards , says : " Whilst the library of my friend Richards remains amongst them , to perpetuate the name and character of its donor , may it urge its worthy President , as well as the members of this truly respect able institution , to the continued exercise of that spirit of liberality which induced an honest Cambro-Briton , at the distance of three thousand miles , to mark and reward it . " The last letter from Manning of which we have any /z/ account , is addressed to his college classmate and life-long friend , the Rev. Dr. Smith : PROVIDENCE , 4th June , 1791. /z/ Yours of Feb. 15th ult. came to hand three months to a day after it was written , so that we now stand on even ground . As you say of mine , it met a welcome reception . I am sorry it has not been in my power to provide for Mr. Messer agreeably to my wishes and ideas of his merit . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall ; but Mr. Alden , of senior standing , appears to incline to fill the place . If so , there will be an opening at Taunton in the academy which he will leave . I hope that Mr. Messer may be accommodated at one or other of these berths . Please to present my best respects to him , and tell him he shall have my interest . Ere this comes to hand , the news of the departure of our two good friends Messrs . John Jenckes and Nicholas Brown must have reached vou . Providence , church , and society are bereaved indeed ! But Jesus lives , and lives to support his cause when earthly supporters fail . The affairs of the college do not prosper as I could wish . With the twenty-two who graduated last fall , we have lost twenty-nine this year , which is a great defalcation from our small number . More are about to come soon , but I think it will be some time before we shall make the number of last year good . Our number is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that early this spring his kitchen caught fire by accident , and consumed with it all their kitchen furniture , smoked meat , etc . Poor ill-fated man ! He is not to have his portion here . Well , I believe he is secure of it above . I am glad to hear that you found my friends the Newbolds agreeable . I saw Caleb at York a few days since , and he mentioned you with great affection , as also all the eastern people to whom he was introduced . I saw none of your relations to the west ward , as my journey was hasty and attended with business . Nothingremarkable in the Middle States in a religious way , save that Brother Foster and people are very happv and prosperous . The Second Church rent again , and in a miserable situation . Our old friends generally well . My brother Enoch died in February last , and John Manning , Esq. , my cousin ; also Aunt Randolph , wife of Uncle Ephraim . The people of Providence have chosen Mr. Maxcy for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gives very general satisfaction , and prom ises usefulness . Religious impressions are not all erased from the minds /z/ of the people here . With best respects to you and lady , in which Mrs. Manning joins , Your old friend , /z/ Dr. Manning , as his correspondence shows , had repeat edly and earnestly requested his people to seek for a proper person to succeed him in the ministry . This he did , not because his interest in preaching had diminished , but rather on account of his multiplied duties as President of the college , which would not permit him to do justice to his flock . " At length , in a most honorable way , he re signed his pastoral office . " On the last Sabbath in April , 1791 , a few months only before his death , he preached to the people of his charge his farewell sermon . The occa sion was one of unusual solemnity . For twenty years he had been to them their spiritual guide . Under his teach ings and influence the church had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society had become large and flourishing . Revivals had attended upon his min istry , so that again and again he had come to them " in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ , " announcing to not a few " glad tidings of great joy . " Scores of his hearers he had led down into the baptismal waters . And now , as he uttered from the pulpit his last affectionate ad dress , and , as if in prophetic anticipation of his approach ing end , expressed the improbability of his ever preaching to them again , sorrow filled their hearts , and their emo tions found utterance in sobs and tears . At a meeting of the corporation held on the 13th of April , Dr. Manning had notified them to look out for a successor to fill his place ; and shortly after preaching his farewell sermon , he had made a request in writing for a meeting of the Baptist society , to make arrangements for /z/ finishing the meeting-house and lot , stating in this re quest that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular presentiment of his approaching mortality , can never , perhaps , be ascertained . It proved , alas ! to be but too well founded . On Saturday , July 23d , he dined at the hospitable table of his friend Mr. John Brown . On Sabbath morning following , while uttering the voice of prayer around the domestic altar , he was seized with a fit of apoplexy , in which he remained , but with imper fect consciousness , till the ensuing Friday , when , about four o clock in the morning , he expired , in the fifty-fourth year of his age . The sudden death of a man who was universally es teemed and loved , and who had filled , for so many years , such various and commanding stations of usefulness and trust , produced throughout the entire community the most profound sorrow , reaching to every part of the city in which he lived . When , a month previous , his intimate friend and associate Nicholas Brown , whose munificence had flowed in a thousand channels , and whose example had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene which he had so long adorned with his presence and enriched with his bounty , it was to be expected that there should be , as there was , a general expression of sor row and regret . But that the removal of a Christian min ister , and a teacher of science and letters , who possessed none of the advantages of wealth , but whose later years , on the contrary , had been oppressed by economic solicitude and care , should produce a regret so universal and so deep , " is a pleasing homage " adopting the language of Robert Hall on a similar occasion " to the majesty of moral power and intellectual greatness . " /z/ The corporation immediately assembled in the college hall , when the death of the President was announced by the Hon. Jabez Bowen , LL.D. , Chancellor . Among other demonstrations of respect and affection for the deceased , a committee , consisting of the Rev. Dr. Hitchcock and Messrs . John Brown and George Benson , was appointed to wait on Mrs. Manning , and express to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late worthy husband . " Messrs . Joseph Russell , Welcome Arnold , and George Benson were also appointed a committee to superintend the funeral , the expenses thereof to be defrayed by the corporation . On Saturday , July 30 , the next day after his death , the remains of Dr. Manning were conveyed from his residence to the college hall , where the funeral solemnities were performed by the Rev. Dr. Hitchcock , at that time the pastor of the Congregational church in Providence , and one of the most active Fellows of the college . " The fu neral , " says Prof. Goddard , " though a public one , was no empty pageant . Multitudes flocked to the college , to look for the last time upon a face which had so often beamed upon them in kindness ; and multitudes followed him to the grave which was so soon to hide him forever from their sight . " Indeed , the funeral , in the language of the Provi dence Gazette , was thought to " have been the most nu merous and respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a hearse , 1 was borne to the north burying-ground , where it now rests by the side of Nicholas Brown , in the family lot . " United in life , in 1 We have it upon the authority of the late Mr. John B. Chaoe , that at Dr. Manning s funeral a hearse was used for the first time in Providence . It was imported from England . /z/ death they are not separated . " The following was the or der of the funeral procession : /z/ On the ensuing Sabbath , an eloquent and impressive funeral sermon was preached in the Baptist meeting-house , by the Rev. Perez Fobes , LLJX , pastor of the Congrega tional church in Raynham , Mass. , and also Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy in the college . A sermon was also preached on the same day by the Rev. Dr. Maxcy , Manning s successor . Both these sermons were afterwards published . From the former we can not forbear making brief extracts : " The amiable Manning has given up the ghost ; and where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him presiding with mild dignity and parental affection , greatly beloved by every member of that collected family ; not in the house of God , where he often met you ; nor in the pulpit , where you have so frequently heard him preach the glad tidings of great joy ; not at the communion-table , breaking to you the bread of life , and praying for the health of languishing souls ; not in his own house , with his family and friends around him , where he was ever known as the revered head and illustrious example of religion , of government , and of every domestic and social virtue . No , he is not here . " /z/ " The corporation of the college , with the instructors and students , all feel and recognize the loss . Their hearts echo to the voice of mourning , to the deep-toned bell , and to all the badges of sorrow . With multitudes around us , we have dropped the involuntary tear . We have felt the sigh unbidden heave , and followed the hearse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourners , all united in the attestation of high esteem and affection for the lamented man of God . We are witnesses , and God also , how piously , and justly , and unblamably he lived among us , we are witnesses to the amiableness of his natural temper . How pleasing his condescension and affability ! How conspicuous his candor and im partiality , even in circumstances of peculiar trial ! These , added to a strong mind , well furnished with useful learning , and with ample re sources for eloquence , popularity , and pleasing address , rendered him highly esteemed through the large circle of his acquaintance . But , alas ! all these amiable and useful qualities could not exempt him from the fate of mortals . " To the foregoing , we add several letters by Dr. Man ning s intimate friends , announcing his death , together with extracts from a Commencement oration , and the circular letters of the Warren and Philadelphia Associ ations . The following letter is addressed to the Rev. Dr. Hezekiah Smith : BOSTON , July 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that will give you pain , but you must know it . Dr. Manning was taken with a fainting fit last Lord s Day morning , at family prayer , and expired yesterday morning , at halfpast four o clock . The complaint was of the apoplectic kind . He had no senses from the time he was taken . Great the loss to his amiable wife , great to the college and Baptist interest in general . But the Lord reigns ; submission to him is our certain duty . We must immediately look around for a person to fill his place ; but where to find him I know not . What think you of Mr. Allison , or Dr. Jones ? Has the former had a public education ? Or has the latter the various qualifications for a Presi dent ? You and I must exert ourselves on this occasion . Friends at Providence and elsewhere will expect it . Write freely to me on this sub ject . I suppose it will be best that Mr. Howcll be desired to preside at /z/ the next Commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adieu . Yours , /z/ The following letter to the Rev. Dr. Samuel Jones gives particulars of Manning s death and funeral . It was written , it will be observed , in behalf of the members of the cor poration of the college , and in an informal manner , desig nates Mr. Jones as Manning s successor in the presidency . PROVIDENCE , Aug. 3 , 1791. /z/ Before these lines will come to your hands you will doubtless have heard the melancholy tidings of the death of our late worthy President Manning . He departed this life about four o clock on Friday morning , the 29th ult. , after an illness of only five days , during which time he discovered little or no signs of reason . His funeral was attended last Saturday . It was the largest and most solemn that I have seen in this place . I need not tell you that his death is universally lamented by all ranks of people , but the loss is more severely felt by the corporation of the college , and by the students under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and celebrated for many shining abilities which peculiarly qualified him to preside in it , we are apprehensive that the institution may suffer a temporary relapse , unless some known and established char acter can be induced to supply the vacancy soon . At a meeting of as many of the corporation in this town as could be readily convened to take into consideration measures relative to the en suing Commencement , some conversation passed about the election of a President , when it was the voice of all present that I should write to you on the subject , and call on you for assistance on this occasion , so critical to the interests of the college . It is our unanimous and very earnest re quest , dear sir , that you will come to our help . The eyes of the corpora tion seem fixed on you for a successor to President Manning . From my long acquaintance with you , I have not the least doubt of your disposition to serve the best interests of mankind . A door seems now opened in divine Providence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents I know you possess . Let me entreat you to /z/ consider the application weightily . I am sure you will do it sensibly . I am to request a line from you in answer , by the first post after the re ceipt of this letter , or as soon as you find it convenient to give us an an swer to the subject of it , and I have it in charge in particular and very ur gently to request your attendance with us at the ensuing Commencement . Pray give my respects to Mrs. Jones , by whom I trust I am still re membered , and to any others in your good family to whom I may be known , and to inquiring friends . With very great esteem , I remain , dear sir , Your affectionate friend and very humble servant , /z/ To the Rev. Dr. Rippon , of London , the Rev. Isaac Backus , under date of Aug. 19 , 1791 , writes : " I was with President Manning two days in June past , and when I parted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little thought of its be ing the last parting for time , as at any parting we ever had . But near night , on July 29 , I received a line from Providence , informing me of his decease at four o clock that morning . I went there the first instant , and met the college corporation the next day , who have thought of Dr. Jones for his successor , if he can be obtained ; but we have no idea of obtaining any man who will equal President Manning in all respects , at least soon . His extensive knowledge , fervent piety , constant study to be serviceable to mankind , his easy access to every class of people , with his gift of governing so as to be feared and loved by all , where keen envy did not prevail , rendered him the most accomplished man for that sta tion of any one I ever saw . Yet , in the midst of his usefulness , he is gone , as universally lamented as any man that I have known . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death of Rev. President Manning " was delivered by Sim eon Doggett , of the class of 1788 , then a candidate for the Master s degree . Mr. Doggett was a tutor in the college from 1791 to 1796 . He afterwards had the charge of an academy in Taunton , Mass . He was pastor of the Congregational church in Mendon , Mass. , from 1815 to 1831 , and from the latter year to 1846 was the pastor of the /z/ Congregational church in Raynham . He died March 20 , 1852 , in the eighty-seventh year of his age . From his ora tion on Manning , which is preserved in manuscript among the college archives , we present extracts : He is gone , alas ! never to return . No more , Manning ! must thou . grace that sacred desk with thy majestic presence . No more shall the temple of the Lord seem like the gates of heaven from the sweet droppings of thy lips . No more shall Christian assemblies be moved , be pleased , be instructed , be enraptured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout heart up to the throne of God . No more shall thy concil iating tongue and precious counsels be heard in church and state . Thy placid countenance , thy pleasing converse , thy soft and graceful manners shall no more delight the friendly circle . No more shall you , respected patrons of yonder seat of learning , boast of the shining character of your President and friend . No more shall we , my dear elder brothers , sit in council with our wise , our mild , our beloved President O , relent less Death ! not even the worth of a Manning could elude thy stroke . But in the midst of his usefulness , when that nursery of science , planted and reared by his fostering hand , extending its branches , began to require all those abilities to inspect and preserve it which were exerted to rear it ; when it was under his watchful eye and industrious hand flourishing in all the beauties of knowledge , and moulding human nature into her most pleasing forms ; when he began to see and rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all his glory , cruel Death ! thou hast suddenly snatched him away , and hurried him to the grave Though these his exer tions to increase knowledge were almost unparalleled , yet merely to in crease knowledge was not his end , but the means , the end of which was to regenerate the heart and to advance the Redeemer s kingdom . Hence , while engaged to promote learning , he was still more engaged to promote religion . Of this all his pupils are witnesses who have seen his devotion and enjoyed his instructions . How naturally at our college exercises would a very slight connection lead his discourse to moral and religious subjects ! Upon these subjects , with what additional ardor would he dis course ! These occasions seemed to add new life to his faculties . They would add warmth to his heart , brightness to his understanding , and elo quence to his tongue . And still more did his devotion ever show that his heart s desire and constant prayer to God was that true religion might /z/ flourish . And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian , societies within his extensive acquaintance , especially those of this town , are also witnesses . It was this which led him to the study of divinity , and finally made him so eminent in the ministry . It was this which caused him , like the primitive apostles , to travel through all parts of the country to instruct , to purify , to organize , and to confirm the church Perhaps no one of his age had a greater influence in the Redeemer s king dom ; and his usefulness was parallel with his influence . And was it not also this ardent desire for the triumph of religion that inspired him with such distinguished eloquence ? Few preachers of his age spoke like him . He moved , he pleased , he instructed all who heard him . Notwithstand ing the diversity of dispositions , and the indifference of hearts in Chris tian assemblies , his eloquence made its way to all . Sometimes clothing himself with the threatenings of the law , he seemed to thunder forth all the terrors of Mount Sinai , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . At other times , putting on the garment of mildness , the peace of the gospel , his eloquence breathed naught but be nevolence , diffusing tenderness , and melting all hearts into grief and love . Thus following this great man from his first appearance upon the stage of active life to his disappearance , we invariably find him holding in his left hand the classics , in his right the word of God , with his eye fixed on the good of mankind , widely diffusing , as he passed along , knowledge , and religion , and happiness . Here we might add his more particular character . We might amplify the majestic but mild beauties of his per son and appearance ; the vast resources of his mind ; the uncommon greatness of his acquirements , considering the activity of his life ; his remarkably amiable disposition ; his astonishingly popular talents , and his distinguished and inflexible virtue and piety Time not afford ing me the pleasure of further addressing the particular connections of this great man , I proceed to ask whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly be the object of detraction ? Alas ! the depravity of human nature , it could , it was . But mark the issue . Where now is detraction 1 Confounded with shame and remorse , she has forever hidden her head . The universal lamentation at his death , the surprising throng of mourners at his funeral , and the universal approbation of his character , have eternally stopped her mouth , and reflected her deadly shafts back upon herself , where they will continue to sting like serpents , and to caution her to be careful how she deals with real merit . " /z/ The circular letter of the Warren Association alludes to the death of Maiming as a great loss in Zion : " Should we close this letter without taking notice of the providence of God in the removal of two of our ministers by death the year past , we should betray a criminal inattention . The one is Brother Nathaniel Green , of Charlton , who hath long sustained a good character in our churches . The other was our much esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island College , whose abilities and usefulness were well known to us all , and whose attention to the interests of learn ing and religion justly claim our esteem . Oh that the great Head of the Church , in whom are all gifts and grace , would favor us with other per sons of equal accomplishments , that thereby the breaches in the walls of Zion may be built up . " From the circular letter of the Philadelphia Associa tion we also make an extract : " But our joys abate , while we reflect on the heavy tidings , so generally mentioned in your letters , of the death of our highly esteemed and dearly beloved brother , DR . MANNING ; who , engaged in the dearest interests of religion , of science , and the prosperity of his country , fell from the zenith of glory and usefulness . In the general loss we sustain an important part . No longer shall we enjoy his able counsels , his divine and persuasive eloquence , nor his personal friendship . But while we ti-ust he fell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspeakable , resignation becomes us . May the Lord sanctify to the churches and ministers of Christ the awful stroke , enable us to feel and faithfully discharge the duties devolv ing on us , and imitate his amiable example . " A review of Dr. Manning s life , as presented in the sev eral chapters of our work , affords a pleasing illustration of the truth which Cowper has so well expressed , " God gives to every man The virtue , temper , understanding , taste That lifts him into life , and lets him fall Just in the niche he was ordained to fill . " /z/ It only remains to add a few particulars relating to Man ning s personal appearance , habits , character , and influence . This we shall do in the language of his intimate friend , and early associate in the instruction of the college , the Hon. David Howell , who wrote his obituary notice , and who also penned the inscription upon the stone erected by the Trustees and Fellows of the college to his memory . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Providence Gazette for Saturday , Aug . G , 1791 : " In his youth he was remarkable for his dexterity in athletic exercises , for the symmetry of his body , and gracefulness of his person . His coun tenance was stately and majestic , full of dignity , goodness , and gravity ; l and the temper of his mind was a counterpart to it . He was formed for enterprise . His address was pleasing , his manner enchanting , his voice harmonious , and his eloquence almost irresistible . " Having deeply imbibed the spirit of truth himself , as a preacher of the gospel , he was faithful in declaring the whole counsel of God . He studied plainness of speech and to be useful more than to be celebrated . The good order , learning , and respectability of the Baptist churches in the Eastern States are much owing to his assiduous attention to their wel fare . The credit of his name , and his personal influence among them , have never , perhaps , been exceeded by any other character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , as the founder . He presided with the singular advantage of a superior personal appear ance , added to all his shining talents for governing and instructing youth . From the first beginning of his Latin school at Warren , through many discouragements , he has , by constant care and labor , raised this seat of 1 The likeness of Dr. Manning accompanying the present work was engraved from an original portrait , which has long been in the possession of Brown Uni versity . It was painted in the year 1770 , by Cosmo Alexander , a Scotch gentle man , who came from Edinburgh to Newport about this time , and who is said to have patronized Gilbert Stuart , and to have given to him his first lessons in drawing . He returned to Scotland in the winter of 1772 , taking young Stuart with him . An account of Alexander may be found in " Dunlap s History of the Arts of Design in the United States . " /z/ learning to notice , to credit , and to respectability in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more rapid prog ress or greater maturity , in the course of about twenty-five years . " Although he seemed to be consigned to a sedentary life , yet he was capable of more active scenes . He had paid much attention to the gov ernment of his country , and had been honored by this State with a seat in the Old Congress . In state affairs he discovered an uncommon degree of sagacity , and might have made a figure as a politician . " In classical learning he was fully competent to the business of teach ing , although he devoted less " time than some others in his station to the study of the more abstruse sciences . In short , nature seemed to have fur nished him so completely , that little remained for art to accomplish . The resources of his genius were great . In conversation he was at all times pleasant and entertaining . He had as many friends as acquaintances , and took no less pains to serve his friends than to acquire them . " His death is a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world . He is lamented by the youth under his care , by the churches , by his fel low-citizens ; and wherever his name has been heard , in whatever quarter of the civilized earth , the friends of science , of virtue and humanity will drop a tender tear on the news of his death . " His amiable lady , the wife of his youth , and the boast of her sex , with all her fortitude of mind , which is great , must have sunk under the distressing loss were she not sustained by divine grace . May Heaven con tinue to support her , for earth must have lost its charms . Few persons ever enjoyed a more excellent constitution , or better health . Increasing cor pulence , 1 occasioned chiefly by his confinement to the labors of his station ( for he was temperate in his diet ) , gave him some complaints of ill-health of late years ; but what in particular furnished him with a singular pre sentiment of his mortality , is unknown . " i Concerning Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of his pupils , thus writes : " His motions and gestures were so easy and graceful that ordinary observers thought not of his immense volume of flesh , and those who criticized , admired the manner by which it was spontaneously wielded . I do r , ot know that he had ever read Hogarth s Analysis of Beauty , but he moved in his line of grace . " /z/ Our task is done . We have endeavored to trace the origin , and to exhibit the early progress , of Rhode Island College , or , as it is now called , Brown University . So far as possible , we have allowed the writers , the actors , and the records of the past , to tell their own story in their own way , having no theories to advance , and no interests save those of truth and justice to subserve . That members of the Philadelphia Baptist Association planned the college in the outset , admits not even the shadow of a doubt . It was designed , in the language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorn human nature , and promote the true interests and happiness of mankind , " by disseminating sound knowledge and useful literature . Its main design , however , was to secure for the churches an educated ministry . For this its friends toiled and prayed , amidst difficulties and discouragements , growing out of indifference on the one hand , and opposition on the other . Under the auspices of its devoted President it be came a centre of influence , and a rallying point for the de nomination , greatly promoting , " says Manning , " Baptist principles , and the spread of civil and religious liberty throughout New England , and adding respectability to the Baptist profession . " We have traced the career of Dr. Manning from its commencement to its close , and , so far as our materials would admit , have made him his own biographer . Our readers have thus obtained a more correct idea of his character and life than could have been obtained by any formal delineation of his virtues as a man , or of his genius as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interests of the college appears to have been the ani mating motive of his conduct , and the improvement and elevation of the Baptist denomination through the college , /z/ the object and aim of his entire professional life . The sentiment , so beautifully expressed by Dr. South , that " the Spirit always guides and instructs before he saves ; and as he brings to happiness only by the ways of holiness , so he never leads to true holiness but by the paths of knowl edge , " was by no means an universal sentiment , it will be observed , in the days of Manning . The Baptists as a de nomination were not specially friendly to learning , and the provision for the education of their clergy was exceedingly limited . To the work of removing existing prejudices against collegiate institutions , and of securing for the de nomination to which he was attached the benefits of an educated ministry , he devoted his best energies . His men tal acquisitions , his distinguished piety , his great ministe rial excellence , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rare and so extensive an influence over the minds of men , were all alike consecrated to this one cherished object . For this he declined , at the begin ning of his public life , the call of the church at Charleston , having already committed himself to the interests of the college . For this he resigned his pastoral charge at War ren , greatly to the surprise and the regret of his people . For this he perseveringly labored amidst the discourage ments of poverty , the opposition of enemies , the indifference of friends , and the conflicts of war . To benefit the college he left its quiet shades , and the pulpit where his labors had been honored and blest , and entered the arena of political strife ; and when his object was attained , so far as it could be through his own personal exertions , he returned from the halls of Congress to his accustomed duties , resisting all the allurements of political life and the public distinctions to which his talents would naturally have entitled him . And toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gracious manifestations of the Divine presence , and en joying the emoluments of a large and flourishing church and society , which had been built up mainly through his exertions , he again and again requested his people to pro vide a successor in the pastorate , in order that he might give himself more exclusively to the care of the college , and to the great work of laying broad and deep the foun dations for an educated Baptist ministry . In all this " he labored , " says Prof. Goddard , " not for himself , but for others , and , in language breathing a holier inspiration than that of poetry , may be conveyed the grand moral of his life : Love thyself last ; Let all the ends thou aim st at be thy country s , Thy God s , and truth s . " The narrative has , in several instances , presented illus trations of sectarian bitterness , of which Manning and his associates were sometimes the objects , and also of the un fair dealings to which the college in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a part of the history of the times , and , we trust , only in the spirit of candor and of historical fidelity . The animosities and strifes of a hundred years ago have long since been buried , and both the college and its self-sacrificing founders are enshrined in the reverence and affection of all , of every ecclesiastical name , who have shared in the manifold benefits they have conferred upon mankind . May the record here made of the consecrated benevolence and the persevering efforts of our fathers stimulate the patrons and friends of Brown University , which now enters upon the second century of its exist ence , to renewed exertions on its behalf ; and may all its scattered sons , and the religious denomination especially whose present prosperity is so largely due to his intelligent /z/ devoted labors , hold in grateful remembrance the virtues , the talents , and the piety of JAMES MANNING . " Peace to the just man s memory , let it grow Greener with years , and blossom through the flight Of ages ; let the mimic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stream on his deeds of love , that shun d the sight Of all but heaven ; and , in the book of fame , The glorious record of his virtues write , And hold it up to men , and bid them claim A palm like his , and catch from him the hallow d flame .
