txt MEN 'S RIGHTS . I HAVfl always had a perverse'iaclination to the other side of the question , especially if there was little to be said for it . One hates to be smothered even under truth . What if all the world , as well as our senses , say that the shield is silver ? One wants the more to creep round to that solitary , dark corner yonder , and look out of the eyes of the one poor ghost who says that it is gold . For instance : this question of Woman 's Wrongs , or Woman 's Needs , as I prefer to call it . It is a truth so selfevident , so weighty , that it is too late for argument about it . It finds tacit , terrible words of its own in the envious , hungry eyes of the lean women crowding in the evenings into the doors of slop-shops and arsenals ; in that other mob of women , born pure as you or I , who , later in the night , stand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who carries her soul and body into the market for a husband . It is a tragedy more real to me than any other in life . But its reality oppresses us sometimes : takes away our breath like the p*le-m*le bloodiness of Hamlet . Is there no wholesome comedy left in the world ? One 's heart is so sore looking at women , that it is a relief to turn to the tyrants men , who are accused with all this misery , to find if they have not a word to plead on their side . I have a friend , a sensible young feliow , with homely practical ideas to suit his life , who fancies that men are in danger , in their turn , of losing some of their rights . His fancy has the more weight , because I think he represents the moderate and cool men , who leave the talking about this matter to those who flatter and sneer at us , or drive the women-leaders of the Rights movement into most unmanly rages by petting , and offered pap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , has neither gifts nor graces by which he will probably influence his age . He has no mania for leaving footprints on the sands of any time . He is like the majority of young men in the Middle States , mediocre in intellect , but well-meaning and industrious , hoping to make a moderate fortune , become a good citizen , husband , and father , and go through life creditably and honestly . Next week he is going into business for himself , in a small way , down on the wharf . " So far , good , " he says . " Where men are concerned , life is plain walking enough . If a m*n is my enemy , I knock him down , or he knocks me ; if he is my friend , I give him a helping shoulder when I can , lend him money when he is hard-up , am civil to his womenfolks , and , without any tears or effusion , I feel a hard tug within me when he dies . But it is the women : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose it is unreasonable and the old masculine tyranny in me , but I would like to know in what relation I am to stand to them ?

Since I began to listen to the story of their wrongs , the world is turned topsy-turvy . I 'm morally sea-sick . But how long is // this transition to last ? Whose fault is it that it lasts so long ? " As John is one of those who come in with the mob at the end of a reform , I advise him to shut his ears to the tumult , and attend only to his business down on the wharf . But how can he shut his ears ? The very air is filled with the protests of women , from France , England , and every city and village about us . Battle-cries from the stronger , groans from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , " cheated , manacled , with divine and stifled powers . " No wonder that John , who is easily convinced by noise , feels , he says , like Dante looking down the ruined sweep , and believes , consciencestricken , that these multitudinous souls are really pursued only by the cruelty of man 's will . " On this side , and ui that , above , below , It drives them ; hope of rest to solace them Is none , nor e'en of milder pang . " What is it they want ? What is it they do not want ? There is a savage reality in some of their needs . Suffrage , they cry ; emancipation from i bondage as old as the world ; equal wages and property-rights ; work to save them from prostitution ; and-God help us ! ! **food for them and their children . When I hear these cries , and the wild , contradictory remedies with which they vainly rush to each other , it brings back a passage from an old book of mine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , they wallowed for a while . " Then said Helpful : Why did you not look for the steps * " I fled the other way , ' said Christian . " For the1*e never was a slough in which there were not stepping-stones , if we looked for them with common sense and a little faith in God . That is my experience . Our grandmothers seem to have had firm ground under their feet . There is an old lady , on the other side of the fire , a keen-eyed , stiff little body , with broad , pure satin ribbon about her high cap , and a thick ring of Guinea gold on her finger-her troth-ring when she was seventeen . Girls were betrothed but once then , she tells me . When she talks of her formal courtship , of the miracles of chenille-work done between the halfyearly solemn tasks of storing away pork and preserves , of the old-fashioned reverence for old age , of the mild mental intoxication prbvided for women in " Faber on the " Prophecies , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpses of a life which , though narrow , was contented , *clean , and decent . What workwomen saw belonged to them then , they did without reluctance , without slighting , and without braggadocio . Is it so with us now ? But Eliza tells me , we have liberalized all that . The enfranchisement of her sex is at hand . Eliza is John 's sister* I see a great many girls like her nowadays . She has pale , striking features , a skin like dough , gray , thoughtful eyes ; her chest is flat ; her movements and whole bearing are full of unrest , and hint subtly at suppressed power . Women are not intimate with her , though she is generous and large-natured as a lion or a fine dog , and men do not understand her . Perhaps only one ever will , and him she should marry . The girls of her clique belong to the class who have more culture than money ; but they struggle less than their mothers did to keep up appearances ; even make jokes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or literary ; some of them make specialities of bugs or German philosophy ; most of them have written rejected poems for the magazines ; and , although they may have just left school , I hear them , in the evenings , discussing with the men Bismarck 's policy , or Herbert Spencer , or Renan , with light , authoritative touches of comprehension , that leave the old lady and me behind them breathless . Whether they condemn a philosophy , or dismiss a lover , or arrange their paniers and chignons , it is done alike with the same careless air of aplom1* and superiority . They would have me. think that woman 's brain , after its so long imprisonment , is like the vapory genie who escaped from the fisherman 's iron box , in the story ; there is nothing // on earth or sea which it can not cover and conquer . They are girls who do not marry early , as a rule . John has another sister , Nelly , whom her sister deems far below the true status of women  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawning through her last year of school , with her hands full of books , and both eyes on " thc beaux . " Since she was born , Ncll has been brimming over with inviting little coquetries ; and for my life I can see no harm in them ; they are just as pure as the cooing of the birds in Spring waiting to be chosen by their mates , or the perfume of the flowers by which they silently woo one another . The girls grow satirical when they talk of their grandmother and the lot of woman in her days . They look back upon the chenille , and pork , and preserving-work , as the butterfly on the grub from which it has escaped . They were examining some old ivory miniatures last night , and were annoyed , I saw , to find the features of these lastcentury women as refined as their own , and the vehicles of as subtle and strong minds . " Strange , " said Ehiza3 as she put them away , " that they could have been contented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mental hunger of women of this age , is the trait that separates them from all others . " That last sentence seemed to me to touch the germ of the whole matter . Suffrage , or work , any of the popular cries among us , are but so many expressions of this same mental hunger or unused power . Unused , and therefore unwholesome power . And , following , comes directly into view one marked trait about the women of the present time , as men see them , particularly those who live in large cities  --  a trait of which they hear but seldom . Men who flatter them , laugh coarsely at it ambng themselves ; and men like John , to whom there is nothing on earth so worthy of reverence as a good , pure woman , look on it astonished and incredulous . He thinks se cretly a great deal about the woman whom he will marry , and wonders where and how he will find her . He is awkward and shy when with them , fearing to hurt them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pure and good and tender . This matter of which I speak concerns him deeply , and the men like him . But it is fitter that I , being a woman , should speak of it than he . The most salient and apparent change in women , in the last few years ( I do not say the deepest ) , is not advance in intelligence , marked as that may be ; it is the growth in impurity . It is simply a transient effect of this roused and ungratified brain-power . The ordinary London or New York woman is too far advanced in the " progress of the age " to find employment for her awakened imagination or reason in housekeeping or in gossip ; too little to turn to art or science or even downright hard business . In self-defence , then , she listens to lascivious music , or looks at the living pictures of the ballet , where her passions at least are daintily played upon . She reads , or writes , as the case may be , novels in which few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women virtuous , or , advancing a step farther , she finds that but a mean and ignoble life for a woman which is sacrificed to the children whom God has given her ; and , on aesthetic principles , quietly does her share in building up the temples to murder , that openly face us in our most crowded streets . I begin with an extreme case ? Perhaps so . Yet hunger is not choice in its food , and there is reason to doubt whether the ordinary ahiment of all women in literature or art , now , is a whit more pure and wholesome than that of men , coarse as we declare their appetites to be . There is a class of subjects , the name of which would bring the red to the old lady 's cheek yonder , but with which it is the fashion of the day to make young girls thoroughly conversant . Ther ( is no need to send Nelly out of the room now , no matter what topic the matrons // may discuss . The terra iw*o*jnita of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it be otherwise ? She finds not only men , but women , whose names are tainted , among the leaders of fashionable society ; she sits beside her mother , , and sees her smiling at the bald indecency of the operabouffe without a blush ; she hears the social evil " coolly discussed as a social necessity . It is no wonder , then , that , night after night , Kelly herself may be seen , with back and bosom half-bared , whirlifig and perspiring in Dick French 's arms , while her mother looks placidly on . If I hint my disgust , I am told severely , that to the pure all things are pure , and that the obscene play and the waltz that sets Dick French 's blood on fire , if looked on vesthetically , are , to women , refined and innocent pleasures . I doubt if any man believes this . If , for lack of pure occupation for their brains and senses , women of society bring this offal to pollute their daily lives , they need not suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real nature of the substance from the men about them . Dick French , worn roui that he is , has joined the school of the critic of the Saturday Review . He asserts that all women are represented by these . He hints that he understands the lures that these d*icoUet* belles put forth . " It 's cursed hard on a fellow , " he says . " The extravagance of these women wo n't allow a man to marry ; yet they tempt him to do it with all the arts of the worst of the demi-monde . " Then he and his compeers adjust their eye-glasses , and lean against doorways , criticising the paces of the delicate young girls who are whirled past , as a trader might the slaves in the market . French goes too far . My little Kelly is not in the market ; she has her secret innocent dream of true-love and marriage some day , hid away in her heart . There is not one of French 's crew whom she would marry . When she unclothes herself immodestly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulterior purpose **29;138;TOOLONG of the moment . Custom has made her eyes familiar with indecency-worn away the defensive instinct of purity with which every woman is born ; but that is the worst that can be said of her . Yet , if her own blood be such ice , that the exposure of her person has no power to bring a blush to her cheek , does it matter nothing to her that pleased , unclean eyes rest on her , that half of the men who look on her mistake her motives and pity the degradation she undergoes in her effort to please them ? I use coarse language . The times are coarse . The state of society which can make a Swinburne possible , can bear a few plain words without detriment to its modesty . It is true that the evil is as yet confined to our large cities . God foI*bid that the fashi*niable fast girl of New York or Chicago should be received as the typical woman of America . She bears the same proportion to the women of the States that the feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet-blooded body . But this society assumes to stand foremost in refinement and culture , and can not object to have its claims tested . Besides , the feverish taint will spread . Men , I think , have some claim to be heard in this matter . The most debased among them will hold one thing sacred  --  the honor of his wife . He has a right to demand that it come to him untainted . Dull and plain fellow as is John , he has a right to claim from the woman whom he marries , and from the mother who rears her , that she shall not have been put in the market to parade her shape like an animal ; that she shall not have had her person handled by every row5 who frequents the ball-room ; that he shall not receive her hackneyed and brazen from flirtations ; and that her mind shall be clean as her body . This is a return to old-fashioned prudery . Yes . If the rusthetic culture of today demands the exploration of such foul fields by our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity for wider *careers for woman is to . render motherhood the rare ' luxury which it // has become in New England , let us , in the name of the good , pure God , go humbly back to the stagnation of our grandmothers ! I know quite well the answer ready for me . It is not women who have first tainted society and literature ; it is not weak , starving , ill-paid women who are to blame for this Gehenna of prostitution that underlies our social fabric . I do not think that the guilt of man has any thing to do with the responsiisility of women . To our own master we stand or fall . We have always claimed to be the moral element in hu-. inanity . The claim was never made so loudly as it is now by our spokeswomen . " Her right , " says one of the most earnest , " is to be ministered unto in carnal things ; her province is to minister in spiritual things . " Anothbr portrays venality disappearing from the courts , bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so soon as her pure foot shall be admitted over the thresholds . " Evil shrinks away abashed before the steps of the ideal woman . " But the real ? Men have a right , when claims like these are made , to demand their proof . We who boast of white garments , must show them white . How can we ask for the ten talents to be given to us , when we grow less and less able to hold that one talent of purity committed to our keeping ? Here is a reform more urgent than any which will follow suffrage ; yet women shut their eyes to the bare facts , and hurry by . There are other rights of men , which it would be worth our while to consider for our own sake . They are unfortunate in their manner of presenting them , it may be . It is too late for John , either to ignore his sister Eliza altogether , or to call her " a fair one , " and try to tie up these very keen eyes of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present posture of affairs better , perhaps , if he clapped her on the shoulder , and begged her , like a good fellow , to be done with complaining and haranguing , and look at the matter rationally , as one man with another . She has begun her argument with the peroration . The beginuing of every reform has been this outcry , unrest , groping , passionate demand ; but that is only the trumpetcall , the real struggle comes afterward . It is time the struggle began . So long as we cite our wrongs , and plead for standing-room in the world1 we gain that tender , valueless sympathy , so readily given , because we are women ; but as soon as we attempt to put our feet on the man 's preempted ground , we must prove our right to every inch by the hard logic of work well done . Our stakes must be driven as deep as his before we can take his long-held territqry from him . That is but fair . To begin at the beginning : I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole blame of what she calls the serfdom of woman I With but rare exceptions , she declares , they have been , in every nation , domestic slaves or petted playthings ; debarred from a share in the legislation of governments , which they were taxed to support ; debarred from a shve in the world 's work , which would have made them as independent , in mind and body , as was man . Hence both mind and body arc enfeebled , and marriage has become the sole approved means of earning subsistence . I suppose it is right that all reformers must be purblind in a measure ; if they only see the head of the nail they 're driving , they strike the harder blows . Those words-domestic slaves and petted toys-have a ring about them which Eliza likes . She has repeated them so often that they seem to her to cover the whole ground of argument , from Sarah in Abraham 's tent to the days of Mary Wollstonecraft . They seem to me as blatant as most popular cries . The condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . The larger brute makes his weaker mate grind his corn , and carry his 1om*d , in obeclience to the only law he knows-that of physical force . IP has been a different instinct which has hitherto assigned woman her place by the fireside in civilized countries . Eliza calls it an unjust instinct and fraught with evil . " Man is and has // always been the enemy of women , " cries one of these female reformers , in a sort of unintelligible rage , which the mention of a man always rouses in her . I do not want to argue that point . It is not of importance as concerns the justice now due to women who is to blame for her past position . Only , if we were told the history of any race-who , for three thousand years , had lived in daily intercourse with another , with a chance for the same culture , with the same language , seated side by side in perfect social equality , and yet who had remained in a state of subjection , debarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be apt to decide , sharply enough , either that the rights were not fitted for them by nature , or that their cowardice and hesitation to grasp them deserved the serfdom . There have been women-judges , soldiers , merchants , in every country and in every time ; women who were leaders in the state or in war or in trade ; and the readiness with which their ground was ceded to them , the applause with which their slightest merit was welcomed , prove how easily climbed was the path they trod , and how accessible to every woman , if she had chosen to cLimb it . It was not altogether the fault of the obdurate rock that it hid for so many years the gifts of manhood from the boy Theseus , but his own flaccid muscles and uncertain will , which failed to overturn it . When the time to use them had come , the rock was put aside , and the golden sandals and magic sword lay beneath which were to make his path easy and clear for him . My word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for real work , he did not vent his disgust at his own weakness in rage , and kicks against the stubborn stone . Again . Eliza , as the woman of the nineteenth century , naturally magnifies her office . It is so easy to include in one fell swoop of pity and condemnation all women who have gone before , to satirize them as pretty , half-souled lumps of matter ; unable , blind to the God-given rights of which they were deprived ; subject to the flatteries and wrongs of all Euphuistic tyrants , from licentious Solomon to unfortunate Doctor Todd . But  --  to go to the gist and marrow of the matter-what is the real difference between Eliza and her despised greatgrandmother ? The women of no age have lagged far behind the men in the mental culture belonging to that age . Yet there was a space between the foremost man and woman in the days of " Sidney 's sister , Pembroke 's mother , " and there is a like space now . It is hardly fair for Eliza to flaunt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength which she owes to the advance of her time-an advance in which men have assuredly been the pioneers . Putting aside this advantage , then , as irrelative , the difference between the women of the two eras is in the work which offers itself to them , not in their ability or faithfulness to their work . The wife of the farmer in Cheshire , in County Cork , or in our own dark and bloody Kentucky ground , found as much exercise for practical knowledge , for governing power , for skilful hands and ready brain among her cows , linenlooms , or mules , as the shrewd New York girl of to-day , setting types or measuring yards of muslin . If Eliza had ever chanced to meet one of those old Frenchwomen of the salons , at whom and at whose feeble imitations she rails , as at painted , useless butterflies , the would have found a new revelation in human nature to her  --  a something for which , beside the apparent outward graces , there had been required a variety of acquirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human natm'e , and an infinite tact in tI use of all her capital , which would have made up a dozen of the crude , half-taught *oung women who rush before the American public as its voluntary guides and instructors ,  --  woinenwho were true artists in their vocation and , though they never , perhaps , lifted a pen save to write the idlest and charmingest of notes , left broad , deep traces in the wOrld 's history , // became a fifth estate , with an influence as powerful and more subtle than any other . There is a great class of women who do not belong to any rank or age , upon whom the seventh and flaming vial of Eliza 's wrath is poured-women of whom my coquettish dumpling Nell is the embryo type . They look at us from every phase of art or literature , their loving , lovable faces surrounded by every halo which the hand of genius can lighten and color : Miranda , Juliet , Rose Bradwardine , Thackeray 's Amelia , all of Dickens ' heroines , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many exponents of the man 's ideal woman ,  --  the woman who , with accidentally more or less brain ( it matters little whether less or more ) , lives solely in and for man ; whose eyes may look outside of her home , and her hands there be moderately helpful ; but who in that home lives and moves and has her being . When she comes to die , if her husband , and children alone rise up and call her blessed , that is enough . She has well done a great work , and had an exceeding great reward . Eliza , that terrible iconoclast , is sick of this stupid idol ; she means to tear the pink-and-white doll down from her throne in the hearts of men , and set up the woman whom the times demand ; clear-eyed , large-brained , large-hearted , fitted by nature and training to be either seeress , orator , sea-captain , or clerk in a cooperative grocery . But men , Eliza , are mulish . They will treat you precisely as the Chinese would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deity with all politeness , with uplifted hands and gaping eyes of admiration , and then go home , and plump down on their knees before their own private little god behind the kitchen-door . The Domestic Woman has been on the throne so long , you understand ? It is sheer regard for her that has made royalty itself respectable in England for half a life-time . She is a great stumbling-block in your way , I know . She promulgates the idea that you , who talk of Woman 's Rights , belong to a class of long-haired men and Bloomer-trousered women , who have lost all faith in God or George Washington , and are bent on forcing her into a cold-water pack , and marrying her daughter to the first convenient mulatto . She knows a woman who writes a book by as inevitable marks as Satan by his betraying hoof and tail ; the uncombed hair , slippers down at the heel , slovenly house , and children going to perdition . There is no deceiving her on that point . During the war she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality or the faith of her husband , though far more bitter than he . When he was killed , she and her daughters ( whom she had failed to launch in the one respectable career , that of marriage ) , joined the great army of sewing-women , and are measurably comfortable in the meantime , as starving with the needle in one 's hand is a thoroughly womanly and anti " strong-minded " exit . The gods themselves can not fight against stupidity , says Eliza , and prays with all her soul , that the Domestie Woman may die out , and leave no successors . But she wo n't ' die out ; she wo n't be weeded out ; she will spring up , generation after generation , like the many-headed , sweet , toothsome clover ; and there are men who , till time shall be no more , will go on preferring the clover to the stateliest tree that shades the ground-obstinate fellows , of whom my friend John is one . He is a radical ; he urges that every career shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the polls also ; yet when he marries , it will doubtless be one of the old-fashioned , dependent , dull women . When Eliza has reformed a little farther , she may be clearer-sighted , and see the uses in this familiar dear type of woman and the world-old relations she holds . But Eliza and her class are like workmen cutting a tunnel ; just not they see nothing but the hill before them which they attack with such sounding blows : this road th ' *y make for human progress is a necessity , they // know ; all civilization stands stdll for them to finish it . When it is done , and they have gone farther up the heights , they will find perhaps how wide this world is , and that there is place and need and welcome in it , not only for this great path of progress , but for the quiet ground that is fruitful , and for the still , well-ordered homes , whose memory lies deeper in a man 's heart through life , and works greater changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven which he has never seen . To speak plainly , I believe that the old type of the woman , whose real life comes to her through the love of home , husband , and children , is irrevocably fixed by nature , in the hearts of all men and the majority of women , as the highest and best , and that the chief obstacle in the way of obtaining new work and wider careers for us now , is the mistake of our spokeswomen in ridiculing that old figure , and in declaring such work and careers incompatible with it . The quiet , retiring home-wife and homemother , with her strength or her sillinesses , all men have tried and tested ; but this new creature , who has no blush , whether her words are heard by one or a thousand , vociferously claiming to be man 's equal , politically and in mental stature , and his superior spiritually , is , justly or not , a something utterly distasteful to the masculine mind . It forgets that the women who have been most efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to the crowd . It reasons the matter out briefly enough . " If this is to be the result of making my daughter a clerk or engraver or physician , let her , in God 's name , stay at home , and take the only chance for women-get a husband , if she can . " And the daughter , in whose heart , after all , the strongest cord throbs at that thought of husband and child , is afraid , for that reason , to render herself distasteful to men , hesitates to throw away her chance , and stays at home , a heavy burden perhaps , both brain and body diseased from idleness , and work waiting for her without . If the hus band does not come soon , the innocent dream of true love and marriage begins to fade out ; she feels herself the one too many , at home and abroad , a mistake in life  --  the solitary one of God 's creatures who has neither use nor tie , and is in the world on sufferance . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can . She has a vague feeling that she is guilty of legal prostitution . But it would be so sweet to have a place as other women , a home and a baby of one 's own ! So the bargain and sale goes on . There is a fatal flaw in the working of the social machine ; here are the workers , and there the work . Yet the prejudice of men keeps them apart . A woman who chooses to work believes that she must lose caste , the chance of marriage , be ridiculed and underpaid . And for this prejudice against the new position for women , the noisy vehemence and unwise boasts of the leading reformers , is , I fear , responsible . Yet mistaken though they may be in minor points , no woman ought to have for them one word that is not grateful . They are pioneers in the hardest and noblest work of the age in this country , next to the abolition of slavery . If they suppose that it is a new path that is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , it is an error which time and nature will set right . The facts of the case are so plain that the weakest girl can understand them . The number and the helplessness of our sex have become a drag in the country . There is a large surplus , in every State , of women who have no man on whom to lean for support . The old prescribed methods , of sewing and teaching , will not provide one eighth of them with food ; and they must live . That is the urgent and immediate necessity . More work , and more wages . Suffrage and property-laws are of secondary importance . Whether the necessity for new occupations for woman is an outgrowth of these circumstances solely , or also a demand of her enlarged mental power , matters very little ; the problem to be // solved is whether the old idea of woman is to be displaced by them . Sneer as the reformer will at the " fireside angel " or the " sanctity of home , " these catchwords are hints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition is the great intangible difficulty in her way to-day . Look closely for a moment or two , and see how this acts . Eliza is almost past the age for marriage . There is a strong inbred truth in the girl that has hindered her from marrying for a *settlement . There are two or three servants employed in the house , so that she has no work to do beyond making her own dresses and hats . Her father is an old , gray-headed man , who has reached that age when he should have time to take breath , after his long life 's work , before he goes hence and is seen no more . But he has not time ; he works harder than ever . There are two girls besides Eliza and Nelly , and they must be dressed and maintained in a certain style , to make suitable marriages . He goes early to work and comes back late , feeble and anxious , while they are stitching at the old dresses and hats , to make them look like new ones ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go out to dance the German , or make that husband-market in any other customary way . But they do no more than this , for fear of losing caste , though there is not one of them who has not a stronger brain and sounder body than either father or brother . Some day the old man will die , on whom they have been content to rest this heavy weight till the last . There is an insurance on his life of a few thousand dollars ; ani on that , I suppose , they will eke out an anxious , scanty living , half-starving indoors to keep up the miserable show of gentility , cherishing every lingering , poor remnant of beauty , in the hope of making even yet that approved disposition of themselves , balked at every turn by the want of a few dollars , their natural tastes stifled and ungratified , their natural power left unused to gnaw and torture them within to the end . But with Eliza 's progressive ideas , she can not be cowed by the fear of losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . She is what is called a capable woman-shrewd , quicksighted , cool and prompt in action , thoroughly fitted for trade ; if she had been born a boy , she would , by this time , have made for herself a steadygrowing business , and been known in the stock-market as a live man . But she has the mania of all intelligent girls for becoming a teacher of the public . She writes poems , sapped out of Emerson and Walt Whitman ; argues for suffrage in season and out , giving weak dilutions of Mrs. Dali 's powerful , downright logic . She is in doubt whether to begin lecturing , or to go on the stage and restore the ' legitimate drama . But to open a bookstore , or to learn the furbusiness as a clerk ! As an almost invariable rule , the young woman , nowadays , who feels within herself a hunger for some other work than that of her hands , believes herself qualified , by right of that hunger , for the very highest work . She must leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all-forgetting the innumerable trades , head-and-hand crafts that lie beneath , in which the majority of men find ample fields for all their observation , skill , and ingenuity . She forgets that the spirit of God filled Bezaleel to enable him to devise cunning works in gold and silver and brass , as much as it did Aaron , who spoke well for Him . She is dazzled by the stately journey of such a life as Lucretia Mott 's , and the great triumph that came to close that work to which she was called , and does not understand that they only labor worthily who confine themselves to the labor for which they are qualified , whether it be that of freeing a people or of blacking boots . I feel how unfitted I am to give an opinion on a subject to which such women as Caroline Dall have nobly devoted years . of research and labor ; yet I can not but fear that , in their struggle to lift their sex up to higher ground , they will place us where we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , be urged to press into the pulpit as into the other learned professions ? The humblest among us is called of God to preach His gospel in action ; but preaching it in words is another thing . It is taking a portion of the water of life and passing it through the conduit of our own individual thought and character . It is not a mere pious intention to do good , or a few years ' drudgery over Hebrew and Greek or Articles and Confessions , that can justify a man in elevating himself as an exponent of divine truth . One needs only to listen to the dull platitudes that fall so far wide of the wants of the age , to the differing acrid dogmatisms , to the truisms , old and sapless and dry , which are dealt out to us Sunday after Sunday , from too many pulpits , to feel the truth of this . If the most cultured and enlightened class of men in the . cities are , as a rule , not members of the Christian church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late years have been *tchieved under the name of Humanity instead of Jesus , it is because there is too much of this kind of preaching ; because earnest and thoughtful men have been turned away from that Helper whose teaching solves the problem of this time as of every other , by the shallow verbiage in the pulpit of many of the men who , in their home-lives , are not unfitted to be His ministers . I confess that I , for one , will be sorry when women are admitted into the paid ministry . Not that to some of them , as to some men , the message may not come which will burn in the soul until it be delivered , or life teach some individual lesson which may be fit for the healing of other souls . When that is the case , they will speak . God 's true messengers , in all ages , have found utterance . But the salary , and the respectable position attached to the professional salvation of souls , would , under present circumstances , be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to men ; and a woman would be less likely to forget herself in the pulpit , be more apt to be swayed by a love of ap probation than her brother , and so lower the standard of the Christian religion even more than he has done . I may be wrong in this . But as man has been so ready to rush with hasty steps into this sacred office , only to show so often his own weakness and to bring it into disrepute , let us not be in haste to follow him . I would be less eager than Eliza , too , to claim what she velemently terms her natural and inalienable right of suffrage . It galls her beyond endurance , on election-day , to watch ignorant , drunken boors-Dutch Jake and Irish Jimcrowding to the polls , while she is forced to sit at home , passive and useless . It seems to me that if Eliza 's motive is the good of her country , she might be contented to stay away from the ballot-box , if she must take with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant than their husbands of politics . It does not anger me so much that " women , negroes , and idiots " are together deban*ed the use of the ballot , so long as neither women , negroes , nor idiots are , as a mass , fitted to use it intelligently . Of what avail would it be to throw heavier weights of ignorance headlong into the political scale , oaly for a few skilful hands to arrange and manipulate , precisely as they are doing now ? When the right of suifrage is restricted to all by a certain amount of education , and thus the intelligent mind of the country made its dominant power instead of the gross matter-weight of sex and color , women and negroes may contentedly take their share in the government , both to its benefit and their own . My sympathies , I confess , are in no case so much with the prominent women of the country who aim at higher work , and whose every step wins prompter notice because they are women , so much as with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbling about in the slough because they can not see the steps ; the fifty thousand sewinghands in New York ; the seventy thousand intelligent women in New England , for whom there are literally no // husbands , for whom Mrs. Stowe urges domestic service ; but more than all , the countless young , educated girls in struggling families , through the whole country , whose brothers are healthily and happily at work , while they are indoors , their brains idle , morbid , discontented , shut into this narrow cell by the rules of respectable gentility , waiting for the husband , who may never come . If I had as many daughters as those with whom the Lord rewarded Job , and twice his wealth , they should each one have some head-or-hand craft by which , if need were , they could earn their own living . So far at least , like him , I would give them inheritance among their brethren . Here , in one house , is a brother who has quietly set aside all thought of marriage for himself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  a generous , noble act , though common enough . The girls accept it from " Charley " with selfish indifference , as a matter of course ; and Charley 's generosity does not hinder him from gradually sliding into loose old-bachelor ways , and seeking in haunts of which they have never heard even the names , amusement and excitement , of which , if he had a wife and children , he would never have felt the need . Take Mrs. A- , for instance , a bookkeeper 's wife , a woman with a better head for business than her husband . He has a salary of $800 , out of which a family of five are to be fed , clothed , and educated . Two of the boys are scholarly , clear-brained fellows , whom it was poor A- 's one dream of ambition to educate thoroughly and give a fair chance in life . They have both begun to learn a trade , as , being boys , they must do something to help keep the wolf from the door . Their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haggard woman in middle age ; has done her own work of cooking , sewing , nursing , to save the scanty eight hundred dollars . Was that the best she could have done ? " Is there no advice you can give me ? " writes a young girl . " I have enough of money on which to live . I never yet have seen the man whom I wished to marry . I am as intelligent and well-taught as my brothers . Would they be content to occupy their lives with a round of visiting , in a small country-town , with purposeless , unused study or fancy-work ? I can not write essays or tales ; I have nothing especial to say in them . I do n't succeed in teaching ; I am not naturally benevolent or fond of children . Yet I think there is some strength in me . Did God make me for nothing ? Surely , somewhere in the world , there is work for me to do ! " The work for her and for all of us to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the steps out of the slough , which we will not see . Women all stand waiting for some grand movement t. be made , which is to give them relief : suffrage to be granted , medical schools to be opened , Vassar Colleges established in every State , cooperative housekeeping to be . inaugurated , and the myriad of house-worries taken off their hands . The only help for each woman who wants work lies in herself . She lives , perhaps , in some small inland town . There is no opening for a teacher , if she even is thorough enough for one ; sewing pays poorly ; she has sent articles to the Atlantic and Harper , and never heard of them again . Very likely . How many men are fitted for teachers , or tailors , or authors ? What can she do ? or rather , what does some turn of mind or expertness of hands hint that she could best learn to do ? What would she turn to if she were a man ? To trade or farming , engraving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making chairs or photographs , raising bees or hanging paper ? Whatever it be , let her begin it now , as quietly as she can , and in as humble a fashion as is necessary , learning the trade as a man would do . Miss Penny , in a book published this year , gives five hundred suitable employments for women . I would reduce the number to three hundred and sixty , as those easily practicable , ' and in which women // in England and this country have actually been engaged. * " But what would people say ? " I do not think the question a weak one . I understand the shrinking soreness of heart with which a woman cowers before the tumult of wonder and sarcasm and jeers which she supposes will hail her appearance before the public . It will depend entirely upon yourself what they will say . If you are quiet , straightforward , and in earnest , most probably they will say very little about you . The world is quick to recognize a true motive or a sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The higher the order of people to whom you belong , the less likely they are to be prejudiced by your action . The higher you stand , therefore , the easier and the more incumbent upon you is the duty that li* before you . There is no use in railing against a prejudice ; it must be lived down . Every woman who pursues an unusual work , steadily and faithfully , and shows that she can remain as modest , gentle , and tender as when she plied the needle or cooked the home-dinner , is doing a real service for her sex , very different from vague , frenzied citations of the Bible and Constitution to prove wcman the equal of man . It is just in this step of your course that Man 's Right opposes you . There is one hard fact which we women are apt to shirk , but which we must face after all , and that is , that in the pitiless economics of nations the question is not the . worker but the value of the work . Wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment . If the wheat you bring into market is poor , your pay will be poor ; and it is sheer folly for you to point to your pale face , or to boast of first-rate grain raised in another century by one of your family . How * Miss Penny 's book would he more useful if the scale of prices given in it for work , were those of the present time . It would be worth her while to correct this in another edition . The book would then be a more efficient aid to woman than a dozen treatises on her rights . can that make yours worth another penny in the pound ? Before you take man 's work from him , you must prove that you can do it as well as he . In that proof lies your great obstacle . Offer yourself as a clerk or apprentice to any business in your own town ; if you have capital , embark in any business , and the chances are that you will have a fair field to try your chance . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rules that determine the value of men as laborers ; and it is but just to them that you should be . If you accept work as a makeshift , a means to an end , giving it as little service as may be , it is right you should be pushed aside by those whose heart is in it . Art may be as truly worshipped in a carpenter 's shop or laundry-room as in the sculptor 's atdier , and however humble the offering may be , she is as jealous of service in one place as the other . " Young girls , " says a New York editor , " who take up the business of printing hoping to be freed from it by marriage , or widows who mean to make it serve only until their sons are able to support them , can not be expected to turn out as thorough work as men , whose business it is to be for life . " That they do not , is proved by the re employment of men by some of the largest printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the trammels of the printers ' union by the service of females . It is enough to dishearten any advocate for woman 's claim to wider work , to see the listlessness and impatience with which such work is too often done when found . Look at the incivility and indifference of the female-clerk , compared to the man who stands behiiid the counter with her ! " But that is to be his business* some day he hopes to be a partner ; he is making capital for himself out of your good-will . " Precisely . Why should it not be her business ? Why should she not become an active as well as passive helpmeet for her husband ? Suppose Mrs. Aputs // her skill in drawing to account as a designeror watch-engraver ; or that good housekeeper , Mrs. B , employed fifty women , instead of one , in canning fruit ; or Mrs. C - , in place of her bit of kitchen-garden , hired an acre in addition , and cleared one or two thousand a-year in raising herbs for the drug-market-all employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not benefit both husband and children , as much as by remaining , as they are now , maids of all work ? " But we are always underpaid , " urges the trembling coward on the brink , afraid to make the plunge . This is but measurably true . As a rule , when the work is proved to be equal to a man 's , there is no difference in the wages . When Rosa Bonheiir , or Jean Ingelow , or Fanny Kemble , bring their wares into market , the question of sex does not suggest itself with that of payment . In cases where it does suggest itselg the remedy is in your own hands . Make your work equal to a man 's , and then exact his rate of payment . Take not a penny less-because you are a woman . However weak you may be , you owe this much service to all other women . It is another right of the man that we should not underbid him in the market , and one which we will willingly cede to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , will not be builded like Solomon 's temple of old , with silence and devout aspirations ; there is squabbling and dirt and mortar flying enough to make us think that the foundations of the world are broken up . But when the work is done and the rubbish cleared away , the world will be just as it was ; there will only be a more comfortable dwelling in it , a house with higher roof and wider windows than served our grandmothers . The sky above it and the human beings who found the larger dwelling in their improved circumstances necessary and pleasant , will be substantially the same . My friend John may possess his anxious soul in patience . There are women , as well as men , who will remain unmarried , or who , married , seem to be sent with a general rather than especial mission-a " Thus saith the Lord " to deliver to all the people rather than to one or two of His little children . Why should they not fulfil their errand ? Why should not the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether , we are shaped very much as were all the generations of women who have gone before us ; and in this very fashioning of both our bodies and minds show that our best and highest duties in life are those of wife and mother . We are not moving , as yet , en masse upon the polls or the retail-trade ; nor are we demolishing our little kitchen-stoves which we bought when we were married , to plunge into the vast conglomerated cooking partnership . A good thing , no doubt , when it is a necessity ; but these universal schemes , wherein every dish of potatoes and turnips is to be dipped out of a general pot instead of being cooked to suit Will 's or Tom 's particular taste ; wherein every woman finds herself a mother , not to her own especial baby , but spiritually to the whole of the rest of mankind , are chilly-very chilly to the weaker among us . John may choose his wife , and be very sure that she will find her little home as dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as any woman from Eve down . And if he gives her all the work for which her brain and hands arc fitted , he will find her a less morbid , sickly wife , less likely to gloat over Offenbach , and brood over possible new elective affinities for herself ; he will find her , in every sense , more helpful , and more certain to place him and her baby where they ought to be , next in her duty to her God .
