THE MYSTERY OF THE GILDED CAMEO . OF the few unto whom I have heretofore confidentially narrated the circumstances , some merely laughed , and seemed to give me credit for a most lively imagination . Others looked wise , and talked about undeveloped laws in electro-biology and magnetism . Two shook their heads , and quoted Hamlet 's celebrated remark to Horatio . Three or four kept silence , appearing to be troubled about my sanity . And one  --  a melancholy man with a sallow complexion , who bade me turn up the gas before I commenced-grew pale as I went on , and admitted that , after all , there might really be something in it . As for myself , I can not tell what to think about it . I can only confess the whole matter to the public , in the hope that somewiser head than has yet been consulted , may furnish the true solution . It happened a year ago , in Florence , where I was detained for some weeks by a temporary failure of health . And having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became rather like one of the settled citizens-seldom any longer dropping in at the galleries and studios , but falling gradually into a uniform routine of out-door life , sunning myself at cctf* entrances , and , at fixed hours , starting out upon pleasant strolls . Of these , my favorite one was across the Ponte Yecchio , stopping for a few minutes at the little shop of old Andrea Yaggione , to gossip with him about the events of the day . There may be some who recollect the old man . His place was nearly half-way across the bridge , on the right hand as you passed from the Lung Arno ; and , like the rest , was filled with mosaics , photographs , alabaster leaning-towers , bronzes , medals-in fine , with a goodly assortment of all those curiosities which travellers most generally affect . Perhaps the greatest curiosity of all was the face of old Andrea himself , as it appeared looking out from the midst of his goods  --  a queer , semi-grotesque face , with no beard , flanked with bushy tufts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering eyes which peered restlessly out from behind the long , overhanging eyebrows as through a veil . A benevolent , pleasing face , too  --  and belonging to an expansive , finelyshaped head . Seeing this alone , you would have said that he was a large , well-proportioned man ; but it was not so . From his waist downward , old Andrea was a cripple , withered and misshapen , with the limbs of a halfgrown child ; and he was daily carried down to the shop upon a mule , and lifted into his place by his two sons . Happening to stop almost daily at Andrea 's shop in preference to the others , I soon , by dint of good-natured chaffering over his goods , became pretty well acquainted with him ; and so much so , indeed , that at last he began to look out for my coming as one of the small events of his life , and finally went so far as to invite me to step in behind his counter and rest myself . There I often sat , snugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candelabras decked with bright-colored silk scarfs , and watched with interest the little stream of loiterers crossing the bridge , and the occasional sharp bargainings of travellers over cameos and mosaics - bargainings in which it is needless to say that Andrea , while surrendering his goods with a melancholy affectation of ruinous sacrifice , always got the best of it . Gradually it became one of my secret enjoyments to have chance acquaintances , at the Hotel d'Arno , guardedly exhibit to me the very articles that I had watched them purchase at almost double the proper value , all the while vaunting their own acuteness in making the acquisition . " At old Andrea 's ,  --  half-way along the bridge , " they would say ,  --  " has the best stock of goods in town . My courier // directed me to him , or else I might never have found him out . A sharp old fellow , too , and would cheat you , if he could ; but I was up to him there . I was not born yesterday , you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go with you , and help you through with it . " One day , upon entering my nookery , I found Andrea poring over a trayful of goods and trumpery which he had just purchased in one lot from a peasant-woman . There were a rosary or two of cracked beads , joined with silver links , a few broken mosaics , valuable only for their settings , a string of corals , an old lock of no value as a protection , but rather remarkable for its elaborately ornamented scutcheon-in fine , a varied mass , of which some was of little value , and the rest entirely worthless . Andrea carefully sorted these out into different boxes , putting some articles by for the melting-pot , and some aside for future reburnishing . Then , picking up from the heap that remained , a curious medallion-like ornament , he gazed at it for a moment inquiringly , and finally , without a word , placed it in my hands . Upon examining it , I saw that it was a cameo , of rather larger size than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oval . It had evidently been once of some value as a work of art , but was now battered and scratched , and was absolutely worthless except as a relic of antiquity . The intaglio represented a female figure , which , a portion of the face having been cracked off at first baffled all identification , but which , from the sundial upon her lap , I finally recognized as Atropos , one of the three Fates . Around the edge was a coiled serpent - not an independent piece of setting , but a part of the stone itself . Of actual setting there was none , nor was there any fixture at the back to show that it had ever been worn as a pin or buckle . There was simply a ring at the top , whence I conjectured that it must have been suspended from the neck , possibly as a sort of charm . The back of it was plain , and filled in with some kind of dark enamel , which was not scratched like the face , probably from being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were carved the date and initials , C. M. , 1565 . What was most remarkable about the trinket was its style of embellishment  --  the hair of the figure and the borderiiig serpent having evidently been once thickly gilded . " Where could it have come from ? " I said to Andrea . " Who knows ? " he answered . " It may have been concealed for three centuries in a monastery , or may have been openly worn by a peasant-family down from one generation to another . Old trinkets are turning up all the while , and no one asks any questions about them . I have never yet seen any thing exactly like this , however . I remember to have heard that nearly a hundred years ago there was such an ornament in existence in the cabinet of a cardinal . It is one of the traditions of our craft . There was said to be some charm or virtue about it , but no one could discover the key to it . Then it disappeared during a siege of the city . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them-who can tell ? " " It is very curious , " I said . " What is the price of it ? " Nothing , to yourself , " answered Andrea . " It has no value now as an ornament , being so defaced ; and why , therefore , should I try to make a profit out of it to you who may chance to fancy it ? Therefore put it into your pocket . " I did so willingly , and without scruple at accepting the gift , having so often hitherto made purchases to his profit . And thanking him , I told him that I would keep it to remember him by , being about to leave Florence before many days . " To return to your own country ! " said Andrea . " To that happy land where all the people are rich , and all the streets are wide , and the houses new ? Well , I can not wonder that you pine for it . " And he sighed , as though he , too , would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . How could I make him comprehend that I rather preferred the narrow streets and the little old shops of Florence ? I could not , indeed , explain to myself why it was . Therefore I made no answer , except that I hoped in future years to return to Florence and spend many more months there ; and then , inaspiritof pleasantry , hanging the cameo around my neck , inside my vest , for a charm , I left him , promising to come back every day until my departure . My usual route , after crossing over the bridge , led through the tangled streets until I reached and passed out of the nearest gateway ; after which I would make a semi-circular detour through the more open country , loitering along the walled fronts of picturesque villas , until finally I relintered the city at another gate , and so arrived again at my hotel . This route I now pursued , and strolled carelessly along , unburdened with serious thought , until I came to that point where I w*as accustomed to commence my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little back from the road there was a small vine-covered cottage , with a broken , untrimmed hedge in front , and flowers growing thickly around . I had often taken note of its pleasant aspect , more especially as it seemed unaccountably to stand empty and deserted , as though stricken with the plague  --  the doors and windows being closed , and the grass in front overgrown with weeds , and a large dusty cobweb stretching across the gate ; and I had wondered how such a little nook of contentment could remain unsought for . Now , as I approached , I noticed that it was occupied , for the windows were open ; and , leaning over the low gate , appeared a young but fully-grown girl , clad in a semi-antique costume , which added to the picturesque grace of her attitude as she stood listlessly twirling a ring upon her finger in seeming unconsciousness that any one was nigh . As I approached , however , she lifted her eyes , and started , as though about to withdraw into the cottage . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her finger , and fell into the path before me . I could do no less than pick it up and return it to her , nor could she do less than thank me for the service . This led to a response upon my part ; and so , little by little , a few muttered words changed into actual conversation , and I found myself leaning over the other side of the gate , listening to a voice which struck me as the most pleasantly modulated that I had ever heard , and stealthily gazing into eyes whose depth and softness I felt had never been surpassed . How shall I describe her ? Alas ! the real essence of beauty can not be described . Features and matters of mere outward expression may be accurately depicted ; but what words can ever give a true conception of that inward beauty which seems to shine from the very depths of tile soul , making itself felt in each shifting glance of the eye , or in the lightest curve of the lip , brightening with new loveliness , curving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other more manifest charm of person , even as the sun showers down new embellishments upon a gentle landscape already believed to be perfect in its details ? At the most , I could but faintly tell how , at the very first , she seemed to me ; for though , in the beginning , I took some timid note of dreamy eyes , and dark clustering locks , and pearly teeth , and rich brown . com* plexion , before many minutes had elapsed I had forgotten all these mere* outward attractions , and became conscious only of her winning grace of language , her softly-modulated tones , and her soul-lit , pensive glance . Until , suddenly , with a start , I came to myself . What were these tender tones and soul-lit glances to me ? They had their attraction , to be sure , but what of* that ? I should probably never see her* again . It was only a pleasant little romance , lasting for one moment , and to be forgotten the next - that wan all . And even now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , muttering an apology for having detained her , I departed , unconscious . // that I had been performing the first short act in a drama . And somehow , I began to lo*k with more distaste than ever upon my native land , where these little waifs of romance did not happen ; and if old Andrea could then have questioned me about it , I could have told him that it was not simply its broad streets and houses all new that excited my artistic aversion , but rather its apparent inability to furnish , amid its business excitements , such pleasant interludes of vine-covered cottages adorned with lustrous-eyed maidens . And this , for the moment , was my heart 's complaint , never varying , and always repeating itself until I had ag in crossed the Arno , and stood in my own room at the hotel . Sidney Talfourd , my chum , was there , sorting out his effects into two portmanteaus , preparatory to our approaching departure . Sidney was not exactly my travelling companion , since he had been rang4ig all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly at Florence . But he had now joined me , and it had been determined that we should go home together , first taking a tour to Venice and Vienna , and thence passing by way of Berlin and Dresden to Paris . He was good company ; and , irrespective of personal liking , there was a strong bond of union between us , from the fact that be had a pretty sister at home , to whom I had bcen engaged for the past two years . " Look here ! " be cried , as soon as I entered the room . " While you have been loitering away your afternoon , loafing in at old Jew shops , and the like , I have picked up a treasure . See this , now 1 ' , With that he held out to me a dingylooking book , smoke-dried , atmospheredried , age-dried-dried up in every way in which a book can dry . The pages were yellow , and in places somewhat obliterated . It was bound in that quaint gilded parchment which commonly goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the Chronicles of one Bartolomeo IJberti - an author of whom neither of us had ever heard . But that mattered nothing to Sidney . The date - 1602-  was what pleased him . He had for old books a mania , about which I had often laughed at him ; and if the date was far enough back , he cared little for the contents . " What is it all for I " I said , handling the book with an affectation of disgust , as though it had just come from a pest-house . " Chronicles about what ? " " About old philosophers and poets , and fellows of that ilk , who have lived in Florence a little before our daywhat we should call our most respected citizens , " answered Sidney . " Dip into it , and perhaps you may find something interesting that will stop your mock laughter . " I dipped into it accordingly , turning over the leaves at random and occasionally stopping to read a few lines . I found it , as he had stated , a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated in history , but the greater number long gone down to oblivion . I was about to close the volume with weary disgust , when a word or two suddenly fixed my attention ; and as I read , the blood mounted into my face , so that , had it not been for the obscurity of evening , Sidney could not have failed to notice my agitation . It was in a sketch of the life of one Cianino Medici  --  a grandnephew of the famous Lorenzo  --  and in the midst of a page so blurred and eaten away that but a few scattered sentences remained ; so that it was with difficulty I deciphered even these few words : which gilded cameo having been given to lion s7eep*ng with *t upon his breast and whispering the name of whomsoever he sought , C'ianino would , in his dreanss , see whatever might be happening to such person in any part of the world . But with this condi that he miserably perished . As I read , my knees almost smote together , and I could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doubt that the long-lost // charm had passed into my possession , and with it the method of its application . The date , the initials , all concurred to convince me beyond the possibility of dispute . But , at the same time , came the conviction that there was some horrible diabolical spell connected with it which would too surely prevent my enjoyment of it . How pleasant , , indeed , to look upon the features and actions of those whom we most loved ! But , oh ! how could I ever dare to do it ? To what penalty might I not subject myself ? What was the meaning of that sad conclusion of all , " that he miserably perished ? " And what a terrible deprivation it was that the very lines which should have explained every thing clearly , had been thus eaten or rusted away ! " I say , " remarked Sidney , " do n't you wish you could look in upon them at home now ? I think I can see them all . It 's ahout five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bout sitting down to dinner . How they would relish a bottle of Orvieto-would they not ? And there is Bessie , too . She was ill when we last heard from her . Would n't it be a nice thing if we could find out just how she is ? " Bessie - ill - look in upon them ? Why , so I could - that very ni0ht . The proper instrument for the purpose was dangling around my neck . And , at the suggestion , the string seemed to cut into my flesh . And I would so like to know whether Bessie had recoveredbut I dared not make the attempt . No , even if it were life and death with Bessie , I could not venture to use the charm , and risk the possible consequences of the act . " Sidney ! " I exclaimed , softening my voice as much as possible , so as to conceal its agitation , " were there any more copies of this book in the shop where you bought it I " " Any more copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment . " Do you think I would buy a book if I thought there was another copy of it in the world ? And do you imagine that such treasures are to be picked up in shops ? I bought that book of a dirty old monk ; and it is my opini6n that he stole it out of the monastery library . " " Nevertheless , Sidney , I would give a great deal to see another copy of it , for my curiosity is excited . See here ! There is something gone from this page , and I would dearly love to find out the missing links of the narrative . " " I see , " responded Sidney , running his eye hastily down the page . " About some old monkish charm , I suppose . And , of course , the devil had something to do with it . He always has , in these old stories . Well , I suppose we will never know , now . Certainly , we can not find out about it in Florence . There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though even that I doubt . But I am glad you are becoming interested in old books , at last . I have hopes of you , now . You have n't , in some of your meanderings , come across the old cameo , have you I " he added , with a careless laugh . " Well , we will try to find the missing page , when we get to Paris . When will that be-in three weeks ? Let us say four weeks , for sure . And now , as I am rather sleepy , I will go off to my bed . " He nodded , and retired , while I sat up half the night , gazing at the gilded cameo , longing to test its powers , but not daring to do so ; and finally , flinging myself upon my bed , I gained a few hours of sleep  --  a troubled and unrefreshing sleep , however , which did not rest me ; and morning brought me no respite from care . I now thought of the day only as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty breakfast , sallied forth to look for another copy of Bartoliomeo Uberti . Bookstores and libraries all underwent my scrutiny . I even gained access to some monastic libraries , and pored greedily over the shelves ; but all in vain . Until at length , when twilight came , I resolutely banished that care from my mind , and set out upon my usual round  --  a chat with old Andrea upon // the Ponte Vecchio , a stroll across the bridge to the city-gate , and so onward through the villa-lined suburbs . When I came to the little cottage , at the termination of my outward route , it was not unnatural , perhaps , that I should look to see whether the pretty maiden of the preceding evening was there again . That chance meeting-. it had surely been too pleasant not to be repeated , if possible ; and it would be no sin to gaze once more for a few minutes into those pensive eyes before I went away forever ; and , in fact , it would be rather a hard fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was with a peculiar pleasure that I now saw the young girl leaning over the little gate as before ; the more so that she seemed as though anticipating my coming . And consequently it could hardly be expected that I should not again tarry for a little while-which I did ; and found myself , once more bending over my side of the gate , looking dreamily down into her face , and thirstingly drinking in her soft , modulated tones , as she prattled on in her native tongue . And with less consideration than I had displayed upon the preceding evening , I there remained , watching her play of expression , until the stars peeped out one by one , and the distant Duomo began to show less distinctly against the darkening sky , and I realized that it was indeed time for me to tear myself away . " Would I be able to see her again ? " I then faltered forth . " Were these two pleasant meetings to go for naught ? ' * She smiled , and , holding out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she could not help it-that she would be there upon the following evening . And I , taking courage , pressed the little hand , and , dropping a kiss upon it , departed , every few steps looking back to see if she was yet gazing after me , until a turn of the path hid the little cottage from my sight . Another evening  --  and yet anotherand still I contrived to see her . I have said that I could not adequately describe Feb. her beauty . Let me now further say , that if it were possible to depict with graphic correctness every attribute of her marvellous loveliness , whether it shone upon the outward surface , or gleamed fitfully from some inward fount of fascination , it would not avail to do so , unless I could also give a proper conception of the singular bond of sympathy which now began to draw me towards her , as though by magnetic influence . Never had I felt the like of it before ; and I remember that , being at the first dimly conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vacantly speculate upon its nature , and even try to philosophize upon it . It was not love-so I took pains to assure myself . Might it be the forerunner of love ? That , of course , was nonsense . I was merely her friend , and she mine-that was all . And somehow , I began to feel as though I had known her years ago-as though these meetings were the realization of plans that had been forming for ages , and that some great mistake would be committed in the course of nature , were it all to end without result of any kind . What more shall I say to express the inevitable result ? I soon began to discover that I was drifting onward in a dangerou 's current , but I no longer had the strength of mind to attempt resisting it . I knew that I could no longer deceive myself ; that what I had so innocently imagined to be mere friendship , was becoming love - yes , had already become so ; and yet , infirm and weak of purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day more willingly to give myself up to the spell . Thoughts of my home grew faint ; memories of its loved ones became unfrequent . I even forgot , for the time , my golden cameo , and my search after the little book of Bartolomeo Uberti ; all my usual cares and pursuits seemed to pall upon me ; I no more visited old Andrea , or loitered upon the Ponte Yecchio ; my only task was to count the minutes until the twilight hour came , and then hurriedly pass over to the little cottage where Lella waited for PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . // me at the gate ; my only desire was to linger a few weeks longer in Florence . " I can not go yet , " I said at length to Sidney . " I do not feel my health as fully restored as I could wish , and I would prefer to linger here . I do not care for Venice or Vienna . I will let you make that tour alone , and next month I will meet you in Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointed at the change of programme , but-good , honest fellow that he was-suspected nothing . " Well , if it must be so , it must , " he mournfully ejaculated . " And , Sidney , " I cried , suddenly recollecting the topic of mylate anxiety , " look into some of the large libraries of Vienna or Paris , or wherever there is a large public library , in fact , and see if you can find another copy of Bartolomeo Uberti . I am more anxious than you can think , to know the whole of that faded page . " " You have Bartolomeo on the brain , I believe , " * he responded with a laugh ; " but I will try to gratify your whim . And remember , next month , on the 15th , I shall expect you at the Hotel Louvre . " The next day he departed ; and I , feeling relieved from the presence of one who , at times , had unwittingly fettered my moments , now gave myself up more unresistingly than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining there longer . Soon , growing more bold , I would slip into the gate and stand at the same side with Lella , beading forward so as to gaze into her eyes with the same ease as before ; then grew accustomed to place myself upon a bench inside the hedge , where , well screened from the road , I could gaze at her as she sat beside me . And , after a little while , it was no more than to be suspected that my arm should wander around the slender waist , and that the fair head should rest upon my sheulder . In all this I had no thought of wrong , nor did I ever dream that there could be any serious issue to the affair . Deeply entranced and carried away as I was , there were certain waking moments , as it were , in my existence , when I felt forced to look upon the situation soberly , face to face . And , though feeling well assured that she loved me in return , I could not but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plighted to another , whom I had in times past believed I loved . There could be no sundering of that tie - nor , were it broken , would it avail me any thing . For how could I ever think to bring this untutored Florentine girl to my own home , and there present her to my friends ? Nay , what did I know about her , except that I had met her by chance , and now loved her ? Who were her kindred ? I had never thought to inquire , nor had she ever asked about my own . We were simply all in all to each other , in a blind , unrefiecting , passionate way ; and the outer world and its ties were a myth , which ought not now to trouble us . We had no plans for the future - how could we have ? It was all a tender romance which should be enjoyed for the present , and must some day be rudely broken . We were as Paul and Virginia in our talk and actions ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I longed , as I often did , that I might have her always with me , there would come the terrible conviction that in New York there could be found no Paul and Virginia society . No , the rupture must some day come , and surely , too ; for each day the time of my final departure drew nearer , and could no longer be procrastinated . And meanwhile , as I lingered , a new act of the drama commenced . " You must not come to-morrow , ** Lella said to me one evening , as I was taking my leave of her . " Why not ? " I inquired , astounded , for such a deprivation had not yet happened to me . " I dare not tell , but so it must be , " she responded , hesitatingly . There were candor and regret in her tones ; but somehow there seeme*d to be an insincere gleam in her dark eyes , and I felt a momentary suspicion of her . Nevertheless , at the end , her persuasive tones // lulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the reason for the self-denial to which she compelled me , I bade her " good-by " with a tolerable degree of truthfulness , and , for the moment , my only emotions were regret for the necessity and despair of being able to exist for the next fortyeight hours away from her . But when I reached my own room , and was away from the influence of her enticing tones and tender glances , the vision of that single glimpse of insincerity came back to me , and made me uncomfortable . Why could she not have told me her reason for not seeing me ? If it were a sufficient and proper one , would any person sooner than myself admit it ? And was it not a proof of something wrong , that she would not confide in me ? Thus I could not help arguing with myself , as the twin serpents , suspicion and jealousy , gnawed at my heart . And not reflecting that , as I hadeformed no settled views for Lella 's future , I had no right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before disregarded . Once , when I had been leaning with her over the gate , a strange young man had appeared , and made as though he would stop , but , at an almost imperceptible sign from her , had passed on . At another time , I had seen a male figure crouching behind the corner of the cottage , watching us , and had started up in pursuit , when it had vanished , and she had laughed , and said that it was only my shadow . These trivial incidents now seemed to form confirmation of some wrong ; and little by little I remembered other matters of like character , and miserably brooded over them during the day , until , when evening came , I was almost ill with mental agony . If I could only see her , myself remaining unseen , and thus be satisfied of her truth or falsity , what a relief it might be to me ! And at one time , in my desperation , I would have sallied forth and played the spy upon her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage where I could stand without risking detection . Suddenly I felt a burning , as it were , at my left side , where the gilded cameo reposed . I had not thought much about the trinket of late , being fearful of using it , and half doubtful , moreover , whether the magical powers ascribed to it were not entirely a fable of the Middle Ages . But now I drew it forth , and there came over me an irresistible longing to gaze at Lella , if it were possible , and watch her present occupation . I could but try ; and , if it failed , no harm would be done . But if it succeeded , and the penalty , whatever it might be , should be exacted ? Pshaw ! what penalty could there be ? I had not sold myself to the devil , had I ? Nor were these the days in which devils could have power over the human race . Thus , little by little , I reassured myself , persuading myself to do , for an unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my own distant kindred . Hitherto , more from habit than any thing else , I had continued to wear the cameo about my neck during the day , though I had always laid it aside upon retiring , finding it too cumbrous a trinket for the night . But now , determining to try the charm , whatever might be the result , I left it upon my breast , laid down upon my bed , whispered the word " Lella , " and , closing my eyes , awaited the result . At first , nothing ; for , in my agitation of mind , I could not sleep , and heard hour after hour strike . But at last I fell into an uneasy slumber ; and , almost immediately , in my dreams saw Lella pictured before me . She seemed to be sitting in front of her cottage , upon the rustic level behind the hedge , just where she had been accustomed to sit with me . But now there was another person beside her , whose youthful beauty I could not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand was in his , and her head rested upon his shoulder , even as it had been wont to rest upon my own . And I could see that her eyes gazed up into his with the same lus*j trous glance of sympathetic affection which she had lavished upon me . What more proof of her perfidy could I de // sire ? So , for a moment , stood the lifelike picture , and then seemed to roll away , and I saw her no longer . But though the miserable scene was withdrawn from my eyes , I was not left in peace . All night as I tossed about wearily , a dark , undefined cloud as of black mist seemed to close in about me , rolling back and forth , now receding and again approaching , and gathering up its folds so closely that it appeared as though I could have touched it . It was simply nightmare , I reasoned , produced by excess of mental agitation . But though I strove to shake it off , I could not ; and even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly as before . And in the morning I arose pale and haggard , my own reflection in the glass startling me with its wan , stricken aspect . What could I think of it all ? Was it but a mere dream , a trick of my imaginatio*n , or had I actually seen Lella herself ? If the latter , was there real magic in it , connecting itself with the Gilded Cameo ? Or , on the contrary , was it a chance coincidence , my high-wrought fancy producing some singular and accidental manifestation of second sight ? But whatever it might be , I could not but feel borne into my soul the conviction that Lella was false to me , and I determined that I would not longer visit her .. I would depart fi-om Florence at once , and tear her image from my mind . It must be done before long ; therefore , why not now ? And when she found that I did not come , she would understand that her treachery had been discovered . There could surely be no explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were all destined to come to nothing . For of what use is it to resolve , when we are in the hands of fate ? And , by the afternoon , new ideas came and changed my programme . I determined that I would see her once again , but that it should be for the simple purpose of charging her with her falsity , and throwing back her pretended affection into her face . And so , when the usual hour arrived , I saw her , leaning over the gate , and watching impatiently for me , with the pleasant smile upon her lips , and the love-light in her eyes . And then , as even in my fiercest passion I had dimly conjectured would be the case , I almost forgave her upon the spot , making my complaints in a mild , undecided tone of remonstrance , rather than reproach , and accepting her excuses ere she had fully time to utter them . It was some story she told about a brother who had lately returned from Palermo , and who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she had therefore denied herself my society , for the sole purpose of keeping us apart . What could be more plausible , to be sure ? It is true , the story did not satisfy my reason , but it did appease the raging of my heart . And again I yielded myself bodily to the fascination which she threw about me , and was happy as before . Until , after three more stolen interviews with her , I was again directed to abstain from her presence for a single evening ; and again tormented by the pangs of jealousy , I yielded to the temptation , and , by the aid of the Gilded Cameo , watched her in my dream . And I saw that she was at the opera , seated in the back of a secluded box , with the same person at her side whom I had previously seen with her . His arm was about her , and her head upon his shoulder , as in the garden . What further doubt could I have ? Her story had been false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers might chance to be affectionately inclined for a few moments after a long absence ; but were these continual manifestations the ordinary evidences of fraternal regard ? Once more I resolved to leave heronce more rushed to charge her with her perfidy ; and again , beguiled with a ready excuse and a few ' tender glances , I tried to believe , and then forgave her . And not twice only , but oftener . For now the drama began to advance apace , and each week there was a renewal of the old scene . The whispered direction to remain away for // only one evening , the jealousy , the application to the magic charm , the cruel discovery of her falsehood , the open charge of perfidy , the eyes softly beaming upon me with love , the halPbelieved story , and the perfect forgivenessall were there in their due sequence , to complete her triumph and my self-degradation . And soon I began to discover too truly the penalty that attached to the use of the Gilded Cameo . The dark misty cloud , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , was not merely an unsubstantial nightmare , but rather an actual display of some demoniac influence . This I could no longer doubt ; for when I essayed a second time to satisfy the whisperings of my jealousy , that night the cloud was there again , still rolling about me , but thicker , blacker , and nearer than before . There was even something supernaturally terrible and oppre*sive in it  --  a strange kind of vitality , as it were , which seemed eager to press upon me and crush me in its cumbrous folds . Upon my third attempt it was there once more ; and now it began to assume shape and rotundity , as of a foul spirit . I could even fancy that I saw , stretched from the yet somewhat cc*nfused body , a taloned hand , upraised to smite me , and I cried out with fear and agony . Again , another night , there was a further change ; for the form grew more defined in outline , and a bright , glittering eye begun to be developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck terror into my inmost soul . And now , instead of coming and going at chance moments , as it had at first done , the appearance began to remain with me constantly throughout all the hours of the night . And while I knew that its horrible aspect , and perhaps its *corporeal power over me , were increased with each application to the charmed cameo , I daily found less strength to resist the temptation , so grievously did my jealousy now torment me , encouraging me in a reckless daring . It was a fate  --  and who could struggle successfully against it ? Let me only go on to the end , and die . At last , overcome by this constant mental agony , I began to lose all my former strength and elasticity , and my flesh fell away from my bones , until I was a ghost of my original self . I felt that now , indeed , the end was drawing near , but I scarcely cared . What was life when subjected to this constant terror ? And what hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And once more I lay down with the Gilded Cameo upon my breast , waiting for the dreams that it might bring . Six times already had I availed myself of its powers , and was now about to yield for the seventh time ; for again the spell of love and jealousy was upon me . But as I* prepared to close my eyes , they fell upon a letter which lay on my table . It had remained there unopened for three days , so completely had my misery and misplaced passion driven from my mind all interest in matters at home . But now , influenced by some good impulse , I lifted the letter , and carefully examined the seal . " This night may be my last , " I muttered to myself ; " I feel it so , and I have no strength left to resist my doom . Be that as it will . But let me first give one thought to those who now , from a distance , are praying for me . Let me not go out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , at least , I owe them . " I broke the seal and opened the letter . It was from Bessie ,  --  she whom I had so much loved , and had of late so grievously neglected . With affectionate word she told me the family and social news-all those little trivial matters which so greatly interest the wanderer from home . The new picket-fence at the farm was being repainted-green , to correspond with the hedge . The old maid Molly was about to be married , and was getting a white veil , as though she was only sixteen . The peaches had failed , and a smoking-cap was being embroidered for me . Billy , the dog , had been sick , having rashly undertaken , after the example of the cat , to // eat a mouse ; but lie was better . And they were all daily expecting to hear that we had taken our homeward passage . And would I bring her a Roman lamp , and a lace shawl , and a leaningtower , and some Genoese filagree-work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How all at once the familiar scenes thronged about me-scenes that were dear , even in their trials and vexations ! How vividly , for the instant , I could picture each of those loved ones I My father reading his paper-my mother knitting  --  and Bessie , my own Bessie , running in with her worsted hood to bring them the letters which she had received from Sidney , and to learn whether they had any word from me ! The tears came into my eyes . It was a moment when my better nature was touched . Scales seemed to have fallen from my understanding . Could it be that I was neglecting all these home-treasures for an idle flincy ? And should not the momentary impulse to do better be allowed to have sway at the last ? I felt instinctively that it depended upon myself alone , and that , if I did not resolutely seize the propitious moment , I would be lost forever . What better time than now to emancipate myself from the fatal spell ? Would I have the same strength upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , tearing the trinket from my neck , I hurled it far out through the open window . It dropped into the Arno , and there sank . I watched its fall , half expecting to see a puff of smoke arise where it struck ; but it went down without any unnatural demonstration , like an ordinary stone . But with it sank my evil destiny . I gazed upon the circles expanding where it touched the water , and then all was calm again . Calm , not only on the bosom of the river , but also in my heart . A wonderful peace and repose seemed to have come to me there ; a terrible weight was all at once lifted from my spirits . Impulsively I knelt down by my bed , and for the first time in many nights said my prayers ; and then-then fell into a gentle slumber , and slept the sleep of innocence . INo phantom cloud w , ith glittering eyes and threatening hand disturbed me , but , through all the night , bright dreams of home gladdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thirsty longing to be with my loved ones again . And when I awoke , I felt refreshed and regenerated . Even my glass showed an improvement ; for my hollowed cheeks seemed again filling out with health , and a pleasant light  --  the old light of cheerfulness-was gleaming in my eyes . I threw open the window . It was a sparkling , bright day , and the streets were all gay with life and motion . Flower-girls passed by , holding up with winning gestures their bunches of camelias . Image-vendors strolled along , with elastic tread , in spite of the weight of their overloaded trays . Minstrels leaned against the stone coping of the river embankment , and cheerily piped up at the hotel windows . Open carriages filled with happy excursionists rolled along . In every direction was a jovial throng , passing to and fro along the Arno and across the Vecehio and Trinita bridges . An irresistible impulse seized me-an impulse such as I had not felt for many dayscommanding me to sally forth and become a part of that active scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic with alert and cheerful spirits , and instinctively took the route of my old familiar stroll . And first to the Ponte Vecchio , where old Andrea Yaggione was at his post selling a mosaic to a long-whiskered Englishman , who stood searching Murray in vain to ascertain how much he ought to pay . " A good-morning to you , " shouted Andrea . " And you have not gone , yet , back to that happy land where there are no laws ? You have been absent many days . " " I shall go to-morrow , " I said , not slackening my pace , and resisting his invitation to come behind his counter . For how , on such a bright , beautiful , // elastic day , could I keep from active motion ? Therefore I hurried on , across to the opposite bank , through the gate , and along the road of villas , until I found myself approaching the cottage , - Lella 's cottage . Should I return ? Dare I pass that place again ? Might not the old influence entrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of purpose come back to me ? Had not some scales fallen from my eyes ? Was the sight of a mere country beauty to dazzle my understanding and destroythe balance of my equanimity ? Therefore I pressed resolutely forward ; and soon the little cottage rose upon my sight . But , to my utter astonishment , it was closed , and apparently deserted as I had first seen it , and the gate was shut , and even the old dusty cobweb was stretched from post to post . " What is the meaning of this ? " I inquired of a peasant-woman who just then emerged from a hovel near by . " Whcre is the person who lives here ? " " Signor , there is no one living in that place , " she answered , opening wide her eyes . There has no one been found to live there for years past ; for they say , " and she crossed herself ; " that there is a demon in the house . " I started with wonderment , and , for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my confusion , gave it up , and walked hastily onward . What mystery was all this ? Did the peasantwoman speak the truth ? Had I been under the influence of some unholy hallucination ? Was I actually , at that moment , sane ? I pressed my hands to my eyes , looked up at the bright sky as though seeking to reassure myself ; glanced once back towards the deserted cottage with its cobwebbed gate , and then passed on , as in a misty whirl , until I reached the hotel . There , as I entered , the porter met me , and handed me a letter which had just arrived . It was from Sidney , and bore the Paris postmark . " I have engaged our passages in the Arago , which sails on the 22d , " he wrote . " Therefore you will have to hurry on at once ; and as I expect to see you so soon , I will say nothing now about my journey through Austria and the Rhine country . But I want to show you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have picked up some lovely old books - so old , that nobody can read them at all . Speaking of which , reminds me of my promise to hunt up the missing words in Bartolomeo Uberti . I searched the Imperial library in Vienna , and the Royal library at Berlin , but could not find another copy than mine ; nor did I have better luck at the library in Paris . But the librarian put me on the track of an old Academician living in the Rue d'Enfer , who has more old books than you can well imagine ; and going to him I found that he also had a Bartolomeo Uberti , and in capital preservation . And this is the whole of the page about which you were so curious that you made me also a little curious ; and , now that we have it , I do not see that it amounts to any thing after all . " Which gilded cameo , having been given to him b*y the fiend , was also a charm ; for , sleeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whomsoever he sought , Gianino would , in his dreams , see whatever might be happening to such person in any part of the world . But with the condition , that if he should apply to it as many as seven times , he should be altogether in the power of the fiend . The which cameo Cianino joyfully received , not believing but that he could so far control himself as to use it sparingly , and only upon great occasions , and not oftener than might be safe for him so to do . But the fiend , taking upon himself the appearance of a beauteous virgin , did throw himself into the way of C'ianino ; a d did surround him with such artful fascinations , and did , moreover , so violentl* ' work upon his jealousy of her , that Cianino , having no more power of resistance , did heedlessly apply himself once too often to the gilded cameo , for the purpose of spying out her conduct . Whereupon the fiend did cast himself upon ( Jianino , tearing him limb from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
