Main text I became acquainted with Mr. A. , in a neighboring city , some considerable time ago , and formed a great liking to him . He was intelligent , frank , and lively ; in a word , essentially a social being . Just one of the class who stand on dangerous ground , though having an instinctive dislike to excess or coarse debauchery . Though then a drinking man myself , I was older than he , and had seen enough of the evils of intemperance and the deceitfulness of strong drink , to make me wish to put him on his guard ; but the opportunity never presented itself until about a year afterwards , when I was so situated that I could enforce precept with example . Mr. A. had arrived in our village , on business ; and immediately after his arrival I met him at a corner of a street . After the usual salutations , the following conversation ensued : Mr. A.  --  Is there no decent place here where we can get a drop of something to clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . B.  --  Since I saw you last I have come to think that no rum shop can be a decent place ; and , I am sorry to say , that those of our village are of almost the lowest order . Mr. A.  --  What , B ! Sworn off . No more jolly times , no more of the spirited toasts , no more sallies of wit , under the influence of the " rosy . " I am astonished at you ! B.  --  Not more so than I am at myself . I am astonished that , knowing the insinuating nature of social habits , and the dreadful effects of confirmed drunkenness , to which all social drinking tends , I did not , long ago , renounce the cursed habit of tippling . Mr. A.  --  Well , I will , of course , allow that confirmed drunkenness is bad , and brings much misery into the world ; but you pay a poor compliment to yourself , if you say you Were in danger of becoming a slave to drink , as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind enough to guard against that , and I , for one , can take a glass or let it alone . I dare say if I thought I were in danger of becoming a drunkard I should do as you have done . Besides , I must say I like a glass now and then , especially when the company is good . B.  --  Well , the ice is broken , and I will speak plainly to you . Now , or perhaps never , is your time to escape the danger . You own you like a glass , and I know you like good company , which in your estimation consists of social merry fellows , and from these likings almost entirely grow intemperance and drunkenness , among refined and sensitive natures . Apart from this easy entrance into the Domains of Bacchus , no man , with a nature such as I give you credit for , would ever find himself associating with the bully , the loafer , to use an Americanism , and the thief . Yet , such cases are altogether too common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. A.  --  Nonsense . If I were to find the habit getting the better of me , I should stop at once ; but , as I said before , I can take it or leave it alone . B.  --  I do not doubt that you can now ; but what guarantee have you that you will always be able to make this boast . You know the old saying , " Habit is second nature . " According to my observation , habit , at least the habit of drunkenness is stronger than nature , for it will make a high-souled , honorable man , the meanest thing that crawls ; it will lead him to borrow money without the least idea of paying it , and to beg for liquor , from people that formerly he would have been ashamed to be seen with . A man does not become a drunkard all at once ; there would be few were such the case . The change would appal the most abandoned . But the steady use of liquors affects the nerves and weakens the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils of intemperance in his own case , ten chances to one he has not force of will to make an effort for freedom . Alcohol , in some shape , is almost necessary to his existence . Mr. A.  --  Why B. , you talk like an oracle , but I must say , I think your new-found zeal carries you too far , and to some extent , warps your judgment . But , as I said before , I am husky , and if you will not accompany me I must take a nip alone , for I think I see the picture of a Lion with a suspiciously blue nose round the corner , and I shall test his hospitality . B.  --  Hold on , A. I do n't like to think of your drinking alone ; and , as I can not accompany you , let me introduce you to Mr. C. , an acquaintance of mine , who , I daresay , will be glad to show you the mysteries of the Blue Lion bar-room . Mr. A. looked suspiciously at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and to whom I introduced him , showed no indications of belonging to the " Upper Crust , " being unwashed , uncombed , and altogether seedy in attire . As they left , I told A. I wished to see him further , and should wait his return from the tavern . A quarter of an hour elapsed ere he made his appearance , and , when he did , he looked at me with an expression of suspicion and enquiry . Mr. A.  --  Well B. , what genius was that you introduced me to ; he do n't quite seem to belong to your order ? B.  --  No , he is or was one of your kind , one who could take a glass or leave it alone ; I thought it a good opportunity of introducing you to a lecture on temperance . Mr. A.  --  By Jove ! you did that , and I had to pay for it too . B. How was that , Mr. A ? Mr. A.  --  Because your friend C. was very glad to see a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet me again . Was sorry he could not return the treat , as he had left his purse at home , and wound up by insinuating that perhaps I could lend him 50cts. for the occasion . Would be sure to see me with his friend B. , &c.; B.  --  Ah ! C. , is a smart fellow , and I had an object in making you acquainted with him . I scarcely ever spoke to him before , but I know his history . He used to be able to take it or leave it alone , but now he always takes it and never leaves it alone , if he can get it . Besides , he is no ways scrupulous as to how he gets it . He would borrow ten cents from a blind beggar , if he could . Yet , he was once in the best circumstances , and was looked upon as the soul of honor and spirit . Mr. A.  --  My God ! what a contrast ; how did he come to his present degradation ? I should like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . He came to his present position precisely as thousands do , and began by doing as you are doing now . He was gay and social , and thought he could " take it or leave it alone ; " but as it is a sad case , I shall give you a sketch of his history . Poor C. was the only child of a widow , whose husband died shortly after their marriage . She was married again and lavished all her love and care on her only child . He grew up a handsome boy enough to make any mother proud . He got the best education , and at 24 years of age he was admitted a partner in a respectable business . For years he was apparently prosperous , and was the rage among the young ladies ; while he was the leader in all social boon companionship . He could not be said to neglect his business but his growing irregularities , for they did come , slowly but surely , were beginning to attract attention . At last he married the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , who adored her husband ! who though vexed and grieved , could not think an occasional case of drunkenness was wrong in him , no matter what it would have been in others . At last his excesses became so great that his partner got quit of him , and headlong precipitation into excess followed . His means were soon dissipated , and just as want was beginning to stare them in the face , his loving little wife sank broken-hearted into an early grave , leaving one little image of herself to the care of the doubly crazy father . Fortunately the mother 's relations took the little stranger , which the besotted father was not loth to surrender , and he went to stay with his now poor old mother , a spiritless , aimless wretch . His downward course was so rapid and so complete that he seemed to think of nothing but how to obtain drink , and under one pretence or another he has contrived to strip his aged mother of nearly all she possessed . Such is the end of the once gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it alone . How do you like the picture ? Mr A.  --  Well , I must confess , it is not very encouraging ; but then he is an exceptional case . There are not many such . B.  --  Hold there ; there are many such . Every drunkard is an instance of a man who could once take it or leave it alone , as I can shew you , if you are not yet convinced . Mr. A.  --  Well , B. , I own there is great truth in what you have said , and I am half convinced that it is safest to leave it alone ; you have introduced me to a pretty good lecture on temperance , at a cost of 50 cents . When I see you next , I shall tell you my decision .
