S H ALL eight hours of bodily labor be a day 's work ? This most important question now agitates great masses of people throughout the land . It is a vital question , and it is one which seeks intelligent treatment . In it is involved one of the greatest questions , if not the greatest , of human life : What is man 's work , and how can he best secure it ? It is safe to say that a large proportion of the " laboring classes " favor the strike of the bricklayers for the " eight-hour system , " while an equally large proportion of the non-laboring classes-so-called-look upon it with disfavor , if not with fear . If this prove anything , it is , that human judgment is a poor thing enough when it can so easily be warped by a narrow self-interest . But there is a right judgment in this matter as in all others , and it is worth our while to arrive at it . While I do not propose to go into any extended discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a few of the facts which are inwoven so closely with this as with all questions of human labor ; and I also wish to ask thoughtful people to consider with themselves this most vital of all questions-man s work . Few , I think , are aware how carefully labor is now organized , in some departments at least , in this country ; few are aware that nearly all the bricklayers of New York City belong to , and are firmly bound by , three bricklayers ' unions , which comprise on their rolls some four thousand skilled workmen . Few know , I fancy , that all over the United States these bricklayers ' unions exist , to the extent of three hundred in number ; and that their rules hind them to sustain one another as bricklayers in all parts of the Union , not to " work under any consideration when the members of said union are on a strike , ' without a special permit from said union ; " " and no member of this union , or any subordinate union , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions involving the rules of the union , or on account of prices of wages or a reduction thereof until the difficulty is arranged and the question involved settled . " The various local unions are combined into a great central international union , to which they all send delegates , and which has officers and a purse . The three unions of New York City contain some four thousand members , each of whom pays an initiation fee of $25 , and a monthly due of twenty-five cents . If injured at his work , the injured member is allowed $6 per week while disabled , and at his death his family receives $fio . So far they are benevolent institutions ; but in the event of a " strike " or other important movement , this union shall have power to levy upon its members for extraordinary purposes such tax or sum as may be at the time necessary , which tax shall not at any time exceed the sum of ten per cent . on the net earnings or wages each member may be receiving at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vast sum ; and I learn from one of the officers // that , in this great strike at New York , in addition to the $25,000 in their treasuries , they have received from other unions and contributions some $150,000 , a large portion of which has not been expended , or had not been at the end of the sixth week of the strike . To protect themselves against a damaging competition which would reduce wages , they are hound all through the country not to work with any bricklayers who do not belong to the union , and not to work with any " boss " who takes more than two apprentices . The presence of a single man in the force who is not bound like thei*selves , is the signal for laying down the trowel . The members deny that they resort to intimidation or force to prevent men from working , and say that their remedy , and the only one , against their own traitors , would be ejection from the union and refusal to work with or hold communion with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful body , and that it is intelligent , too-it knows what it wants . And what does it want It wants exactly what all mankind wants and has wanted since the beginning of time-less work and lzzg/zer*ay . Once the mason was a " born thrall ; " then he worked from sun to sun ; next he worked ten hours ; now he says he will work only eight hours , and he fixes his price . Is he not entirely justified in this ? Is he not free to demand the highest price for his labor he can possibly get ? If work be indeed a curse , is he not bound to get rid of it ? It seems to me there can be but one answer to these questions . Other trades and occupations do what they may to protect themselves from competition ; lawyers and doctors have always made it difficult to get admission into their ranks ; the newspapers absolutely forbid admission into their association ; the great railroads kill projected lines ; and so on the world over ; why , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us who are so fortunate as not to he builders of houses ? " But , " say some , " it makes houses dear and raises rents , and drives us from the city , and plays the deuce with everything . " True , it does seem to , but the bricklayers are not in fault . Who is ? It is not easy to say who is , or to say that anybody is . The bricklayers are simply doing what all the rest are doing-looking out for tkemselves , and that they are pretty likely to do ; and I should think they must win in this contest . Some honest-hearted man may here demonstrate- " Surely you do not wish this thing to succeed ; you do not wish four thousand men to knock off work at four o'clock , and then hang about , drinking at grog-shops and smoking and spitting in the streets ; you do not advocate that ? " I do not . Drinking , smoking , and spitting are three of the poorest uses a mortal man can put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three things that idle men , whether they be bricklayers , or bankers , or book-makers , are surest to go at ; and yet I do not see how the bricklayers are to escape this end . Let me state why I think the bricklayers must succeed , whether desirable or not . In the first place , the " eight-hour system " has become a political shuttlecock , and Congress has decreed that eight hours shall be a day 's work in all the Government yards and arsenals . The plasterers , who are few in number and all skilled men , some time since , succeeded in establishing it for themselves . The bricklayers are united and determined and intelligent , and are few in number , and they have money . They are suppprted by the other trades ; for the carpenters and wheelwrights know well that once establish this rule for the bricklayers , and it is sure to apply to them . And lastly , and more than all , no Amen // can boy now learns a trade , and no man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he can get him into what he thinks a higher position ; that is , into one where he does not work . Let us illustrate this . Some two years ago a man who had begun life as a carpenter , and by hard work and assiduity , and pluck and luck , had amassed a property of a million and a half , told me that an old friend who had come up as he had , came to him to consult about getting a place for his son . " What , " said Mr. C. , " do you want him to learn a trade ? " " Oh , no , no , no -- not at all ; I want to get him into a banker 's office . " Mr. C. , not being a banker , could not help him . This same Mr. C. told me that his journeymen carpenters , to whom he was paying $3 50 or $4 a day , were mostly Irishmen whom , thirty years ago , he should have set to sawing wood , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his workmen are Germans , and that it is not easy to get them . A carpenter came to do some work for my friend , in whose room were some pictures , which attracted attention . The carpenter said that his son was very fond of paintinb . " Well , " said Mr. D. , " whatever you do , I would advise you to teach him your own trade first ; then he is safe . " " Well , " said the carpenter , " I 've pretty much decided to send him to the scientific school . " I find everywhere that the law and medical schools are full , and that there are many of them ; and I believe it is safe to say that already there are at least four doctors for every patient and eight lawyers for every case . I find every laborer in the city is determined that his son shall study Latin and Greek at the common schools , having a vague belief that , in some way , therein lies the secret of being able to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without work shows itself and is becoming more and more startling and dangerous . This will be apparent to any one who examines the census of i86o , which shows in the State of New York 49,597 clerks to 11,745 masons ! And besides this is another curious fact , that , while the wages of the masons are $4 50 per day , those of the clerks do not average over $2 per day ! See , also , how the non-workers count with the masons in other departments : I 1,745 masons only in the largest State of the Union , with a population of 3,880,735 ; but there are 3,679 barkeepers , 6,127 drivers , 5,592 lawyers , and 5,235 clergym*n . The wages of the masons are double , too , that of the clergymen ; for the average pay in the Methodist Church is not over $6oo a year . It is plain that there is some most potent and wide-spread influence at work to iiiduce men to he clerks and clergymen at $2 per day , when as masons they can earn $* per day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be stated-ma ; zual labor is disrej5utable iii and indeed in all communities where oTeat citie this commuiitj ' , * s prevail . So rough and harsh a statement may seem to need qualification or explanation , for we read in men 's speeches now and then fine passages about " the dignity of labor . " It is a fine phrase-it seems to be nothing more . I have sought in vain to learn that any orator who has used this fine phrase has been desirous or even willing to have his son learn one of the manual trades . I can discover no man with any wealth at all who has taken steps to have his son engage in one of the working occupations . I can discover that nine men of ten are toiling and moiling , and planning and plotting to get money enough to secure their sons and daughters the ability to live without work of any kind ; and at least // without hand or body work . No , it is plain that no rich man educates his sons or daughters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor mea are planning to have their sons do brain work , not hand work ; to live by their wits rather than their muscular power or dexterity . Work is disreputable-is it not so ? Else would not these thousands of poor clerks gladly leave two dollars a day to get five ? Disreputable means , not in esteem , not honorable . Now , I ask , is it practicable for any bricklayer in this city of New York , or in any city known , to enter , to be one of what is called " good society ? " No matter how well-educated or well-bred he may be , the fact that he is a bricklayer does forbid his being accepted as a friend and equal by the men and women of good society . XVe must admit that any young woman of good society would shun this man ; that if she were mad enough to fall in love with , and marry him , she must do it by sacrificing her social position , and nearly all her friends and associates . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose sole and only and open business is stock gambling , find easy admission , and a ready reception to the most timid of matrimonial advances . So strange are these social distinctions , and so far do they extend , that I have never yet met in " society " a master bricklayer . It was my privilege to know a charming and accomplished woman , who , tired of carrying on the battle of life alone , at last married a gentlemanly and well-looking manufacturer , who was not in her set . But she never could get him into her set , and she was soon obliged to drop out of it herself and disappear . It is not easy to understand why stock gamblers are accepted in good society , master masons and carpenters not ; why clerks at two dollars per day are marriageable , masons at five dollars a day not ; unless that they are able to keep smooth hands and wear good clothes week days as well as Sundays . No one would claim that the clerks are more intelligent , more moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masons ; but the facts are as I state them . A stranger would say , that a girl who should gladly marry a clerk at two dollars per day rather than a mason at five dollars , simply because his hands were smoother , must be an idiot ; and yet she is not one . She merely values the outside of the cup and platter more than the inside , and society stands by her in doing so . It is more reputable to be the wife of a poor clerk than that of a rich bricklayer . In this state of things it must be admitted that American boys are not likely to learn trades ; and if they do not , it is evident that those who have the trades can make what terms they please , and work what hours they please ; and that the hours will be less and less , and the wages higher and higher . This will apply not only to the bricklayers , but must gradually and surely include all classes of skilled labor . I do not see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be as cheap hereafter as they are to-day . We are deluding ourselves with the idea that as soon as we get to specie circulation again , wages are to be one dollar and fifty cents per day instead of four dollars and fifty cents . It seems to me this is a mistake . There are but forty-two apprentices in the whole Bricklayers ' Union of New York City . As the ranks of manual labor grow less , and the ranks of brain labor grow larger , the first will compel the last to come to its prices . At this moment , I learn from a lawyer of long experience , that law , except to the few , is a very poor business ; that competition and cut-throat practices prevail to a disagreeable extent-quite enough to drive him out of the profession if he knew what other to take hold of . I am inclined to believe this // is in a considerable degree true of the other liberal professions , and that it will go on until it works a cure or brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is widespread , almost universal , few will deny . Being at Chicago last summer , I learned from a distinguished editor there , that the city was sxvarming with young men who had left their farms and crowded into the city in search of fame and fortune to he got hy easy work ; and that after a few weeks , necessity drove them into questionable , if not vicious courses , so that from them came the recruits to the ranks of vice and crime . It was but a few years ago that a leading bank in Cincinnati advertised for a " runner , " the lowest place , I believe , in the bank . More than three hundred persons applied for the place ( salary three hundred dollars a year ) , among whom were lawyers , doctors , and clergymen . I rode in St. Louis last summer with the driver of a street car , who told me he preferred to drive the car seventeen hours a day ( at two dollars ) , until his knees swelled and he could hardly sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , he could not stand it much longer ! The man did not seem to be a fool . Besides the fact that manual labor is looked upon with disesteem , comes another very curious one ; it has for a long time been considered a curse ! The good Dr. Watts made a mild effort to stem this theory by his little ditty be-ginningHow dotb tbe little busy bee , But it has had almost no influence against the first and most powerful teaching . All mankind and womankind have had this subtle notion creeping through their veins from their infancy ; and not without effect . If work he indeed a curse , what a blessed thing to be rid of it ! Indeed , are we not justified in getting it off our own hacks at any rate , even if it shall fall on the backs of others ? Such has been a very general belief and such has been the universal practice of men from the dim days of the past down to to-day . Now , I believe it can be proved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God himself that work is not a curse , but is the exact oppposite of it , the one great and gracious blessing of human nature . Man , we all agree , is the finest creation on earth of the divine mind ; the handsomest , the most sagacious , and the most capable of all created creatures . Man was fashioned for a purpose , and put into existence the master of all animals and all plants ; the conqueror who was to subdue and bend to his uses all the elements , earth , air , fire , and water ; it was simply impossible that he should do this without the use and application of every faculty of his nature . An idle man subdues nothing , masters nothing ; he is an absurdity in creation , such as to make angels laugh or grieve . Man is also the most subtle and complex of all created beings , and as we describe or analyze him , we speak of him as body and mind , or , perhaps , as body , mind , and soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ; so the perfect man is he whose body , mind , and soul work together in perfect harmony to produce a paradise on earth . Just so far as he fails to do this , he fails of the best and highest of which he is capable . The first , greatest , and universal want of man is food , and this he can not have without work ; even in wild lands he can not hunt without hard bodily work . Work , then , is the first , greatest and most universal vocation to which man mus/ apply himself ; and it must be hard work , body work-work of muscle as well as of mind . This most complex and exquisite creature called man is furnished with bones , and nerves , and muscles , and they were designed for use . Some // OCT. , four hundred of these muscles overlie his bones , and they are permeated by the finest and most delicate nerves , which carry to the muscles the message of the mind . These muscles are fed by the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying strength and courage . This good red blood is provided by the food we eat , which a wonderful stomach , full of intelligence , seizes and elaborates in a most subtle and mysterious way into that which makes blood ; which makes , also , brain , and nerve , and muscle . At this point , then , we find that a very important part of man is his muscular system , and that these four hundred most varied and capable muscles are adapted to work-indeed , are , apparently , given to man to be used . It is not plausible that all this muscle power is provided merely to lift the food to the mouth , merely to walk out to see a sight . The hand-that most wonderful member , which no other created animal has-it does not seem likely that it was so cunningly fashioned merely to wear a Parisian glove . We see , then , that the first and greatest business of man is to provide himself with food ; that the earth gives this to him as the return for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him expressly that he may use them in work . I affirm , then , that work is not a curse , but , on the contrary , is one of the greatest blessings possible to man . I affirm , too , that there is no pleasure so great as that which comes from the consciousness of work well done , well paid and well praised . No repose is equal to that which comes from a well-directed use of all the powers of man , of which the muscles are second to none . Men who do not do bodily work never are and never can be well , neither can they be content . They can not be well , because the muscles must , by action , use up the food we eat , or the system will become choked and diseased . This action of the muscles must also set in motion the great skin system , which , with its seven millions of pores , and its twenty-eight miles* of spiral vessels , should carry off , in invisible perspiration , much which the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced hack upon the lungs and other internal organs to clog and impair them . Ladies , the world over , fancy it is best to try to live without bodily work , that it is misery to perspire ; they are always sick . Scholars attempt it ; they are pale , and weak , and dyspeptic . Rich men attempt it ; they go up and down the earth in search of health , which they can never find . Mankind , as a mass , yet believe they can ignore and contemn the plainest laws of their nature , and can be made whole by some hocuspocus which a druggist will put into their stomachs . Marvellous simplicity ! Wonderful faith ! Hardly equalled by the delusions of the good old past , when men fancied they could be bewitched by the glance of the " evil eye , " or be cursed by a stone to be found in a toad 's head . It remains to be said here , once more , that health and strength are to be had only from good air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the faculties , including muscle as well as mind . And the great and good physician is he who knows how to assist the sick man to get back to these when he has once forsaken them . Nor can man be content or easy in his mind , except by a proper exercise of the body in the shape of work ; and I beg leave to suggest here that these common truths apply to both sexes , only that woman needs and should have less bodily work than man , because her great function of renewing the race engrosses // much of her powers ; still , she requires some of what man recluires more , and she can he neither strong nor content without work . We see and know that children are in incessant motion , can not be kept still , are restless , and too often are severely reproached for it . Poor things I they are doing what the great Architect intended , and unwise parents do not know it . At this time of life every muscle is growing , developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat well ( not trashily ) , and then by motion , exercise , play , to apply this food to the building up of strong and perfect bodies . When this body has got to its full stature , it requires less motion or exercise , but then its business is to apply this motion to work , to steady and productive uses , which is not the duty of childhood . But many persons are born rich , or they choose pursuits which seem to impose no bodily labor . Those who are idle are always unhappy ; it must be so , because to every muscle goes a subtle nerve , which says , incessantly , " Why do you not work ? Why do you not work ? Why do you not work ? " It is simply God 's way of whispering to us that we are not obedient to his designs . How do we respond to this-by obedience ? It has been my lot to know , perhaps , one man or woman of a thousand who did any systematic labor which was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as a matter of principle , did two hours of bodily work daily . I have known one lawyer , preacher or scholar in a hundred only who gave his body a fair chance ; and I have known most of them to become poor creatures enough by the time they were fifty , while many were sleeping under green bed-clothes before they were forty . And yet we sometimes reproach the Creator for these untimely deaths . How do we solace our own unhappinesses ? what fatal attempts do we make to alleviate our idleness and unrest ? We seek excitements . If we are women , we crave a ball , or we spend ourselves upon dress , or we plunge into flirtation . If we are men , we seek relief in tobacco , or in wine , or in gambling . Here comes in that vast consumption of narcotics and stimulants , all of which deaden the nervous sensibility and make idleness endurable . The English only have produced a class of idle men who find a substitute for work in chasing lions in Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon the first puddle of the Nile is to be found , or in baffling about among the icebergs of Greenland to find a pole which does not exist . The wonderful energy and talent wasted upon these things could have been had nowhere except in a country where there was great vigor combined with great leisure ; vigor not consumed by tobacco or wine or stock-broking . It would be quite impossible for any nation to sustain a class of idle men or women without the free use of narcotics and stimulants . It is only by their use that these manage to exist ; and the great increase in their use is mainly due to the accumulation of wealth in the hands of some , which enables them to live idle lives . Just what time should be spent in bodily work , or in exercise to take its place , has never been carefully decided . It has been estimated that , if the whole adult population of any land spent four hours per day in productive labor , the whole would be rich . As it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive pursuits , and this portion must produce enough for themselves and the other half . To show that this is not an extravagant statement , let me say that , in the State of New York ( i86* ) , in a population of 3,827,818 , there was a total of but 459,676 persons engaged as food-producers ; and this includes all // OCT. , laborers , of whatever pursuit , because the farm laborers were not separated from the rest . But it must be said , however , that there are other occupations not included among the food-producers which are as productive as they . Whatever the proportion may be , it is clear that a large share of all highly-civilized people are non-producers , and many are absolutely idle , which is their misfortune . I think we may conclude that from two to four hours per day is a fair allowance of time for bodily exercise or work for persons in good health , and that , without some such consideration for the body , it can not enjoy health . Scholars and men engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , not being able to know it , they live but short and spasmodic lives , and do not secure a /wa/t/iy ac/lox of file braiu while they do live . Let us ask-in what rank is to be found most restlessness , discontent , unhappiness , of this or of any country ? The obvious answer must be , in the wellto-do , the upper classes , as they are called . It must be so because they have no work , and they have not been able to discover the urgent necessity of it . So palpable is this that I think few will deny the next position , which is-that just so far as men and women are living a life which requires an active exercise of body , mind and soul , just so far are they content , if not happy . I never have heard of but one man in this latter world who seemed to be perfectly healthy ; and he asserted that he exjoyed everything-earth , air , sea and sky , /zimse*f of course , and his fellow-creatures , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive of it that you are one in a town of a thousand people , each of whom is perfectly strong and healthy , and is engaged in a good occupation . Would not that be a kind of paradise ? Has not God intended it to be possible to man ? For myself , I know that a bad stomach is the cause of ; not all , but every kind of wickedness under the sun ; that out of it come strifes and envyings , malice , and all uncharitableness . Nine-tenths of the " badness " of children proceeds solely from this , and they are not responsible for it , while their parents are . But it will be asserted by those who believe in idleness , that they , the idle , are as well and live as long as those who work . I am not prepared to deny it , nor do I admit it . While I believe in work-bodily work-it is evident that there is such a thing as overwork , drudgery , exhaustion . So that one-half of mankind , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mind and soul are dwarfed or deadened . Work , when it is to this excess , is not a pleasure , as it should be , but a pain and a misfortune . And out of this , I fancy , has come some portion of the hatred of work which vitiates the human mind and injures the human body . Now , I ask all judicious people if eight hours a day of manual labor is not as much as man or woman is capable of ; without too much exhaustion to be able to enjoy any of the occupations and pleasures of mind and soul ? There is nothing charming about the over-worked drudgeman or woman-whose labors for the day being ended , can do nothing but eat and sleep ; who can not make himself clean and lovely , and then enjoy the converse of a book , the sweet sounds of music , or the sweeter gossip of children . Work well doize , well taId well traIscc4 I claim to be the greatest charm of existence . A slovenly workman can neither enjoy his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will get no pleasure out of it . But work well done , whether in laying brick , in designing houses , in growing wheat , in making newspapers , will secure satisfaction , for one may feel that he has lived to some good // purpose . Now , if a man can be sure that he has done and is doing his besithat which he is fittest to do , and is doing it in his best way-that is the great end of human life , and it will secure content . But a man must also be well paid and well praised that is , he must know , by the praise of others , that his own judgment of his work is correct ; and he must be paid his fair share of the joint earnings of men , so that he can secure his fair share of this world 's goods and pleasures . It is an uncomfortable fact that we do praise grudgingly , and the critical faculty is one that loves to indulge in crucifixion . It is an egregious blunder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beware of the critic who sees only spots on the sun ; he is certainly a failure himself . A good , generous reception of other men s work marks the good , generous , able man . The man who is rich can afford to give . And the man who is not envious can afford to praise ; he never detracts , he takes no pleasure in it . But bow can work be well paid , even if well done , in such a condition of human society as now exists The old theory of society was the patriarchal , paternal , kingly , despotic ; and it came to pass that the great king not only owned all the lands , but all the people . According to this theory , the people must do all for the king , and the king must do what he pleased for the people . The feudal system broke up that system into smaller ones , in which the people gained much ; because the lord came into direct contact with his people and cordd not wholly avoid his duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the tenant owed service to the lord , the lord also owed protection and sustenance to the tenant . Property , then , had duties as well as rights , and men 's duties involved with them some rights . Modern society plants itself upon " The Rights of Man ; " the duties of man have little to do with it . Individualism-every man for himself-that is what we stand for . Every man owns himself ; of course , and is entitled to have and to use as he pleases all he can get . Whoever is strong enough , or cunning enough , or lucky enough to get and to keep , gets and keeps , or gets and spends all he can . He recognizes no claims upon him from any other person . The ties of good-fellowship , of friendship , of blood , of family , are looser than ever before . In the clan , the clan feeling was supreme , and the most insignificant member of it was to his own people more valuable than the highest member of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if need be , and in the distribution of the spoil he had his share . While there was any food left , he was not let to starve . The glory of his chief was his glory , and the tail of Macallum More wagged when the head wagged . Is it so now ? Is it true that the firemen on the Central Railroad wag their heads when Vanderbilt wags his ? Does a big dividend help Ikem ? Is it true that Mr. Stewart 's clerks are glorified when their chief is crowned with golden bays ? Are the wool-pickers in the Bay State mills happy when the president makes a glowing report ? I take it , the answer is No . And it is significant of much . It means that feudalism , with its evils and its goods , has passed away , and society bases itself upon individualisin ; that is , the full and perfect liberty to every individual man and woman above the age of twenty-one to do just as he or she will  --  to go his own way-to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to live by his wits or by his work , to be a president or a beggar , as he will or can . This social state has been coined into a phrase with variations . It is " Every man for himself ; and God for us all ; " or , " Every man for himself ; and the devil take the hindmost ; " or , // OCT. , " Every man for himself ; and the strongest fend off . " So widespread is this failing that many , perhaps most families , do not recognize any claim of one member upon the rest . A weak or erring brother or sister is not to he sustained , or supported , or encouraged by those who are strong , as a matter of course ; and outside of one 's own family no one admits that there is any shadow of claim . The strong and the able get and keep , the weak and timid go to the wall . Competition is the main impulse of trade , and the struggle is constant , untiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rich menrailway kings and millionaires . It also leaves a vast residuum of men and women who , after a few weak struggles , settle into holes and corners , and live on through life with no hopes , with no ambitions , with no clan to be proud of ; with no chieftain , who , like an earthly providence , is to succor and support their children when death wafts their natural protectors away . Even the clergy are not secure , for , so far as I know , no church pays more than a hare subsistence , and only in the Methodist Church is a fund provided for the disabled , or for the families of the dead ; and this fund is a mere pittance . " Strikes , " it seems to me , are a harsh remedy for a great evil ; hut I believe if I were one of the cler*y I should set myself to work to organize a great and universal strike for higher wages , and , like the police of New York , I should work hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children should not he absolute paupers . Or else , I should organize a " Total Abstinence from Marriage Society " at once . Either of these two things any respectable clergyman will be justified in doing . This excessive individualism is now showing itself in a marked and total change of the social feeling from what existed in the " good old times . " The cares and anxieties of the individual to secure himself and his posterity , first , against want , and second , in luxury and idleness , are eating up the sentiment of brotherhood or community , and stifling all social sympathy . Why is it that everywhere we hear complaints that there is no society ? that nobody seems to care for any one but themselves ? that a kind of mutual sympathy and helpfulness which existed not half a century ago is hardly to be met with now ? It is not that we hate our fellow men , I believe , but , engrossed as we are with our own schemes and struggles , we have , no time or thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to row our own boats , sometimes heavily laden , up the stream toward the golden sands ; and we see others wrecked and stranded , and hear their despairing cries ; but we can not stop , nor can we drag them along . So we think . It is no place here , at the end of an article , to essay an examination of these two great social systems , known as Feudalism and Individualism ; but the examination must be entered upon , and we must try to see our way out of our present maze , or we may pronounce modern civilization , and even Christianity itself-so far as this world goes  --  a failure . That we shall be loth to do , and shall rather attempt at some future time to pierce the darkness . Here , for the present , let us leave it , and turn for a moment to the text with which we began . How then can work be well paid if well done ? The bricklayers say that it is to be secured only by the combination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Society as a whole , the government , makes no attempt to protect any one except in his individual liberty , and political economy scouts at the man who should advocate it . The bricklayers  --  and other trades also-band themselves together to secure high // prices for their work , and to prevent , as far as possible , injurious competition . It seems that this course is a legitimate and inevitable product of modern society , and must be accepted as such ; that there is no power but themselves to say what they shall do , and that standing alone each man would be weak and powerless to control prices or to check competition . United and acting in concert , they can make their muscle and skill tell , and can demand a fair or an unfair share of the joint productions of the world . A fair share is what all men ought to have , but an unfair share is what all ( except a few regenerate souls ) seek to get . There seems no reason why a man or woman born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth ; why one whose hands are not strong should have all snatched away from him by those whose hands are strong ; but that is modern society ; and it is not honorable or Christian . We seem to accept it , however , as God 's law , and many say , " Oh , he gets all he is worth ; he is weak , and can not earn much , " and so is left to die a pauper . Does not this savor of cruelty ? It is wretched enough to be born weak , or to grow up useless , but it does not soothe the wretchedness to be told " that is what you deserve . " The bricklayers , then , having formed themselves into a guild , are asserting their demands for less work and more pay in their own way . Let me call their attention to one or two facts in the history of the old guilds of the middle ages , when , as we fancy , men were not so wise as now . What did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in England they had officers , " whose duty it was to exercise authority over all persons professing the business to which they belonged ; who were to see that no person undertook to supply articles which he had not been educated to manufacture ; who were to determine the prices at which such articles ought justly to be sold ; above all , who were to take care that the common people really bought at shops and stalls what they supposed themselves to be buying ; that cloth put up for sale was true cloth , of true texture , and full weight ; that leather was sound and well tanned ; wine pure , measures honest ; flour unmixed with devil 's dust , " * etc. , etc . Above all , you will observe , that the workmen of the guild were to do fair and honest work , and that the buyers were not cheated with dishonest goods . Now do the bricklayers or any other of our guilds propose such an object as this ? I fear not . I fear that they only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little work as possible . And then do they propose to themselves to be idle as much of their time as possible ? These benighted old middle ages had glimmerings of better than that . Listen again- " Every child , so far as possible , was to be trained up in some business or calling , idleness being the mother of all sin . ' The children of those who could afford the small entrance fees were apprenticed to trades , the rest were apprenticed to agriculture ; and if children were found growing up idle , and their fathers and mothers failed to prove that they could secure them an ultimate maintenance , the mayors in the towns and the magistrates in the country had authority to take possession of such children and apprentice them as they saw fit , that when they grew up they might not be driven , ' by want or incapacity , to dishonest courses . ' " By act of Parliament of 1536- " If a man was out of employment , preferring to be idle , he might be demanded for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and compelled to work whether he would or no ; ' and more , sturdy beggars // might , if caught at it the third time , be put to death . " Such a hatred had these old medi*valists of idleness ! They held that a man had better be dead than be a strong professional beggar . And such I take it is the view of all men , though most might hesitate about shooting him . About to close , it seems proper to make a personal application , as is the fashion elsewhere . Briefly , then-man 's work is to do something in this world for the good of his fellow men . Idleness is a curse , and work is a blessing . Idleness produces misery ; work is the parent of content . The bricklayers should not strike for fewer hours because they desire idleness , but rather that they may have time to develop and enjoy mind and soul . Competition must be supplanted by cooperation , or human society must go into ruin . Such , in short , are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , as to the question of man 's work .
